Dear Readers,
Have you ever heard of the book “The Imperative of Responsibility”? It was written by Hans
Jonas and was the best-selling philosophy book of the 1980s. Its main message is as topical
today as it was then: “Act so that the effects of your action are compatible with the permanence
of genuine human life on earth.” Simply put: Those who act according to the motto “after me
the deluge” increase the probability of deluge. Instead, we must act in a way that we can justify
to our children and grandchildren. This is exactly what we are doing at Daimler.
It is no accident that no other vehicle manufacturer can look back on a tradition as long as ours.
This also has to do with the fact that we take responsibility – for the economy and the ecology,
for employees and society. We are not writing this because it reads well in the editorial of a
sustainability report, but because the “Responsibility Principle” is a guiding principle in our
business activities.
Take our products: Of our total investments of around €5.7 billion, in research and development last year, almost half went into “green” technologies. With the B-Class Electric Drive and
the Denza – the first electric car to be fully developed in China for China – we have brought two
more E-vehicles onto the road.
For us, PLUG-IN hybrids are a key technology in the transition to fully electric driving: By
2017, we will have brought ten PLUG-IN models onto the market – one new vehicle every four
months, on average. For us, responsible action also means that we must work to make road
traffic even safer. Ninety percent of traffic accidents are caused by human error. It is clear:
Every accident is one too many. We also see great potential in autonomous driving. In 2013, we
presented the prototype of an autonomous S-Class, followed by the first autonomous truck last
year: our Future Truck.
The “Responsibility Principle” also guides us in our relationships with our employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, neighbors, and NGOs. Our guidepost in the last fifteen years has
been the UN Global Compact – which addresses environmental protection and the protection of
human and employee rights as well as the fight against corruption. We are convinced that only
those who act ethically are also economically successful. This is what we are striving for and
what we want to continue to discuss with you, dear readers, in the future as well. Let us take
responsibility together!
Best regards,

Dr. Dieter Zetsche

Hybrid vehicles

he C 350 e is a true wonder of efficiency. It boasts 205 kW
of output but only needs 2.1 liters of fuel to travel 100 kilometers. This corresponds to CO2 emissions of 48 grams
per kilometer. Despite all this efficiency, the comfortable sedan
is as lively as a sports car: In its Sport Plus mode, the vehicle
accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 5.9 seconds. A premium
sedan that’s as dynamic as a sports car and as environmentally
friendly as a compact — how can that be?

T

We asked someone who should know the answer: Uwe Keller,
who has a Ph.D. in engineering and is also the Project Lead for
the centerpiece of the C 350 e: the hybrid powertrain. “Ulti–
mately, the secret lies in perfect interaction,” says Keller. “We
matched all of the systems, parts, and components down to the
last detail in order to ensure that the combustion engine, the
transmission, and the electric drive work together perfectly. In
combination with our intelligent drive system management concept, this results in a high level of efficiency and
outstanding handling.”
Efficiency is also the main objective of the project team led by
Keller. However, the powertrain developers don’t work alone to
achieve this goal, as approximately 200 employees at MercedesBenz in Sindelfingen are directly or indirectly involved in the
hybrid powertrain project. These include experts for control
devices, electrical functions, electronic systems, and batteries,
as well as the individuals responsible for the various model
series. “Every unit or department works with the others to make
a contribution to the overall result; success is always the success
of many,” Keller explains.
Perfect interaction isn’t required from the technical systems
alone, nor is the complexity limited to the technological aspects.
After all, what the hybrid powertrain team does is to bring to-

10

Uwe Keller, 46, is the Project Lead for hybrid
powertrains. Keller, who has a Ph.D. in control
systems engineering, has been working at Daimler
for 15 years. After focusing on gasoline engines
and transmissions, he began working on hybrid
drives around five years ago — and it fascinates
him to see how this field brings together different
technologies and components, as well as different
people and their expertise.

gether two worlds that each have their own laws: the worlds
of combustion engines and electric drive systems. “If greater
efficiency is to be achieved in such a system, everyone must be
aware of the fact that a change to even the tiniest detail will
impact the entire system,” says Keller. “Getting this type of
systemic thinking embedded in people’s minds was one of the
biggest challenges we faced.”

The most efficient powertrain
As regards the powertrain, the main goal was — and still is — to
achieve the highest degree of efficiency. That’s because there’s
always a certain amount of loss whenever energy is transferred
to the wheels via the transmission, regardless of whether the
energy comes from a fuel tank or a battery. This is due to towing
and friction effects, for example. The developers lower the losses
with the help of sophisticated micromechanical measures. “The
good thing is that everything we achieve in terms of powertrain
efficiency has double the impact in hybrids — when they are
driving and when they recover energy,” Keller says. Individual

Hybrid vehicles

efficiency gains often amount to just a few percent, but when
taken together they have a major effect on the system. “For
example, we achieved CO2 emissions of 109 grams per kilometer
with the E-Class BlueTEC Hybrid in 2012,” he adds. “Today, we’re
down to 99 grams — just through optimization measures alone.”
This is also not the first success the powertrain specialists have
been able to celebrate. Indeed, Daimler has launched a whole
range of hybrid models on the market since 2009, and the
drive system technology has been improved with each vehicle
launched. New records for fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions
have been achieved nearly every time. With CO2 emissions of
94.99 and 115 grams per kilometer, respectively, the diesel
hybrids from the C-Class and S-Class series were recently rated
at the top of their segments in benchmark studies. This is mainly
due to an advantage that competing brands have been unable
to match to date: “We have the most efficient powertrains in all
model series,” Keller explains.
Which brings us to an exceptional aspect of the Daimler approach here: The Group is not seeking to serve just one segment
with its hybrid concepts. That’s why Daimler doesn’t build
“special-purpose design” vehicles but instead utilizes a modular
concept. The basis consists of customized powertrains that can
be combined with different engines and used in all model series.
Such a powertrain also includes a special hybrid transmission
with an integrated electric motor. The combustion engine is
linked to the transmission in a manner that allows it to be completely disconnected when it is not needed, in which case it stops
running. Such a setup makes it possible to combine different
types of engines and transmissions, including everything from
front- and rear-wheel drives for cars to all-wheel drive systems
for SUVs. The result is a broad range of variants and a high
degree of flexibility. This, in turn, enables Daimler to respond
more effectively to customer requirements and offer a more
extensive range of products.

2.1 liters per 100 km — in the real world as well?
The Group therefore has good reason to believe plug-in hybrids
will be successful on the market. Regardless of the variant in
question, the combination of a high level of dynamic handling
and low fuel consumption is an attractive feature for many customers. Nevertheless, can consumption values such as those
measured on a test rig with the C 350 e actually be achieved in
practice? After all, it’s no secret that real-world fuel consumption
is generally higher than official consumption figures.
Still, Keller says, “Our 2.1 liters can definitely be achieved — and
consumption can even be lower than that. For example, I drive to
the office in the all-electric mode with a fully charged battery —
that’s 13 kilometers. I then drive home in the evening on a full
charge and with zero emissions. In other words, I don’t use any
fuel whatsoever for my commute. When I take other trips where
I need the combustion engine, my fuel consumption is pretty
much exactly the same as the NEDC value without the electric
drive.”

How official fuel consumption is calculated in the EU
The main purpose of standardized testing procedures is to provide fuel consumption figures that enable different vehicles to
be compared. Although the stipulated driving cycles are derived
from real-life driving profiles, they are ultimately nothing more
than a convention, so actual consumption usually deviates from
the official figures.
The New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) defines the conditions and speed sequences under which a vehicle with a combustion engine is to be operated on a test rig in order to measure fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, as well as other
parameters.
Consumption data for hybrid vehicles in the EU is obtained in
accordance with the ECE R 101 regulation, whereby consumption is first measured with a discharged battery — in other words,
without the electric motor operating. A “bonus” for the given
electric range is then subtracted from the measured consumption value.
In the case of the C 350 e, the calculation is as follows: The
vehicle can travel 31 kilometers in the all-electric mode. For this,
it receives a bonus of 55 percent on the official consumption
value (without any additional external energy). The consumption
figure for a four-cylinder hybrid in this performance class is
4.6 liters per 100 kilometers, which corresponds to 107 grams
of CO2 per kilometer. If one then subtracts 55 percent, the
result is 48 grams of CO2 per kilometer, or 2.1 liters of fuel per
100 kilometers.
This calculation method takes into account the special characteristics of plug-in vehicles that operate with both electric
motors and combustion engines. Purely electric vehicles, on the
other hand, are always expressed as emitting 0 grams of CO2
per kilometer.

It can thus be concluded that actual fuel consumption is variable
and depends in large part on the use profile — and even more
on the way the driver operates the vehicle. That’s why MercedesBenz developers implemented innovative operating strategies
and driving programs streamlined for efficiency in the C 350 e.
These features make the vehicle even more efficient in real driving situations.

Hybrid offensive for lower CO2 emissions

Efficiency through intelligence
Like the S 500 PLUG-IN HYBRID, the C 350 e was imbued with a
lot of intelligence by Mercedes-Benz engineers. A sophisticated
drive system management concept ensures that the efficiency
benefits from the powertrain are fully exploited. In addition, intelligent strategies enable maximum driving efficiency. “A predictive and route-based operating strategy, a haptic gas pedal with
radar-controlled energy recovery, and a radar-based shifting
strategy — our people developed solutions that are truly unique,”
says Keller proudly.
The predictive operating strategy Keller referred to uses information on road topography from the navigation system to optimize
the battery-charge state. For example, if a hybrid is approaching
a long downhill gradient where braking energy can be recovered,
the operating strategy will take energy from the battery in
advance in order to lower fuel consumption and will then fully
recharge the battery on the subsequent downhill stretch. Daimler
has been using this operating strategy in selected hybrid vehicles
since 2013.
The route-based operating strategy is a C 350 e specialty. This
strategy also uses data from the navigation system, but the
goal here is to ensure the most efficient use of the combustion
engine, the electric motor, and the battery along a given route.
For example, a trip from Hamburg to Munich begins with allelectric driving in the city. Once the vehicle gets on the highway,
the combustion engine takes over. The traction battery is then
charged as needed during the rest of the trip, thereby ensuring
that the vehicle can be driven completely emission-free once
again when it arrives in Munich.
The haptic gas pedal emits a double impulse to indicate to drivers
when they should remove their foot from the accelerator. This
occurs, for example, if the radar system in the C 350 e determines that the car is approaching a slower-moving vehicle on the
highway. If the driver releases the gas pedal, the system switches
off the combustion engine and the car begins to virtually “sail.”
However, if the vehicle is still moving too fast, the system will
turn on the electric motor to brake the car — and recover energy
during braking.

12

The system ensures that the new plug-in hybrids drive not only
economically and in an environmentally friendly manner but also
very smoothly, as these are important preconditions for the market success Daimler is seeking to achieve. Plans call for a significant increase in the share of the new-car fleet accounted for by
highly efficient drive systems and model series over the next few
years. Between now and 2017 alone, the Group plans to launch
ten new plug-in hybrid models on the market. The S-Class and
C-Class models are to be followed by the production launch of
a new Mercedes-Benz plug-in hybrid around once every four
months — everything from an E-Class to SUVs. Daimler expects
to be producing hundreds of thousands of hybrids by the end
of the decade.
So, what’s the purpose of this ambitious offensive? We asked
Thomas Weber, Member of the Daimler AG Board of Management
and responsible for Group Research & Mercedes-Benz Cars
Development, explains. “Given the CO2 limits that will go into
effect in the EU in 2020, we will need to achieve a fleet value of
roughly 100 grams per kilometer. For a premium manufacturer,
simply building small cars with low engine displacement is not
a viable option. That’s why we will focus on the most efficient
technology and bring about a breakthrough for plug-in hybrids.”

»Formula 1 drivers Lewis Hamilton and
Nico Rosberg know that it’s all about
using energy intelligently rather than
simply hitting the gas.«
Thomas Weber

The best of both worlds
In practice, however, the most efficient technology can only lead
to low CO2 emissions if drivers exploit the associated potential.
An economical and predictive driving style is still not necessarily
considered “cool,” but Weber believes that could change. “Two
of our most famous employees have demonstrated that you can
drive fast and economically in a hybrid. I’m referring here to Nico
Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton. These two Formula 1 drivers know

Successful transfer:
Mercedes-Benz series and Formula 1
development teams learn from one
another in many ways. In the area
of hybrids, the two sides especially
support each other’s efforts to
further increase efficiency.

Built-in intelligence
The operating strategy for the C 350 e is designed to ensure a type of interaction between the electric motor and combustion engine that’s perfectly aligned with the situation at hand and also optimizes fuel efficiency. The system takes into
account the battery-charge state, the traffic situation, and the route topography. However, the interaction between the two
drive systems can also be regulated manually.

that it’s all about using energy intelligently rather than simply
hitting the gas” he says.
Race car drivers as a role model for a clever urban driving style?
That would certainly be something new. What’s not new, but
still not very well known, is that series development experts and
Formula 1 specialists at Mercedes-Benz learn and benefit from
one another in many ways. Their approach is based on the idea
of bringing together the best of both worlds. In the past, it was
mainly the series developers who benefited from the achievements of their Formula 1 colleagues in terms of enhanced lubricants, materials, fuels, and micro surface-finishing and coating
techniques. For example, the friction-reducing coating with
extremely hard diamond-like carbon (DLC) developed for motor
sports is also used in production engines.
Today, however, there is a mutual exchange of knowledge in
many areas, which has led to improvements to both Formula 1
and production vehicles. This especially applies to hybrid technologies, aerodynamics, suspensions, and friction-reduction
techniques for powertrains. In the area of hybrids, the two sides
especially support each other’s efforts to further increase efficiency. Both sides contribute their specific expertise to the development of components such as electric motors, batteries, and
control systems.

Ambitious goals
But back to Uwe Keller and his team: The powertrain developers
in Sindelfingen will keep grinding away when Daimler launches
one new hybrid after another over the next few years. They plan
to make future hybrid drives even more effective and efficient.
They also want to help make hybrid vehicles more attractive to
customers. To this end, they will work even more closely with
colleagues from battery development units, for example. That’s
because the next development step will focus mainly on extending the electric range for hybrids and making the charging
process more convenient. For example, Daimler will soon begin
testing inductive charging systems in which electrical energy
is transferred wirelessly. Daimler engineers are also working
hard to get more battery capacity out of the same volume.
If all of these things can be accomplished, plug-in hybrids from
Mercedes-Benz might become just as common in the not-toodistant future as diesel and gasoline models are today.

China

Mr. Troska, you’ve been the Board of Management member
responsible for Greater China since the end of 2012, and
you live most of the year in China. In this context, what has
impressed you most during the past two years?
Hubertus Troska: The close cooperation with our long-standing
Chinese partners, the unbelievable dynamism and diversity of the
business environment here, and especially our employees. They
are models of diligence, openness, friendliness, a commitment
to success, and dedication and enthusiasm for the world’s most
valuable automotive brand. Even an old hand at international
assignments like me is inspired by that.
2014 was a very successful year for Daimler in China. At the
same time, experts are warning that there may be a slowdown of economic growth. To what extent will this affect the
automotive industry? Is the end of the “gold rush” mood
already in sight?
Troska: Today China is the world’s biggest market for vehicles,
and I believe it will always occupy that position. Even if its economic growth slows down and its gross domestic product only
grows by about seven percent in the medium term, that would
still be impressive. Increasing urbanization, relatively low vehicle
density, and a steadily growing middle class are also continuing to
offer great potential for the constant and sustainable growth of
the automotive market. That’s especially true of premium vehicles.
We are really doing well here. With over 280,000 Mercedes-Benz
cars sold last year — an increase of almost 30 percent — we grew
much more than our competitors and the market as a whole. We

significantly expanded our dealer network and substantially
improved our service quality. We opened a training center in
Shanghai for our car sales staff and our service employees — it’s
the biggest center of its kind in the world. Our vehicles are very
popular in the market, largely because our portfolio includes
products that are specifically tailored to the Chinese market. One
example of that is the long-wheelbase C-Class, which we produce
exclusively in and for China. As a result, we are consistently
expanding our local production. The first compact SUV of the
GLA-Class will roll off the assembly line this spring. It will be followed by other compact models. Only last fall, we concluded an
investment agreement with our partner amounting to about €1
billion for this purpose. At around the same time, we also opened
a new research and development center in Beijing. This is a further key element of our strategy for sustainable growth in China.
It will enable us to give our Chinese customers a voice in our
global network and even greater weight in future product developments.
As you can see, we are well positioned and we are looking very
optimistically at the future. In 2015 we want to once again
increase our sales by a double-digit percentage and deliver well
over 300,000 vehicles to our Chinese customers.
That sounds very positive. Within the context of your economic success, how significant is integrity for you and your
activities in China?
Troska: Integrity is of key importance to us. According to an
ancient Chinese saying, “A business will not prosper without

»A business will

integrity.” At Daimler, we are convinced that trust is the most
important currency and that a good reputation is the best asset
of a company that aims to operate in an upright and sustainable
way. That’s why we made integrity a key element of our corporate
strategy years ago, whether we are doing business in Europe,
the U.S. or here in China. The basic principle is the same: Legal
and ethical standards must be respected wherever we operate.
And that also applies to our suppliers and business partners.
How sustainable are your business operations in China?
Troska: They are very sustainable. Our car production in Beijing
is a good example. The Beijing Benz plant is state-of-the-art, and
it fulfills the most stringent standards for environmentally friendly production. Another example is the products we offer here
in the Chinese market. In addition to offering the smart electric
drive and Mercedes-Benz hybrid vehicles, we founded the joint
venture BYD Daimler New Technology Co., Ltd. together with our
partner BYD in Shenzhen in 2010. Here we have jointly produced
the DENZA, an electric vehicle that is specially developed and
produced in and for China, since August 2014. The DENZA not
only has a remarkable range of up to 300 kilometers but also
stands out as the safest electric vehicle in the Chinese market.
That was confirmed a few months ago by the Chinese authority
for vehicle safety. That’s yet more proof of the pioneering role
we are playing with the DENZA.
Electromobility is strongly supported by the government
in China, but sales are still low. What do you think is the
reason for that?
Troska: Electromobility is still a challenging market all over
the world. In many cases, the specific challenges are identical.
It’s all about technology and range, charging facilities and infrastructure, functionality and costs. In my opinion, the Chinese
government is very aggressively addressing these issues. That’s
because it has realized that mobility can cause problems, especially in big cities — and China has more big cities than any other
country. Electromobility offers a very good approach to a solution
here, and that’s why it is being strongly promoted. For example,
our DENZA customers in Shanghai receive subsidies of about
€15,000 as well as free license plates. As you know, free license
plates are not offered as a matter of course in China.
In short, I think China has the potential and the will to become
the world’s biggest market for electric vehicles. And with our
DENZA we’ve established ourselves in exactly the right position.
After all, it’s the only vehicle from a European OEM that is fully
entitled to receive these subsidies.
Can you tell me something about your compliance management system?
Troska: The compliance management system we are implementing makes sure the six basic compliance elements are introduced in all the companies in which we have an interest and that
they are further developed there. In other words, there has to
be a compliance function in every Chinese company in which we
own a stake. We continually analyze and evaluate compliance
risks, and we have defined binding codes of conduct. Finally, we
have established a whistleblower system for reporting suspected
compliance violations in each of these companies, and we provide regular training courses on compliance-related issues for
the employees there.

China

Mr. Troska, the issue of human rights in China is politically
controversial and widely discussed. In your experience,
how is this issue being dealt with at our locations in China?
Troska: Let me say this much: Daimler was one of the first
signatories of the UN Global Compact. That’s not a coincidence,
because this document expresses our own convictions. We consider human rights our top priority. As a company, we consider
employee rights and fair working conditions indispensable. We
are vehemently opposed to every form of discrimination, forced
labor, and child labor. And that holds true for every country in
which we operate.
Let’s talk about corporate social responsibility. How do you
live up to this claim in China?
Troska: In the early 1980s we were a founding member of the
China Charity Foundation. Since then we have established a
comprehensive CSR system in China that focuses on areas such
as education, mobility, art and culture, as well as environmental
protection.
In the area of education in particular, we have created some very
successful programs under the umbrella of the “Star Fund.”
These include the traffic initiative “MobileKids” and the “Happy
Music Classroom.” Ever since our music program was established, we have enabled more than 160,000 financially disadvantaged children to receive music instruction. This year we have
mainly experimented with percussion classes — to the delight
of some parents (laughs). We are also supporting education for
older students. For example, we have been offering a scholarship program for students at the renowned Beijing University for
20 years now.
We are also the first automaker ever to promote six UNESCO
Natural Heritage Sites in China. And we’re also quick to help
when a natural disaster strikes. For example, in 2014 we joined
up with our dealers to donate 20 million RMB (about €3 million)
within only 24 hours for the victims of the earthquake in Ya’An
in southwestern China.
These are only a few examples of our involvement in China, but
they make it very clear that we want to grow not only in this wonderful country but also with it.
Mr. Troska, thank you for this interview!

Attractiveness put to test
heir jobs may be very different, but that’s exactly why a
worker at the plant in Fuzhou, China, a consultant at
Daimler Financial Services in Mexico City, and an engineer
at the research center in Sindelfingen all have one thing in common: Daimler is interested in hearing their opinions when the
company defines targets in one of the key areas of sustainability
— its attractiveness as an employer. Periodic global surveys
ensure that the Group can collect a wide range of opinions from
employees in all different fields. “The survey results are the staring point of our work,” says Eckhard Kreßel, Head of Human
Resources and Labor Policy at Daimler AG. Managers need to
analyze critical factors together with their staff and then jointly
develop ideas for improvements. In this sense, a survey can
serve as an engine for development and change. Employees
seem to take the same view, as survey participation rates are
high. For example, 70 percent of the company’s workforce took
part in the most recent Group-wide full census survey in 2014.

T

Strong identification
One of the survey’s key indicators is the Employee Commitment
Index (ECI). The ECI gauges employee identification with Daimler
on the basis of parameters such as satisfaction and loyalty —
but also with regard to employee opinions on the company’s

points were received by Daimler in
the 2014 ECI — which means the
Group is now two points above the
average for companies around the
world.

“The opinions of our employees are
indispensable — not just for helping us
show better appreciation for their efforts
but also for improving our performance.”

competitiveness and the level of motivation they themselves
experience. Daimler’s global ECI score of 63 points in 2014 was
more or less the same as in the last Group-wide survey in 2011. In
terms of a comparison with other companies, Daimler remains
above the current worldwide average of 61 points.
There are differences between organizational units, however.
Whereas the results among managers and administrative personnel improved, the mood among production workers and employees in production-related units debased in some cases. “It’s
important to establish a dialog here in order to obtain more
detailed information on the criticisms and opinions that led to the
results,” says Kirsten Andres, an organizational development specialist who supports the post-survey follow-up process at Daimler
Trucks. Getting staff involved in the process presents an organizational challenge in assembly units that often employ more than
1,000 shift workers. Nevertheless, there are some good examples of how this challenge can be overcome. For instance, one
production unit used the regular group meetings that take place
on the assembly line to conduct an analysis of the results of its
2012 survey. Prior to the first meeting, the unit’s management
team extensively analyzed critical feedback, which they used to
formulate appropriate questions. This multi-stage dialog between
management and staff led to measures to improve the quality of
information provided to employees and promote a greater sense
of team spirit, for example. Employees quickly realized that a true
effort was being made to change things.

Daimler captured two awards for its NANOSLIDE® technology:
the 2014-2015 European Environmental Award in the category “Process,” and the R&D 100 Award presented by R&D
Magazine in the U.S. The ultra-thin NANOSLIDE® coating reduces
weight and engine friction; this in turn improves fuel efficiency
and lowers CO2 emissions.

Acting
locally
Economic, social, and environmental conditions vary from
country to country. Many Daimler national subsidiaries and
regional organizations have therefore developed their own CSR
and sustainability programs within the framework of the
Group-wide sustainability strategy. This is the case, for example,
in China, India, Argentina, South Korea, Spain, and the
Middle East. Some subsidiaries even publish their own sustainability reports.

Daimler’s electronic assistants aren’t used only in its vehicles.
For example, employees in Germany who don’t want to go
through an endless pile of e-mails in their inbox following a vacation can use the Mail on Holiday service. This system ensures
that e-mails that arrive when a staff member is on vacation are
automatically deleted. It also sends an e-mail to senders with the
e-mail address of the person filling in for the vacationing employee. This ensures that all queries etc. can be dealt with quickly.

Top employer
Daimler Financial Services is the first German company to
make it into the elite group of the World’s Best 25 Multinational Workplaces. The ranking is made every year by the
independent Great Place to Work Institute. Daimler’s Financial

Integrity and compliance

Beyond the minimum requirements:
Daimler is adopting new approaches with respect to integrity and compliance.

or the last few months, Daimler employees have been running the risk of encountering some unpleasant individuals.
These characters display traits that are the exact opposite
of the most important principles in the Integrity Code — like fairness, the appreciation of diversity, and personal responsibility.
Fortunately, they only exist in a computer game known as Monster Mission, in which players are confronted with situations from
working life and have to make decisions that will ensure the sustained success of their virtual company. In the engine-testing
shop, for example, a vehicle is being driven out and Paul fails to
notice that the car is still connected by a cable to the test rig. The
cable then snaps — it’s broken. What is Paul to do now? His coworker on the early shift needs to have a test rig that works.

F

Now it’s up to the players, who can play alone or as a team, to
make a decision. Should Paul admit his mistake and tell his boss?
Should he instead go find a cable that works and hook it up to
the test rig? Or should he simply do nothing? Providing one
answer isn’t enough here, as players are then presented with
counterarguments and have to weigh the pros and cons. In the
ideal case, they should ultimately come up with an ethically
sound and economically beneficial solution. Every time they do
so, the monster gets smaller and smaller, until it eventually
disappears from the company. Players then collect points and

Developing a sense of integrity by playing
Monster Mission is an innovative continuation of the integrity
dialog that has been extensively conducted at Daimler over the
last few years. The company is seeking to adopt new approaches
for the discussion of integrity-related topics, and gamification
was intentionally chosen as one of the methods to be employed
here. Experience from different business sectors shows that the

use of typical game elements in a non-game context is actually
helpful in motivating people to address serious issues and to
achieve ambitious goals together. After the first Monster Mission
episode went online in September 2014, some 33,000 employees
from 47 countries went on a “monster hunt.” They even did this
during working hours, something which is expressly permitted by
the company. “Obviously, the game is only one way of making
people more aware of integrity-related issues in the everyday
work environment,” says Pia Simon from the Integrity Program
Office. “The challenge we face is to reach a very diverse workforce with very different needs, which is why we’re always developing new methods.”

http://sustainability.daimler.com

Daimler has made great progress with regard to integrity and
compliance. For example, the Group’s compliance system
was completely revised and a definition was developed of what
it means to act ethically together with the employees. The fact
that Daimler has been very successful in its efforts was also
confirmed by a monitor assigned by the U.S. government who
accompanied the company between 2010 and 2013.

Exchanging information with other companies
Daimler is not resting on its laurels, however. “For us, integrity
isn’t a project that can be completed at a certain point in time,”
says Christine Hohmann-Dennhardt, the Member of the Daimler
Board of Management responsible for Integrity and Legal Affairs.
“We want to step up to the challenges brought about by a constantly changing environment and continually adapt and refine
our understanding of the concept of integrity.” This fits in well
with the exemplary role Daimler plays as a participant of the UN
Global Compact’s LEAD Group.
Monster Mission and other innovative formats express Daimler’s
determination to take the dialog with its employees one step further. Daimler also wants to share its knowledge and experience
in the area of integrity and compliance with others. One example
of this is the Daimler Compliance Academy, which is offered to
compliance officers at other companies. The focus here is on an
interactive discussion of current compliance trends and the
transfer of practical knowledge using fictitious case studies. The
first seminar was held in April 2014 and the response to it was
very positive.

»Effective data protection is a key factor
for ensuring acceptance of connected
and autonomous driving.«
This was the consensus during a panel discussion at the
Automobile on the Data Highway symposium in September
2014 in Stuttgart.

Providing impetus in social debates
Another measure has already attracted a good deal of attention.
Daimler promotes an interdisciplinary exchange on relevant
social issues with various stakeholder groups and has created its
own platforms for this purpose. For example, the Group staged
two conferences with top-notch experts in 2014: The Sponsorship Symposium focused on what constitutes responsible sponsorship. At the Automobile on the Data Highway Symposium, the
challenges associated with data protection in connected vehicles
was discussed. “We as a company can provide an impetus here,
and we also benefit tremendously from the constructively critical
discussions with experts from different sectors,” says Daimler’s
Chief Data Protection Officer, Joachim Rieß.

Transportation concepts

Networked mobility
Intelligent networks hold the key to the future of mobility. Mobility services such as moovel already
show today what might happen tomorrow. Such services link existing modes of transportation
with new, flexible mobility solutions. This offers customers benefits and also helps improve the
traffic situation in urban areas.

haring rather than owning — this could be the new megatrend. For example, your parking space in front of your
house is available the whole day during the week, so why
not rent it out to someone? Or you only use your drill or jumper
cable once every couple of months — so why not share them with
someone else? More and more consumers now prefer to share
things they don’t need all the time rather than buy them. Thanks
to the Internet and easy-to-use apps, people who are offering
things to share and those who want to use them can find each
other quickly. Researchers believe the new “share economy” is
more than just a stylish trend. They think the nature of economic
activity could change noticeably over the medium term and that
this could have an effect on mobility as well.

S

Carsharing, for example, is becoming more popular in cities, and
“multi-modal” transport is the new buzzword. In a multi-modal
setup, various modes of transportation are combined in a way
that gets users from point A to point B in the quickest and least
expensive manner. This is made possible by apps that deliver
to a smartphone or tablet all the information that’s needed to
make a multi-modal trip smooth and flexible — everything from
long-distance bus, train, and public transport schedules to booking systems for reserving the nearest rental bike or carsharing
vehicle.

Simple, flexible, and good for the environment.
There’s no doubt that new mobility services are booming. With
services such as the car2go carsharing system and the moovel
mobility platform, Daimler is one of the market leaders in the
22

sector. The automotive company’s goal with moovel is to make
mobility more intelligent and flexible in metropolitan areas especially. To this end, Daimler is working to further expand networks
that include all types of mobility services. The idea is to make
mobility options available in a way that allows each user to find
the best transport sequence for his or her specific needs.
Once users register with moovel, they can access information
on all available transportation options from any place and at any
time — everything from local public transportation systems and
ridesharing offers to airplane flights. Depending on user preferences, moovel suggests the fastest, least expensive, or most
convenient route. Key modes of transportation can not only
be booked via the app; they can also be paid for electronically.
All of this is very easy and convenient — and it doesn’t just benefit
customers. That’s because those who use moovel help ensure
better use of existing resources and also improve the traffic situation, especially in urban areas.

What is the environmental assessment of flexible
carsharing?
car2go is one of the main transportation options in the moovel
system. This flexible carsharing system allows customers to use
and return rental cars anywhere within a city. This very attractive
concept is also considered environmentally and climate-friendly
— even more so when electric vehicles are available as well, as
is the case with car2go. It’s therefore not surprising that with its
one million customers, car2go is now the biggest carsharing
company in the world.

Transportation concepts

moovel and more — mobility services from Daimler
Mobility services from Daimler aren’t anything new. Back in the 1970s, the
Group developed its Bus Rapid Transit concept. New mobility services have
been repeatedly added since that time. It’s not just moovel that’s causing the
sector to grow more dynamically than ever before. Here are two examples:

Bus Rapid Transit. Bus Rapid Transit
(BRT) makes traffic flows in cities smoother
and more efficient because it enables buses to operate at more frequent intervals
in dedicated lanes and with separate traffic
light sequences. The flexible system is
also helpful when major events take place.
For example, BRT proved very valuable
in seven Brazilian cities during the World Cup soccer championship in the
summer of 2014. Today, BRT is already helping 170 cities around the world
use their infrastructure more efficiently and improve their public transport
systems. Autonomously driving buses will also be used in BRT systems in the
future.

Corporate carsharing. Daimler Fleet
Management is bringing carsharing to corporate vehicle fleets. The provider of fleet
management and leasing services began
offering corporate carsharing solutions
for its fleet customers in 2014 with the goal
of enabling more efficient use of company
fleets. Corporate carsharing helps companies lower fleet and mobility costs and streamline processes.

Just missed the train?
Many of us know what it’s like to be just a little late and
have to watch a train leave the station right before your eyes.
Fortunately, those who have a smartphone and the moovel
app can obtain the complete range of alternative transport
options on their displays. They will then quickly find out that
the next train leaves in 25 minutes and that a rental bike is
available at their destination, for example. Still, that might not
be enough for them to get through the city and to their meeting on time. Their next option is car2go — a vehicle is available
right next to the station. All they have to do now is to get in
and drive off. Problem solved!

Carsharing

Trains

Ridesharing

Public transport

Taxis

Rental bike

It’s also part of a trend whereby young people in particular don’t
necessarily want to own a vehicle but do wish to remain mobile.
The question is how this trend affects general mobility behavior.
For example, do carsharing customers use their own vehicles or
public transport more or less often than other people? Questions
such as these are being addressed by researchers at the Institute
for Applied Ecology and the Institute for Social-Ecological
Research (ISOE), who are working together with experts from
car2go in the “share” research project. Interim results from this
multi-year project funded by Germany’s Environment Ministry
were presented in July 2014. A broad-based survey of users in
Stuttgart and Cologne revealed, for example, that younger, welleducated urban residents in particular make extensive use of
flexible carsharing services. From this it can be concluded that
flexible carsharing programs also attract people who were previously less likely to use public transportation because they found
it too complicated and insufficiently flexible. Use of the intermodal transport options that are now available is also more likely
to lead to a better environmental performance than is the case
with exclusive personal transport.
The second phase of the project, which addresses longer-term
trends, will examine whether this turns out to be true, as the
“share” project will then release greenhouse gas data for car2go
in Stuttgart and Cologne. The data will be used to determine the
extent to which flexible carsharing models contribute to climate
protection, as well as to identify the differences between conventional and electric vehicles in this regard. The researchers
plan to release their results in 2016.

Raw materials

Resource efficiency:
key to the future
Using valuable raw materials efficiently and dealing sparingly with scarce resources — in the future,
this will require a concerted effort by companies, political decision-makers, and society.
A discussion between Franz Untersteller, Minister of the Environment in the German state of
Baden-Württemberg, and Herbert Kohler, Chief Environmental Officer of Daimler AG.

Franz Untersteller: Mr. Kohler, I’m glad to see that you’ve
granted the theme of efficiency such a prominent place in your
Sustainability Report. It shows that Daimler realizes the growing
significance of this issue. The government of Baden-Württemberg regards resource efficiency as a key factor for the state’s
success as a business location. The main aim of our business
and industrial policy is to strengthen the manufacturing industry
in the areas where greater sustainability could potentially be
developed. The best way to do that is to deal efficiently with our
energy production resources and our material resources.
Herbert Kohler: These two themes have also been on Daimler’s
agenda for quite some time. For example, in recent years we have
continuously reduced our vehicles’ fuel consumption, to the
point where the average CO2 emissions of our cars sold in Europe
have decreased by 27.5 percent since 2007. And we won’t slack-

resources have to be protected and how
to prioritize them.«
Herbert Kohler

en our efforts in this area in the future — as our plug-in hybrid
offensive is demonstrating.
Our progress in terms of dealing sparingly with material
resources may not be quite so obvious. However, there are many
examples that testify to our efforts and our successes. For
instance, the new C-Class is 100 kilograms lighter than its

http://sustainability.daimler.com

predecessor model; more than 95 percent of the materials in a
Daimler vehicle are recyclable; and about 90 percent of the
residual materials in our plants are recycled. Our remanufacturing activities are certainly a highlight of our efforts in this area.
And of course we’re also working to enhance the recyclability
of the new components for electric mobility, for example through
research programs such as MoRe and LiBRi.
Untersteller: Those are undoubtedly good examples and steps
in the right direction. Especially for economically strategic raw
materials and technological materials, it’s extremely important
that we make much stronger efforts in the future to keep them
within the circular flow of the economy. Not only is this necessary
— there’s also tremendous potential in this area, in my opinion.
For many new industrial raw materials such as the rare earths,
the recycling rates have generally been less than one percent so
far, in contrast to the widely used industrial metals. Remanufacturing is an excellent beginning, because it lengthens the longevity of products. But we need still more smart solutions of this
kind. For the low-volume material flows of important raw materials in particular, we have to think in new and comprehensive
ways. In this area, our state government is promoting a project
called the Dismantling Factory. The aim is to generate highly
concentrated streams of residual materials that are also economically strategic raw materials so that these residues can be
channeled toward economically worthwhile reuse.

»Especially for economically strategic
raw materials and technological materials, it’s extremely important to keep them
within the circular flow of the economy.«
Franz Untersteller

But we can, and must, also greatly improve efficient processes
in companies. To be sure, we have already achieved a lot here in
Baden-Württemberg and raised our raw material productivity
by 56 percent since 1994. That puts us considerably above the
national average, but we’re still quite far from the 100 percent
increase we’re aiming at. The requirements for the manufacturing industry in a highly developed industrial region such as
Baden-Württemberg are increasingly posing two challenges. For
one thing, we have to manufacture products while generating
a minimum of pollutants. For another, production processes
increasingly have to be carried out in urban locations. That
means we have to use resource-saving technologies that close
the energy and materials loops and take advantage of the synergies offered by urban infrastructure. In the Ultra-efficiency Factory research project, we’re working together with business and
science experts to develop the knowledge and tools we need.
Kohler: I completely agree with you. The efficient use of material
resources is a long-term obligation that still needs some development work. In terms of technology, we certainly need new concepts and processes that reduce the use of material resources
and make it possible to reuse raw materials in high-quality ways.
But at the same time we are being confronted by a contrary
development: Trends such as our customers’ desire for greater
comfort and the expansion of electric mobility tend to result in
the more extensive use of raw materials.

Raw materials

Prof. Herbert Kohler is the Head of Corporate
Research and Sustainability at Daimler and is also
the Chief Environmental Officer of Daimler AG.

Franz Untersteller is a member of the State
Parliament of Baden-Württemberg for the Green
Party and has been the state’s Minister of the
Environment, Climate and the Energy Industry
since 2011.

We are ultimately facing challenges that go far beyond the technical dimension and present us with evaluation issues. We can
comprehensively assess our vehicles’ fuel consumption by using
key indicators such as energy requirements and CO2 emissions.
But the process is more complicated for material resources. For
example, the use of one kilogram of sand has to be evaluated differently than the use of one kilogram of rare earths. This means
that companies, political decision-makers, and society must
clearly decide which resources have to be protected and how to
prioritize them. As a company, we want to actively participate in
this discussion — and we are already doing so within the framework of the Daimler Sustainability Dialogue.
Untersteller: Against this background, our state’s strategy for
resource efficiency, which we want to officially present at the
end of 2015, aims to detach economic growth from resource consumption. This could be done easily through de-industrializing
our economy, but I want to accomplish this while retaining our
high proportion of manufacturing industry and our medium-scale
economic structure. We are quite aware of the complexity of this
issue. We have to take a close look at the possible conflicts
between this target and those of other strategies so that we can
ultimately set up a list of priorities. This is a task for society as a
whole, and we want to address it together with the participating
stakeholders.
In any case, I regard resource efficiency as a task that is shared
by businesses and policy-makers. In 2013 we joined the top
business associations and the Baden-Württemberg Chamber of
Commerce and Industry to establish the Alliance for Greater
Resource Efficiency in Baden-Württemberg and sign an agreement concerning the initiative “100 Companies for Resource
Efficiency.” I would be delighted if Daimler were to participate
and make its experience available to others.
Kohler: We’re happy to rise to this challenge. We’ve also got two
projects in the pipeline that we can contribute to this effort. I can
only agree with your statement that we have to identify possible
conflicts between various targets and evaluate these targets in a
dialog that involves society as a whole.

Remanufacturing

Optimal resource
conservation
Recycling conserves energy and scarce resources — and saves customers money. In the form
of remanufacturing, this tried and tested principle is taken beyond mere repair and refurbishing measures. Instead, refined high-tech systems are used to transform old assemblies and
components into genuine spare parts that measure up in every way to new components.

robot arm moves a torch line by line along the surface of
a component. Sparks fly, and loud sizzling noises can be
heard in the noise-insulated cabin. The component to
which a micro-thin metal coating is being applied is the crankcase of a V6 engine block. The powerful engine was used in an
Actros truck for many years before it was decommissioned and
sent to the Daimler plant in Mannheim, where experts give such
engines a new lease on life. The fiery high-tech process in the
cabin is truly special, as Jana Kunze, the production engineer
who was responsible for introducing the process to the remanufactured engine unit, explains: “Coating is nothing new, but the

A

process we use here is really unique. We planned and built the
entire facility and peripheral areas in cooperation with external
manufacturing partners.”
The process Kunze is referring to is known as twin-wire arc
spraying technology. The experts in Mannheim refined it especially for use with crankcases. The principle is quite simple: Two
current-carrying metal wires are connected at their ends, and
the resulting short circuit creates an electric arc that generates
a temperature of around 4,000 degrees Celsius. The ends of the
wires melt and the liquid metal is vaporized using compressed

air or gas and then sprayed onto the surface of the component.
“We apply as many as seven coatings to the crankcase in this
manner,” Kunze explains.
Although the process sounds easy, it initially presented the
remanufacturing (reman) experts with several challenges. “We
had to conduct various tests in order to determine which materials and process parameters should be used,” says Markus
Zeller, an engineer in the remanufacturing unit in Stuttgart who
is responsible for developing remanufacturing procedures for
spare parts. “For example, we analyzed the spray jet with specialists from the German Army University and examined adhesive
mechanisms and materials with experts from the Materials Testing Institute at the University of Stuttgart. Our goal was to identify materials that function in an optimal manner but are also
cost-effective,” he says.

completely excluded. “Instead, we developed a new milling technique that involves applying a fine groove profile to the crankcase surface,” Zeller explains. “The sprayed metal sticks to
the grooves very well.” Once that’s done, the crankcase can be
precisely dimensioned and then installed as a component of a
replacement engine that measures up in every way to a new one.

Good and affordable throughout a vehicle’s entire
service life

Goals related to economy and sustainability were also the driving force behind the development of the new twin-wire arc spraying process back in 2009. On the one hand, Mannheim had been
remanufacturing old crankcases for quite some time by milling
off corroded areas. The problem was that the experts weren’t
able to compensate for the resulting loss of material, as the
engine block always ended up being too short after the milling
process was completed. Special shorter pistons then had to be
used to ensure that the engine would work properly. This not
only contradicted the principles of remanufacturing, which are
geared toward resource efficiency; it wasn’t very cost-effective.

After two years of research and development, the new twin-wire
arc spraying facility went into operation in 2012. It was indeed
a highlight for the remanufactured engine experts in Mannheim,
but also only one of many technological innovations that have
helped Daimler engineers continually refine and expand reman
activities at the Group. Today, the premium automaker’s remanufacturing portfolio covers four categories:
1. Major components such as engines, transmissions, and axle
housings
2. Mechanical components such as turbochargers, brake parts,
and steering units
3. Components for diesel injection and aftertreatment
4. Electronic systems — including everything from navigation
and control units to high-voltage batteries
All in all, Daimler now offers 12,000 parts and components for
cars and commercial vehicles as genuine spare parts. Remanufacturing also isn’t limited to the activities of the 350 or so specialists for replacement engines in Mannheim: From the U.S. to
Brazil, South Africa, and Japan, some 2,100 Group employees are
involved in remanufacturing activities around the world.

What was needed was a process that would somehow offset the
unavoidable material losses resulting from the milling. That was
easier said than done, however. The preparation of the holding
primer especially gave the remanufacturing team major headaches. The sandblasting procedure normally used was out of the
question here because the possibility of impurities couldn’t be

The basic steps of remanufacturing haven’t changed much since
the process was first used in 1945. Used parts and components
are examined, taken apart, and thoroughly cleaned. They are
then studied in detail, and damaged and worn elements are
removed and replaced. The subsequent reassembly process is
governed by rules similar to those for the assembly of new parts.

More economical and sustainable

27

Remanufacturing

Remanufacturable from the beginning
Jana Kunze, 30, is a production engineer at the
Daimler plant in Mannheim. After studying systems
engineering, she joined Daimler as a trainee in
2010. She’s been working in the remanufacturing
unit for four years and likes the fact that she’s able
to learn things about an engine’s history by examining its signs of wear and tear.

Markus Zeller, 32, is a mechanical engineer for
production and materials technology. He has been
working for Daimler since 2009. He wrote a doctoral dissertation on twin-wire arc spraying, and his
work has focused on remanufacturing processes
for spare parts ever since he obtained his Ph.D.
in 2014. He especially likes the fact that he gets to
work on a wide variety of vehicles — from smart
cars to trucks.

Quality checks and tests on series-production test rigs ensure
that the finished spare parts meet the same strict requirements
that apply to new components.

There are thus plenty of good reasons to expand remanufacturing activities. However, the best reason is that valuable resources
are becoming increasingly scarce. If bottlenecks are to be avoided, scarce resources will have to be used economically. Daimler
therefore also plans to employ remanufacturing processes such
as twin-wire arc spray coating with components that previously
couldn’t be rebuilt. “For example, right now we’re working on
a twin-wire arc process for coating cylinder linings that works in
a manner similar to the one used with new car engines and
Formula 1 engines as well,” says Zeller. “The first basic tests
have already been successful.”
There are both technical and financial reasons why some components can’t be remanufactured. Often both factors play a role —
for example, if it takes a lot of time and effort to disassemble and
repair a part. One solution here is to incorporate remanufacturing requirements into the development process for new components. This is known as remanufacturability. The idea is to design
vehicle components in a way that allows them to be easily remanufactured later on.

Solutions for replacement batteries
All of this guarantees the type of high quality that only a manufacturer with knowledge of the original component production
process can offer. Nevertheless, the replacement parts are still
less expensive than new ones. It’s therefore not surprising that
more and more customers are requesting remanufactured parts.
Interest is especially great among drivers of older vehicles.
Thanks to remanufacturing, they can be sure that even after four
or eight or more years, new replacement parts will be available
for their vehicle and — perhaps more importantly — will be offered
at an affordable price. After all, the costs for repairing older vehicles using quality spare parts can quickly exceed the book value
of the car. Without remanufactured parts, some used vehicles
would undoubtedly have a lower resale value because the latter
heavily depends on how much it will cost to repair the vehicle
later on.

Greater efficiency, lower resource consumption
Customers benefit in many ways from remanufacturing, which
also happens to be environmentally friendly. For example, the
reprocessing of used parts requires less energy, consumes fewer
raw materials, and results in lower CO2 emissions than the production of new parts. Daimler saves as much as 13,500 tons of
raw materials and up to 54,000 megawatt-hours of energy in this
manner every year.
The environmental benefit is considerable, as evidenced by the
life cycle assessment for an engine and a transmission. If one
considers the factors of greenhouse-gas potential, consumption
of fossil-based resources, acidification, overfertilization, and the
formation of photochemical oxidants, it turns out that the remanufacturing of an OM 906 truck engine has a 40 percent lower
negative impact on the environment than the production of a new
one. The difference with a G 281 truck transmission is even more
dramatic, as the environmental impact of a remanufactured
transmission is 70 percent lower than that of a new transmission.

Remanufacturability plays a particularly important role in new
hybrid and electric vehicles. The high-voltage (HV) components
used in such vehicles are of extremely high quality and therefore
very expensive. Manufacturing them in a resource-efficient way
and making them affordable for customers is therefore a remanufacturing issue as well. HV-system engineers therefore work
closely with reman experts in the early stages of the development process. As a result, remanufacturing requirements are
taken into account in the series development specifications and
in negotiations with suppliers.
Some 20 components for Daimler hybrid and electric vehicles
are already available as remanufactured parts today. The remanufacturing specialists are also working full steam on the development of new processes and the expansion of their portfolio.
Daimler is one of the pioneers of battery remanufacturing, for
example. Engineers in Stuttgart and Mannheim have developed a
process that makes it possible to remove a single damaged battery cell instead of having to take out an entire cell cluster, or
even the complete battery. This process is unique in the industry.
The engineers are now looking at ways to design remanufacturable power electronics systems.
Back in Mannheim, the twin-wire arc spraying robot in the reman
engine facility has now applied the seventh and final coating. The
crankcase will now be sent on to the finishing line, where every
tenth of a millimeter counts. “We are subject to exactly the same
stipulations that apply to new parts,” says Kunze. “If we can’t
meet the requirements, we have to figure out a new remanufacturing method, as we did with the crankcases. For us, throwing
away and melting down a part is the worst-case solution; the
ideal is always to remanufacture.”

From the heart
Daimler employees support charitable projects and initiatives around the world by donating
money — and often by getting involved themselves. The company fosters this commitment as a sign
of social responsibility.

A small contribution that has a big effect: ProCent financed a fence for a children’s aid project near Cape Town, South Africa.
The playground at the site was built by volunteers from Germany.

I know why I do this when I look at the children, the
progress they make, and the joy on their faces,” says
Bastian Kircheisen, an employee at Daimler Trucks who has been
working for several years as a volunteer for the Vulamasango
children’s aid organization in South Africa. Vulamasango operates a kindergarten and an after-school center on the edge of
the townships around Cape Town and is also now building an
orphanage at the expansive site it occupies. A total of 120 children without parents or a home will be housed here in a familylike community in the future. Daimler employees from Germany
are part of the reason why such a safe home will now be available to these children in an environment otherwise marked by
violence, drug abuse, and HIV/AIDS.

They often recommend causes or projects that they’ve been
involved with for many years. Such is the case with Bastian
Kircheisen. “I happened to learn about the children’s aid project
by coincidence a few years ago and I was immediately thrilled
by what they were doing,” he recalls. “Since then, I’ve been helping the organization wherever I can, and I’m now also on the committee of its support association in Germany.” When Kircheisen
found out that the orphanage under construction urgently
needed a fence to keep criminals out, he submitted a ProCent
request. “We then received approval for the entire cost of
€57,000,” he says, which allowed a fence for protecting the
children and teenagers to be built without delay.

Indeed, some 100,000 German employees — the clear majority —
participate in the ProCent initiative, which is based on an idea
originally developed by the General Works Council: Employees
voluntarily donate the cent portions of their monthly net salaries,
and the company then matches that amount. The proceeds
are used to fund charitable projects in Germany and abroad, all
of which are recommended by Daimler employees themselves.

Vulamasango has received the single highest amount of funding
from ProCent to date. “Since the start of the initiative, we have
provided around €2.75 million in funding to 479 charitable projects,” says Elisabeth Viebig, Head of Community Commitment,
Volunteering & Memberships. Such projects include an eat-in
kitchen at a hospice in Berlin and an initiative in Stuttgart that
distributes free sleeping bags to the homeless. Environmental
and nature conservation programs, such as renaturation projects, also receive support.
“The key requirement is that a project has to be recommended by
a Daimler employee, which means our people decide how the
money is spent,” Viebig explains. ProCent coordinators from the
General Works Council serve as contact partners, and there are

Day/Week of Caring 2014 — a selection of projects

U.S. During the Week of Caring,
200 employees built a playground for underprivileged
children.

Mexico: A total of 180 employees renovated schools, community centers, and playgrounds in
poor neighborhoods in Mexico
City.

Brazil: After the World Cup
ended, 30 DFS employees built
housing for people who live in
extreme poverty.

Japan: Employees from DFS and
their colleagues from other business units performed cleanup
work in the area around Mount
Fuji.

Germany: In Stuttgart, 110
employees marked steps in a
home for the blind, and also
put up notices and signs written
in Braille.

Corporate volunteering

»Our employees’ cent
contributions and project
recommendations impressively demonstrate their
social commitment.«

It goes without saying that top managers at DFS get involved in
such activities as well. As Daimler Financial Services Chairman
Klaus Entenmann points out, “Social responsibility and commitment is a firm component of our corporate culture. It allows
us to give back to our communities and offers our employees a
different perspective on things. The joint effort they make fosters
a unique team spirit that binds everyone at our company to one
another.”

Surprise packages for Christmas
also panels at Group locations and headquarters that are made
up of equal numbers of members of the Works Council, the management representative committee, and the corporate management team. The panels make the final decision on the projects to
be selected and the amount of funding.
ProCent thus stands as a symbol of Daimler’s commitment to
firmly establishing the principle of social responsibility among its
workforce. “Our people themselves have a good sense of what
needs to be done to improve the environment and society, and
many of them do volunteer work in their free time,” says Viebig.
“Initiatives such as ProCent enable them to contribute their ideas
and help shape our company’s activities in this area.” That’s why
social projects that include volunteers from Daimler are also a
firm component of human resources development measures in
the Group-wide CAReer entry-level program for young talents, in
team development programs, and within the dual education system. For example, in 2014, 23 trainees helped out with the renaturation of a marsh in the village of Hinterzarten in Germany’s
Black Forest region — and learned about both nature conservation and the power of cooperation in the process.

»Our ProCent fund is a symbol of the
social responsibility assumed by the
company and its employees.«
Michael Brecht, Chairman of the General Works Council
at Daimler AG

Practical assistance worldwide
Corporate volunteering projects for which Daimler gives its
employees time off have a long tradition at the company. Daimler
Financial Services (DFS) provides a good example here, as the
division has been staging a company-wide Day of Caring for
almost ten years now. In 2014 alone, a total of 2,300 DFS
employees in more than 30 countries rolled up their sleeves to
work together on charitable local projects. During the Week of
Caring in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, 1,100 employees spent
a whole week working on major charitable projects at more than
30 different institutions. There are also many other opportunities
for employees to help out. For example, employees in the U.S.
can take part in an Individual Volunteer Day to assist in a project
that is of special importance to them personally.

Daimler employees also like to help people out at Christmas.
Under the motto “Give a Smile,” staff members in Stuttgart
have been putting together Christmas packages for children and
teenagers from underprivileged families since 2013. In 2014,
the initiative was expanded to four other Daimler locations in
Germany and to 17 Daimler Financial Services subsidiaries in
Europe. The campaign was actually originally started at Daimler
Financial Services in Germany in 2005. Employees are allowed
to put together as many packages as they want, and Daimler
provides the boxes. The suggested limit is €25 worth of gifts per
package; volunteers can create address labels on the intranet
and check off whether the packages are for boys or girls, and of
what ages. The intranet site also offers suggestions for gifts. The
packages are delivered to the children and teenagers by experienced partners, including the Schwäbische Tafeln food bank,
SOS Children’s Villages, and Germany’s Protestant Social Welfare Organization (Diakonie).
Training supervisor Karl Migl is a big fan of “Give a Smile.” He
promoted the campaign to 22 industrial mechanic trainees in
their first year of training at the Brühl plant. They all quickly
agreed that they wanted to participate. Some teamed up to
finance a package and even gave their parents and friends boxes
to fill with gifts. Migl’s goal of surpassing the 85 packages from
the previous year was quickly achieved: “Soon we had more than
100.” In the end, it turned out to be 130. Katja Weichelt, a 20year-old trainee who participated in the campaign, tried to imagine what a mother without much money might not be able to
give her son or daughter for Christmas. “That’s why I decided to
get one big thing rather than a lot of smaller items,” she explains.
In the end, she decided to purchase a learning laptop.
It was an honor for the trainees to also take the packages put
together by other employees in Brühl and load them on to
the “Give a Smile” truck. Two trucks — a Fuso Canter and a
Mercedes-Benz Atego — were used in 2014 to pick up Christmas
packages during the first two weeks of December from Daimler
locations near Stuttgart, and a total of 8,500 packages were
officially handed over to Schwäbische Tafeln on December
16. Taken together, all Daimler locations in Germany and other
parts of Europe filled more than 13,000 boxes with Christmas
presents in 2014.

In choosing the direction of our sustainability strategy we are guided by two aspects: on the one
hand, by the question which requirements we set for ourselves in order to have sustainable success,
and by our desire to know our stakeholders’ expectations on us as a globally operating company,
on the other. We use a multi-step materiality analysis for the identification of the fields of action
that are relevant for us and our stakeholders.

In the design of this report we observe the G4 guidelines of the
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), accounting for the principles
of completeness, contextualization, stakeholder inclusiveness,
and materiality. Significant fields of action are important for our
stakeholders as well as for our company. For our determination
of the cross-section of perspectives, which do not always coincide, and to enable us to set priorities, we utilize a multi-step
materiality analysis.
Identification and relevance. In order to obtain an exact
picture of the expectations of the various stakeholder groups
we also evaluate reader surveys on this report, customer and
employee surveys, specialist unit workshops, dialogs with
individual stakeholder groups, and the results of our “Daimler
Sustainability Dialogue.” In 2014, we additionally organized
specialist events on current issues, in this case on data protection and sponsoring, in order to get critical impulses and initiate
social discourse. In addition, we also take into account the analyses of our “News and Issues Management” and our “Society
and Technology Research Group.” The following applies to the
fields of action identified in this manner:
– They affect our present and future business activities.
– We are in a position to influence them – directly or indirectly.
Prioritization through open stakeholder survey. To enable a
priority ranking of the identified fields of action, we conducted
the second international open stakeholder survey in 2013, for
which we did not preselect the target groups in order to consider
as many legitimate stakeholder interests as possible. Within a
period of about one month, all interested parties could take part
in the survey on our website daimler.com, and name and evaluate
topics that were important to them. By the end of the survey,
more than 800 responses had been received. In our assessment
of results, we gave special consideration to the great significance
of our primary stakeholder groups (shareholders and investors,
customers, suppliers, and employees) as well as to the expertise
of non-government organizations. That is why these groups are
taken into account with a higher weighing factor.

34

Cross-section of significant topics from the company and
stakeholder view. The results of the online survey were incorporated into a materiality analysis, in which they were compared
with the results of a survey and discussion among the members
of our company’s sustainability bodies as well as the entire Board
of Management of Daimler AG. The decisions made in these
internal bodies were based on the discussion of topics that have
material effects on our company from a social, ecological, ethical, human-rights, and economical perspective. The results of
the internal and external surveys used in our materiality analysis
in the last two years varied only to a minor extent. That is why
we have decided to perform the materiality analysis at two-year
intervals from now on. The next survey will therefore be conducted in 2015. The table shows the fields of action evaluated in the
last survey in 2013 – organized thematically in line with the
responsibility dimensions of our sustainability strategy and presented in decreasing order of stakeholder priorities. The importance of the majority of action fields for our stakeholders and
for our company is high or very high.
From analysis to actual practice. The results of the materiality
analysis show us the areas that must be given special attention
in our activities. Thus for example, in the reporting year we intensified our efforts for reducing the CO2 emissions of our vehicles,
and further advanced our approach for the observance of human
rights. We are also working intensively on ways of further improving the satisfaction of our customers by examining the different customer requirements worldwide in even greater detail.
For reviewing and improving our activity as an employer we use
the feedback instrument of our worldwide employee survey.
The materiality analysis also provides us with guidance for our
annual “Daimler Sustainability Dialogue.” It enables us to select
topics, which we discuss in depth at the events with sustainability experts and other stakeholders.

Strategy and management

Strategy and management.
Sustainability is a basic principle of our corporate strategy and a benchmark for our business
success. To enable us to deal systematically with the fields of action that are also considered
important from the view of our stakeholders, we are continuously developing our sustainability
strategy, aimed at the implementation of our medium- to long-term “Sustainability Program 2020”.

Our understanding of sustainability
In our mission statement we have formulated what sustainability
means to us and how we wish to achieve the associated objectives in our daily working lives and in our business activity:

03
Our understanding of sustainability

1
2
3

At Daimler, we define sustainability as responsible
corporate behavior that leads to long-term business
success and is in harmony with society and the
environment.

We are moving toward our goals by making sustainability a firmly integrated aspect of our operations
and by requiring and promoting a strong sense of
responsibility for sustainable operations among all
of our managers and employees throughout the
Group. We include our business partners in this
process and participate in continuous dialogue on
these issues with our stakeholders.

Our management structures, processes, and
systems are also designed in accordance with this
concept of sustainability. All of our behavior is
based on legality and integrity. As one of the world’s
foremost automakers, Daimler strives to achieve a
clear leading position in the area of sustainability.

Strategic approach
As a globally operating automotive manufaturer, we deal with
industry specific challenges in the implementation of our sustainability objectives, which arise from the social and ecological
effects of our business activity as well as from the framework
conditions under which we operate. Our approach to these
challenges gives rise to opportunities for sustainable business
success. At the same time, we are called upon to identify and
address risks at an early stage:

36

– We are committed to legal and ethical standards and must
ensure that they are observed — worldwide as well as by our
business partners and suppliers.
– Road traffic contributes to the generation of CO2 and pollutant emissions. As an automotive manufacturer we strive to
create sustainable mobility solutions and demonstrate our
power of innovation in the areas of environmental protection,
conservation of resources, and safety.
– Our operational processes, particularly in vehicle production,
are associated with environmental effects, which we keep as
low as possible through a system of consistent environmental
management.
– As an employer, we bear responsibility for ensuring fair and
attractive working conditions for almost 280,000 employees
worldwide.
– As a good corporate citizen, we want to contribute to the
common good beyond the scope of our business operations
and in doing so make use of our special competencies.
To adequately meet these requirements and address our selfdesignated sustainability objectives on a systematic basis, we
have developed a Group-wide sustainability strategy, which is
integrated into our corporate strategy based on the fundamental
corporate values of passion, discipline, respect, and integrity.
Sustainability is anchored in this target system as a basic principle at the implementation level. That means: We can achieve
sustainable profitability and social acceptance with a license to
operate in our business activity only if we consider the environmental and social effects of all business processes, and tie our
economic objectives to ecological and social requirements.
Daimler’s target system: Online 101

Our sustainability strategy has six main activity areas (“responsibility dimensions”) to which relevant fields of action are
assigned. We have linked these with targets and target indicators. All targets taken together constitute our medium- to longterm “Sustainability Program 2020.” The program provides
us with a yardstick to measure ourselves and be measured by
the public. A key task of the cross-disciplinary dimension of
management responsibility is the systematic management
of the strategic program and the verifiable implementation of
its objectives.

Material fields of action

We concentrate our sustainability management on fields of action that are significant for our stakeholders and ourselves.
For prioritization of key fields of action, we employ our multi-step materiality analysis
which is performed at periodic intervals.

We are working
on the provision
of sustainable
mobility through
safe, economical,
and emission-free
vehicles.

We are investing
in eco-friendly
production and
process technology based on
an operational
environmental
management.

We respect and
promote our
employees
through attractive
working
conditions.

In the identification of particularly relevant fields of action, we
take into consideration the views of our company and standpoints of our stakeholders, which include employees, customers,
shareholders, and suppliers, as well as environmental and human
rights organizations and many other stakeholder groups. We
prioritize the fields of action at regular intervals with the help of
a multi-step materiality analysis. In this respect, as well as in
the associated process of updating and possibly correcting our
sustainability strategy, continuous dialog with our stakeholders
plays an important role.

business activity.

We are committed
to compliance
with legal and
ethical standards.
We also encourage
our business
partners and
suppliers to do the
same.

Sustainable management
Sustainability management is a continuous improvement
process, which is used for the systematic steering of our sustainability program and the verifiable implementation of its objectives. We have coordinated our management and organization
structures to this end, and have created clear lines of responsibility in all business divisions. Our sustainability objectives are
anchored in our management and leadership system, and are
documented in the target agreements between employees and
managers.

house principles and policies that help our employees in making
the right decisions in the highly complex day-to-day business.
The Enterprise Regulations Database (ERD) contains all internal
policies of the Group and works agreements, and is accessible to
all employees. The ERD is available in ten languages and the policies are published in up to 23 languages.
The basic guidance for our business activity is provided by the
ten principles of the UN Global Compact, with which we have a
special affiliation as a founding and LEAD participant. Our internal principles and guidelines are founded on this international
frame of reference and other international principles.

Since 2011, we have been utilizing a sustainability scorecard as
an instrument for controlling the key sustainability targets. This
signals needs for action and successes based on quantitative
indicators and qualitative targets via a traffic-light system and
thus enables us to take targeted measures with the direct
involvement of corporate management.
Governance structures. As a corporation founded under German law, the Daimler Group has a dual management structure
comprised of a Board of Management and a Supervisory Board,
both of which work closely together in the best interests of the
company in line with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code. The requirement for sustainable corporate management is also firmly established at this top management level — through the personal target agreements of the
members of the Board of Management, which have been supplemented with annually updated non-financial indicators in the
area of integrity and the UN Global Compact since the 2011
financial year.

women in Supervisory Boards of fully co-determined and listed
companies required by the great coalition. Since February 2011,
the Board of Management Division for Integrity and Legal Affairs
at Daimler AG is headed by a woman. The current share of
women in the Board of Management is 12.5 percent due to the
enlargement of the Board of Management from seven to eight
members as of January 1, 2015. Moreover, we have set ourselves
a target of 20 percent women in senior executives positions by
the year 2020. The share of women has grown continuously in
recent years and was at a good 14 percent at the end of 2014.
For the year 2015, we have set a target of one percent additional
growth.

Sustainability ratings

Independent rating agencies and research institutes have evaluated and
critically assessed our sustainability performance in 2014 again. Today
there are many different ratings and ranking of various quality and significance. The Corporate Sustainability Board (CSB) has therefore decided
that our company will only supply data for the ratings and rankings whose
assessment methodology, quality, and transparency can be subjected to
a verifiable analysis.
In line with these requirements, the performance of Daimler AG in the
CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) is particularly noteworthy. Here,
Daimler was singled out as sector leader in the automotive industry. The
company received the award for outstanding commitment and exemplary
transparency in dealing with climate change, and scored the maximum
number of 100 points in the Climate Disclosure Leadership Index (CDLI).
In addition, Daimler received an “A ” performance rating for its initiated
measures, already achieved progress, and planned strategies for reducti-

Stakeholder dialog
Our business activities affect the interests of many people in
different countries and regions. We therefore seek the dialog
with all stakeholders in order to exchange experiences and
address controversial topics without any restrictions. That is why
the stakeholder dialog is a key element of the cross-divisional
management responsibilities in our sustainability strategy. The
honor of being cited as a cross-industry best practice example in
the 2013 Corporate Responsibility Index of the Bertelsmann
Foundation shows us that we are on the right track, which we will
continue to pursue rigorously.
Organization and responsibility. For our stakeholder relationships we have defined clear lines of responsibility, communication channels, and forms of dialog dependent on the topic and
case. In addition to institutionalized dialog management, for
example in Investor Relations, Procurement or Corporate Communications, the Sustainability Board and the Sustainability
Office coordinate the social dialog and the central events for the
topic-based dialog.

Targeted selection process of stakeholder groups. For us,
stakeholders are all parties and organizations which impose
legal, financial, operational or ethical requirements on Daimler
AG. One criterion for the identification and weighting is the
extent to which a person or group is influenced by our company’s
decisions and can in turn influence these decisions. The most
important stakeholders are our employees, customers, shareholders, and investors, as well as our suppliers. However, civil
groups such as NGOs also have legitimate interests and frequently possess special expertise, which we utilize and optimally
include in a structured manner. The same applies to analysts,
professional associations, trade unions, media, science, and politics as well as municipalities, residents, and neighbors of our
locations.
Forms of dialog. To ensure the inclusion of our stakeholders,
we utilize online and print media, questionnaires and surveys,
expert discussions, workshops, and local and regional dialog
events, among others. In addition, we collaborate in professional
associations, committees, and sustainability initiatives. In the
reporting year, in the framework of two interdisciplinary confer-

40

on of CO2 emissions: the top score. The CDP, which is supported by more
than 750 “signatory investors,” is considered the most important authority
for sustainability evaluation in the world today.
In 2013, the UN Global Compact introduced the “GC 100” stock index in
collaboration with the research provider Sustainalytics. This index represents the performance of 100 particularly sustainable and responsibilityconscious companies, of which Daimler AG is a member.
In addition, we are included in the “Euronext Vigeo — Europe 120,” an
index comprised of the 120 leading companies in the area of entrepreneurial responsibility in Europe.
We will continue to intensify our sustainability activities in order to improve our position in the relevant key ratings.

ences, we engaged in an intensive dialog with more than
80 experts and Daimler representatives on the topics of “Connected Driving and Data Protection” and “Responsible Sponsorship.” We thus deliberately initiated social discussion and dialog
in the spirit of constructive criticism about sustainability topics
that are especially relevant for us and the society.
Data Protection Symposium: Online 104
Sponsorship Symposium: Online 105
Topic “Integrity and compliance”: pp. 20 f.

“Daimler Sustainability Dialogue.” In addition, we attach great
importance to the “Daimler Sustainability Dialogue,” held annualy in Stuttgart since 2008, which brings various stakeholder
groups together with representatives of our Board of Management and the executive management. In line with our objective
of promoting the establishment and observance of sustainability
standards around the world, we are now organizing “Daimler
Sustainability Dialogues” in other countries as well. Thus far,
events have been held in China, the U.S., and Japan. Our Corporate Sustainability Board has decided to promote further internationalization in close collaboration with the respective national
companies.

Dialog at locations. We are also engaged in dialog with the
stakeholders at our locations. One example is our planned Testing and Technology Center in Immendingen on the Danube,
which will be built on the site of a former military base. From the
very start, we sought the dialog with the people in the region,
and addressed their concerns. In addition, the Daimler Forum
opened in 2012, ensuring the local presence of the company in
Immendingen, where the residents can learn about the status
of the project.

Stakeholder survey. With a view to reaching as many stakeholder groups as possible, we conduct an open international online
stakeholder survey on a regular basis. The last survey conducted
in 2013 was answered by more than 800 persons and organizations. All interested parties were invited to evaluate the relevance
of fields of action in the area of sustainability for our company
without limiting it to specific groups. Since the results of the sur-

vey remained relatively stable in 2012 and 2013, we have decided
to conduct the stakeholder survey at two-year intervals from now
on. Accordingly, the next survey will be conducted in 2015.

Feedback on our sustainability program. The results of our
open stakeholder survey are reflected in our materiality analysis
and also flow into our sustainability program along with the
results of the “Daimler Sustainability Dialogue.” Here, we deliberately focus on topics that are considered to be significant by us
and our stakeholders. Our aim is to translate the agreements
made in this context most optimally into verifiable targets and
initiatives that can be advanced during the year in cooperation
with our stakeholders.

Political dialog and representation of interests. Our principles for political dialog and lobbying provide the basis for responsible and ethical lobbying. These principles include neutrality in
dealing with political parties and interest groups.
Social renewal processes are often associated with far-reaching
political decisions that have an impact on our company’s longterm strategic focus. To help us make our planning more secure
and enable us to contribute our ideas to these change processes,
we speak with political decision-makers about topics such as
CO2 regulations, vehicle safety, new mobility concepts or electromobility. Other key issues include trade policy, location-specific
issues, education and HR policy. We summarize our company’s
positions on issues from the fields of environment, energy, transportation, and economy in an annual brochure on the occasion of
the international motor shows in Germany, alternating the focus
between passenger car and commercial vehicle topics. Since
2013 we have made this brochure available to a broader audience. Our positions are in accord with our declared principles,
sustainability goals, and public statements of our company. Given the fact that goals can be conflicting between sustainability
dimensions, different nuances are possible.
Brochure Company Positions: Online 109

The External Affairs department of Daimler AG is the coordination center for political dialog at the national and international
level. This worldwide network with offices in Berlin, Brussels, Beijing, Stuttgart, and Washington, operates with a staff of around
60, and coordinates more than 30 other corporate representations in key markets. In addition, a Group-wide “Lobbyists Register” ensures that political lobbying is carried out in accordance
with the applicable regulations and ethical standards. Registration also serves to meet the existing registration requirements of
public institutions.

cial risks, risks arising from warranties, legal risks as well as compliance and reputation risks within and outside the company.
Organization and responsibility. Our Group Risk Management
Committee (GRMC) is a platform that ensures holistic risk analysis and recognition of significant and existential risks. It defines
and designs the framework conditions for the Group-wide internal control and risk management system and reviews the effectiveness and functional capability of the deployed processes. The
responsibility for operational risk management lies directly in the
divisions, corporate functions, and legal entities. The respective
responsible officers have the task of identifying and evaluating
risks that are relevant for their unit, as well as for developing,
implementing, and monitoring risk minimization and -reduction
measures. The risks are documented and forwarded to Group
Risk Management, which processes the information and makes it
available to the GRMC, the Board of Management, and the Supervisory Board.
Other initiatives established in the context of risk management
are our Compliance Risk Assessment, the integrity reviews of
business partners, environmental risk analyses at our production
locations, and the consideration of consumer protection issues
in our quality management system. The proactive approach is
also supported by the systematic integration of environmental
protection throughout the entire life cycle of our vehicles. In addition, other risks analyzed in the sustainability context include e.g.
data protection and human rights.
Comprehensive risk report: AR 2014, p. 187
Compliance risks and collaboration with business partners: p. 45

Managing local impact. Risk prevention is also important
for managing the local effects of our business activities. This
applies, for example, to environmental protection in the production process: Our environmental management system defines
structures and processes that ensure transparent reporting
and clear areas of responsibility at all levels of our production
facilities around the world. More than 98 percent of our employees work at locations with environmental management systems,
which are audited and certified according to ISO14001. In addition, we regularly conduct environmental due diligence processes at our locations. Since 2011 we have also been working on a
Group-wide risk management system for human rights.
Operational environmental protection: pp. 56 ff.
Human rights: pp. 43 f.

Risk provisions
The precautionary principle is realized as a guideline for risk
prevention in principles and initiatives such as the UN Global
Compact. For us, active risk management requires early identification, assessment, and handling of risks. To this end we have
established management and control systems which are combined in a uniform Group-wide risk management system — also in
keeping with the legal requirements. Our major risk categories
include, among others, environmental and industry risks, finan-

Ethical responsibility

Ethical responsibility.
We are convinced that ethical business practices ensure our long-term success and benefit
society. As a globally operating company we take responsibility and strive to be a leader
in ethical corporate governance. That is why we anchor integrity in our corporate culture on
a sustainable basis.

Culture of integrity
Integrity is one of four corporate values which form the foundation for our business activities. Accordingly, the advancement
and consolidation of integrity is an essential building block of our
sustainability management and an element in the target agreements for the Board of Management remuneration. With a view
to advancing the culture of integrity in our company we engage in
dialog with our employees through a variety of measures. Regular
discussions of integrity issues are an integral part of our daily
work.
The shared understanding of the values of this dialog is our
Integrity Code, which is based on a mind-set developed jointly
with our employees. It defines the principles for our business
conduct in daily operations, such as fairness, responsibility,
mutual respect, transparency, openness, and compliance with
laws and rights. The Code, which is valid throughout the Group, is
available in 23 languages. A guide providing answers to the most
frequently asked questions offers practical support for specific
situations in our day-to-day business. In addition, a team of
experts is available to answer questions on the Integrity Code.
Integrity Code – text: Online 201

Communication and training. In September 2014, we introduced the online game “Monster Mission,” which raises the
awareness of our employees for the content of the Integrity
Code. The game presents typical decision-making situations
from the day-to-day business, and invites the players to examine
specific aspects of ethical behavior. The game is accessible to all
employees worldwide via the Intranet and Extranet. The Integrity
Code also forms the foundation for our training program on
integrity and compliance. Depending on the risk and target
group, we use classroom and web-based training through which
we anchor ethical and compliant behavior within the company
on a sustainable basis.
Topic “Monster Mission”: pp. 20 f.

42

In 2013, we rolled out a web-based training course on our shared
values and principles of behaviour for more than 100,000
employees throughout the Group. In 2014, nearly 40,000 more
employees from different hierarchical levels completed extensive
web-based training on integrity, compliance, and law. Our training strategy has an annual planning cycle for the program — from
the needs analysis and execution to the feedback and monitoring
process. Our local trainers are provided with modular training
documents that can be used for specific target groups according
to the risk associated with the participating functions. Each new
employee receives an introduction to integrity and compliance as
part of their welcome package.
Our training programs: Online 202

Managers as role models. Our Integrity Code also defines the
expectations on our managers, who have a special responsibility
to promote the culture of integrity at Daimler as role models.
Modules on integrity are included in all seminars for qualification
of new managers. In addition, integrity and compliance are
important criteria in the annual target agreements and target
achievements of our managers.
External perspective through an Advisory Board. The Advisory Board for Integrity and Corporate Responsibility established
in September 2012 with external experts from different sectors
accompanies the integrity process at Daimler with a constructively critical approach. The Board also met in three regular meetings in 2014 in order to discuss current topics with the representatives of our company.
Initiating social debate. In the reporting year, Daimler organized two events in order to provide a forum for critical dialog with
different stakeholder groups and further promote social discussion. The data protection symposium “The Automobile on the
data highway” was organized under the management of Corporate Data Protection. The invited guests from business, science,
politics, government organizations, associations, and media
engaged with great interest and commitment in discussion on
the different aspects of data protection with the speakers and
Daimler representatives, and recommended continuing the dialog. In the Sponsoring symposium, experts from business, politics, science, and sports discussed the aspects of responsible
sponsoring with specialists from our company.

Human rights
The respect of human rights is one of our top priorities. As an
automotive manufacturer, we attach great importance to employee rights, fair working conditions, and rejecting all forms of discrimination, forced labor, and child labor. The responsibility for
human rights issues belongs to the Board of Management division “Integrity and Legal Affairs” and is essentially based on the
UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. In line with
the requirement for a human rights policy formulated there, we
have specified operational responsibilities and approaches in our
Integrity Code, the Supplier Sustainability Standards, and our
supplier agreements as a key requirement for all employees and
business partners.

Ethical responsibility

Due diligence reviews at the production sites. Our concrete
human rights approach at our production facilities includes a
risk assessment conducted in form of a due diligence process in
keeping with the UN guiding principles, which facilitates the identification of country-specific risks. Among other tools, we use the
instrument of the Human Rights Compliance Assessment (HRCA)
of the Danish Institute for Human Rights for this purpose. We
have almost achieved our goal of conducting a total of 19 country
analyses by the end of 2015, and had examined 16 countries
using the HRCA method by the end of 2014:
– 2012: Germany, Mexico, and Egypt.
– 2013: Japan, France, Hungary, South Africa, Brazil, India,
Spain, and the U.S.
– 2014: Czech Republic, Turkey, Argentina, Canada, and
Indonesia.
– In 2015, the countries Portugal, Romania, and the United
Kingdom are still to follow.
Results of the assessments. The country analyses do not
indicate significant need for action for the Daimler units in majority shareholdings, but have identified optimization potential in
individual locations with regard to special financial benefits of
the company (such as special payments during maternity leave
or social benefits for socially disadvantaged groups), background
checks for high-risk service providers or information gaps relating to the awareness of integrity-promoting instruments. We
have closed the identified gaps. Consequently, our regulations
extend beyond the locally applicable legal requirements. In
addition, based on our analyses, in the reporting year Daimler
did not have any cases of child or forced labor, violations against
the right to collective bargaining or freedom of association.
Indigenous peoples are not affected by the corporate activities at
our production locations under review.
From HRCA to the “Daimler Human Rights Respect System.”
Based on the experience gained from the compliance assessments, which will be completed by the end of 2015, we began to
develop a concept for a systematic and continuous “Daimler
Human Rights Respect System” during the reporting year that is
to replace the Human Rights Compliance Assessments starting
in 2016. The concept for this system comprises four key process
steps:
1. Risk identification: The following constituent parameters are
decisive for the identification of potential human rights risks,
among others: the general human rights situation in defined
countries with operating Daimler units, the business model of
these units, and the possibility of exercising influence.
2. Program management: To enable systematic management
of potential human rights risks for Daimler, a variety of different measures is already available or will still be developed as
part of our program management.
3. Monitoring: A monitoring system oriented primarily to highrisk units supports the regulatory process of Daimler’s
human rights approach. The adequacy and effectiveness of
the system can be reviewed and improved on a continuous
basis.
4. Reporting: The fourth process step of the “Daimler Human
Rights Respect System” calls for extensive regular reporting
aimed at providing information on critical issues and fulfillment of external reporting requirements.

44

Because the development of this concept could not draw upon
existing systems, the concept was developed in a cross-functional process. In addition, feasibility and requirements analyses
were carried out and key issues were discussed with external
stakeholders at the “Daimler Sustainability Dialogue” 2014,
whose recommendations we are gradually integrating.
“Daimler Sustainability Dialogue” 2014: p. 40

Training programs. We also address human rights issues in our
employee training programs, and with more intensive advanced
training provided for selected target groups (e.g. internal and
external security staff).
Investigating suspicious behavior: In the event of suspected
human rights violations our whistleblower system BPO is available internally and externally to provide “access to remedial
action” also in line with the third pillar of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. An established complaints
management process is also established with respect to our
suppliers via the World Employment Committee.
BPO whistleblower system: p. 45

Human rights and suppliers. Human rights are an integral part
of the Supplier Sustainability Standards and the contract terms
for direct Daimler suppliers. We rely on appropriate communication and training measures to enable addressing human rights
in the highly complex supplier chain, on which we have only an
indirect influence. We examine the observance of sustainability
standards by our suppliers in a multi-step process on the basis
of a risk analysis, that we carry out by country and merchandise
category.
Suppliers: pp. 64 f.

Compliance
Compliance is an indispensable element of the integrity culture
at Daimler. Compliance with all relevant laws, voluntary commitments, and internal regulations and acting in accordance with
ethical principles is a matter of course for us. Our top priority is
to comply with all anti-corruption legislation, as well as to protect
and promote fair competition. We have codified this in our
Integrity Code. We strive to sustainably anchor integrity and compliance as integral parts in our value chain.
Compliance Management System (CMS) as a foundation.
Our CMS is aligned to national and international standards, and
supports us in ensuring compliant behavior in our daily business. We review the effectiveness of the system on a continuous
basis, and adapt it in line with worldwide developments, changed
risks, and new legal requirements. We thus continuously improve
its efficiency and effectiveness. In 2014, we developed new
processes for reviewing and observing international sanctions,
and expanded the measures for the prevention of money laundering in the trade with goods and services as well as the measures for the prevention of financing terrorism.

Ethical responsibility

Prevention of money laundering and financing terrorism.
With a view to the further improvement of the Group-wide prevention of money laundering in the trade with goods and services, we have examined the increasing requirements in various
countries and have initiated more extensive measures. In this
context, the “Anti-Money Laundering Policy” entered into effect
on August 1, 2014.This policy lays the foundation for Group-wide
compliance with the respective national legislations. A center of
competence supports the Chief Compliance Officer in his function as the anti-money laundering officer of Daimler AG for the
central management, consulting, and coordination of money
laundering prevention measures in the goods trade.
Review of sanction lists. Restrictions in the movement of
capital and goods are instruments of international policy at both
international and European levels. Daimler AG takes appropriate
measures to ensure that the legal sanctions specified by the
legislator are observed. With a view to effective and efficient
implementation, we have introduced a worldwide system-based
standard process for implementation of these requirements,
which provides for an implementation phase.

Our whistleblower system receives reports of irregular conduct
from employees and external parties worldwide around the
clock, through different reporting channels, as well as anonymously — to the extent permitted under local law. A prerequisite
for the acceptance of the system is that it is designed fairly, takes
into consideration the principle of proportionality, and gives
equal protection to whistleblowers and affected parties. We
codified these criteria in a globally applicable corporate policy
in 2013. In addition, in February 2012, we created the neutral
mediator function in Germany, which is staffed by an independent attorney. The mediator also receives reports of rule violations, and is obligated to maintain confidentiality by the oath of
professional secrecy. Of the 59 BPO cases, which were closed
“with merit” in 2014, six were in the category of “Bribery.” The
company responded with appropriate measures.
Information on criminal proceedings against Daimler AG is provided in the Annual Report for the 2014 reporting year. Proceedings against natural persons are generally not disclosed since
convictions or resolutions under criminal law are not communicated to Daimler AG.
Proceedings against Daimler AG: AR 2014, notes: pp. 247f.

Analysis of compliance risks. In 2014, we again performed a
systematic risk analysis of all business units which included
assessments in accordance with qualitative as well as quantitative indicators — such as the respective business model, the relevant environmental factors and the type of contractual relationships. The results of this analysis provide the basis for the risk
controlling. Together with the business units we define measures
for risk minimization with a key focus of our activities on sales
companies in high-risk countries. The responsibility for implementing these measures and the supervisory duty lie with the
respective members of management, who work closely together
with the Group Compliance unit.

Collaboration with our business partners. Ethical conduct
and compliance with regulations is an essential prerequisite for
trusted collaboration with our business partners. In selecting
our direct business partners, we make sure that they comply with
the law and follow ethical principles. Depending on the risks we
provide our business partners with target group-oriented trainings measures. In addition, we have formulated our expectations
in the brochure “Ethical Business. Our shared responsibility.” If
business partners fail to observe our standards, we retain the
right to terminate the collaboration.
Our training programs: Online 205
Brochure “Ethical Business. Our shared responsibility.”: Online 206

Reinforcing the worldwide structures. Our Compliance organization is divisionally oriented. This structure has proven itself
and enables the effective support and advisory services to the
business divisions by a divisional or regional Compliance officer,
respectively. Moreover, local compliance partners around the
world ensure that our standards are observed. We safeguard the
independence of the divisional and regional officers from the
business divisions through their direct reporting line to the Chief
Compliance Officer, who in turn reports directly to the Board of
Management member for Integrity and Legal Affairs as well as to
the Chairman of the Supervisory Board.
We provide specific qualification training, which supports the
Compliance staff in dealing with the frequently changing legal
and regulatory situation. In addition, all new Compliance employees receive comprehensive introductory training in a practical
Compliance seminar.

Supplier Sustainability Standards: p. 64

Specialist dialog beyond company limits. We are frequently
asked to share our experiences in the area of compliance. That is
why we have decided to offer a practical seminar on compliance
with the Daimler Compliance Academy. The first seminar was
held in April 2014 in Germany. While previous external training
programs were directed only at business partners and suppliers,
for the first time, with the Academy we have now organized a
seminar for compliance professionals from all industries. Another goal of the seminar is to create a platform for the exchange of
experiences about compliance trends and challenges.
Topic “Integrity and compliance”: p. 21

Whistleblower system. We use the Business Practices Office
(BPO) as a valuable source of information on potential risks and
specific violations of the rules. That is why it is an important
instrument of good corporate governance that also serves to
avert damage from our company.

Ethical responsibility

Antitrust law
Daimler has a Group-wide Antitrust Compliance Program oriented around national and international standards. The program
establishes a binding, globally valid Daimler standard that
defines the approach to be taken in the internal assessment of
issues related to competition law. Our standards are as strict as
those of the European antitrust authorities and courts, and thus
ensure a consistent level of compliance advice in all countries.
Web-based training and more detailed classroom training sessions on antitrust law are aimed at our managers and employees
in selected functions. Monitoring measures at our corporate
units supplement our antitrust-related risk analysis and support
us in the continuous improvement of the effectiveness of our
Antitrust Compliance Program and the adjustments to worldwide
developments, changed risks, and new legal requirements.
Antitrust proceedings against Daimler AG: AR 2014, notes: p. 247

Data protection
With the Data Protection Policy, we have entered into a commitment to maintain high data protection standards around the
world. The Data Protection Policy meets the requirements of the
European Union’s Data Protection Directive, and establishes
principles for ensuring and maintaining a corresponding data
protection level for all companies of Daimler AG.
Organization and responsibility. The Chief Officer Corporate
Data Protection works with the support of local data protection
coordinators toward ensuring compliance with the valid data
protection laws and internal standards in the Daimler Group. He
advises on and initiates communication and training measures,
and performs controls and audits for compliance with the data
protection laws and Daimler’s Data Protection Policy. This also
includes complaints management and the fulfillment of reporting
requirements.
Training programs. The range of training and informational
measures for employees and managers is continuously optimized
and expanded. In addition to web-based training, classroom
training, and target group-specific information documents, the
topic of data protection is also addressed in the company’s internal media.
Incidents. In the reporting year, there were no significant data
protection violations and no fines were imposed. The number of
complaints received by Corporate Data Protection is slightly
down again compared with the previous year. In five cases investigations by supervisory authorities due to customer complaints
were performed and concluded with satisfactory results.

Privacy by design. The networking of the vehicle is one of the
focuses of innovation in the automotive industry. At the same
time, connectivity with the Internet and driver support through
new assistance systems are presenting new challenges for data
protection and information security. That is why the design of
data protection concepts for the connected vehicle (privacy by
design) was a key area of emphasis in the activities of the Chief
Officer Corporate Data Protection in 2014.
Principles for data protection in connected vehicles. The
two US associations Auto Alliance and Global Automakers have
adopted the joint data protection principles “Consumer Privacy
Protection Principles for Vehicle Technologies and Services”
with the active involvement of Daimler AG. In addition, Daimler
AG collaborated actively with the German Association of the
Automotive Industry in the development of principles of data
protection in the connected vehicle, which define requirements
for a comprehensive, integral concept for data processing and
data protection in connected vehicles.

Product responsibility

Product responsibility.
For us, product responsibility requires a combination of three things: the greatest possible
customer benefit, the highest safety standards, and maximum eco-friendliness and efficiency.
To achieve this goal, we depend on environmentally sound product development and innovative
concepts. This extends from trailblazing vehicle and powertrain technologies, lightweight
construction. The use of natural materials, and remanufacturing of components to sophisticated
assistance systems that can prevent accidents.

In the area of environmental compatibility we observe the Daimler
Environmental and Energy Guidelines. The second guideline is as
follows: We develop products that are particularly environmentally
friendly and energy-efficient in their market segments. Therefore,
our mission is: to fulfill demanding environmental standards and
deal sparingly with natural resources. Our measures for environmentally compatible and energy-efficient product design take
into account the entire product life cycle — spanning development, production and product use, as well as disposal and recycling.
Environmental and Energy Guidelines: Online 301

why continuous improvements in environmental compatibility
are a major requirement in the creation of the product performance specifications. Our DfE experts are involved in all stages
of vehicle development as a cross-divisional team.
In addition, we systematically integrate the product design into
our environment and quality management systems according
to ISO 14001 and ISO 9001. Since 2012, Mercedes-Benz has
been in full compliance with the relevant ISO 14006 standard.
In addition, Mercedes-Benz has also been certified according to
ISO TR 14062, the standard for environmentally oriented product development, since 2005.

Environmentally responsible product development
A vehicle’s environmental impact is largely decided in the first
stages of development. By integrating environmentally responsible product development (Design for Environment, DfE) at an
early stage of the development processes, it is possible to minimize the impact on the environment more efficiently. That is

Comprehensive life cycle assessment. Evaluating the environmental compatibility of a vehicle requires an analysis of the
emissions and use of resources throughout the entire life cycle.
The standardized tool for this is the ecological assessment,
which examines all environmental effects, from the extraction

weight, followed by the chassis at 25 percent, the comfort and
safety equipment at 20 percent, and the engine and transmission
at 20 percent. Thus, the most effective approach is to focus on
the vehicle body.

Less weight, more recyclates, more natural materials. Our
goal is to make our vehicles lighter while continuing to reduce
the environmental effects of materials used in their production.
For this, we are using new lightweight materials and components,
on the one hand. On the other hand, we are increasingly using
renewable materials and recycling materials.

Lightweight-construction champion C-Class. The innovative
aluminum hybrid body of the new C-Class is about 70 kilograms
lighter than a traditional body shell made of steel. Overall, it was
possible to reduce the weight of the vehicle by as much as 100
kilograms compared with the predecessor model. This pays off:
The lightweight construction of the new C-Class contributes to a
reduction in fuel consumption by up to 20 percent. The aluminum
content of the body shell has been increased from less than 10
percent in the successful predecessor to nearly 50 percent in the
present model.

Intelligent lightweight construction can further reduce vehicle weight without sacrificing safety and comfort. In this context,
the selection of materials, as well as the component design and
manufacturing technology also play an important role: Not every
material is suitable for every component. At 35 percent, the
vehicle body accounts for the biggest share of total vehicle

Materials in the new C-Class. Steel and ferrous materials
account for almost half the vehicle weight (46.9 percent) of the

new C-Class. Alloys make up the second largest group with 22
percent, followed by polymers at 20.2 percent. The percentage
of other materials — primarily glass — and non-ferrous metals is
around 6 percent. However, the main differences are observed
in the steel and alloys of the new C-Class, which is at around
10 percent lower than the predecessor model for steels and
about 9 percent higher for alloys and 1 percent higher for polymers. This is attributable primarily to the lightweight design
improvements in the body and axles.
Increased use of recycled materials. The European End of Life
Vehicle Directive 2000/53/EG specifies utilization quotas for
passenger cars and vans with a gross vehicle weight of up to
3.5 tons. In addition, it also requires manufacturers to use more
recycled materials during vehicle production in order to strengthen the markets for recycled materials. That is why the performance specifications for the new Mercedes-Benz models prescribe
continuous increases in the amounts of recycled materials to
be used in car models — as also specified in the targets program.

13
The environmental profile of the new C-Class

Primary energy requirement. Over the entire life cycle — from the
manufacturing process to the use and recycling — the new C-Class
has a primary energy consumption of 521 gigajoules, or 170 gigajoules
(25 percent) less than the predecessor model, a savings that corresponds to the energy content of around 5,300 liters of gasoline.
CO2 emissions. The environmental input of the new C-Class is around
35 tons of CO2. Over the entire life cycle and based on a total driving
distance of 200,000 km, the model generates 28 percent (13 tons)
fewer CO2 emissions than its predecessor did at its market entry in
2007. The new model emits around 23 tons of CO2 in driving operation.
Thus driving is the determining factor for CO2 emissions as well as for
the primary energy consumption.
The values, calculated for the C-Class Diesel C 220 BlueTEC, are as
follows: CO2 environmental input over the entire life cycle 30 t, or 11 t
of CO2 (minus 26 percent) less than its predecessor.

CO2 emissions of the new C-Class compared to predecessor model

Currently, 52 components with a total weight of 49.3 kilograms
are approved for manufacture with recycled plastics for the new
C-Class. This corresponds to 3.7 percent of the total vehicle
weight or a good 29 percent of all thermoplastic materials used
in the vehicle. In the predecessor model this figure was only
2.8 percent.

More renewable raw materials. Renewable materials offer
many advantages:
– In contrast to fiberglass, the use of natural fibers generally
leads to a reduction in a component’s weight due to their
lower density.
– They can be processed with conventional technologies.
– The resulting products are generally easily recyclable.
– In energy recovery their CO2 effect is almost neutral because
only as much CO2 is released as was absorbed by the plant
during its growth.
– They contribute to the reduced consumption of fossil
resources.
Natural materials in the new C-Class. Renewable materials
used in the production of 76 components of the new C-Class
have a combined weight of 26.3 kilograms. Thus, the total weight
of the components manufactured with the natural materials has
increased by 55 percent compared to the predecessor model.

Total emissions. The new C-Class has clear also advantages in other
emission categories as well over the entire life cycle. This particularly
applies to NOX emissions, which have been reduced by 6 percent
in the gasoline-powered model and by as much as 45 percent in the
diesel-powered model (only calculated values).

Top scores in aerodynamics. With a Cd value of 0.24, the new
C220 BlueTEC Blue Efficiency Edition sets a new standard in
the medium-size category. On the road this yields measurable
ecological and economic benefits, because good aerodynamics
make a decisive contribution to lowering fuel consumption and
CO2 levels with savings of 1 gram of CO2 per kilometer in the
NEDC driving cycle for each reduction of the Cd value by 0.01
points. Measured in terms of average real consumption, the
reduction amounts to as much as 2 grams of CO2 less per kilometer. Sophisticated aerodynamics pay off even more impressively in highway driving, where a 0.01 point improvement in
the Cd value yields a reduction of more than 4 grams in the CO2
emissions per kilometer — which gives Daimler good reasons
for attaching great value to excellent aerodynamics.

Innovative vehicle and powertrain technologies
Our goal is to ensure mobility for future generations as well.
That is why we strive to offer our customers safe, efficient, and
low-emission vehicles vehicles and services. Our vision is to
achieve a drive system mix that is tailored to the market requirements. The main focus points of our development: particularly
fuel-efficient, and environmentally compatible powertrain technologies in all our automotive divisions are embraced in our initiative “The path to emission-free mobility”:
– Further development of our vehicles with state-of-the-art
combustion engines with the goal of achieving significant
reductions in consumption and emissions.
– Further efficiency increase through hybridization.
– Electric vehicles with battery and fuel cell drive.

B-Class Electric Drive. With the new B-Class Electric Drive,
which first came on the market in the U.S. followed by Europe
in November 2014, we are offering an all-electric vehicle model
from Mercedes-Benz for the first time. The B-Class Electric Drive
has a range of around 200 kilometers and reaches an electronically limited top speed of 160 km/h. Over the entire life cycle —
production, use over 160,000 kilometers and recycling — the BClass Electric Drive generates 64 percent fewer CO2 emissions
than the comparable gasoline-powered model B 180. An externally validated environmental certificate presents in detail the
benefits and differences compared with the conventional reference vehicle.

DENZA — electromobility for China. In China, we have developed an electrically powered city car in the framework of a joint
venture with our Chinese partner BYD, which we brought on the
market in 2014. With a driving range of up to 300 kilometers,
DENZA is tailored to the special requirements of the Chinese
market. In addition to enabling locally emission-free driving, the
five-seater vehicle is also very attractive because of a variety
of special benefits. Thus, for example, government agencies
grant high subsidies for locally developed and manufactured
electric vehicles, and these vehicles are exempt from the general
registration restrictions in metropolitan centers such as Beijing
and Shanghai.

high demand, we also intend to expand the charging infrastructure at other locations soon.
In addition, as part of the initiative Quick Charging for Corridors
and Metropolitan Areas (SLAM), together with partners from the
industry and research we are examining business models for the
operation of quick-charging stations in metropolitan areas and
along the connecting traffic corridors. More than 600 new charging stations complying with EU regulations and processes for
their need-based positioning are to be realized with a steady
focus on providing a preferably uniform and convenient access
and invoicing system.
Electric vehicles with fuel cell drive are also suitable for long
driving distances due to their great range and quick refueling.
The electricity is generated in the vehicle itself from hydrogen,
which is fueled as in a traditional vehicle. Emission-free driving
will only become attractive to customers for longer distances if
sufficient fueling stations become available. That is why Daimler
is promoting the development of a comprehensive hydrogen
infrastructure jointly with partners from politics and the energy
sector. That fuel-cell vehicles can be built in series production
was demonstrated in 2014 by a B-Class F-CELL from the current
fuel-cell fleet of Mercedes-Benz. The vehicle set an endurance
record of 300,000 kilometers driven under normal everyday conditions.

H2 Mobility. In the autumn of 2013, we already made concrete
plans for a nationwide network of H2 filling stations as part of
the “Initiative H2 Mobility,” which envisages around 400 public
hydrogen fueling stations by 2023. The goal is to offer an H2 fueling station for every 90 highway kilometers between urban centers. Furthermore, according to the planning, at least ten hydrogen filling stations will be available in each metropolitan region
starting in 2023. The total investment requirement for the project will come to €350 million.

Fuel consumption and CO2 emissions
The largest share of primary energy consumption and CO2 emissions over the life cycle of a vehicle is attributable to the usage
phase. In the case of a passenger car with a combustion engine it
is about 80 percent. The remaining 20 percent is consumed
almost entirely during the manufacturing process. Vehicles with
alternative drive systems have fewer CO2 emissions during the
usage phase. However, the primary energy consumption of these
vehicles generally increases during production because of the
energy needed to manufacture certain components such as batteries and electric motors.

CO2 emissions of our vans. An EU Directive on the CO2 emissions of vans with a total weight of up to 2,585 kilograms entered
into force in 2011. According to the regulation, starting in 2014,
the requirement is to comply with a level of 175 g CO2/km which
is applicable in stages and has to be met to a 100 percent by
2017. As of 2020 the level drops to 147 g CO2/km. As in the case
of passenger cars, the vehicle weight must also be taken into
account: if the average weight of the fleet of a given manufacturer is above that of all vans sold in the market, the CO2 fleet level
to be achieved is also increased accordingly. Accordingly,
Mercedes-Benz vans must comply with a level of 210 g CO2/km
starting in 2014. At 199 g CO2/km in 2014, the Mercedes-Benz
vans fleet achieved an improvement by a good 3 percent compared with the previous year.This equals a more than 11 percent
decrease compared with the reference year 2011; we have thus
exceeded the goal we set for ourselves and fulfills the EU van
fleet regulation already in the very first year to a 100 percent.

Daimler is working intensively to further reduce emissions from
all phases of the product life cycle. Through the optimization of
our BlueEFFICIENCY measures and the market launch of the new
models we were able to achieve another significant reduction in
the CO2 emissions of our new vehicle fleet in 2014.
In the reporting year, the average CO2 emissions of the total fleet
of Mercedes-Benz Cars in Europe were at 129 grams per kilometer. We have thus achieved a reduction by more than 19 percent
in the last five years. In 2014, we achieved another improvement
by an additional 4 percent. Our goal is to lower the CO2 emissions
of our new-vehicle fleet in Europe to 125 grams per kilometer by
the year 2016. In the EU, M1 vehicles must meet a fleet target of
95 grams of CO2 per kilometer beginning in 2020. In consideration of the expected average vehicle weight, this leads to a target
of around 100 grams of CO2 per kilometer for Daimler.

Higher fuel efficiency for passenger cars and vans. With
the extremely economical BlueEFFICIENCY technology package
we are reducing the consumption and CO2 emissions of our
Mercedes-Benz cars and vans by up to 32 percent in individual
models compared with the predecessor vehicles. This is aided by
optimization measures in the powertrain area, energy management, aerodynamics and weight reduction through lightweight
construction and tires with optimized rolling resistance, as well
as by driver information for adopting an energy-saving driving
style.
Legendary power, increased efficiency. In our semi-trailer
tractors (class 8) we are using highly efficient powertrain components and sophisticated aerodynamics in order to reduce fuel
consumption and CO2 emissions. We have also done this in our
new Western Star 5700XE truck. The hood and chassis and cabin
paneling of the truck have a new aerodynamic design which
significantly reduces drag. This alone reduces fuel consumption
by more than 7 percent. In addition, the truck comes with a new
integrated Detroit Diesel powertrain with a slow-speed DD15
engine, and the Detroit DT12 direct transmission and a particularly fuel-saving final drive ratio. The individual measures and,
most of all, the fine-tuned overall package, yield a bottom-line
decrease in consumption of nearly 15 percent compared with the
reference vehicle (Western Star 4900SB with fuel efficiency
package).
Economical SuperTruck. With further advanced technologies
Daimler has successfully implemented the goals of a research

compared with the 2009 reference vehicle in two on-road highway tests.

More efficient with high-tech steel pistons. Since the autumn
of 2014, we have been using the new high-tech pistons made of
steel in the V6 diesel engine of the Mercedes-Benz E 350
BlueTEC — a world premiere in a production passenger car.
Because steel conducts less heat than aluminum, higher temperatures are generated in the combustion chamber cavity of the
steel piston, which leads to a shorter combustion time and
improved combustion, and additionally enables reducing the piston friction. As a result, the engine uses about 3 percent less
fuel. In addition, the greater strength of steel allows a particularly
compact design. In this way, despite the significantly higher
material density, the steel piston weighs about as much as an
aluminum piston. The lower piston height additionally yields
potential for new engine concepts with an even lower weight and
installation space.

Excellent engine compartment encapsulation. Insulating
partition walls in the engine compartment and a radiator shutter
that is closed when the vehicle is not moving ensure that the
heat in the Mercedes-Benz S 300 BlueTEC HYBRID is retained
where it is generated: in the engine compartment. The “ECO
Thermo Cover” ensures that the vehicle does not cool off when it
sits for a longer time. The higher temperatures reduce engine
friction when the vehicle is restarted. This leads to a minimization
of cold-start losses and lower CO2 emissions. According to
our research, this makes annual average fuel savings of up to
1.5 liters per tank filling possible.

Fleet values in the US. In the US, fleet values are regulated by
two co-regulating standards for reduction of greenhouse gases in
vehicle fleets: the Greenhouse Gas Standards (GHG) and the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards (CAFE). The CAFE fleet
value for each model year is determined on the basis of the number of vehicles sold and their respective fuel economy figures.
For every 0.1 mile per gallon below the specified limit, the manufacturer is required to pay a fine to the government of US$5.50
per vehicle sold. In the 2014 model year the introduction of vehicles like the CLA 250 contributed to the increase of our CAFE
fleet figure.

Fleet value in China. In China, there are different fuel economy
requirements for domestically produced and imported passenger
cars. At the same time a differentiation between sixteen weight
classes is also made. The fleet fuel economy target relative to
the weight of Daimler’s “domestic” fleet was 9.3 liters/100 km,
and the actual value achieved in 2014 was 8.4 liters/100 km.
The target for the import fleet was 9.6 liters/100 km, and 8.3

Ahead of schedule on emissions. All new model-certified
Mercedes-Benz passenger cars are in compliance with the limits
of the Euro 6 European emissions standards, which have been in
effect since September 2014. This has been true for many models for several years. As early as in 2011, Mercedes-Benz vehicles
accounted for half of all Euro 6 passenger car registrations in
Germany and for as much as 80 percent in 2012.
Thanks to innovative technology, our direct-injection engines are
also below the stringent particulate matter limit of the second
Euro 6 stage, which becomes effect in 2017 and reduces the
number of particulates by another 90 percent compared to the
first stage. All diesel-powered vehicles and 50 of 69 gasolinepowered direct injection Mercedes-Benz Euro 6 models were
already in compliance with the tightened limit of 6 x 1011 particles in mid-2014.
Comprehensive Euro VI range. In the commercial vehicles
area, Mercedes-Benz was the first manufacturer to offer its
complete product range certified to Euro VI standards — from the
Actros long-distance truck to the special-purpose vehicles
Mercedes-Benz Unimog and Econic. The light is also green in the
area of buses: all model series of the Mercedes-Benz and Setra
brands are available certified to Euro 6 standards today.

Noise
We have significantly reduced the noise emissions of our passenger cars, trucks, and buses in recent years through a series of
improvements. Our main concern at present is to find satisfactory solutions for the conflicting objectives we repeatedly face in
the area of noise reduction. Especially in commercial vehicles
there are technical areas in which reducing noise and lowering
fuel consumption are at odds. Thus, for example, an encapsulation of the powertrain dampens the engine noise. At the same
time, however, it requires a stronger cooling system, which raises
the fuel consumption. The additional fuel consumption can be
countered with higher injection pressures, which in turn lead to
a harsher combustion noise.

Conservation of resources
Our business naturally requires great quantities of materials.
Therefore, one of the focal points of our development tasks is to
keep the requirement for natural resources as low as possible.
In particular, we strive to limit the use of raw materials that are
only available in limited quantities and are frequently associated
with a great ecological burden, in the early stages of development. In addition to the economical use of resources, the reconditioning of components and the re- cycling of used materials
play an important role.
Consistently high recyclability. During vehicle development
we also prepare a recycling concept, in which all components
and materials are examined with a view to their suitability for
the various stages of the recycling process. As a result, all
Mercedes-Benz models are 85 percent recyclable and 95 percent recoverable.
The key aspects of our activities in this area are:
– The resale of tested and certified used parts through the
Mercedes-Benz Used Parts Center (GTC)

– The remanufacturing of used parts
– The workshop waste disposal system MeRSy Recycling
Management.

Recycling of electromobility components. The research project Motor Recycling (MoRe), which is supported by the Federal
Ministry for Education and Research, is dedicated to the question
of how components and valuable materials from electric powertrains can be recycled and reused. Daimler is a part of the consortium from industry and research, which is examining the
entire electro-automotive value chain as part of MoRe — from
the design and production of engines to reuse in the vehicle. In
this context, various aspects of the recycling of engines are analyzed:
– Removal of magnets from the old engines
– Repair and subsequent reuse of electric motors or their
components
– Recycling of magnet materials and rare earth metals.

Mobility concepts and services
Transport infrastructure and transport systems frequently operate at their limits, especially in urban areas. That is why Daimler
has developed a range of pioneering mobility concepts — from
the car sharing provider car2go and the mobility platform moovel
to the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) bus system.
Topic “Transportation concepts“: pp. 22 f.

Effects on health and safety
Our safety and zero-emission driving strategies are aimed at
ensuring maximum safety for drivers, passengers, and all other
road users, and the prevention of emissions and noise.
Upon delivery, our products and services must satisfy the contractual criteria for quality and active and passive safety and
must be ready for use in accordance with their intended purpose.
That is why we work intensively on eliminating errors to the greatest possible extent as early as in the development and design
stage. Our safety obligations also apply during production and
sales as well as after the handover of the vehicles. The Daimler
“Product Safety” policy regulates the related requirements,
tasks, activities, and responsibilities. With the help of our worldwide product monitoring system, we can detect potential risks
at an early stage. The processes and procedures for suitable
countermeasures such as warnings, customer service measures,
etc. are defined.
Seal of quality confirms allergy-friendly features. Good air
quality in the vehicle interior and anti-allergen surfaces contribute to the passengers’ safety and well-being. We ensure that

Top fit in the truck. Professional drivers are exposed to maximum stress. In its research project TopFit Truck, Mercedes-Benz
Trucks places the main focus on the driver. The goal is to make
the job more attractive and thus to counteract the looming shortage of drivers.

Total visibility in the blind spot as well. Collisions when turning are very frequent and generally have serious consequences.
This particularly applies to accidents with trucks and unprotected
traffic participants like pedestrians or bicyclists. Blind Spot
Assist from Mercedes-Benz helps to prevent such collisions.
It gives truck drivers reliable warnings of dangers when turning
in situations with limited visibility. Institutions like the German
Insurance Association (GDV) assume that Blind Spot Assist could
help prevent half of all accidents between trucks and pedestrians
or bicyclists. The number of associated deaths could be reduced
by nearly a third.

Vehicle safety
One of our key obligations is to ensure the safety of our customers and all other road users. Mercedes-Benz experts have
been conducting in-house accident research on critical traffic
situations and real accidents with Mercedes-Benz vehicles since
1969. That is why our comprehensive “Integral Safety” concept
is consistently reconciled with real traffic and accident data.
The concept is focused on the synergy between active and passive safety.
Top scores in the Euro NCAP rating. Three Mercedes-Benz
models completed the safety tests of the European New Car
Assessment Program (NCAP) with top scores: the C-Class sedan,
the GLA, and the V-Class. All three models received top scores
for occupant and child safety, pedestrian protection, and the
safety support through assistance systems in the tests, which
had been expanded and intensified compared with the previous
year. In addition to the good rating, the Mercedes-Benz C-Class
received the Euro NCAP Advanced Reward for two safety systems: the drowsiness detection ATTENTION ASSIST and the
anticipatory occupant protection system PRE-SAFE®.

Training programs for greater safety. The EU Directive
2003/59 obligates professional drivers in goods and passenger
transport to regularly educate themselves on safety issues. In
2008, Mercedes-Benz was the first truck manufacturer in Germany to offer a government-certified safety training program.
Since then we have trained more than 55,000 drivers, and driver
training has meanwhile become an integral part of MercedesBenz’s training programs.

Customers
Culture of customer orientation — customer dedication. We
sell our products and services in nearly all countries of the world.
That is why we attach great importance to our ability to address
in detail the partly very different wishes of our customers in
every market. To this end, since 2013 we have been aligning and
organizationally reinforcing our corporate structures to our five
business divisions even more strongly. The corporate departments are also better aligned to the market requirements from
the business divisions. For us, customer dedication is not a purely organizational measure but one with which we associate the
goal of reinforcing the customer orientation culture throughout
our entire company.

Safety awards for the E-Class and M-Class. In extensive tests,
the US Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) performs
an annual evaluation of the active and passive safety of current
vehicle models. In 2014, the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and M-Class
ranked among the best with top scores in the tests and received
a “TOP SAFETY PICK+” distinction.

Accident prevention systems. The effectiveness of accident
prevention systems has been repeatedly demonstrated in recent
years. A great number of such systems ensure maximum safety

Safer through the intersection. The new Brake Assist BAS
PLUS with Cross-Traffic Assist helps avoid rear-end collisions and
collisions with crossing traffic at intersections. With the help of
a radar sensor system and a state-of-the-art stereo camera the
system can recognize dangerous situations. In the event of danger, it prompts the driver to apply the brakes through visual and
audible signals. If the driver does not apply the brakes strongly
enough, BAS PLUS automatically increases the braking pressure,
including an emergency stop, if necessary. The system is active
in the speed range to approx. 70 km/h.

Improving customer satisfaction. All of our business units
have established quality management systems for the continuous monitoring and improvement of customer satisfaction. Since
2006, we have been implementing the program “CSI No. 1 —
Delightful Customer Care” on a sustainable basis. The program
has a worldwide orientation and is aimed at making us Number 1
in customer service. Country-specific CSI action plans are
agreed and implemented on the basis of international benchmark
studies, internal data surveys, and customer surveys. Processes
and behavior patterns in all sales stages and at all hierarchical
levels are to be continuously and sustainably developed to
ensure maximum customer orientation. Finding the right balance
of rational and emotional elements is decisive for achieving the
highest possible acceptance among all target groups. The measures include training courses, dealer consulting and coaching,
and process improvements, as well as the integration of key figures relevant for customer satisfaction in the monetary control
instruments in Sales and Marketing and in Service.

Product responsibility

Mercedes-Benz Cars has become firmly established at the top of
many rankings for years. Customer satisfaction at MercedesBenz Trucks has also been visibly improved since the introduction
of CSI No. 1 in 2012. Accordingly, the Spanish and German national companies were ranked No. 1 in the industry benchmark
in the area of sales; the French and Italian markets moved up to
No. 2. In the area of workshop service, Germany and Spain also
moved up from third place to being No. 1. It is planned to expand
the CSI program to as many as 11 truck markets by the end of
2015.

Sustainability issues are increasingly taken into account in brand
and product communications. For example, Mercedes-Benz’s
BlueEFFICIENCY systems include a range of innovative technologies that enable a marked reduction in fuel consumption and
emissions. The topic of sustainable mobility is also becoming
increasingly prominent at motor shows. For example, in September 2014, the new S 500 Plug-In Hybrid and the new B-Class Electric Drive were among the product highlights at the International
Motor Show (IAA) in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

In the course of the increased alignment of our corporate organization to the business divisions we have introduced a divisional
key account system at Daimler Financial Services, which enables
us to offer financial services that are customized to an even
greater extent for our customers.

Focus on individual wishes — for people with disabilities as
well. For us, individual customer orientation means taking the
needs and interests of our customers seriously. That is why no
two vehicles rolling off the lines in our plants are exactly the
same. The special Mercedes-Benz program “Ex-Factory Driving
Aids,” which is offered in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and
Luxembourg today, is directed at people with physical disabilities. The program offers steering and operating aids such as
hand-operated gas and brake pedals, as well as vehicle entry aids
such as hydraulic lifts for passengers. Mercedes-Benz currently
operates 23 “More Mobility Centers,” where specially trained
sales staff are glad to advise and assist customers. We are continuously expanding this network of service centers. In Germany,
Mercedes-Benz also offers disabled people special terms for
almost all passenger car model series. In 2012, Mercedes-Benz
developed the “Educated Comfort” demonstration vehicle,
adapted to the special needs of older drivers with adapted
ingress and egress and improved vehicle loading possibilities. In
the next step, the vehicles will be produced in small series for the
market entry.

Information and advertising. All our advertising, sales promotion, and sponsorship campaigns are subject to an in-house audit
procedure to ensure that they are in compliance with the applicable laws and Daimler’s standards and codes of conduct. We also
observe industry principles such as the European advertising
sector’s Code of Ethics. As a matter of principle we avoid the use
of violent, discriminatory, sexual, or religious elements in our
advertising. Respect for foreign cultural norms and religious
beliefs is a particularly important concern in our international
campaigns.

Daimler AG is intensively involved in consumer protection issues
and has established systematic safeguards in this area. All
Daimler products are subject to top quality and safety requirements throughout their entire life cycle. In this context, the
quality management systems used in the individual units play an
important role. Requirements for avoidance of product flaws
and preventive measures for the protection of customers are
additionally defined in the product safety policy of Daimler AG.
These requirements are monitored through periodic audits.
We are obligated to instruct users of our products about their
use and possible risks associated with it, to warn against dangers
and to label our products. These requirements are also described
in our product safety policy. In the context of our product responsibility we also fulfill the requirements according to REACH and
CLP in Europe.
We abstain from publishing a detailed report of possible violations. Due to the absence of any legal obligations or industrywide standards, comparability with the competitors would not
be ensured in our view.
Product information for our customers. Our service booklets
and operating instructions tell customers how to save fuel and
use their vehicles in a safe and responsible manner. We provide
additional information online. For example, the Mercedes-Benz
website provides interactive owner’s manuals and detailed
service information for our customers. The Mercedes-Benz
Service app, which includes numerous features for mobile use,
can also be downloaded from the website. The Guideline for
Rescue Services is also available online with instructions for
quick rescue of accident victims from Mercedes-Benz vehicles.
Mercedes-Benz Bank. As part of the Daimler Financial Services
division, we are aware of our obligation to our customers. That
is why we attach great importance to ensuring extensive transparency and top quality in all areas of our customer business —
from investment counseling to loan approval and leasing agreements for vehicle purchases. In this process, it goes without
saying that we conduct our activities on the basis of the legal
consumer protection requirements. As a member of the Bankers’
Trade Association we have signed a code of conduct which regulates our dealings with customers relative to granting installment
credits and credit lines. We guarantee that all relevant information on credit and loan agreements will be fully available before
the contract closing, and will be elaborated by us upon request.
We handle customer data with extreme sensitivity and care.

Corporate environmental protection

Corporate environmental protection.
We pursue an integrated approach to corporate environmental protection. That is why we start
with the causes of potential negative environmental effects. We minimize negative effects of our
activities with the help of effective environmental management systems and state-of-the-art
technologies. We promote climate protection, conserve valuable resources, and contribute to the
preservation of a livable environment — at our locations and beyond.

We have formulated our requirements for a comprehensive system of environmental protection in the environmental and energy
guidelines of the Daimler Group. Detailed specifications for the
Group-wide environmental management system are defined in
the Environmental Management Manual. In addition, we have
internal standards for handling hazardous materials, waste management, and the prevention of soil and water contamination.
Our Environmental and Energy Guidelines: Online 401

Organization. On behalf of the Daimler Board of Management,
the Member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG, Group
Research & Mercedes-Benz Cars Development represents the
environmental concerns of the Group. Different organizational
units ensure the central management, networking, and communication of environmental issues:
– The Chief Environmental Officer is mandated by the Board of
Management to coordinate the Group-wide environmental
management activities and to advise the company’s management on environmental issues.
– The Corporate Environmental Protection unit coordinates the
operational requirements of the Group-wide environmental
management function which include analyses of the legal
requirements, definition and advancement of environmental
protection standards, environmental reporting, and production-related environmental protection risk management.
– Regional committees in Europe, Asia, North and South America ensure that local and regional conditions are taken into
account in production-related environmental protection
measures and that the related activities are appropriately
managed in coordination with the Corporate Environmental
Protection unit and the Group’s Chief Environmental Officer.
Training. We regularly organize awareness and training programs for our employees and managers with a focus on the practical applications of operations-related environmental protection and questions concerning environmental responsibility.
We also train our auditors on audits of our environmental management systems of our plants. In addition, our “refresher
courses” on environmental management allow participants to
exchange ideas and experiences.
Control. In order to eliminate or reduce environmental risks in
advance, we regularly audit our locations in accordance with
globally uniform standards. Suppliers must observe our sustainability requirements and are expected to operate with an environmental management system that is certified according to ISO
14001, EMAS or other comparable standards. In addition, our

56

Mercedes-Benz specifications define requirements for the environmental compatibility of our component deliveries. Furthermore,
the Mercedes-Benz contract terms contain requirements concerning materials selection, banned substances, and recycling
requirements, as well as compliance with environmental legislation.
Environmental risk analysis: Online 402
More about sustainability requirements in the supply chain: p. 64

Certification. Our production locations worldwide are certified
in accordance with ISO 14001 and are regularly audited to determine whether they meet the requirements of this environmental
management system. As a result, over 98 percent of all Daimler
employees work within the framework of a certified environmental management system. In addition, almost all German locations
are certified in accordance with the EU Eco Management and
Audit Scheme (EMAS). A total of 18 locations — including our
major plants — already have energy management systems that are
certified in accordance with ISO 50001.

Environmental protection costs. Our investments in environmental protection plant and facilities with integrated environmental protection features amounted to around €108 million in 2014
(previous year: €140 million), whereby integrated environmental
protection features are not clearly separable. Current environmental protection expenditures for personnel, operations, and
waste disposals were at €432 million (previous year: €432 million). Our Group-wide expenditures for development projects
relating to environmental protection, such as alternative drive
systems, state-of-the-art emission control technologies, and efficiency increases in the vehicle, amounted to €2.4 billion (previous year: €2.5 billion).
Principles of data collection. In our recording of environmental
and energy data we take into account all relevant locations which
are majority owned by Daimler AG. Details on the approach and
procedure are provided in the Internet.

Through our high share of in-house production relative to our competitors we are also reflecting a greater proportion of the environmental effects in our carbon footprint. The transmission alone, which
other manufacturers carry as a purchased part that is not taken into
consideration, accounts for around 8 percent of our energy consumption in the area of passenger cars.

introducing new energy-saving production methods, increasing
the efficiency of existing processes, using low-carbon energy
sources, and relying on renewable energy wherever possible.
CO2 emissions. Despite the significantly increased production
output, all of these measures and the mild weather led to a
1.9-percent decline in energy consumption and a 2.6-percent
decrease in CO2 emissions in 2014. The total emissions presented in the chart result from the combustion of fossil fuels and purchases of electricity and district heat from third-party energy
producers.
Climate-friendly energy supply. For the heating of our plants
we use low-carbon natural gas and, where available, district
heating. In many locations, we have highly efficient cogeneration
facilities in use, which are operated by Daimler or by a regional
provider. The concerted expansion of decentralized combined
heat and power (CHP) units is an important pillar of our ecofriendly energy supply system. From 2011 to 2014 we set up
more than 27 CHP modules with a capacity of around 160 MW.
With these modules alone, we can cover around 6 percent of our
electricity and heating requirement under optimized CO2 conditions.

In order to have the appropriate correlation with our environmental data,
we only count the production from plants which are majority-owned by
the Daimler Group.
Since no minority participations in companies or external contract
production are included, the production volume is lower than cited sales
numbers might indicate.

In several locations in Germany, the U.S., and India, we operate
photovoltaic installations on our roofs or provide roof space for
the use of operating companies. More than 65,000 square
meters of roof space are used for CO2-neutral electricity production in this manner.
In addition, we also report the upstream and downstream CO2
emissions for the Mercedes-Benz Cars business unit (scope 3).
For the upstream production phase this amounts to 13.7 million
tons of CO2. For the service life phase (150,000 km) the figure
is 33.3 million tons for the vehicles sold in 2014.

Corporate environmental protection

Saving energy. Our energy projects at all locations are operated
on the basis of exact record-keeping through a dense network
of automatic electricity meters. In line with this, we design our
energy-saving measures in accordance with four points.
1. To avoid unnecessary use of energy during production breaks,
we use intelligent switch-off and stand-by controls.
2. Furthermore, we are dealing with energy waste through
compressed air leaks, heat losses and excessive process
requirements (e.g. temperature specifications). In these
areas, there is reduction potential not only in the production
processes themselves, but also in the building infrastructure
with heating, air conditioning, and ventilation.
3. We achieve the most significant efficiency increases by
replacing old production facilities with modern plant technology and new building construction.
4. The success of an energy project depends, not last, on the
employees’ commitment. That is why we are raising our
employees’ and managers’ awareness of energy issues with
the help of events and communication measures. In addition,
energy-saving suggestions are rewarded within the scope
of the company suggestions system.

Waste and resource management
The recycling and reuse of raw materials, indirect materials, and
supplies in our plants has been a self-evident activity for years.
Exceptional circumstances (see Table 25) caused the recycling
rate to drop to 85 percent in 2014. Our innovative technical
processes and environmentally sound production planning
additionally enable us to avoid waste from the very start. With a
view to meeting our special responsibility as waste producer, we
regularly audit the waste disposal operators for our production
plants in accordance with an established process. Waste exports
into other countries do not take place.
Innovative process minimizes waste volumes: Online 409

25
Waste volumes

Air purification
Solvents (volatile organic compounds or VOCs) in particular are
released during vehicle production. In addition sulfur dioxide
(SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulates are also emitted into the atmosphere. Damaging substances have only been emitted into the ozone layer in negligible
residual amounts since we introduced the almost exclusive use
of refrigerants that are not damaging to the ozone layer. As a
trailblazer in the introduction of largely solvent-free paint systems, we have already achieved a drastic reduction in solvent
emissions over the last decades; in particular at Mercedes-Benz
Cars we are benchmark in the competitive comparison. We are
also unlocking further reduction potential through the use of
state-of-the-art technologies, primarily in the painting of commercial vehicles and major components.

The increase in hazardous waste requiring disposal was due to a reclassification of used foundry sand. We have initiated measures to reduce this waste.

Resource management. As a company from an industrial sector
which consumes large amounts of materials, we strive to plan
material use carefully and to employ finite resources as sparingly
as possible. We purchase a large part of the materials used in
our vehicles from suppliers in the form of components. Although
the environmental effects of purchased components are not
directly included in the assessment of our environmental performance, they are taken into account in our holistic assessment
of product development and selection of materials. Under this
assessment method, which we have used for our passenger cars
thus far, we extrapolate the entire use of materials in the production chain in additional consideration of the waste flows. Because
of the size and complexity of the Daimler Group, it is impossible
to analyze the material flows in greater detail in the context of
Sustainability Reporting. However, details on individual model
series are provided in the respective life cycle reports.

Through the use of efficient technologies we have reduced the
use of scarce resources to the absolute minimum. We plan the
recycling of materials at the end of the product life cycle as early
as in the development stage. In addition, we also remanufacture
used parts to a great extent. This yields economic benefits for
the customers and conserves resources.

Our production plants cover a total area of around 5,200 hectares, 65 percent of which are occupied by buildings and transport areas. Because land is a limited public good, we use these
areas as efficiently as possible through dense, multi-level building development. We also design outdoor areas within our plants
to serve as a habitat for indigenous plants and animals. In this
way, we can facilitate biodiversity even amidst the industrial
architecture. For example, peregrine falcons have found a new
home on chimneys of our plants in Wörth and Sindelfingen. In
the Tuscaloosa plant, natural vegetation and beavers with their
dams ensure the retention and preliminary sedimentation of rain
water. Due to the way we use land and our plant locations in
industrial zones, no significant negative effects on endangered
species are to be expected.
Biodiversity index. To better measure the effect of our activities, we have developed a biodiversity indicator whose practical
viability is currently being tested in several plants. The indicator
categorizes our horizontal and vertical areas in accordance with
their environmental value. In future, this indicator will enable us
to set targets for our plant-specific environmental protection program, and to clearly evaluate the progress that has been made.
More on the biodiversity indicator: Online 414

Logistics and employee transport
The incoming and outgoing delivery traffic in our plants as well as
the distances our employees travel for work and business also
affect our environmental balances through emissions, noise, and
use of resources. We minimize the environmental effects of
these transports through the use of an efficient logistics system
and of rail and waterway transport. We replace business travel by
telephone, video or online conferences wherever possible and
expedient. Employees at the Sindelfingen and Stuttgart locations
receive discounted yearly passes for the public transit system.
Truck deliveries to our German plants, to the Hungarian plant in
Kecskemét, and the plant in Vitoria, Spain are monitored centrally. The CO2 emissions can be approximated on the basis of the
tonnage and truck kilometers traveled.

Soil and groundwater. We eliminate any soil and groundwater
contamination in advance as far as possible. An internal guideline provides minimum standards for the handling of soil and
groundwater contamination for all locations. The requirements
frequently extend beyond the local legal regulations. Compliance
with these requirements is reviewed in the framework of our
worldwide audits. In 2014 there were no significant accidents
associated with soil or groundwater damage.

Employees.
Around 280,000 people worldwide are using their power and skills to contribute to the success of
our company. Fair and trusting relationships with employees are more than just an ethical and
legal requirement for us: Without them we would not be able to conduct our business successfully.

Human resources strategy and objectives. Our human resources strategy is firmly anchored in our Group-wide sustainability strategy. It is geared towards five strategic objectives:
profitability, competitive workforce, excellent management skills,
high attractiveness as an employer, and professional HR organization.
HR target system: Online 501

Areas of action. We have derived twelve key areas of action
from these objectives — ranging from generations management
to topics such as diversity and equal opportunity or to life balance and the qualification training of specialists in the growth
markets. For each area of action we have defined specific objectives that are also reflected in the target agreements of our managers.

Principles and guidelines. In our internal principles and guidelines, such as our “Principles of Social Responsibility,” we commit ourselves to observance of employee rights, among other
things. We also require the same from our business partners and
suppliers. For violations of our principles, we have established a
complaints process together with the employee representatives
in which each case is centrally documented and processed.
Safeguarding employment. We strive to safeguard the employment of our employees on a permanent basis. Our “Safeguarding
of the Future of Daimler” agreement contributes to achieving
this aim. In addition, we also use flexible working-time models
and collectively agreed framework conditions, which enable us to
make use of market opportunities and absorb fluctuations in

Employee representation and co-determination. Our employees have the right to organize themselves in labor unions. We
also ensure this right in countries in which the freedom of association is not protected. More than 95 percent of our employees
in Germany and more than 80 percent of our employees worldwide are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Our
employees in Germany have extensive co-determination rights
which are regulated by the German Labor Management Relations
Act. We work closely together with the employee representatives
both regionally and at the international level. At the corporate
level, ten members of the Supervisory Board represent employee
interests. Moreover, we maintain a continuous dialog with our
social partners even beyond the scope of the legal co-determination rights.

Employer of choice
Employees’ opinions are important and valuable to us. How
committed are our employees to the company? How strong is
their motivation? How satisfied are they with their work situation
and with the leadership provided by their supervisors? We get
answers to such questions through our worldwide employee
survey. The feedback provided by our employees helps us to
advance our organization and leadership culture on a continuous
basis. If the results of the survey indicate a need for improvement, we address the need in the follow-up process of the survey.
With the group employee survey in 2014, we again achieved a
high participation rate of 70 percent — which shows that our
employee survey is accepted as a feedback instrument. The good
rate also shows that our employees have an interest in getting
involved and in further developing the company.

http://sustainability.daimler.com

The results of the employee survey flow into our Employee Commitment Index (ECI), which in 2014 remained at the same level of
the last full survey conducted in 2011. In the international benchmark comparison we thus continue to be above the worldwide
average, and are even significantly above that level in individual
regions. However, we did not score well in all areas. That is why in
2015 the main focus will be on determining needs for action and
initiating required measures in areas where we did not scored
well. We will then measure our success in implementing the
measures at our next employee survey in 2016.

Company pension plans. Upon retirement, our employees can
generally expect to receive attractive company pensions — in
addition to the statutory and privately financed benefits. This
applies to both full-time and part-time employees. Depending
on the country and company, we offer defined benefit or defined
contribution pension plans. In addition, employees can also make
additional provisions for retirement by converting parts of their
earnings into pension contributions. We cover our pension obligations predominantly with suitable pension assets and protect
them against insolvency.

Topic “Employee survey”: p. 17

Attractive and fair: compensation at Daimler. Daimler relies
on the abilities and efforts of its employees. We remunerate the
work they perform in accordance with the same principles at all
affiliates around the world. Our Corporate Compensation Policy
establishes the framework conditions and minimum requirements for this. In our desire to offer attractive salaries and other
benefits we also give consideration to local market conditions
within the specified framework. We audit the local compensation
systems on a regular basis through sampling procedures.
Corporate Compensation Policy: Online 509

Salaries and minimum wage. The salaries are determined on
the basis of the employees’ tasks and performance, as well as in
line with their qualifications and experience. We pay salaries customary for the market and the industry, which are significantly
above the legal minimum wages that apply for many locations.
In addition to the statutory minimum wages, salaries and wages
are often determined by collective bargaining agreements. In the
event of union affiliations, our affiliates generally offer additional
voluntary benefits. For example, the employees of Daimler AG
in Germany currently receive compensation that is significantly
above the pay specified in collective bargaining agreements.
Equal pay. In setting the base remuneration we are not guided
by gender or origin, but exclusively by the employee’s job and
responsibility, and thus eliminate any form of discrimination.
Salary decisions are made on the basis of the multiple-eye principle. Transparency is ensured by regular income reviews. In
addition, the principle of “equal pay” also applies for temporary
employees, who are paid in accordance with the collective bargaining agreements for the metal and electrical industries during
their assignments in the commercial sector.
Compensation of managers. The more responsible the position, the higher the variable remuneration component. On the
one hand, the variable component takes into consideration the
company’s performance. On the other, it is based on the extent
to which the manager has achieved the individually agreed targets, which are discussed between managers and their superiors
as part of a worldwide uniform process. Sustainability criteria
also play a role in this context. For example, we also agree on
diversity and compliance targets with our managers — depending
on their respective function and level.

Diversity management
Our employees and our customers are becoming increasingly
international and diverse. This diversity challenges us and at the
same time provides us with a valuable resource. Under the motto
“I’m one of you,” Diversity Management creates the general conditions for a culture of diversity, which include clear rejection of
any form of discrimination, the creation of a work environment
that is free of prejudice as well as awareness-building and training measures, particularly for our managers.
Diversity Management begins on the Board of Management and
extends to each individual employee. All members of the Board
of Management support our Diversity Statement and actively
advocate for the realization of its principles:
– Promoting diversity. At Daimler, we respect and appreciate
the diversity of our employees. We encourage them to contribute this diversity to the company.
– Creating connections. We utilize the multifaceted experiences, perspectives, and skills of our employees around the
world. They reflect the diversity of our customers, suppliers,
and investors.
– Shaping the future. Each individual makes a contribution to
creating an environment characterized by respect and mutual
appreciation. This is how we are shaping Daimler’s future
together.

Online 510

In order to implement all of this in the company, our Diversity
Management concentrates on four fields of action: Gender
Diversity, Generations Management, Interculturality, and Work
Culture.

Employees

Promotion of women in management positions. Daimler
has the self-designated goal of increasing the share of women in
management positions in the Group by 20 percent by the year
2020. Right now about 14 percent of our executives in middle
and upper management are women. To achieve our objective, we
are promoting women through special programs. This applies in
particular to female professionals from engineering and technology. In 2014, 40 percent of the trainees who entered the company through our CAReer program were women.
Development of the percentage of women: Online 512

Generation management. The demographic transformation will
lead to changed employee structures in the next ten years. While
the average age of our employees at present is 44 years, it will
rise to about 47 years by 2024. One in two employees of Daimler
in Germany will then be 50 years or older. In addition, with the
increase in the retirement age the generation diversity in our
businesses will also increase. Today, our teams are staffed by
four generations of employees with their own ideas, abilities, and
strengths, who present special challenges for the work environment. To enable us to benefit from the advantages of this generational diversity for the company, we are encouraging mutual
respect among all age groups in their everyday work, and promote productive collaboration.

All our employees in Germany are entitled to parental leave. Of
those who took advantage of this possibility in 2014, around
60 percent were women and 40 percent were men. Almost all
our employees who took parental leave later returned to their
jobs in the company. Furthermore, works agreements additionally enable employees to suspend their careers for up to five years
— with the guarantee that they can return to Daimler afterwards.
In Germany alone we have set up 570 nurseries for children
under the age of three in the close proximity of our sites. In addition, a quality-certified online platform is available to support
employees in finding appropriate childcare solutions, ranging
from nannies to “surrogate grandparents.”
To enable managers at the level of team and department manager to work in more flexible arrangements, we promote a system
of job sharing. Currently, more than 30 job-sharing pairs take
advantage of this possibility at Daimler with respective working
arrangements of up to 30 hours per week.

Development and advancement
With the help our Generations Management we are dealing with
these challenges by adapting the framework conditions to the
changing employees. In addition, we strive to raise our managers’
awareness and strengthen employees’ personal responsibility,
with a view to maintaining the health and performance capability
of employees of all generations on a lasting basis.

We are competitive and innovative only if we can attract and bind
highly qualified employees to our company. To this end, we are
supported by custom-tailored programs and promotional measures in all important phases of employees’ individual training and
career paths.

Generations Management activities: Online 513

Interculturality. Daimler earns 80 percent of its revenues outside Germany. We are present at 90 locations on five continents.
Our employees come from more than 140 countries and a wide
variety of cultures. The majority of our managers abroad come
from the respective regions. Our employees’ diverse cultural
backgrounds help us to better understand the wishes of customers in the various regions and to tailor our products accordingly. We support our employees with worldwide staff assignments, mentoring, intercultural skills training, and targeted
recruiting measures. For example, international applicants
account for about one-third of new employees hired through
our CAReer trainee program. Our goal: Their quota is to rise to
around 50 percent by the year 2020.

Vocational training. Our industrial-technical and commercial
vocational training, as well as our study programs at the Cooperative University, enable us to secure the majority of young
employees we require. To keep abreast with the latest developments, we continuously expand our job portfolio as required. In
Germany, the Daimler Training System (DAS) ensures the high
quality and efficiency of our technical vocational education.
With our international exchange programs for trainees and trainers, we create the basic requirements for mobility and flexibility,
as well as for foreign language and intercultural skills. In 2014,
more about 70 trainees and two trainers had a chance to gather
their first international experience in countries like Spain, Hungary, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, Romania, and Turkey.

International mentoring program: Online 514

Flexible working arrangements. Today, many employees
attach great value to the ability to structure their working hours
individually. Frequently, this is the only way they can balance
their professional and personal lives. Our goal is to offer them
appropriate conditions for this. Accordingly, Daimler in Germany
provides more than 300 different flexible working arrangements.
This is a special plus for us as Employer of Choice when it comes
to attracting qualified young trainees and managers.

In addition, we are continuously internationalizing our training
activities in order to achieve high training standards throughout
the Group. For example, we have developed the Mercedes-Benz
Qualification System (MBQS) for our international passenger car
locations. The program sets the framework conditions for the
development of required qualifications abroad. Furthermore, we
are also establishing cooperative university elements outside
Germany.
Currently, Daimler employs a total of 8,346 trainees (2013:
8,630), including 1,773 abroad (2013: 1,964). We are in the
process of training another 1,400 young people (2013: 1,300) as
part of cooperative agreements with schools at international
locations.

Recruiting and developing new talent. Our broad range of
career entry and qualification training programs is directed at
talented young people who are offered development prospects
in our company. These include study programs at cooperative
universities, support programs for students (Daimler Student
Partnership), the FacTS sponsorship program for young
skilled workers, the Group-wide CAReer trainee program, and
the Daimler Academic Programs, which offer bachelor’s and
master’s degrees or even an academic certificate.

Training and skills upgrading. In keeping with the principle of
lifelong learning, we enable our employees to obtain further education and training — professional as well as personal — throughout their careers. In doing this we increasingly rely on E-learning
and electronic means of communication. Once a year, superiors
and employees meet to discuss qualification topics and agree on
appropriate measures.
Continuing education is regulated by the general works agreement on qualification, which also provides that employees can
leave the company for up to five years in order to obtain additional qualifications, and can subsequently return to the company.
We give this opportunity to around 500 employees each year.
Moreover, managers can facilitate employee qualification efforts
through time credits and financial support.
The Daimler Corporate Academy (DCA) provides an integrated
globally consistent qualification program for our specialist and
management staff, who are provided with the same high-quality
offerings, often in their respective national languages in many
locations. The program covers the areas of management, specialist knowledge (HR, Finance, Procurement, IT) and cross-functional knowledge. In addition, the DCA also supports the strategic
cooperative ventures of the corporate Group with customized
offerings.

Company health promotion at Daimler is aimed at motivating
employees to develop healthy lifestyles and to reinforce their
sense of personal responsibility on health issues. It creates
incentives for health-conscious behavior and promotes a healthy
environment with the help of campaigns, counseling, and qualification offerings, as well as therapeutic and rehabilitation measures. The annual campaign in 2014 ran under the motto ‘Good
nutrition has many colors.’ With nutritional tips, presentations,
and cafeteria initiatives, the campaign showed that healthy nutrition can be fun and does not necessarily have to entail sacrifice.

Occupational safety includes all measures for the prevention of
work accidents, work-related illnesses, and occupational diseases. One of its key principles is risk assessment, which provides the basis for the derivation of preventive measures. Key
occupational and health safety processes are standardized in
order to enable the creation and advancement of sustainable
comprehensive and integrated processes, methods, and systems. Occupational safety objectives must be set, approved, and
implemented for every organizational unit on a regular basis in
accordance with of our occupational health and safety guidelines
and occupational safety strategy and the results of audits and
reviews. There is an obligation to continuously improve health
and safety. The achievement of objectives in health and safety is
supported through an effective reporting procedure.

Suppliers

Suppliers.
In a global economy based on division of labor, our responsibility does not end at the company’s
gates. Compliance with sustainability standards must be maintained along our entire supply chain.
We promote this through dialog and training, as well as through joint standardization initiatives
with other manufacturers. In the event of violations, we take the appriopriate steps.

As a globally operating company with more than 62 production
locations in 19 countries, our success depends on good, trusting
cooperation with our worldwide suppliers. This is also reflected
in our procurement volume, which amounts to about half the
total revenues of Daimler AG. The collaboration with our suppliers is based on shared values and requirements, which also
include compliance with sustainability standards along the
supply chain.
Procurement organization and training program. Some
2,700 employees work in our procurement units at more than
50 locations around the world. Through established committees,
procurement management ensures cross-departmental networking on sustainability issues and uniform procurement communications within and outside the organization.
Training programs on sustainability and compliance are mandatory for all new employees. In addition, we keep employees upto-date about new developments. In 2014, we rolled out the
web-based training program “Sustainability in Procurement and
the Supply Chain” at our worldwide locations.

Our Sustainability Standards
Our “Supplier Sustainability Standards,” which were revised in
detail in 2013, present our requirements for working conditions,
human rights, environmental protection, safety, business ethics,
and compliance. They form the basis of any business relationship
with producing suppliers and service providers, and are a binding
component of the contactual conditions. By signing the contract,
our direct suppliers commit to observing the sustainability standards, communicating them to their employees, and spreading
them to their upstream value chains. We support them in this
through targeted information and training measures. The Daimler
Supplier Portal serves as the central information platform.
Supplier Sustainability Standards — text: Online 601
daimler.covisint.com

Environmental management in the supply chain. Suppliers
exercise a significant influence on the ecological balance of the
Daimler locations. That is why Daimler expects regular proof
of certified environmental management according to ISO 14001,
EMAS or other comparable standards along the supply chain.
Starting January 1, 2015, this requirement will be anchored in our
purchasing conditions.

64

33
Social principles for contracts for work and services

Since 2013, the awarding and performance of contracts for work and
services has been subject to standards that extend beyond the existing legislation. These standards define the requirements with regard to
occupational health and safety, accommodation, remuneration,
use of part-time employees, commissioning of sub-contractors, and
freelancing. These social principles are relevant for all purchase orders
that exceed a period of two months and are realized on the business
premises of Daimler AG in Germany. Suppliers are required to fill out
and sign a declaration concerning their compliance with the standards. This is a prerequisite for placing new purchase orders. An auditing team from Procurement performs on-site reviews at the suppliers
to determine whether the standards are observed and the contracts
for work and services are correctly performed.

Dialog and training. For us, sustainability in supplier management is a continuous process that can be successful on a permanent basis only in collaboration with our suppliers. That is
why we attach great value to an active dialog with our suppliers
worldwide, in which we also include the local supplier industry.
We regularly organize supplier events in which we also adress our
sustainability requirements. In collaboration with other automotive manufacturers, Daimler Procurement also organizes supplier
training courses. In 2014, such training programs were conducted in China, Turkey, and Russia. Overall, we have already trained
more than 300 suppliers since 2010. In addition, the implementation of sustainability standards in the supply chain is an important topic in our stakeholder dialogs.
“Daimler Sustainability Dialogue”: p. 40

Development of an industry-wide framework
of reference
Many challenges and opportunities associated with sustainable
management cannot be addressed by individual companies
alone. They require industry-wide collaboration along the worldwide supply chain, which additionally increases the effectiveness
of the measures. That is why we are active in various national
and international trade and industrial associations such as econsense, the Federal German Association of Materials Management, Purchasing and Logistics (BME), the German Association
of the Automotive Industry (VDA), the American Automotive
Industry Action Group (AIAG), and the European Automotive
Working Group on sustainability in the supply chain, which was

http://sustainability.daimler.com

Suppliers

founded as an industry initiative within the European corporate
network of CSR Europe. The goal of the cross-company collaboration is to develop a recognized company- and industry-wide
frame of reference. One result of this collaboration is the development of uniform social and ecological minimum standards,
which were published in 2014. The AIAG and the European
Automotive Working Group have reached a consensus on these
“Automotive Industry Guiding Principles to Enhance Sustainability Performance in the Supply Chain,” thus ensuring the worldwide applicability of the standards.
As part of CSR Europe we are working intensively with experts
from the procurement units of other manufacturers and in the
process we have developed and successfully piloted a joint questionnaire with which suppliers can self-assess their sustainability
performance. This questionnaire is recognized and used by all
companies that take part in this initiative. Daimler will use this
questionnaire to assess the sustainability performance of selected key suppliers.

– Audits of new suppliers. Particularly in the case of new suppliers from high-risk countries, trained auditors ask specific
questions concerning the compliance with sustainability standards during on-site assessments. In addition, we use a selfassessment questionnaire if required.
– Escalation process for suspected and actual violations.
In the event of a suspected or actual violation against our sustainability standards by a supplier, we follow an established
escalation process, which begins with the request for an opinion and explanation of the measures taken to remedy the
irregularities. If any doubts remain, we seek direct contact
with the supplier or demand a written statement from the
supplier’s company management. We work closely together
with the employee representatives, especially in cases of
suspected human rights violations. We follow up on all reports
of violations.

Risk analysis

This analysis enables us to identify suppliers that are subject
to increased risk and to derive activities on this basis. In addition, we use media and database research to review cases
of actual sustainability and compliance violations by our
direct suppliers. We systematically follow up on all reports of
violations.

If required, independent auditors conduct special sustainability
audits at our suppliers. In justified cases we refrain from placing
further orders or terminate the cooperation until it is demonstrated that the irregularities have been remedied.

Measures
Preventive

at an early stage, we conduct a targeted risk analysis of our
suppliers by country and commodity at regular intervals.

Consequences in the event
of violations

Supplier Sustainability Standards

Due to international crises, certain regions of the world are exposed to
the risk that armed conflicts could be financed with the revenues from
the sale of raw materials. In order to prevent conflicts arising from the
trade with so-called conflict minerals (tin, tantalum, tungsten, and
gold), a series of initiatives have been introduced aiming at a declaration of the origin and the responsible procurement of the raw materials.
For example, Section 1502 of the US Dodd-Frank Act stipulates that
companies listed on US stock exchanges must certify the source of
these commodities along the entire supply chain.
In Europe, the European Union also envisages legislation on this matter. Daimler supports an approach for the establishment of responsible procurement of raw materials that is both purposeful and practicable, and engages in regular dialog with industry associations such as
the German Association of the Automotive Industry.

Prevention and risk management
The establishment of uniform sustainability criteria and the use
of effective control instruments present a special challenge in a
value chain that spans the entire world. That is why we have set
up an effective system for monitoring our sustainability requirements within our procurement processes.
– Regular review of our active suppliers. To identify possible
sustainability risks in our supply chain with regard to child

Social responsibility

Social responsibility.
For us, business success and social responsibility go hand in hand. As a company, we strive to
design, help, and promote. Together with our employees we help master social challenges in many
charitable community projects.

Our global presence offers us the opportunity to co-design the
social environment at our locations worldwide, and to support
the dialog between the cultures. In this context, we focus on the
one hand on fields of action that arise from our role as “good
neighbor.” On the other, we are involved in projects in which we
can contribute specific expertise and our core competencies as
an automaker. In this respect, the main emphasis is on the following issues: promotion of science, education and traffic safety,
nature conservation, art and culture, community and charitable
commitment, employee commitment as well as dialog and understanding.
We have invested nearly €60 million in funding for non-profit
organizations and in sponsorship of socially beneficial projects in
addition to our foundation activities and corporate volunteering
efforts, as well as projects initiated by us.

Control and transparency. The donations and sponsorship
committee of the Board of Management manages all donations
and sponsorship activities around the world. The committee is
guided by our “Sponsorship and Donations Policy,” which specifies binding regulations concerning criteria, legal provisions, and
ethical standards. Transparency is additionally facilitated by the
donations and sponsorship database, in which all donations and
sponsorship activities of the Group worldwide must be recorded.
Regular communication measures help our employees to
observe the policies worldwide and make them aware of the
risks in the area of donations and sponsorships.

66

We provide donations to political parties in strict compliance
with established laws. Our internal corporate policy explicitly
requires a Board of Management resolution for all donations to
political parties. In 2014, we supported the democratic parties
exclusively in Germany with a total of €320,000. In 2014, the
CDU and SPD each received €100,000, and the FDP, CSU and
Bündnis 90/the Green Party €40,000 each.

Promoting science
Sustainable development is not possible without the targeted,
global promotion of science, research, and technology. Sharing
knowledge across borders and promoting innovation are important factors in this respect. That is why we support universities,
research institutions, and multi-disciplinary science projects
around the world. We have bundled these activities in the form
of foundations.
The Daimler and Benz Foundation is endowed with a foundation volume of €125 million. As a driving force of the knowledge
society it promotes in-depth scientific exploration of research
ideas in the areas of environmental protection and future-proof
technology. Furthermore, it also supports a think tank on the
subject of mobility that is to research the effects and socially
relevant aspects associated with autonomous driving.
Autonomous driving in future road traffic. The Daimler and
Benz Foundation is investing around €1.5 million in the “Villa
Ladenburg” project. A team of more than 20 research scientists
is examining the future effects of self-driving vehicles on the
individual and society.

Within the framework of the Donors’ Association for the Promotion of Sciences and Humanities in Germany, among other things,
the Daimler Fund supports the German President’s Award for
Innovation in Science and Technology, which is presented each
year by the German Federal President and is among the most
important scientific awards in Germany.

With the MINTernational promotional program, the Donors’
Association for the Promotion of Sciences and Humanities in
Germany, the Daimler and Benz Foundation, and the Daimler
Fund strive to contribute to the continued internationalization
of the MINT subjects (mathematics, computer science, natural
sciences, technology) in Germany. As part of a contest, technical
universities are honored that have developed especially innovative concepts for preparing MINT students in Germany for
the world market and bringing the best foreign students to Germany. The winners of the first round of the competition received
a total of €500,000 to implement their concepts.

Junior Achievement. The aim of the worldwide organization
“Junior Achievement” is to familiarize young people with the prerequisites for a successful professional life in a global world. The
organization’s educational programs for all age groups — from
kindergarten to a high-school diploma — are focused on three key
topics: work readiness, entrepreneurship and financial education. Many of our employees at Daimler Financial Services in
Singapore and the U.S. have again volunteered to participate in
the initiative in 2014, and have supported school kids at local
schools with learning skills.

Education
We believe that improving access to education is one of the
most-lasting investments we can make for society and for our
company That’s because education creates opportunities and
opens up doors to a future full of possibilities. That is why we are
involved in a variety of projects around the world with a view to
promoting enthusiasm for science and technology and also the
ability to look beyond working life and go through life with an
open mind. At the same time we are promoting equal opportunity with our projects.
Genius — Daimler’s young knowledge community. Our education initiative Genius combines a variety of educational projects
for children and teenagers in the key areas of future technologies, mobility, and the environment. Genius promotes practical
and playful learning with age-specific offers and free workshops
at learning locations outside of school. In addition, in cooperation with the Klett MINT textbook publishing company, we have
also developed suitable instruction materials for the subjects
of natural sciences and technology, and offer the associated
teacher conferences and teacher continuing education.

Training in the townships. We train men and women of all ages
in cooperation with the St. Anthony’s Education Centre in Reiger
Park, a township of Johannesburg. The center provides literacy
courses and trains welders and bricklayers.
Internships for talented young trainees from the Arab countries. In cooperation with selected local universities we promote
talented young people from the Arab countries, who are given
the opportunity to complete an internship at a German location
of the Group. The focus is on the subjects of entrepreneurship,
executive development, and education.
Each girl is a star. Together with the women’s organization
CYDD we are paving the way to technical jobs for socially disadvantaged girls in Turkey. The award-winning project “Each Girl is a
Star” offers young women between the ages of fifteen and eighteen the chance to enter a four-year vocational training program
that includes an internship at Mercedes-Benz Turkey, as well as
at dealers and suppliers. The aim is to support these girls in discovering and expanding their abilities and skills. And with great
success: Increasing numbers of graduates of the project want to
study for a technical degree. That is why we have supplemented
the project with a university scholarship program.

Our “journey on the road to accident-free driving” is not just
about using suitable systems to relieve the burden on drivers,
protect them, and support them in hazardous situations. For
us it is more a question of ensuring the safety of all road users.
Road traffic education projects for schoolchildren and safety
training for adults are two examples of how we work to achieve
this goal.
MobileKids. Since 2001, we have made already more than
1 million of children “fit for road traffic” with MobileKids.
The objective: Safe mobility and prevention of accidents are to
become matters of fact in the daily lives of both children and
adults. To this end, traffic safety is communicated in an interesting and playful way in order to show elementary school
kids appropriate behavior in traffic situations at an early age.
Besides teaching safe behavior for pedestrians, bicyclists or car
passengers, MobileKids also provides training on considerate
behavior, for example, on public transportation. In addition to
the varied activities in Germany — ranging from the MobileKids
offerings for schools to children’s traffic schools — we have also
communicated the content of MobileKids in other countries,
such as China, South Korea, Brazil, Hungary, and Turkey. We will
increase the international scope of the project on a continuous
basis in coming years.

Conservation
We share responsibility for preserving the diversity of natural
habitats for future generations. That is why we have been supporting the projects and initiatives of environmental organizations around the world for many years now. We consider it our
contribution to making sure the Earth remains a place worth
living in.
Living moorlands. The Baden-Württemberg league for nature
conservation (NABU) and Daimler initiated a moorland renaturing
project as early as in 2012. As a result, two moorlands which are
in danger of drying out, the Hinterzarten Moor in the Black Forrest and the Bodenmöser Moor in the Allgäu, are to be restored
to healthy and living moorlands. In 2014, as part of the project,
23 Daimler apprentices lent a hand in not only conserving this
precious habitat for plants and animals, but consequently also in
contributing to climate protection. After all, healthy moorlands
are the best natural stores of carbon.

Protection of mangrove forests in Asia. To contribute to the
conservation of endangered mangrove ecosystems in India, Sri
Lanka, Cambodia, and Thailand, we are sponsoring a renaturalization project of the Global Nature Fund for the reforestation of
more than 100 hectares of degenerated mangrove forests. This is
to preserve the biodiversity of the forests and their capacity to
reduce CO2 and serve as protection against flood waves. The
local population is involved in the project through environmental
training and the creation of alternative earning possibilities.
The project thus combines nature conservation, development
cooperation, and disaster prevention.

Art and culture
Art has the power to build bridges. A rich cultural life and a lively
art scene also foster creativity and innovation. That is why promoting art and culture is very important to us.
Our cultural involvements include the Daimler Art Collection,
which was founded in 1977 and has now grown to around 2,600
works by 700 different artists. The emphasis of our activities is
generally on the regional promotion of culture, with a focus on
jazz, classical music, and the promotion of film in addition to the
visual arts. From Berlin we support the Berlin Philharmonic, the
German Opera House in Berlin, and the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern music festival. In Stuttgart, we support the Theaterhaus
Theater, the Jazz Open, and the animated film festival, among
others. In China, we are involved in a strategic partnership with
the National Center for the Performing Arts, and are active as
sponsor of Art Beijing and the International Music Festival. In
South Africa we are active as partners of the “21 icons” project.
The initiative strives to inspire the younger generations to follow
in the footsteps of national icons like Nelson Mandela.

Community and charitable commitment
For us being a global company means we have a global responsibility. That is why we support the social environment at our locations as well as a wide variety of aid projects around the world.
And we do not stop at emergency disaster relief. We also set up
longer-term projects aimed at helping people to help themselves.
Aid for flood victims. After the flood disaster in the Balkans,
Daimler provided €250,000 of emergency relief for the affected
population in May 2014. The donation went to the aid organization Caritas International e.V., which took care of the needed
emergency supplies and maintenance work. In addition, Daimler
together with the General Works Council initiated an employee
donation campaign that enabled us to provide Caritas with an
additional €20,000.
Ekukhanyeni aid project. The “Ekukhanyeni” project in Lawley
south of Johannesburg provides aid for people living in great
poverty. Mercedes-Benz South Africa has been providing assistance for the initiative, which has meanwhile built an elementary
school in addition to providing nursery places for small children,
since 2010. At present, “Ekukhanyeni” is also working on ecofriendly farming as well as on landscape design, energy supply,
and the expansion of the local infrastructure.
Reconstruction after the typhoon. In November 2013, the
typhoon Haiyan cut a path of destruction across the Philippines.
The reconstruction effort is still ongoing. To support the population, Daimler Group Services Philippines and Daimler Financial
Services Singapore donated money for the reconstruction of
kindergartens in the strongly affected city of Borbon on the
island of Cebu. In addition, food and school supplies as well as
other aid and construction materials were provided. Immediately
after the natural disaster Daimler AG transferred emergency aid
in the amount of €500,000.

Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation. With its museums,
libraries, archives, and research facilities, the Prussian Cultural
Heritage Foundation is one of the largest cultural and scientific
institutions in the world. We support the strategic objectives of
the foundation with a view to making an effective contribution to
the promotion of culture in society, with the primary aim of
increasing the visibility of the cultural heritage and the museum
work, and promoting new conceptual avenues for imparting culture in the community.
Emerging Artist Award. With their Emerging Artist Award,
Daimler Financial Services and the Cranbrook Academy of Art
have been providing financial support for a particularly promising
graduate of the Michigan-based Academy of Art since 2005.
The young artist is given the opportunity to make contacts in the
international art scene, and to work and present his art during
a two-month stay in Berlin.

Corporate volunteering
Not only do we face up to our global responsibility as a company,
we also support the efforts undertaken by our employees in the
interest of society and the common good. The countless initiatives reflect the sense of responsibility felt by our employees, as
well as their desire to provide opportunities to those who otherwise have none.
ProCent. As part of the ProCent initiative, Daimler employees
donated the cent amounts of their net income to charitable projects. The company doubles every cent donated, and accrues it in
a promotional fund, from which we support ecological and social
projects in Germany and abroad on the basis of employee suggestions. In 2014, we supported 188 projects with a total of
around one million euros in this way. ProCent supports initiatives
in 24 countries worldwide.

Social responsibility

Day of Caring. Daimler Financial Services (DFS) organizes the
“Day of Caring” in more than 30 countries. In 2014, a total of
more than 2,300 employees worldwide contributed a day of work
in community projects for charitable purposes. The high point of
the activities was the “Week of Caring” in the U.S. and Canada,
during which more than 1,100 employees spent one week working in more than 30 different organizations.
Individual Volunteer Day. Beyond the “Week of Caring,” the
national company of DFS in the US gives its employees one more
paid working day off for their voluntary activities. During the
“Individual Volunteer Day” employees can work on a project in
which they have a personal interest. As recognition of this social
commitment, we publish a monthly report on the experiences of
individual employees on the employee portal.
Give a Smile. As part of the Daimler Christmas campaign “Give a
Smile,” employee volunteers gift-wrap presents for children and
adolescents from socially disadvantaged families. The company
provides Christmas boxes for this purpose. In collaboration with
the aid organizations Schwäbische Tafel e.V., SOS Kinderdörfer,
and other local institutions, the gifts are distributed to children
who would otherwise get no or very few gifts for Christmas. In
2014, we put together more than 13,000 Christmas packages
filled with toys, school supplies or clothing for children between
the ages of two and fourteen.
Willing Hearts is a charitable organization that runs a soup
kitchen in Singapore, where around 4,500 meals are cooked
every day and distributed to people who live on the fringes of
society. In 2014, Daimler employees helped prepare and package
around 18,000 meals.

Together against right-wing violence. Keeping alive the memory of the National Socialist period, taking responsibility, and reinforcing the free spirit of democracy — these are the goals pursued by several projects and initiatives sponsored by Daimler,
such as the City Hall Tour of actor Hardy Krüger. Krüger reports
on his experiences during the Nazi regime under the motto
“Together Against Right-Wing Violence,” alerting the public to the
current threat posed by right-wing extremist groups, and collects
donations for the campaign “Courage Against Right-Wing Violence.” The start of the tour in Cologne in late 2013 was followed
by events in Berlin, Stuttgart, Dortmund, and Leipzig in 2014.
Solidarity against racism and ostracism. The Global Attorney
Meeting was held from May 7–9. Cologne celebrated a special
cultural and arts festival: The event organized by the “BIRLIKTE —
STAND TOGETHER” alliance commemorated the victims of rightwing terrorism and sent a visible sign of solidarity. Daimler sponsored the event, which was attended by German President
Joachim Gauck and Hardy Krüger. The occasion was the tenth
anniversary of the June 9, 2004 nail bomb attack by radical rightwing terrorists in Cologne’s Keupstraße, home primarily to Turkish and Kurdish residents.
Christopher Street Day. Daimler took part in the Christopher
Street Day (CSD) in Stuttgart for the first time in 2014. Together
with members of the employee network GL@D (Gay Lesbian
Bisexual Transgender at Daimler), the company presented itself
with a Mercedes-Benz truck in order to promote social acceptance of people with different sexual orientations. The participation was motivated by the desire to support the work of GL@D
and sent yet another signal for a culture of openness and respect
within the Group. Daimler Financial Services has already been
involved in the CSD in Berlin since 2011.
More on dialog projects: qr-sr.daimler.com/0r4

Dialog and understanding
Being open to the world and being tolerant are two important
foundation stones of our corporate culture. As a group that operates around the world, we support projects and institutions that
promote inter-cultural dialog in the interest of mutual understanding and the peaceful coexistence of cultures. We also support initiatives aimed at promoting democracy.
Daimler-Byrnes scholarship. In 2014, we awarded the DaimlerByrnes scholarships of the Stuttgart region for the thirteenth
consecutive time. The five scholarship recipients will receive
extensive cultural training before they travel to the U.S. in August
in order to live with host families for one year and attend the
local high school. The scholarship was created by Daimler along
with the Forum Region Stuttgart and the German-American
Center/James-F.-Byrnes Institute (DAZ).

Our Sustainability Program 2020

Our Sustainability Program 2020.
Sustainability is an essential element of our business activities
that is firmly anchored in our system of strategic objectives.
We regularly compare our business objectives with our stakeholders’ expectations and set our priorities for our vital sustainability areas on this basis. The results we achieve are presented
in our materiality analysis. From the defined fields of action,
we have derived concrete targets against which we measure
ourselves.
We anchor our sustainability objectives in our management and
leadership system in all stages of the value chain, from product
development and production to sales and marketing. The target
agreements between employees and their superiors specify
the sustainability targets for the respective task, such as CO2
emissions or diversity objectives, on a consistent basis and
are thus relevant for employee remuneration. The targets are
reviewed annually as part of our sustainability management and
are adjusted as required. In this context, through our system-

atic stakeholder management, we additionally respond to the
requirements of internal and external interest groups which we
actively involve in our sustainability activities through surveys
and dialogs.
Materiality analysis: pp. 34 f.

Our Sustainability Program is dynamic. Just as we are called on
to adapt ourselves continuously to new market conditions in
the dynamic competitive environment, we must also satisfy the
requirements imposed on us by our stakeholders. That is why we
have further modified, detailed, and prioritized the Sustainability
Program for 2020 over 2013. The new program presents the
main target horizons of our sustainability commitment until
2020, but is still flexible enough to enable addressing new challenges within a short time. We present only our TOP objectives

Report profile.
In this Sustainability Report we assess the economic, environmental, and social impact of our business operations in the 2014
financial year and present our current sustainability program.
Our interactive online Sustainability Report details and supplements the present printed report with additional information
and offers additional possibilities for use: The website features
a search function, an extensive thematically linked GRI Index, and
a key figures tool, with which you can create tables and graphics
adapted to your information needs.
The information provided in our Sustainability Report applies to
the entire Daimler Group with its business divisions. The reporting period corresponds to our financial year, which runs from
January 1 to December 31.

GRI
In 2006, Daimler joined the multi-stakeholder network of the
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) as organizational stakeholder.
This report was prepared in accordance with the internationally
recognized guidelines on sustainability reporting GRI G4.

– the internal management systems and processes at corporate level used for recording, gathering, consolidation, and
processing of the data published in the report;
– the internal control processes for sustainability reporting
at corporate level;
– the accuracy of data at the corporate level (figures in tables
and statements on production-related key figures “CO2 emissions, water consumption, and recycling rate” and “average
CO2 emissions of the European passenger cars fleet of
Mercedes-Benz,” and statements on accident key figures as
well as donations and sponsorships).
The main focus of the review was on the corporate level and was
supplemented by samples from individual production plants.
As result of the review and as a formal conclusion, Daimler
received the review certificate, which presents the aim and
purpose of assurance, its basic principles, work performed, and
its conclusions. The internal reporting takes place via the Corporate Sustainability Board (CSB).
Audit certification: p. 80

UN Global Compact Progress Report
Audit certification according to ISAE 3000
Daimler engaged the auditing and consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers to examine the Corporate Sustainability Report.
The review was based on the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000: Assurance Engagements other than
Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (ISAE 3000),
published by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards
Board (IAASB), which has been in effect since January 1, 2005.
During the review the Sustainability Report was subjected to a
critical assessment of its correctness, completeness, comparability, comprehensibility, and relevance. This was supported by
sampling of documentary evidence. The areas included in the
review are

In 2000, Daimler became one of the first signatories of the UN
Global Compact. We have committed ourselves to uphold this
international initiative’s ten universally recognized principles. In
addition, we were among the first participants of the UN Global
Compact LEAD group established in January 2011. Since 2013,
we have continuously monitored and expanded our involvement
in thematic and regional task forces and initiatives. With this
Sustainability Report we are meeting our obligation to report
regularly on our initiatives regarding human rights, labor standards and employee rights, environmental protection, and the
fight against corruption.
In July 2014, we submitted the Sustainability Report 2013 together with the following overview as our official UN Global Compact
Progress Report. The next Progress Report will be presented by
us in July 2015. Please note that all references in this Progress
Report relate to the previous year’s report.

We want to become better and better
G4 -22
G4 -23

In recent years we have continuously strengthened our commitment to sustainability and have made our reporting in this area
more transparent and easier to understand. As always, our
reporting is in line with the principles of materiality, stakeholder
inclusiveness, completeness, and sustainability.

Scope of reporting and data acquisition methods
Economy. The information about economic relationships presented in the Sustainability Report for 2014 is based mainly on
data from the 2014 Daimler Annual Report. The Management
Report and Notes sections, from which we have quoted in this
report, were attested to with an unqualified opinion by the auditing firm KPMG Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft AG. Further
information can be found in the Annual Report 2014.
Ecology. Daimler has been systematically compiling key environmental data from its German plants since 1992. In 1997 and
1998 its data acquisition activities were gradually extended to
include production plants outside Germany. Since 2002 the data
acquisition and analysis have been handled with the aid of a database. The data in this report reflects the structure of the Group in
2014 and includes all relevant production plants and the German
sales locations. To ensure comparability with the data for previous years, the data for the entire reporting period does not
include parts of the company in which Daimler is no longer the
majority shareholder. For this reason, the time lines may differ
from those of previously published data. New parts of the company have been included from the time at which they became
part of Daimler. The environmental data for 2014 refers to a total
of 75 locations and satellite sites.

Report profile

The materiality matrix outlines the thematic structure of our
Sustainability Report, which we have designed to be even more
clearly structured than before. We have also taken into account
the wishes of important target groups such as rating agencies,
which need to find key figures, data, and facts as quickly as possible and therefore view brief summaries of important issues as
an important quality criterion. We have therefore concentrated
on the key figures of the GRI Index. The comprehensive Index is
available on the Internet.

G4 -23

Sustainability Program 2020: pp. 70 ff.

In the first part of the Daimler Sustainability Report 2014 we
address company-specific topics, which demonstrate our commitment to act responsibly in the context of our international
business operations. The topics are determined in line with the
materiality matrix and represent issues which are also under
public scrutiny.
The supplement “Overview of the Corporate Group” is a new
feature, with which we satisfy the requirements of the Reporting
Standard GRI G4, which is mandatory starting this year. In it we
present our business purpose and tie it to the action fields of
the materiality matrix and the resulting Sustainability Program
2020.

The reporting process and quality assurance
In addition to a system and data quality audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), we also perform detailed benchmark
analyses. In parallel we also have an internal process for the
review of targets, measures, and fields of action.

Disclaimer
Employees. The facts and figures in the Employees section are
based on the 2014 Daimler Annual Report. The reporting on
human resources data is based mainly on the “HR ePARS” electronic human resources planning and reporting tool, which combines the data of all consolidated companies within the Daimler
Group. This information has been supplemented with data
acquired with the aid of the ePeople or HR EARTH electronic
human resources management systems. The texts and diagrams
in this section indicate whether the data refers to the entire
Group or only to parts thereof.

The 2014 Daimler Sustainability Report prioritizes the areas of
action which arise from the analysis of the business model, strategy and the materiality analysis even more strongly:

We have exercised extreme care in the compilation of the data
contained in this report. Nevertheless, we cannot entirely
exclude the possibility of error. Insofar as this report contains
forward-looking statements, these are based exclusively on
data and forecasts that were available at the time of publication.
Although such projections are drawn up with extreme care, a
great variety of factors that were unforeseeable at the time of
publication may lead to deviations. The content of the report
was examined by the responsible specialist staff. Parts of the
report were examined by PricewaterhouseCoopers.
The last Sustainability Report appeared in April 2014 under the
title “Sustainability Report 2013.” Our next report will be published in mid-April 2016.
Editorial deadline for this report: February 13, 2015

On the basis of the materiality analysis, we have evaluated internal and external sustainability requirements for our company,
and have summarized the results in the materiality matrix.

Independent Assurance Report

To Daimler AG, Stuttgart
We have been engaged to perform a limited assurance engagement
regarding several sustainability key performance indicators
selected by Daimler AG (the Company) in the Sustainability Report
2014 (the Report) for the business year from 1 January to 31
December 2014.

We have complied with the independence and other ethical
requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants
issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for
Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principles of
integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care,
confidentiality and professional behavior.

Responsibility of the legal representatives
7KH&RPSDQ\¶V%RDUGRIManaging Directors is responsible for the
proper preparation of the report in accordance with the criteria
stated in the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 4 (pages 16 to
18) of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).

During 2014 we have not performed any tasks or services for
Daimler that would conflict with our independence, nor have we
been responsible for the preparation of any part of the report; and
therefore qualify as independent as defined by Code of Ethics and
applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

This responsibility includes the selection and application of
appropriate methods to prepare the report and the use of
assumptions and estimates for sustainability disclosures which are
reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, the responsibility
includes designing, implementing and maintaining systems and
processes relevant for the preparation of the report.

Within the scope of our work we performed amongst others the
following procedures:
 Inquiries of personnel responsible for the preparation of the
report regarding the process to prepare the reporting of
sustainability information and the underlying internal control
system;
 Inspection of documents regarding the sustainability strategy as
well as understanding the sustainability management structure,
the stakeholder dialogue and the development process of the
&RPSDQ\¶VVXVWDLQDELOLW\SURJUDP
 Inquiries of personnel in the corporate functions that are
responsible for the chapters product responsibility, operationsrelated environmental protection, occupational safety and social
commitment;
 Gaining an understanding of the systems and processes for
collection, analysis, validation and aggregation of sustainability
data and its documentation on a sample basis;
 Performance of site visits as part of the inspection of processes
for collecting, analyzing and aggregating selected data:
- in the corporate headquarter in Stuttgart
- in the plants in Gaggenau (Germany)
- in the plant in Kecskemét (Hungary);
 Analytical procedures on sustainability data disclosed in the
report;
 Comparison of selected data with corresponding data in the
&RPSDQ\¶VCombined Management Report;
 Gaining further evidence for selected data of the report by means
of inspection of internal documents, contracts and
invoices/reports from external service providers.

Responsibility of the auditor
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion based on our work
performed as to whether anything has come to our attention that
causes us to believe that the data of the report of the Company for
the business year 2014 has not been prepared, in all material
respects, in accordance with the above mentioned criteria of the
Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 4 of the GRI.
The sustainability key performance indicators selected by Daimler
AG for the calendar year 2014 (CO2 emissions of the European
fleet, energy consumption, total CO2 emissions scope 1 and 2,
waste recovery rate, water consumption, accident frequency as well
as cost of foundations, donations, and sponsorships), which are
included in the scope of our engagement, can be found on page 2 of
the sustainability report 2014 DVµ.ey figures 2014¶ and the
corresponding sections in the report. The assessment of the
materiality analysis of the company was not part of our
engagement scope.
We conducted our work in accordance with the International
Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000. This Standard
requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and
perform the assurance engagement, under consideration of
materiality, to provide our conclusion with limited assurance.
In a limited assurance engagement the evidence-gathering
procedures are more limited than for a reasonable assurance
engagement, and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a
reasonable assurance engagement. The procedures selected depend
RQWKHSUDFWLWLRQHU¶VMXGJement.

Conclusion
Based on our limited assurance engagement, nothing has come to
our attention that causes us to believe that the data of the report of
the Company for the business year 2014 has not been prepared, in
all material respects, in accordance with the above mentioned
criteria of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 4 (pages 16
to 18) of the GRI.

In 2000 Daimler became one of the first signatories of the UN Global Compact. We have committed ourselves
to uphold this international initiative’s ten universally recognized principles. Daimler was also one of the first
participants of the UN Global Compact LEAD group, which was established in January 2011.

Principle 6
Elimination of
discrimination

To ensure that our hiring processes are free of discrimination, whether gender-specific or in other
forms, the fixed base salary depends on the individual’s position and level. The same goal is
served within our regular income reviews by mandatory documentation, the inclusion of several
people in each process, and a central HR system that ensures transparency. Our in-house income
reviews have shown that the amount of the remuneration paid for comparable tasks is affected
by factors such as individual performance and the amount of experience a person has gained in a
particular position, but not by the person’s gender.

Principle 6
pp. 43, 61 f.

Principle 7
Precautionary
environmental
protection

Risk prevention is particularly important when it comes to managing the local effects of our business activities. This applies, for example, to environmental protection in the production process.
Our environmental management system defines structures and processes that ensure transparent reporting and clear areas of responsibility at all levels of our production facilities around
the world. More than 98 percent of our employees work at locations with environmental management systems audited and certified according to ISO14001. In addition, we regularly conduct
environmental due diligence processes at our locations.

Principle 7
pp. 41, 56 ff.

Principle 8
Promotion of
environmental
responsibility

Daimler has been systematically compiling key environmental data from its German plants since
1992. In 1997 and 1998 its data acquisition was gradually extended to include production plants
outside Germany. Since 2002 the acquisition and analysis of the data have been handled with
the aid of a database. The data in this report reflect the structure of the Group in 2013 and include all relevant production plants and the German sales locations. New parts of the company
have been included from the time at which they became part of Daimler. The environmental data
for 2013 refer to a total of 75 business locations or subordinate sites.

Principle 8
pp. 56 ff.

Principle 9
Development and
diffusion of
environmentally friendly
technologies

The requirements regarding our vehicles’ environmental compatibility are integral aspects of
automobile development at Daimler and are discussed by the corresponding committees and
implemented accordingly. The vehicle specifications and the quality gates in the development
process document the environmental impact and requirements during the entire product development process.

Principle 9
pp. 47 ff.

Principle 10
Work against corruption

In our Integrity Code, we have made a binding pledge to comply with all relevant laws, voluntary
commitments, and internal regulations, and to do business in accordance with ethical principles
at all times. In doing so, our main focus is on the observance of all applicable anti-corruption
regulations as well as the protection and promotion of fair competition. In this respect, our managers have a special responsibility due to their role model function. Consequently, integrity and
compliance are key criteria in the annual target agreement process and target achievement of
our managers. Based on our Integrity Code, we offer web-based training which clearly conveys
our standards of good conduct and shared values. The training course contains sections on
ethical conduct in daily operations, corruption prevention, our whistleblower system BPO, and
antitrust law. In addition to the Group-wide dialogs concerning ethical conduct across all hierarchies, we are also assisted by our Compliance Management System in ensuring ethical practices
in accordance with the regulations in our daily business.

Principle 10
pp. 39, 44 f., 64 f.

In recent years we have continuously improved our sustainability performance and made our reporting in
this area more transparent and easier to understand. As always, our reporting is in line with the principles of
materiality, stakeholder inclusiveness, completeness, and sustainability context.
Both the printed and the interactive online versions of the Daimler Sustainability Report 2014 are based
on the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). These guidelines were established with the help of
the UN in 1997 in order to create a globally accepted guideline for companies and organizations reporting on
their environmental, social, and economic activities. The amended guidelines of 2013 (G4) serve as the basic
framework for Daimler’s Sustainability Reporting.

We assign a very high priority to recognizing and protecting human rights within our company
and in the locations where we operate. For us as an automaker, the emphasis is on employee
rights, fair working conditions, and the rejection of every form of discrimination and of forced
labor and child labor. We have firmly grounded our sense of responsibility for human rights issues
in the Integrity and Legal Affairs area of responsibility in the Group’s Board of Management.
