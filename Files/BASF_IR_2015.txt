Welcome to BASF
Our integrated corporate
report combines financial
and sustainability reporting
to inform shareholders,
employees and the
interested public about
the 2015 business year.

“We add value as one
company” – this principle
is firmly embedded in our
strategy.
Our actions are centered on
developing innovative, sustainable
products and solutions for our
customers, which we use to meet
global challenges.
To do so, we have relied on
collaboration with strong partners
for 150 years. This key to success
was the focus of our anniversary year
in 2015. Together, we developed
promising contributions to add value.
A few of these are outlined on the
pages that follow.

popular way to keep track of new ideas at this and many
other anniversary events in 2015.

150 YEARS OF BASF

What an anniversary
can do
The knowledge and creativity of many minds can give rise to extraordinary
ideas. This was the inspiration behind our anniversary program. Dubbed
Creator Space™, it was a very special way to celebrate 150 years of BASF.
We organized a tour around the world, bringing scientists, customers, employees
and partners from all over the globe together at one table and launching an online
platform to connect everyone. Ideas were proposed surrounding three main
themes: urban living, smart energy and food. We call this “co-creation.” It is one
way to fill our idea pipeline for the future and create value.

Which ideas emerged
URBAN LIVING

A clean air app
How does growing urbanization affect
our planet? And how can we as
individuals lead a sustainable lifestyle?
These were the questions addressed at
the “Creatathon” in Shanghai. The idea:
People ­engage in a highly creative activity
for a sustained, uninterrupted
period of time. Just like in Shanghai,
when BASF i­nvited six college teams to
spend 24 hours devoting themselves to
developing an app-based, sustainable
mobility solution. The goal of the app was
to help city dwellers minimize their carbon
footprint by selecting the most environmentally friendly mode of transportation.
In the end, first place went to the team
from East ­China Normal University:
With their ­“Carbon Coin” idea, consumers
can cash in their personal contribution to
sustainability as “currency” on an online
platform – similar to emissions trading
between companies.

The green way to go: Megacities like Shanghai are already home to over
20 million people today. That means public transit and other alternate modes of
transportation will play an even greater role in reducing emissions in the future.

150 YEARS BASF

SMART ENERGY

The bus to the future
Environmentally friendly technologies,
comfortable interiors, a lighter chassis –
there was no lack of original ideas and
­visions at a joint c
­ ustomer innovation
workshop. Together with experts from
Daimler Buses, BASF employees from
various fields discussed solutions for
­future bus challenges, ranging from
special coatings and new lightweight
engi­neering concepts to possibilities for
preventing vandalism. This brainstorming
gave rise to project ideas providing new
inspiration for the bus of the ­future.

Safe and clean
through the city:
Participants at a
joint workshop
held by BASF and
Daimler discussed
new technologies
and materials
for making even
more efficient and
environmentally
friendly vehicles in
the future.

together by searching youtube.com for:
“Co-creation with Daimler”

FOOD

Smart watering
How can we reduce food waste
and harvest losses? And how can
we combat drought and the effects
of ­water scarcity? Students, environmental experts, engineers and city
planners were some of the participants
at a “creatathon” in São Paulo that
focused on solutions for more efficient
water use in town and country. First
prize went to the most innovative
suggestion with the potential for
future ­research and development.
The winning team’s idea was to water
fields through drip irrigation, where
a sensor measures soil moisture to
calculate how much water is needed
at what time of day.

Little drops that
make an impact:
In many parts of
South America,
­water is a precious
commodity. New
technologies aim
to help keep fields
irrigated even in
times of lengthy
drought.

150 YEARS OF BASF

FOOD / URBAN LIVING

Employees get involved
A community needs engaged
citizens in order to thrive. BASF
helped its e
­ mployees carry out
charitable projects through its global
team competition, “Connected to
Care.” Around 500 project proposals
were submitted from around the globe;
150 of these r­ eceived up to €5,000
apiece, amounting to a total of
€700,000 in support. BASF also
promotes employees’ volunteer work
outside of its anniversary celebrations,
through various regional projects.

Global community: A new well for an orphanage
in Cameroon, a restored temple for residents of
Karak in Malaysia – employees around the world
got involved in numerous projects addressing
social needs.

SMART ENERGY

An energetic partnership
In Japan, around 50 employees
from BASF and Panasonic Automotive &
Industrial Systems Company came
together in a co-creation workshop to
discuss current energy-related topics,
ranging from power electronics to sensors
and energy harvesting. From numerous
innovative suggestions, the companies
chose the most promising ideas
surrounding the topic “systems for storing
heat energy through chemical reactions”
as a basis for future collaboration and to
benefit from knowledge exchange.
Panasonic and BASF, who had not had a
partnership prior to the workshop, also
plan to work together in research and
development. The two companies are
currently hashing out the details of the
­collaboration.

150 YEARS BASF

URBAN LIVING

New York’s next trendy neighborhood?
How can we improve urban development and the
housing situation in metropolises like New York, where
the population is booming? This was the question posed
by involved citizens, students, engineers and other
participants of a ­design competition in New York. The
assignment: How might Van Brunt Street in Red Hook,
Brooklyn, look in the future? The Red Hook neighborhood
is marked by limited access to public transportation.
Buildings in need of renovation, susceptibility to hurricane
and flood damage, and a high level of socio-economic
diversity all demand creative and practical solutions to
support the neighborhood’s ­future. The winning concept
included an ingenious canal system and the idea of
invigorating the local economy with a “Made in Red Hook”
product label. BASF plans to c
­ ontinue these discussions
and use the ideas for concrete proposals to benefit Red
Hook and other cities.
  Watch videos of our tour stop in New York by searching youtube.com for:

Smart design: How can Red Hook’s community be optimally
connected to public transportation and gain better access to social
and cultural amenities?

150 YEARS OF BASF

URBAN LIVING / FOOD

A change in perspective

90 minutes of water a day: For some
residents of the Indian metropolis of
Mumbai, it is crucial to store drinking water
in containers. For one week, employees of
BASF and Save the Children learned in
person what this means for many families
on a daily basis.

How can we improve access to clean water in a rapidly growing
­metropolis like Mumbai? Around 250 experts from industry, the
nonprofit sector, science and society all set to work on this question.
One example was a joint project initiated by BASF and Save the
Children, in which several employees dove into everyday life in Mumbai
for one week. Some were guests in families who have running water for
only 90 minutes a day. It is important for these families to store water
in containers. But space is often at a premium, and the water can
sometimes get contaminated. For Nitin Sharma, BASF India Ltd.,
joining a family for a week was an indispensable part of the project:
“We can then assess whether and how innovations from BASF can
contribute to the solution, whether it’s a new material for stackable
water containers, an innovative filter system, or a combination of
existing systems. It’s crucial – for commercial success as well – to
understand what the ­people in the community really need.”

150 YEARS OF BASF

SMART ENERGY

Putting daylight to good use
The Museu del
Disseny in
Barcelona: For five
days, the building
played host to the
Creator Space™
tour.

In Barcelona, employees from Switzerland won
first prize at the jamming session finals on energy
efficiency. Their impressive proposal, entitled
“Out of the darkness and into the light – intelligent
daylight management in buildings,” addressed how
less than 40% of available daylight is used in
buildings today. The Swiss colleagues developed
an idea for electricity-free technology based on
microoptic foil that captures up to 95% of daylight
and redirects it into the building’s interior. What
makes this technology unique is that it does not
rely on classic transparent building components,
like windows. The application could be used for
structures like multi-family houses and office
buildings, but also for factories and plants.

URBAN LIVING

Moving for power
A group of mobility experts and fitness
fans from all over the world got together
for a jamming session between BASF
and ­adidas in New York. The topic: the
future of urban transportation. The
results of the exchange ranged from
a smartphone app that networks
bicyclists to a floating ­residential
neighborhood on the Hudson River.
One promising idea was to establish
a volunteer cyclists’ association that
generates electricity by riding a bike.
This could supply schools, libraries and
other community organizations.

Communal sportsmanship:
­Participants in the jamming session
held by BASF and adidas developed
an idea for a cycling association that
uses the energy generated from
­pedaling for the public good.

How we create value

How we create value

Financial and nonfinancial value drivers make an essential contribution
to BASF’s success. We want to understand how these work together,
and derive targeted measures for increasing the positive impact of our
actions and further minimizing the negative effects. This intention
forms the basis of our integrated reporting.
The following overview provides examples of how we create value
for our company, the environment and society. It is modeled on the
framework of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC).
Both financial and nonfinancial value ­drivers – such as environmental,
production-related, personnel and knowledge-based factors, along
with aspects of society and partnerships – form the foundation
of our a
­ ctions. Through our business model, these inputs are
transformed into various outputs: the results of our actions.

To Our Shareholders
Letter from the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors﻿

Dear Shareholder,
As this report goes to print, we are looking back at one of the most turbulent
starts to the year for decades. At times, oil prices fell to below $27 per barrel –
the lowest level since 2003. In 2015, oil prices averaged $52 per barrel, almost half
the previous year’s figure. This price slump reflects not only an oil surplus but also a
slowdown in global economic growth, especially in emerging markets. Our share
price has also suffered from these developments. Since the beginning of the year it
has fallen significantly to below €60 and is thus substantially lower than the peak of
nearly €97 in April 2015.
These figures underline the level of uncertainty about the future performance of
the global economy. This raises some legitimate questions: How will demand for
chemical products develop? What will be the impact if oil prices remain low for any
length of time? How does one steer a company like BASF in such turbulent and
challenging times?
A look back at the past year provides some initial answers to these questions.
Compared with 2014, our goals for 2015 were to increase sales slightly and match
the high level of income from operations (EBIT) before special items. This was
based on the assumption that higher earnings from our chemicals activities would
compensate for the expected decline in earnings in our Oil & Gas segment due to
lower oil prices. We planned with oil prices in the range of $60 to $70 per barrel.

To Our Shareholders 
Letter from the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors ﻿﻿

BASF Report 2015

The start to 2015 confirmed these goals: Although volume growth weakened in the
first quarter, margins developed satisfactorily and oil prices moved in the direction
of the expected corridor. However, the first signs of an economic slowdown also
became apparent – especially in emerging economies. Important industries such
as agriculture and automotive developed more weakly than expected. In contrast,
the U.S. economy proved relatively robust. The weakness of the euro supported
the competitiveness of our European sites.

“In our chemicals business, the oil
price initially had a positive impact
on margins. Soon, however, it was
clear that our customers were
becoming increasingly cautious.”

In our chemicals business, the oil price initially had a positive impact on margins.
Soon, however, it was clear that our customers were becoming increasingly
cautious. They held back from ordering – in the expectation of further declines
in prices for chemical products. Pressure on margins increased in the course of
the year, particularly in the fourth quarter.
In such a situation it helps to build on the strengths of BASF and keep costs and
cash under control. We were quick to adapt production to reflect weaker demand,
reduced inventories and thus strengthened cash flow. Our STEP excellence
program, which had been running since 2012, was completed faster than originally
planned and we therefore launched a new program – DrivE – in September. It is
expected to contribute €1 billion to earnings annually by the end of 2018.
At the end of the third quarter, we completed the divestiture of our gas trading and
storage business to Gazprom. This business contributed approximately €10 billion
to sales and €260 million to EBIT before special items in the first three quarters of
2015. In combination with the further fall in oil prices, it became apparent at the
end of October that we would probably not reach our annual goals. In 2015, EBIT
before special items was 8% lower than in 2014, although we improved earnings in
the chemicals business as planned. EBIT fell by 18%, in particular due to price-­
related impairments to assets in the Oil & Gas segment. As a result, oil prices
thwarted our plans in 2015.
As the Board of Executive Directors, we cannot be satisfied with last year’s
performance. Nevertheless, the BASF team did a good job. On behalf of the
Board of Executive Directors, I thank all employees for their efforts in what was a
challenging year.

“We remain committed to our
ambitious dividend policy and
will again propose to the Annual
Shareholders’ Meeting to increase
the dividend by €0.10 to €2.90 per
share.”

We remain committed to our ambitious dividend policy and will again propose to
the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting to increase the dividend by €0.10 to €2.90 per
share. As a result, we would pay out almost €2.7 billion to our shareholders. Based
on the year-end price of €70.72 for 2015, BASF shares again offer a high dividend
yield of around 4.1%.
What do we expect in 2016? We assume that oil prices will remain low and are
basing our planning on $40 per barrel. As a consequence and in particular due
to the divestiture of our gas trading and storage business, sales will decline
significantly. We aim to increase sales volumes in our chemicals and agricultural
solutions businesses and above all ensure better utilization of the capacities that
came on stream in 2015. This is an ambitious goal because our markets are likely
to grow more slowly than in 2015.

BASF Report 2015 

We expect to achieve a slightly lower level of EBIT before special items than in
2015. We want to again increase earnings in our chemicals and crop protection
businesses, but this will not be sufficient to compensate for the massive decline in
earnings in the oil and gas business. The oil price will continue to be the biggest
risk in 2016. If it should remain below our expected average of $40 per barrel,
then we will be unlikely to offset this by means of higher earnings in the chemicals
business.

To Our Shareholders
Letter from the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors﻿

“We expect to achieve a slightly
lower level of EBIT before special
items than in 2015. The oil price
will continue to be the biggest risk
in 2016.”

Strict cost and expenditure discipline will therefore also be top priority in 2016. This
applies in particular to cutting back on capital expenditures, which we will reduce
significantly following the increase in 2013 to 2015. A special challenge in this area
will be in adjusting expenditures for the development of oil and gas fields.
We will continue to actively manage our portfolio. In 2015, we made a number of
smaller, technology-driven acquisitions, but we also streamlined our portfolio. We
divested parts of our pharmaceutical ingredients business and are preparing the
sale of our industrial coatings business. As a result, we will be able to concentrate
even more closely on particularly promising areas of activity. In the future, we will
continue to review possible acquisitions very critically as to whether they actually
create value for our shareholders. Not everything that is en vogue meets this
criterion.
Research and development and thus innovations remain at the heart of our
competitiveness. In 2015, we reached our goal of achieving sales of around
€10 billion with new and improved products that have been on the market for
less than five years. Following a significant increase in research and development
spending in the past years, we plan to maintain expenditure at the previous year’s
level in 2016. Our goal is to convince our customers by continually offering new
products and solutions. Since customers are increasingly focusing on sustainability,
we see business opportunities that we want to seize through our innovations.
We will further increase the proportion of sales from products that contribute
particularly to sustainability.
Innovation and cooperation with our partners also played a central role in our
150th anniversary year. The wide range of activities, which you will also find in
this report, reflect the dynamics of our industry and the contributions that chemistry
and BASF – together with its customers – make towards enabling a better life,
technical progress and efficient use of resources. This power and dynamism are
hallmarks of BASF – both when the company was founded 150 years ago and also
today.
Yours,

Kurt Bock

thus innovations remain at the

customers by continually offering

BASF once again included

Stock markets were marked by a high level of volatility in
2015. This was largely a factor of fickle economic development, ­slowdown in the emerging markets and the threat
of Greece’s payment default. In this volatile environment,
the BASF share rose by 1.2%, trading at €70.72 at the end
of 2015. We stand by our ambitious dividend policy and
will propose a dividend of €2.90 per share at the Annual
Shareholders’ Meeting – an ­increase of 3.6% compared
with the previous year. BASF enjoys solid financing and
good credit ratings.

eurozone produced robust economic figures. This was followed by considerable dips, due in large part to the weak
economic situation in China and severe recession in Brazil.
The further depreciation of the euro, positive economic development and speculation as to a renewed expansion of the
ECB’s monetary policy initially led to a fourth-quarter boost in
share prices, including the BASF share. Prices dropped again
in December, however, after the ECB ­announced intentions to
continue easing its monetary policy, a decision that disappointed many investors who had anticipated more expansive
measures.

Adjusted for two-for-one stock split conducted in 2008

With over 500,000 shareholders, BASF is one of the largest
publicly owned companies with a high free float. An analysis of
the shareholder structure carried out at the end of 2015
showed that, at 16% of share capital, the United States and
Canada made up the largest regional group of institutional
­investors. Institutional investors from Germany accounted for
9%. Shareholders from the United Kingdom and Ireland hold
just under 11% of BASF shares, while institutional investors
from the rest of Europe hold a further 21% of capital. Approximately 27% of the company’s share capital is held by private
investors, most of whom reside in Germany. BASF is therefore
one of the DAX 30 companies with the largest percentage of
private shareholders.

BASF Report 2015

BASF a sustainable investment

Good credit ratings and solid financing

▪▪ BASF once again part of DJSI World in 2015
▪▪ CDLI: inclusion once again shows BASF’s
transparent reporting on climate protection

BASF has good credit ratings, especially in comparison with
competitors in the chemical industry. BASF was rated “­ A1/P-1/
outlook stable” by rating agency Moody’s and “A+/A-1/outlook negative” by Standard & Poor’s. We have solid financing.
At the end of 2015, the ﬁnancial indebtedness of the BASF
Group was €15.2 billion with liquid funds of €2.2 billion. The
average maturity of our financial indebtedness was 5.2 years.
The company’s medium to long-term debt ﬁnancing is predominantly based on corporate bonds with a balanced maturity proﬁle. For short-term debt ﬁnancing, BASF SE has a
commercial paper program with an issuing volume of up to
­­$12.5 billion. As backup for the commercial paper program,
there are committed, broadly syndicated credit lines of €6 billion available; these are not being used at this time.

In September 2015, BASF shares were included in the Dow
Jones Sustainability World Index (DJSI World) for the fifteenth
year in succession. As one of the most well-known sustainability indexes, the DJSI World represents the top 10% of the
2,500 largest companies in the S&P Global Broad Market
­Index based on economic, environmental and social criteria.
CDP, an international organization that analyzes companies’ climate protection data, has placed BASF among the
leading companies in the world for climate protection reporting. With the highest possible ratings for reporting t­ ransparency
and completeness, we achieved top scores among DAX
companies and in the Energy & Materials sector in 2015, thus
qualifying for the Climate Disclosure Leadership Index (CDLI)
for the eleventh time. The CDP represents 822 institutional
­investors with around $95 trillion in assets under management.
Investors use CDP indexes as assessment tools.
In 2015, BASF was unable to qualify for the Carbon Performance Leadership Index (CPLI), which judges companies’
climate protection activities. Inclusion in the CPLI requires a
considerable reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with the previous year (–4%). Measures already taken in
previous years are not eligible for consideration. BASF has
already implemented numerous greenhouse gas reduction
­
measures in the past that have decreased absolute emissions
by just under 50% since 1990 (BASF business excluding the
Oil & Gas segment). Further significant improvements at this
high level can only be achieved with difficulty, which meant
that we were unable to meet the CPLI’s high reduction
­requirements.

Analysts’ recommendations
Around 25 financial analysts regularly publish studies on BASF.
At the end of 2015, 32% recommended buying our shares
(end of 2014: 41%) and 40% recommended holding them
(end of 2014: 38%), while 28% had a sell rating (end of 2014:
21%). On December 31, 2015, the average target share price
according to analyst consensus estimates was €76.86.

In 2015, we once again put on roadshows geared speciﬁcally
toward investors who base their investment decisions on
sustainability criteria. There, we especially outlined our measures for climate protection and energy efﬁciency. In addition,
we conducted several special creditor relations roadshows,
where creditors and credit analysts could learn more about our
business and our financing strategy.
Investors can ﬁnd comprehensive information about BASF
and BASF shares on our website and on social media platforms.
Analysts and investors have confirmed the quality of our
communication work: We took several leading rankings in
­Institutional Investor Magazine’s annual survey in 2015. These
included first prize in the Best Analyst Days in Europe (Chemicals) category for the Chemicals Investor Day held in London
in 2014. Moreover, our investor relations activities were
honored by the U.K.’s Investor Relations Society with first
­
place in the “International” category.

5 segments
13 divisions
84 strategic business units

At BASF, we create chemistry for a sustainable future.
As the world’s leading chemical company, we combine
economic success with environmental protection and
­social responsibility. The approximately 112,000 employees in the BASF Group work on contributing to the
­success of our customers in nearly all sectors and almost
every country in the world. Our portfolio is arranged
into five segments: Chemicals, Performance Products,
­Functional Materials & Solutions, Agricultural Solutions
and Oil & Gas.

Organization of the BASF Group
▪▪ Thirteen divisions grouped into five segments
▪▪ Regional divisions, corporate units and competence
centers support our business
Since the beginning of 2015, thirteen divisions divided into five
segments bear operational responsibility and manage our 61
global and regional business units. The divisions develop
strategies for our 84 strategic business units and are organized according to sectors or products.

At the end of September, we rearranged our activities in the
Oil & Gas segment, which are bundled into the Wintershall
Group. As part of the asset swap with our partner Gazprom,
we handed over our shares in the previously jointly run natural
gas trading and storage business and in return are expanding
our oil and gas production in western Siberia. We continue to
operate the natural gas transport business together with
­Gazprom, but do not report on it separately.
The regional divisions contribute to the local development
of our business and help exploit market potential. They are
also responsible for optimizing infrastructure for our business.
For financial reporting purposes, our divisions are organized
into the following four regions: Europe; North America; Asia
Pacific; and South America, Africa, Middle East.
Three central divisions, six corporate units and ten competence centers provide services for the BASF Group in areas
such as finance, investor relations, communications, human
resources, research, engineering, and site management, as
well as environment, health and safety.

▪▪ Technology and Know-How Verbund

BASF has companies in more than 80 countries and supplies
products to a large number of business partners in nearly
­every part of the world. In 2015, we generated 42% of our
sales (excluding Oil & Gas) with customers in Europe. In addition, 27% of sales were achieved in North America; 22% in
Asia Pacific; and 9% in South America, Africa, Middle East.
Based on the entire BASF Group, 52% of our sales were to
customers in Europe, 22% in North America, 18% in Asia
­Pacific and 8% in South America, Africa, Middle East.
We operate six Verbund sites and 338 additional production sites worldwide. Our Verbund site in Ludwigshafen is the
world’s largest integrated chemical complex. This was where
the Verbund principle was originally developed and steadily
honed before being put into practice at additional sites.

The Verbund system is one of BASF’s great strengths. Here,
we add value as one company by making efficient use of our
resources. The Production Verbund, for example, intelligently
links production units and energy demand so that waste
heat can be used as energy in other plants. Furthermore,
b­y-products of one plant can serve as feedstock elsewhere.
In this system, chemical processes run with lower energy
consumption and higher product yield. This not only saves us
raw materials and energy, it also avoids emissions, lowers
logistics costs and makes use of synergies.
We also make use of the Verbund principle for more than
production, applying it for technologies, knowledge, employees, customers, and partners, as well. Expert knowledge is
pooled into our global research platforms.
For more on the Verbund concept, see basf.com/en/verbund

We create chemistry
for a sustainable future

As strategic basis for our ­
success on the market

As guideline for our
conduct and actions

With the “We create chemistry” strategy, BASF has set
itself ambitious goals in order to strengthen its position as
the world’s leading chemical company. We want to
­contribute to a sustainable future and have embedded
this into our corporate purpose: “We create chemistry for
a sustainable future.”

Our leading position as an integrated global chemical ­company
gives us the chance to make important contributions in the
following three areas:
––Resources, environment and climate
––Food and nutrition
––Quality of life

In 2050, nearly ten billion people will live on Earth. While the
world’s population and its demands will keep growing, the
planet’s resources are finite. On the one hand, population
growth is associated with huge global challenges; and yet we
also see many opportunities, especially for the chemical
­industry.

We therefore act in accordance with four strategic principles.

Our corporate purpose
▪▪ We create chemistry for a sustainable future

Our strategic principles
▪▪
▪▪
▪▪
▪▪

We add value as one company
We innovate to make our customers more successful
We drive sustainable solutions
We form the best team

We want to contribute to a world that provides a viable future
with enhanced quality of life for everyone. We do so by creating chemistry for our customers and society and by making
the best use of available resources. ­

We add value as one company. Our Verbund concept is
unique in the industry. Encompassing the Production Verbund,
Technology Verbund and Know-How Verbund as well as all
relevant customer industries worldwide, this sophisticated and
profitable system will continue to be expanded. This is how we
combine our strengths and add value as one company.

We live our corporate purpose by:
––Sourcing and producing responsibly
––Acting as a fair and reliable partner
––Connecting creative minds to find the best solutions for
market needs

We innovate to make our customers more successful. We
want to align our business even more with our customers’
needs and contribute to their success with innovative and
sustainable solutions. Through close partnerships with customers and research institutes, we link expertise in chemistry,

For us, this is what successful business is all about.

The BASF brand

Global standards

▪▪ Above-average awareness of, and trust in,
BASF brand in chemical industry

▪▪ We act according to clearly deﬁned values and
standards of conduct that comply with or go
beyond laws and regulations
▪▪ We review our performance with regular audits and
a three-pronged monitoring system

We rely on a strong brand in order to further expand our position as the world’s leading chemical company. Our brand is
derived from our strategy and our corporate purpose – “We
create chemistry for a sustainable future” – as well as our
strategic principles and values.
“Connected” describes the essence of the BASF brand.
Connectivity is one of BASF’s great strengths. Our Verbund
concept – realized in production, technologies, knowledge,
employees, customers and partners – enables innovative
solutions for a sustainable future. The claim that “We create
chemistry,” as stated in the BASF logo, helps us embed this
solution-oriented strategy in the public consciousness. Our
brand creates value by helping communicate its benefits for
our stakeholders as well as our values.
Wherever our stakeholders encounter our brand, we want
to convince them that BASF stands for connectivity, intelligent
solutions, value-adding partnerships, an attractive working
environment and sustainability. This contributes to our customers’ confidence in their buying decisions and to our company value.
We are constantly developing our brand image by measuring awareness of and trust in our brand, and therefore in our
company. A global market research study conducted every
two years showed in 2014 that, in terms of awareness and
trust, BASF is above the industry average in numerous countries. The study collected data on respondents’ aided awareness of BASF and our most important competitors. Our goal is
to continue increasing awareness of BASF in all of our relevant
markets.

Our standards fulfill or exceed existing laws and regulations
and take internationally recognized principles into account. We
respect and promote:
––The ten principles of the U.N. Global Compact
––The United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights
and the two U.N. human rights covenants
––The ILO’s core labor standards and its Tripartite Declaration
of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and ­Social
Policy (MNE Declaration)
––The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises
––The Responsible Care Global Charter
––The German Corporate Governance Code
We stipulate rules for our employees with standards that apply
throughout the Group. We set ourselves ambitious goals with
voluntary commitments and review our environmental, health
and safety performance using our Responsible Care Management System. A worldwide monitoring system ensures our
compliance with labor and social standards. At its core are
three main pillars:
––External compliance hotlines
––The annual survey of our Group companies
––Close dialog with our stakeholders, such as employee representatives and international organizations
Our business partners are expected to uphold prevailing laws
and requirements and to align their actions with internationally
recognized principles. We have established monitoring systems to ensure this.

Innovations for a sustainable future

Business expansion in emerging markets

Innovations in chemistry are necessary to meet the needs of
the growing world population on a long-term basis. The development of innovative products and solutions is, therefore, of
vital significance for BASF. In the long term, we aim to continue
significantly increasing sales of these products and solutions,
and earn higher margins with them than the rest of our port­
folio. This means effective and efficient research is becoming
increasingly important. Aside from the research and development activities in our established business, we are also working on growth fields to tap new business areas for BASF.
Through these, we can make a decisive contribution to innovative solutions for global challenges and contribute to sustainable development. We regularly review the growth fields in
terms of their attractiveness for BASF. We will tailor our technology fields even more closely to the BASF Group’s needs
and reorganize them into key technologies. Key technologies
combine skills and knowledge in order to maintain the longterm competitiveness of our business and products.
Our worldwide research expertise is pooled into three
platforms each headquartered in one of the regions particu­
larly ­significant for us: Europe, Asia Pacific and North America:
Process Research & Chemical Engineering (Ludwigshafen,
Germany), Advanced Materials & Systems Research (Shanghai, China) and Bioscience Research (Research Triangle Park,
North Carolina). In the long term, we aim to conduct half of our
research and development activities outside of Europe and are
continuing to expand our R&D activities in both Asia and
America. This means focusing on growth in regional markets.
Our stronger global presence opens up new opportunities to
participate in regional developments in innovation and gain
access to local talent.

In the years ahead, we want to grow even more vigorously in
the emerging markets and further expand our position there.
Today’s emerging markets are expected to account for around
60% of global chemical production in 2020. We aim to benefit
from the above-average growth in these regions and therefore
plan to invest more than a quarter of our capital expenditures
there between 2016 and 2020.
The weakening of the emerging markets continued in
2015. In China, growth slowed down as part of the orientation
toward a more consumption-oriented growth model. This
dampened growth not only in Asia, but also in the emerging
markets of South America that export raw materials. While the
Argentinian economy was able to stabilize at a low level, Brazil
slid into a sharp recession that intensified toward the end of
the year as domestic and foreign demand weakened. Russia,
too, experienced a significant decline in its gross domestic
product in light of low oil prices and ongoing mutual trade
sanctions on the part of the E.U. and United States.
Compared with 2014, sales at our companies headquartered in the emerging markets rose by 3% to €16,230 million.
This was largely the result of positive currency effects and
increased volumes. Measured by customer location, sales
­
(excluding the Oil & Gas segment) in the emerging markets
grew by 2% to €19,572 million. This brought sales to customers in emerging markets to around 34% of total sales (excluding Oil & Gas) in 2015. In the years ahead, we want to continue
expanding this percentage.

Goals
We carry out our corporate purpose, “We create chemistry for
a sustainable future,” by pursuing ambitious goals along our
entire value chain. In this way, we aim to achieve profitable
growth and take on social and environmental responsibility,

focusing on issues through which we as a company can make
a significant contribution. We updated and revamped our
goals to this effect in 2015.

Growth and profitability
In 2011, we set ourselves sales and earnings goals for 2015
and 2020 as part of the “We create chemistry” strategy. In
October 2014, we announced that we would not reach the
finan­cial goals for 2015, primarily because gross domestic
product and industrial and chemical production had grown at
a considerably slower average rate from 2010 to 2015 than
our strategy had anticipated.
In September 2015, we reduced our expectations for the
global economic environment from 2015 to 2020 (previous
forecast in parentheses):
––Growth of gross domestic product: 3.0% (3.2%)
––Growth in industrial production: 3.5% (3.7%)
––Growth in chemical production: 3.9% (4.0%)

As a consequence, we no longer adhere to the financial goals
previously stated for 2020.
Our aim for the years ahead is, on average, to grow sales
slightly faster and EBITDA considerably faster than global
chemical production, and to earn a significant premium on our
cost of capital. Moreover, we strive for a high level of free cash
flow each year, either raising or at least maintaining the dividend at the prior-year level.

Value-based management
“We add value as one company” is one of the four principles of our “We create chemistry” strategy. To create

solutions in the company’s day-to-day operations and
implement these in an effective and efficient manner.

EBIT after cost of capital
▪▪ Performance and management indicator
Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) after cost of capital is
a key performance and management indicator for the BASF
Group and its operating divisions and business units. This
ﬁgure combines the company’s economic situation as summarized in EBIT with the costs for the capital made available to
us by shareholders and creditors. When we earn a premium
on our cost of capital, we exceed the return expected by our
shareholders.

Calculation of cost of capital percentage
The cost of capital percentage (weighted average cost of
capital, WACC) is determined using the weighted cost of capi­
tal from equity and borrowing costs. The cost of equity is
ascer­tained using the Capital Asset Pricing Model. Borrowing
costs are determined based on the ﬁnancing costs of the
BASF Group.
EBIT after cost of capital, which we use as a steering para­
meter, is a pretax figure. Therefore, we use the current average
tax rate to derive the pretax cost of capital percentage from
the WACC. In 2015, this cost of capital percentage was 11%;
in 2016, this figure will be 10% due to lower capital market
interest rates. Based on this, an EBIT threshold is calculated
which must then be reached by all operating units put t­ ogether
in order to earn the cost of capital of the BASF Group.

Value-based management throughout the
company
▪▪ Exercising a value-oriented mindset in day-to-day
business by every employee
For us, value-based management means the daily focus
placed on value by all of our employees. To this end, we have
identified value drivers that show how each and every unit in
the company can create value. We develop performance indicators for the individual value drivers that help us to plan and
pursue changes.
An important factor in ensuring the successful implementation of value-based management is linking the goals of BASF
to the individual target agreements of employees. In the operating units, the most important performance indicators are the
achievement of a positive EBIT after cost of capital and a
competitive level of profitability. By contrast, the functional
units’ contribution to value is assessed on the basis of effectiveness and efficiency.
All this forms a consistent system of value drivers and key
indicators for the individual levels and functions at BASF. In
addition to EBIT after cost of capital, EBIT and EBIT before
special items are the most signiﬁcant performance indicators
for measuring economic success as well as for steering the
BASF Group and its operating units.
We primarily comment on EBIT before special items on a
segment and division level in our financial reporting because
this figure is adjusted for influences not associated with typical
business operations. This makes it particularly suitable for
describing financial development over time. In addition to EBIT
before special items, we also report on sales as a further main
driver for EBIT after cost of capital. BASF’s nonfinancial targets
are focused more on the long term, and are not used for shortterm steering.
According to our value-based management concept, all
employees can make a contribution in their business area to
help ensure that we earn the targeted premium on our cost of
capital. We pass this value-based management concept on to
our team around the world through seminars and training
events, thereby promoting entrepreneurial thinking at all levels
within BASF.

Our strategy — Sustainability management﻿

Sustainability management
Sustainability is embedded into our corporate strategy.
We employ the various tools of our sustainability management toward living out our company purpose: “We create
chemistry for a sustainable future.” This is how we
underpin the strategic principle, “We drive sustainable
­
solutions.” By integrating sustainability aspects into our
core business, we take advantage of business opportunities and minimize risks along the value chain.

Strategy
▪▪ Identifying significant topics and trends
▪▪ Taking advantage of business opportunities
▪▪ Minimizing risks
As the world’s leading chemical company, we aim to add value
in the long term for our company, the environment, and
­society. Sustainability is simultaneously an essential part of our
risk management and a driver for growth. That is why we
­incorporate aspects of sustainability into our decision-making
processes and define clear responsibilities for this in our
­organization.
Through our materiality analysis, continuous dialog with
stakeholders, and our many years of experience, we are
­always developing a better understanding of significant topics
and trends as well as potential opportunities and risks along
our value chain.
We used a materiality analysis in 2013 to identify and prioritize relevant sustainability topics for BASF. Material aspects
derived from this include, for example, energy and climate,
water, resources and ecosystems, responsible production,
and employment and employability. These are the focus areas
of our reporting. We have also integrated them into our steering processes and used them as the basis for working out our
new global sustainability goals.
In order to properly account for changing conditions and
requirements, we initiated an internal analysis in 2015 to ­review
the results of the materiality analysis. We have already started
involving numerous colleagues and in 2016, we want to
­exchange with external stakeholders.
We take advantage of business opportunities by offering
our customers innovative products and solutions that contribute to sustainable development. We ensure that sustainability
criteria are integrated into our business units’ development
and implementation of their strategies, research projects, and
innovation processes. For example, we identify the sustainability value drivers and risks for specific value chains. We
analyze the sustainability strategies of competitors and
­
­customers in order to tap new business opportunities.
Our risk management supports our long-term business
success. We aim to reduce risks by setting ourselves globally
uniform requirements for environmental and health protection,

safety and security, product stewardship, compliance, and
labor and social standards that frequently go beyond legal
require­
ments. Internal monitoring systems and complaint
mechanisms enable us to check compliance with these standards: these include, for example, questionnaires, audits and
compliance hotlines. All employees and managers are required
to abide by our global Code of Conduct, which defines a
mandatory framework for our business activities.
Our investment decisions for property, plant and equipment and financial assets also involve sustainability criteria.
Our decision-making is supported by expert appraisals that
assess economic implications as well as potential effects on
the environment, human rights or local communities.

Engaging stakeholders
▪▪ Constant dialog with our stakeholders
Our stakeholders include employees, customers, suppliers
and shareholders, as well as experts in science, industry, poli­
tics, society and media. Parts of our business activities, such
as the use of new technologies, are frequently viewed by our
stakeholders with a critical eye. In order to increase societal
acceptance for our business activities, we take on critical
questions, assess our business activities in terms of their
sustainability, and communicate transparently. Such dialogs
help us to even better evaluate which measures we should
pursue to keep people informed on these topics, establish
trust, and form partnerships.
To get our stakeholders even more closely involved, the
Board of Executive Directors once again met with international
experts from science and industry – the Stakeholder Advisory
Council – in 2015 to discuss important aspects of sustain­
ability. These included topics like the influence of externalities
and the challenges of renewable raw materials, especially
palm kernel oil.
We have a particular responsibility toward our production
sites’ neighbors. With the established community advisory
panels, we aim to promote open exchange between citizens
and our site management, and strengthen trust in our activities. In 2015, for example, we tackled a concrete recommendation made by the Stakeholder Advisory Council in 2014 and
developed global recommendations for the community advisory panel system.

BASF is also involved in worldwide initiatives with various
stakeholder groups, such as the U.N. Global Compact. The
U.N. Secretary General appointed BASF’s Chairman of the
Board of Executive Directors as a member of the U.N. Global
Compact Board for another three years. In the worldwide
network of Global Compact LEAD, we are participating in the
implementation of the “Agenda 2030” adopted by the United
Nations in 2015, along with its Sustainable Development
Goals. BASF is also active in local Global Compact networks.
We have been part of the Global Business Initiative on
Human Rights since 2012, a group of globally operating companies from different industries whose goal is to advance
­respect for human rights in business. This included presenting
examples of how to implement the U.N. Guiding Principles on
Business and Human Rights. In 2015, we were also involved
in the consultation process of the German government’s
­national plan of action on this topic.
Furthermore, BASF is a founding member of a cross-­
industry initiative of the World Business Council for Sustainable
Development (WBCSD). Together, a method was developed
for evaluating the societal impact of products throughout their
entire life cycle.
Our lobbying and political communications are conducted
in accordance with transparent guidelines and in keeping with
our publicly stated positions. BASF does not in principle support political parties. The BASF Corporation Employees Political Action Committee, established by our employees in the
United States, is an independent, federally registered ­employee
association that collects donations for political purposes and
independently decides how these are used.

Creating value
▪▪ Creating value along the entire value chain
▪▪ New goal for products that make a particular
contribution to sustainability
We promoted sustainability topics in 2015 through various
projects together with partners along the value chain. With the
help of our ecoefficiency analysis, for example, we analyzed
the economic and environmental implications of various coating processes in a study conducted with Dürr, a machine and
plant manufacturing company, and with our customer BMW.
The goal was to discover ways to improve the ecoefficiency of
serial coating methods, such as by saving ­
resources. The
study showed that the “integrated process” – a coating procedure that saves a paint layer – represents a more economical
and ecological alternative to other processes evaluated.
For the 2015 business year, BASF conducted sustain­ability
assessments and ratings for 95.4% of its entire portfolio of
more than 60,000 specific product applications – which
account for €64.9 billion in sales – using the Sustainable
­
­Solution Steering® method. This externally validated procedure
­allows us to determine how our products contribute to sustainability, and we consider their application in various markets
and industries.
We want to increase the proportion of “Accelerator” products in the long term: in other words, products that contribute
particularly to sustainability in the value chain, and are characterized by, on average, higher growth rates and profitability.
We have therefore set ourselves a concrete goal in 2015: By
2020, we aim to raise the proportion of sales from Accelerator
products to 28%. At 26.6%, this figure already closely
­
­approached the 2020 target in 2015. This development is
mainly based on portfolio measures undertaken in 2015,
­especially in the Oil & Gas segment.

One of these Accelerator products is Elastocool® Advanced –
an innovative insulation material for refrigerators and freezers.
It boasts a high level of resource efficiency while also possessing improved insulation properties. Elastocool® contributes to
achieving the E.U.’s top energy efficiency levels in refrigerators
and freezers.
The chelating agent Trilon® M is another Accelerator,
­having established itself as a high-performance alternative to
phosphate in dishwashing machine detergents. European
Union regulations will almost entirely prohibit the use of phosphates for this application in Europe starting 2017. Chelating
agents’ most important task is to intercept metal ions in dishwasher water in order to inhibit calcium buildup on dishes.
Trilon® M is readily biodegradable, and also improves cleaning
power while fulfilling the criteria for the E.U. Ecolabel.
For all products that are classified as “Challenged” and do
not fulfill our major sustainability criteria, we want to develop
prompt plans of action. These action plans can include
­research projects, reformulations or even replacing one product with an alternative product. Based on the results of the
initial analyses, action plans had been created for 99% of all
Challenged products by the end of 2015.

The products for which we have developed action plans
­include, for example, polyfluorinated substances that are often
used in paper packaging coatings for their water and oilresistant properties. Although European authorities regard any
hazard to people or the environment as very low, stricter regulations are anticipated in the future as these substances biodegrade with difficulty. As a result, the Sustainable Solution
Steering® method has classified them as Challenged in their
use for paper coatings. BASF decided early on not to continue
selling these substances. The new product solutions use
substances whose chemical properties prevent them from
accumulating in the environment. Furthermore, paper coated
with these new materials is biodegradable and can either be
processed into compost by composting facilities (ecovio®) or
recycled (Ultramid® and Epotal®). We will market oil-proof
barriers based on these products in the future; they are classified as Accelerators.

Innovations based on effective and efficient research and
development are an important growth engine for BASF.
We work in interdisciplinary teams on innovative
processes and products for a sustainable future. This
­
is how we ensure our long-term business success
with chemistry-based solutions for almost all sectors of
­industry.
A growing need for energy, food and clean water, limited
­resources and a booming world population – reconciling all
these factors is the greatest challenge of our time. Innovations
based on chemistry play a key role here, as they contribute
decisively to new solutions.
We set ourselves ambitious goals: In 2015, we wanted to
achieve sales of around €10 billion with new and improved
products or applications that had been on the market since
2011. Despite the challenging market environment, we have
achieved this sales goal. EBITDA from innovative products and
processes on the market since 2011 was below the targeted
amount of €2.5 billion in 2015, according to current estimates.
Yet we nevertheless reached our associated goal, which was
to achieve margins with innovations that exceeded those of
the rest of the product portfolio. In the long term, we aim to
continue significantly increasing sales and earnings with new
and improved products.
For more on our goals, see page 28

Our innovative strength is based on our global team of highly
qualified employees with various disciplines. We had around
10,000 employees involved in research and development in
2015. At the beginning of 2015, we arranged the central
research units Process Research & Chemical Engineering,
­
Advanced Materials & Systems Research, and Bioscience
Research into three global platforms each headquartered in
one of the ­regions particularly significant for us: Europe, Asia
Pacific and North ­America. As knowledge and competence
centers, they form the core of our global Know-How Verbund,
joined by the d
­ evelopment units in our operating divisions.
BASF New B
­ usiness and BASF Venture Capital supplement
this network. Their task is to develop attractive new markets
and new ­business models for BASF based on new technologies.

Global network in science and industry
▪▪ Network with over 600 universities, research institutes
and companies
▪▪ Successful collaboration with leading universities
within UNIQUE excellence program
Our global network with more than 600 excellent universities,
research institutes and companies is an important part of our
Know-How Verbund. We collaborate with them in many different disciplines in order to achieve our growth targets. In our
excellence program UNIQUE, we are working particularly
­intensively with fifteen leading universities around the world.
This program will strengthen and expand our portfolio with
creative new projects by giving us even more direct access to
scientific expertise, new technologies and talented minds from
various disciplines. Also involved in UNIQUE is Heidelberg
University, with whom we signed a collaboration agreement
for our joint “Catalysis Research Laboratory” (CaRLa) in the
spring of 2015. The research cooperation, which began in
2006, addresses current issues in homogeneous catalysis and
was extended to October 2017.
Together with researchers from Harvard University – also
a member of UNIQUE, as well as of our North American C
­ enter
for Research on Advanced Materials (NORA) – BASF ­researchers
developed a new method for making amorphous nanoparticles with increased solubility. This property improves the efficient uptake of, for example, vitamins and drugs in the ­human
body. The new process is well suited to a number of different
pharmaceutical, food and crop protection applications.

Innovation﻿

Strategic focus – examples
▪▪ Forward-looking project portfolio
▪▪ Strong customer and market orientation
▪▪ Worldwide presence and expansion of research
and development centers
Our research pipeline comprised approximately 3,000 projects
in 2015. We increased our spending on research and development by €69 million to €1,953 million (2014: €1,884 million);
the operating divisions were responsible for 79% of total
­research and development expenditures. The remaining 21%
was allocated to cross-divisional corporate research focusing
on long-term topics of strategic importance to the BASF
Group. Innovations based on chemistry require marketoriented research and development that is sharply focused on
the needs of our customers. In order to bring promising ideas
even faster to market, we regularly assess our research
projects using a multistep process and focus our topics
­
­accordingly.
Another vital factor for our success is a global research
and development presence. We continued to broaden our
activities in 2015, especially in Asia. In May, we opened a new
agricultural research station in Pune, India. The new facility
focuses on global research in the areas of herbicides, fungicides and insecticides, as well as on solutions going beyond
classic crop protection. In addition, we are also addressing
topics there that are especially relevant for India.

The extension of our Innovation Campus Asia Pacific in
Shanghai, China, was inaugurated in November, strengthening regional research capacity for new materials and systems,
as well as our power of innovation for both the region and the
world.
We aim to keep strengthening our research and development activities in Asia as well as in North and South America.
Our plan is to conduct half of our research and development
activities outside of Europe in the long term. We are adapting
this to the growth in regional markets. This increased presence
outside Europe creates new opportunities for fortifying and
expanding customer relations and scientific collaborations,
shoring up our Research and Development Verbund and making BASF an even more attractive partner and employer in the
regions. Ludwigshafen remains the largest site in our Research
Verbund. This was emphasized by the investment we made in
a new research building opened in July. It creates modern
workspaces and ideal cooperation conditions for around 200
employees in the platform Advanced Materials & Systems
Research.
The number and quality of our patents attest to our power
of innovation and long-term competitiveness. We filed around
1,000 new patents worldwide in 2015. For the seventh time in
succession, we headed the rankings in the Patent Asset
Index in 2015 – a method which compares patent portfolios
industry-wide. This once again underscores BASF’s power of
innovation.

Research focus areas – examples
▪▪ Chemistry-based innovations play important role
in answering questions of the future
▪▪ Growth fields with attractive sales potential
▪▪ Science symposia strengthen university network
Our focus areas in research are derived from the three major
areas in which chemistry-based innovations will play a key role
in the future: resources, environment and climate; food and
nutrition; and quality of life. In order to develop future business
fields with high sales potential for BASF, we develop specific
growth fields. These are regularly reviewed in terms of their
attractiveness for BASF. When they mature, they are transferred to the operating divisions and new ones are promoted.
We will tailor our technology fields even more closely to the
needs of the BASF Group and rearrange them into key technologies. Key technologies pool competencies in order to
­uphold the long-term competitiveness of our businesses and
products.
We held three interdisciplinary science symposia in the
year of our 150th anniversary: in Ludwigshafen, Germany;
Chicago, Illinois; and Shanghai, China. There, a total of 1,500
renowned experts from more than 37 countries engaged with
each other on the topics “smart energy,” “food” and “urban
living,” developing concrete approaches for interdisciplinary
solutions. Nobel laureates Steven Chu of Stanford University in
California and Jean-Marie Lehn of the University of Strasbourg
in France contributed with keynote speeches. The symposia
strengthened our academic network and marked the highlights among the co-creation activities we used to link people
and ideas around the globe in order to find new solutions
­together for global challenges. We plan symposia in the future,
as well, in order to foster scientific exchange.
We also successfully maintain close cooperations with
others in the area of energy. For example, we have developed
new materials for energy-saving cooling together with leading
universities and partners from industry around the world.
Thanks to their special properties, these magnetocaloric
­materials warm up when introduced to a magnetic field and
cool off again when the field is removed. Compared with
­today’s usual compressor technology, cooling systems based
on these widely available and affordable materials have the
­potential to reduce energy consumption by up to 35%. They
are also quieter and operate without gaseous coolants.
­Together with the U.S. technology company Astronautics and
the Chinese appliance manufacturer Haier, we introduced the
first prototype of a magnetocaloric wine cooler and are now
developing it jointly to achieve commercial readiness. We offer
our customers magnetocaloric products for their cooling
­applications under the brand name Quice®.

BASF Bericht 2015

For us, the development of innovative materials also involves
3-D printing – that is, additive manufacturing. Many complex
plastic components have been made using injection molding.
By contrast, 3-D printing offers distinct advantages: lower
small-batch production costs and considerably less time,
since no mold is necessary. Complex structural elements can
be built in a single step, allowing for completely new ­design
options like branching internal cavities. And yet the materials
currently available on the market often do not meet the high
demands of functional components for industrial a
­ pplications.
This is especially true of components optimized for shape and
weight, like those in the aviation, automotive, and consumer
goods industries. We are therefore developing improved materials together with partners, such as plastics and resins, and
optimizing the interplay between the material and 3-D printer.
Process optimization is our goal in the E.U.-supported
projects PRODIAS1 and RECOBA2, in which we have been
closely collaborating with partners from industry, academia
and research institutions since the spring of 2015.
With PRODIAS, we intend to further unlock the potential of
products in white biotechnology. This involves methods and
processes that allow products based on renewable raw materials to be produced efficiently and with fewer resources. The
project focuses particularly on processing diluted aqueous
systems, which are generated in large quantities by the manufacture of such products and which demand energy-intensive
steps for separation and purification. In PRODIAS, we are
­developing methods and process steps optimally suited for
biotechnological processes, increasing the competitive ability
of these products.
The RECOBA research project pursues the goal of improving product quality, efficiency, and flexibility in complex batch
processes – such as for emulsion polymerizations – thus
saving energy and raw materials. Typically, the process control
runs through repetitions according to a fixed schedule. We
want to replace this by developing a model-based online control system that can adjust to current conditions and calculate
the optimal trajectory for any point in time. Product properties,
such as the texture of product particles, can therefore be
­better controlled, and the reactor’s productivity and energy
consumption optimized.

Chemicals: Over the last few years, we have been constantly
improving our production process for isononanol (INA), an
important precursor for products like plasticizers. We have
been able to raise the production and energy efficiency of this
process and expand its raw material base, so that in addition
to steam cracker products, side streams from refineries can
also be used as a raw material. This increases our supply
­security and improves our cost structure. Together with our
partner Sinopec, we started up a new INA production plant in
October 2015 in Maoming, China, in which the new process
has already been successfully implemented.
In the Monomers division, we are constantly on the lookout
for innovative and large-volume applications for our existing
products. An example of this is the successful introduction of
polymer MDI as a binding agent for various wood-based
products. Laminate flooring especially benefits from improved
performance properties, with increased moisture resistance.
Our globally active team of specialists proved a key success
factor for this new application, as they supported customers in
North America and Asia in converting their production.
In 2015, we supplied the first PolyTHF® 1000 produced
using renewable raw materials to selected partners for
testing purposes in various applications. This precursor is
made using a license from Genomatica, and its quality is on a
level with conventionally produced PolyTHF® 1000 based on
petrochemicals. It can therefore be employed as a chemical

Performance Products: Paint manufacturers want to offer
products that can be applied in a short amount of time without
compromising on high quality and attractive appearance. Our
Acronal® EDGE 4750 dispersion in the North American decorative paint portfolio allows our customers to combine the
demands of both primer and top coat into a single paint:
­
­Acronal® EDGE 4750 adheres well and prevents stains from
penetrating the paint while providing coverage, durability and
stain resistance. Painters can therefore dispense with a whole
process step and still achieve the highest-quality results.
The minty taste of menthol, the world’s top-selling flavor,
can be found in countless everyday products. Unlike other
flavorings that remain in liquid form, menthol crystallizes to a
solid at room temperature. Customers first have to melt it
again before using it. Yet we already supply our menthol in
liquid form by transporting and storing the still-hot menthol
from the production facility in containers with a mobile heating
element. This saves our customers several processing steps
along the value chain, allowing them to put it to direct use:
a sustainable business model with both economic and environmental benefits.
The high-performance polymer Sokalan® HP 20 gets
laundry clean with fewer resources. It can be used in both
conventional and highly concentrated liquid laundry detergents, removing stains from textiles even at low washing
temperatures. Sokalan® HP 20 also prevents the redeposition
of removed soil onto the washed fabric, keeping colors bright
and white laundry from turning grey.
Since 2014, the United States has had very stringent regulations for the environmental friendliness of certain lubricants
in the shipping industry – such as those used for marine
propulsion and steering systems. Our Synative® ES TMP
­ester base stocks contain a large amount of renewable raw
materials, are biodegradable, and are nontoxic to marine
organ­isms. Because they work effectively and yet also in a
more environmentally friendly manner than many comparable
products in the marine industry, they help protect marine life
and are e
­ mployed in many applications subject to especially
strict regulations.

Innovation ﻿ ﻿

Functional Materials & Solutions: BASF has developed a
catalyst technology that allows refineries to increase yields of
valuable products like gasoline, diesel and other fuels from
crude oil. The nickel contained in crude oil presents a particular challenge to further processing, as it significantly increases
the generation of undesirable by-products like petroleum coke
and hydrogen. Combined with an optimized pore structure,
our new catalyst based on the metalloid boron intercepts
nickel in processing, thus preventing undesirable chemical
­reactions.
The MasterEase range of concrete additives greatly
­improves the flow properties of the building material. This is
especially true of modern high-performance concrete. Its
lower water and cement content improves stability and
increases buildings’ longevity, but also makes the material
­
sticky and harder to pump. Developed by BASF, polymers
contained in MasterEase products reduce the concrete’s viscosity by up to 30%. From mixing and pumping to sealing and
smoothing, processing therefore becomes easier, quicker and
more economical.
With XSpark®, we have developed an exclusive color
­effect for automotive OEM coatings that sparkles with particular brilliance in direct sunlight. Tiny glass particles that reflect
light more precisely than other effect pigments are applied
­together with the paint layer in a single step. The resulting
­homogeneous surface provides a pure, solid-color reflection
with particular depth, a complex paint effect that creates a
high-quality, elegant-looking coating without being intrusive.
This innovative product has already won several international
awards.
Together with our partner ContiTech Vibration Control, we
have developed the world’s first plastic transmission crossbeam in the rear axle subframe of vehicles for the S-Class from
Mercedes-Benz. Made of Ultramid® engineering plastic, the
component reduces noise and is 25% lighter than typical
models made of aluminum, which means a reduction in vehicle
fuel consumption. Thanks to our Elastollan® thermoplastic
polyurethane, the company Schwalbe has been able to reduce
weight in its “Evo Tube” inner tube designed for mountain
bikes by up to 65% compared with conventional, butyl-based
inner tubes.
Agricultural Solutions: We work together with farmers to
keep their farmland arable for future generations and to
accommodate society’s rising expectations. To do so, we
­
constantly invest in our development pipeline in order to
­expand our portfolio both in and beyond conventional crop
protection – such as in biological solutions. In 2015, we
­invested €514 million in research and development in the Crop
Protection division, representing around 9% of sales for the
segment.

BASF Report 2015

Our innovation pipeline comprises products launched
­between 2015 and 2025. With a current peak sales potential
of €3 billion, the pipeline comprises innovations from all
­business areas. The herbicide Engenia®, for example, is being
introduced in the United States as a key component of
­dicamba- and glyphosate-tolerant cropping systems. In 2016,
we will apply for approval of a new fungicide that can be used
in many crops around the world. We are also bolstering our
insecticide portfolio with novel high-performance ingredients.
Our Seltima® formulation from the Functional Crop Care
portfolio offers farmers an efficient, yet environmentally ­friendly,
solution for guarding rice crops against fungal infections. The
special encapsulation technology developed in the BASF
­Verbund ensures the precise release of its active ingredient
exclusively on the rice leaf’s surface, enabling better protection
of both plant and environment.
BASF Plant Science: We collaborate with numerous
­biotechnology and seed companies, research institutes, and
universities worldwide on developing crops with higher yields
and improved resistance to unfavorable environmental factors,
such as drought. We also work closely together with the Crop
Protection division to research and bring to market innovative
herbicide tolerance solutions. In 2015, we launched the
­Cultivance® production system, a combination of genetically
modified soybeans and the corresponding herbicide.
­Cultivance® therefore provides farmers with a complete solution for weed control in soybean cultivation.
Oil & Gas: Our research and development activities focus on
improving the discovery rate of oil and gas reservoirs, developing technologies for reservoirs with challenging development
and production conditions, and increasing the recovery factor
of reservoirs.
Together with an external partner, we have employed a
new and efficient method in the Staffhorst natural gas field in
Germany for recovering remaining potential in an economi­
cal manner. The conventional drilling rig that would have been
used to extend the well by the necessary 170 meters would
have been too time and cost-intensive; in addition, production
would need to have been halted while the work was in progress. Instead, the drilling was accomplished through the existing production tubing, using flexible steel coiled tubing and the
world’s smallest drilling turbine to drive the drill head. We were
thus able to deepen the well at low cost and without stopping
production.

In addition to innovations, investments and acquisitions
make a decisive contribution toward achieving our ambitious growth goals. We are intensifying our investment in
emerging markets and in North America. We use targeted
acquisitions to supplement our organic growth.
For the period from 2016 to 2020, we have planned capital
expenditures1 of €19.5 billion. We want to invest more than a
quarter of this amount in emerging markets and expand our
local presence in order to benefit from the growth in these
­regions. In North America, attractive growth prospects and
cost-effective raw material prices are strengthening our investment plans in the region. Furthermore, we are continuing to
develop our portfolio through innovation-driven acquisitions
that promise above-average profitable growth. Investments
and acquisitions alike are prepared by interdisciplinary teams
and assessed using diverse criteria. In this way, we ensure
that economic, environmental and social concerns are
­included in strategic decision-making. We also continuously
improve the efficiency of our production processes by investing in our plants.

And reliable supplier
of classic chemicals

With products and formulations
for specific industries

In close partnership
with our customers

BASF’s customer portfolio ranges from major global
­customers and medium-sized businesses to local workshops. We align our business models and sales channels
with the respective customer groups and market
­segments. In line with our strategic principle, “We add
value as one company,” we tightly bundle our products
and services to target the specific needs of customers
from various sectors and release innovations more q
­ uickly
to the market.
In the classical chemicals business, we mostly sell the
chemicals produced in our Verbund in bulk. These comprise
basic products from the Chemicals segment, such as steam
cracker products, sulfuric acid, plasticizers, caprolactam and
TDI. For these basic chemicals, our priority is on supplying
customers reliably and cost effectively. Marketing is carried
out partly via e-commerce.
We create a broad range of customized products, particularly in the Performance Products segment – from vitamins,
personal care ingredients and color pigments to paper chemicals and plastic additives. In joint projects, we start working
closely together with customers already at an early stage in
order to develop new products or formulations for a specific
industry. A worldwide network of development laboratories
allows us to quickly adapt our products to local needs.
We offer functionalized materials and solutions tailored
to customers’ requirements, particularly in the Functional
Materials & Solutions and Agricultural Solutions segments.
­
These include, for example, engineering plastics, concrete
additives, coatings and crop protection products. We engage
in close partnerships with customers and develop innovations
together that help them optimize their processes and applications. Our understanding of the entire value chain as well as
our global setup and market knowledge are key success
­factors here.
For information on customer relations in the Oil & Gas segment,
see page 86 onward

Industry orientation
▪▪ Around half of business units geared toward
speciﬁc industries
▪▪ Industry teams pool cross-unit expertise,
knowledge and contacts
▪▪ Industry orientation systematically and
structurally enhanced
We serve customers from many different sectors with our
broad portfolio of diverse competencies, processes, technologies and products. Around half of our business units are
geared toward specific industries. By combining expertise and
resources, we position ourselves as a solution-oriented ­system
provider for our customers.
Yet not all business units can be arranged purely according
to industry. That is why BASF has created sector-specific
groups for key customer industries – like the automotive,
pharmaceutical and packaging industries – or for growth fields
such as wind energy. These “industry teams” pool expertise,
knowledge and contacts across different units, sharpen our
understanding of the value chains in customer industries and
work on sector-specific solutions that often could not be
­developed within one operating division alone. For more than
fifty years, we have worked closely with the construction
­industry, which has enabled numerous successful and sustainable projects. This means combining the expertise of seven
divisions into one global industry team. The products and
systems developed through this setup improve the durability
of buildings, which themselves require fewer resources for
maintenance. Furthermore, these products make buildings
more ­energy efficient, thus protecting our environment. BASF
is ­developing new solutions for faster and more cost-efficient
construction, easy maintenance, improved insulation materials, and heat transfer by means of infrared-reflective coatings.
The close alignment of our business with our customers’
needs is an important component of our “We create chemistry” strategy. We will therefore continue the systematic and
structured enhancement of our industry orientation in the
­future.

Competition for talent

Vocational training

▪▪ Career website established globally
▪▪ Good scores in employer rankings worldwide

▪▪ 3,240 apprentices in around 60 occupations worldwide
▪▪ Around €107 million spent on vocational training

In the global competition for the best employees and leaders,
we want to recruit qualiﬁed talent in order to achieve our
­ambitious growth targets. This is why we have expanded the
measures that make our total offer package attractive for
­employees. For example, we added 34 countries to our new
career website in 2015, and are making even greater use of
social media to reach potential candidates.
We score well in worldwide employer rankings. In a 2015
study conducted by Universum, BASF was once again
­selected by science and engineering students as one of the 50
most attractive employers in the world. Furthermore, BASF
Corporation in the United States received the Talent Board’s
Candidate Experience Award for the third time in a row for our
excellent performance in the management of external candidates. In Asia Pacific, we were awarded for measures such as
our interactive career website.
Worldwide, the percentage of employees who resigned
during their first three years of employment was 1.1% on
average in 2015. This turnover rate was 0.4% in Europe, 1.9%
in North America, 3.3% in Asia Pacific and 1.1% in South
America, ­Africa, Middle East. Our turnover rates are therefore
lower than those of many other companies.

As of December 31, 2015, BASF was training 3,240 people in
15 countries and around 60 occupations. We spent a total of
around €107 million on vocational training in 2015, as well as
about €9 million on the BASF Training Verbund as part of our
social commitment in the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region.
In 2015, 886 apprentices started their vocational training
at BASF SE and German Group companies, filling almost all
available program slots in Germany. The current shortage of
skilled labor nevertheless presents a challenge that we ­address
with various programs and initiatives. These include Start in
den Beruf and Anlauf zur Ausbildung, in which 249 young
people in the BASF Training Verbund participated in cooperation with partner companies in 2015. The goal of these
programs is to prepare participants for a subsequent apprenticeship within one year, making a contribution to the longterm supply of qualified employees in the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan R
­egion. Because the number of open vocational
training placements in some fields outweighs demand, some
placement slots in these programs remain unfilled. At the
Ludwigshafen site, we also offer a part-time training program
for newcomers from other fields, so that they can qualify for a
career in chemical production even while working at their
­current job.
Furthermore, 20 Spanish apprentices once again began
their vocational training in Tarragona, Spain, on the basis of the
German vocational training model. The theoretical and practical phases take place in Tarragona and in Ludwigshafen. The
apprentices are then placed in production plants after their
vocational training is finished. In 2015, 16 Spanish apprentices
successfully completed their training and began employment
at the Ludwigshafen site at the start of 2016. We consider this
program a way of expanding our recruiting pool.
Moreover, we began a program in 2015 to integrate refugees into German life. In its initial phase, “Start Integration” is
offering 50 participants prospects for beginning their career
through the BASF Training Verbund. With its modular structure, the program is geared toward refugees with a high
probability of being granted the right to remain in Germany.

Learning and development

Managing demographic changes

▪▪ Life-long learning concept focuses on learning from
on-the-job experience
▪▪ Learning Campus promotes further education in
worldwide networks
▪▪ Specific further training for employees in production
and technical fields

▪▪ “Leadership in times of demographic change”
as a part of leadership duties
▪▪ Active knowledge management and effective
­succession planning

Our learning and development opportunities support the Best
Team Strategy and have a direct connection to business. We
want to enable life-long, learner-centric learning; in so doing,
we follow the “70-20-10” philosophy. That means applying the
elements “learning from experience” (70%), “learning from
others” (20%) and “learning through courses and media”
(10%). Our global Learning Campus is the central platform
for the programs on offer for life-long learning. It allows
­employees to find the courses relevant for them. Our goal is to
create a common-ground, inspiring learning experience that
enables employees to connect with the company and with
each other. The options cover a range of learning goals: starting a career, expanding knowledge, personal development,
and leadership training. As a platform for exchange as well as
for strategic and cultural shift, the concept of the Learning
Campus also facilitates thinking and acting as one company.
In regular development meetings, our employees and
leaders outline prospects for individual professional development together and determine measures for further training and
development. This approach was implemented for around
60,000 employees by the end of 2015. Our goal is to introduce
these development meetings for all BASF employees by 2017.
They supplement the annual employee dialogs that are conducted in all BASF Group companies worldwide, which include
an employee performance assessment component.
We spent around €96 million on further training in 2015
(2014: €101 million). Our measures for further training are
based on the learning needs of our employees. Local and
­international seminars and workshops enable the acquisition
and exchange of knowledge and promote networking. Each
employee spent an average of 2.5 days on further training in
2015. Internal specialists provide our employees with career
counseling.
We support the large number of employees in production
and engineering worldwide with job-specific qualifications and
further training. We have further strengthened our in-plant
qualification measures with in-plant trainers who promote the
continuous professional development of employees in production and engineering through individual learning assignments.
Moreover, we expanded our programs on safety culture and
knowledge management as well as team and organizational
development.

The demographic situation within the BASF Group varies
widely by region. Particularly in Germany and North America,
an aging population presents us with challenges. We are also
intensely occupied with future issues like new technologies,
growing digitalization (“Industry 4.0”), and the ever-increasing
delay of retirement. We create a framework to help maintain
the employability of our personnel at all stages of life and
­ensure the availability of qualified employees. Our employees
and leaders are supported with health and exercise programs,
flexible working arrangements, age-appropriate workplaces
and demographic analyses. The topic “leadership in times of
demographic change” also forms a part of our leadership
programs. In addition, we actively engage in knowledge management and systematic succession planning.

Inclusion of diversity
▪▪ Promoting diversity as part of company culture
▪▪ First global goals for increasing percentage of
women in leadership positions
We want to utilize diversity for the development of our ­business.
That is why promoting diversity is one of the mainstays of our
corporate culture. The strong global character of our markets
translates into different customer requirements. We want to
reflect this diversity in our workforce in order to even better
understand the needs of our customers. The aim is to increase
our teams’ performance and power of innovation, and boost
creativity, motivation and identification with the company. We
are therefore further promoting the appreciation and inclusion
of diversity. Leaders play an important role here. We support
them in strengthening diversity and making the best possible
use of it in day-to-day business. For example, specific goals
and measures are being developed for such topics as recognizing and developing different kinds of talent.
For the first time, BASF set itself global goals in 2015 for
increasing the percentage of women in leadership positions. In
the BASF Group, the global proportion of female leaders with
disciplinary responsibility was 19.5% at the end of 2015 (2014:
19.1%). We aim to increase this figure to 22–24% worldwide
by 2021, so that the proportion of women in leadership ­reflects
that of women in the global company workforce. C
­ onsidering
the relatively low rate of turnover in the BASF Group’s leadership team, this is an ambitious goal.

For more information, see basf.com/diversity
For more on diversity in the Board of Executive Directors
and the Supervisory Board, see page 132

Work-life balance
▪▪ Worldwide offers help combine career, family
and private life
Our identity as an employer includes our belief in enabling our
employees to better combine their work, family and private
lives. Through various offers and opportunities, we create
working conditions that give fair consideration to our employees’ individual needs. We want to strengthen employee identification with the company and bolster our position as an
­attractive employer in the competition for qualified personnel.
Our offer includes flexible working hours, part-time

other than Germany. This figure was at 35.6% by the end of
2015. Moreover, we intend to maintain the proportion of senior
executives with international experience at over 80%. We
­
­exceeded this figure by the end of 2015, reaching 82.9%. With
these goals, we continue to drive our globally i­ntegrated

In Germany, BASF is putting into practice the Law on Equal
Participation of Women and Men in Leadership Positions in
the Private and Public Sector. In accordance with these legal
requirements, the Board of Executive ­Directors determined
target figures for the proportion of women in the two leadership levels below the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE:
9.4% for the leadership level directly below the Board, and
11.8% for the level below that. This corresponds to the status
at the time these target figures were determined. Target figures
were likewise defined for German Group companies subject to
co-determination. The deadline for achieving these goals has
been set for Decem­ber 31, 2016. A
­ fter that, the company will
review the numbers and subsequently d
­ ecide on new target
figures.

▪▪ Leaders serve as role models
▪▪ Diverse programs for leadership development

▪▪ Compensation based on employee’s position and
indi­vidual performance as well as company’s success
▪▪ Pay generally comprises fixed and variable
­components plus benefits

Our leaders serve as role models in implementing our strategy

to BASF’s business success. Our leadership culture is f­ ounded
on BASF’s strategic principles and values as well as on the
standards of behavior set out by our globally uniform Code of
Conduct. Our global Competence Model forms the basis of
our employee and leadership development.
All new leaders take part in the module-based New Leader
Program, which supports them in taking on a leadership role.
In addition, we offer global, regional and local programs for
leaders on all levels. These are geared toward strengthening
our leaders’ competencies and offer opportunities for networking and learning from one another. Coaching is
­further­more an important measure for personal development

Global Employee Survey
▪▪ Worldwide survey conducted for the third time
The Global Employee Survey, including its follow-up process,
has been an established tool throughout the BASF Group
since 2008. We conducted it for the third time in 2015. This
time, the survey’s design was even more closely aligned with
the corporate strategy. Overall, 74% of employees in around
80 countries took part in the survey. Good results were
­especially returned with regard to team collaboration, occupational safety, and satisfaction with BASF as an employer. In
some cases, employees saw room for improvement when it
came to supporting individual development, recognizing performance, and communicating change. The results of the
survey were presented to the Board of Executive Directors and
the Supervisory Board. Employees and leaders subsequently
discussed the results together and are developing necessary
measures for improvement. The next Global Employee Survey
is planned for 2018.

In addition to market-oriented compensation, BASF’s total
offer also comprises benefits, individual opportunities for
­
­development and a good working environment. Our employees’ pay is based on global compensation principles. These
take into account an employee’s position and individual performance as well as the company’s success. Analyses of the
Ludwigshafen site have shown that, for contracts exempt from
collective agreements, there are no systematic differences in
pay between men and women, provided the positions and
qualifications are comparable.
As a rule, compensation is comprised of fixed and variable
components as well as benefits that often exceed legal
requirements. In many countries, these include company
­
pension benefits, supplementary health insurance, and share
programs.
On the occasion of the company’s 150th anniversary,
BASF Group employees worldwide received an anniversary
bonus of around €100 million in total.
In 2015, the BASF Group spent €9,982 million on wages
and salaries, social security contributions and expenses for
pensions and assistance (2014: €9,224 million). Personnel
expenses therefore rose by 8.2%, particularly owing to cur­
rency effects. Higher salaries and wages, in addition to expen­
ses for the anniversary bonus and the long-term incentive (LTI)
program, also contributed to the increase.

Working at BASF﻿

Employees participate in company’s success

Global labor and social standards

▪▪ Return on assets determines variable compensation
▪▪ BASF share program “plus” fosters employees’
­long-term participation in company

▪▪ Alignment with U.N. Guiding Principles
on Business and Human Rights
▪▪ Adjusted management process for monitoring
adherence to labor and social standards

With variable compensation components, employees participate in the company’s success and are rewarded for their
­individual performance. The same principles basically apply for
all employees. The amount of the variable component is determined by the success of the company – measured by the
­return on assets of the BASF Group – and the employee’s
­individual performance. Individual performance is assessed
using a globally consistent performance management
­approach. The annual bonus for the 2015 business year is not
as high as in 2014 due to the lower return on assets.
In numerous Group companies, employees are offered the
chance to purchase shares. The BASF share program “plus”
sponsors the long-term participation of our employees in the
company through incentive shares: By investing a portion of
their compensation in BASF shares, they take part in the longterm development of BASF.
BASF offers its executives the opportunity to participate in
a share-price-based compensation program. This long-term
incentive (LTI) program ties a portion of their compensation to
the long-term performance of BASF shares. In 2015, 93% of
the approximately 1,200 eligible executives worldwide participated in the LTI program, investing up to 30% of their variable
compensation in BASF shares.
For more information, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements from page 218 onward

Dialog with employee representatives
Open dialog with employee representatives is an important
component of our corporate culture. If restructuring leads to
staff downsizing, we work with employee representatives to
develop socially responsible implementation measures. This is
done in accordance with the respective legal regulations and
the agreements reached. For cross-border matters, the BASF
Europa Betriebsrat (European Works Council) has been
respon­sible for employees in Europe since 2008.
We signed a new site agreement in Ludwigshafen,
­Ger­many – the BASF Group’s largest site – with employee
representatives in 2015. It applies for all employees of
BASF SE. ­Titled “Meeting the challenges of constant change
­together,” the agreement addresses job security, flexibility and
ensuring competitive ability.
For more information, see basf.com/employeerepresentation

Our voluntary commitment to respecting international labor
and social standards is embedded in our global Code of
­Conduct. This encompasses internationally recognized labor
norms as stipulated in the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational
Enterprises, and the Tripartite Declaration of Principles­
­Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy of the
International Labour Organization (ILO). BASF strives to ­uphold
these standards worldwide. In countries where national laws,
rules and customs deviate from international standards, we
take on the challenge of ﬁnding appropriate solutions that
­respect local customs by engaging in dialog with ­stakeholders.
We check regard for international labor and social standards using a global monitoring system comprising three
instru­ments:
––External compliance hotlines
––The annual survey of our Group companies
––Close dialog with our stakeholders, such as employee
­representatives and international organizations
In order to even better inspect compliance with international
labor and social standards around the world, we began
restruc­turing our management process in 2015. Step by step,
the annual survey of our Group companies will be replaced
with a process through which we can more efficiently monitor
worldwide adherence to international labor standards based
on a globally applicable BASF guideline. The management
process is geared toward internal regulations on compliance
and risk management, as well as requirements with respect to
the U.N.’s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

­specialists discussed the initiative’s future and successes at
an expert convention in Ludwigshafen in 2015.
As a founding member of the Wissensfabrik, BASF is part
of a nationwide network of more than 120 companies and
foundations that have been making a contribution to education and entrepreneurship in Germany since 2005.

Focus on refugees and migration
▪▪ Supporting integration projects in the
Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region
▪▪ BASF Stiftung’s humanitarian engagement
BASF SE has already been supporting over 20 refugee
integration projects in the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region
since 2014. These include language courses and integration
programs for children and families, as well as theater and
crafts projects. BASF’s global “Connected to Care” competition to promote employees’ charitable involvement also supported employee-organized integration projects. Connected
to Care won the Human Resources Manager magazine’s
HR Excellence Award in 2015.
As part of its humanitarian development collaboration,
BASF Stiftung has supported various United Nations projects
since 2012 – along with other international nongovernmental organizations – in their efforts to deal with the effects of
­refugeeism and migration. The company and its employees
gave €377,000 to BASF Stiftung in the 2015 year-end ­donation
campaign for the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)
supporting an education and integration program in Jordan.

The global economy grew only moderately in 2015, slowing down over the course of the year. Dampening effects
came primarily from the emerging markets. Growth in the
European Union was positive, yet remained at a low level.
After a weak start to 2015, the U.S. economy stabilized
over the course of the year. In China, however, industrial
production and demand for imports both slowed considerably compared with 2014. This development also weakened momentum for China’s trading partners and weighed
down raw material prices. Important countries such as
Russia and Brazil found themselves in a recession. Overall, global gross domestic product grew by only 2.4%,
­remaining behind 2014 (+2.6%1) and our ­expectations for
2015 (+2.8%). The average price for a barrel of Brent blend
crude oil fell to $52 per barrel (2014: $99 per barrel).

Trends in the global economy in 2015
Growth in the global economy was marked by diverging developments in the advanced economies and the emerging markets. In the European Union and the United States, c
­ onsumers
benefited from low energy prices and rising real income. The
result was increased demand for consumer goods, stabilizing
the economy in these regions. The e
­ conomic cooldown in
China, however, dampened growth in Asia and South America
in particular. Russia’s recession intensified on account of the
low oil prices as well as the continuing trade sanctions. Furthermore, many emerging-market currencies depreciated
sharply in anticipation of interest rate hikes in the United
States. Although this boosted these countries’ competitiveness in terms of export prices, it also led to further capital
outflow and higher inflation rates.

At 1.8%, gross domestic product in the European Union
grew somewhat faster than in the previous year (2014: +1.4%).
Solid growth rates were seen in northwestern Europe, particularly the United Kingdom, Sweden and Ireland. The economy
in southern Europe was able to continue stabilizing – ­especially
in Spain, which saw growth of 3.2%. France and Italy were
also able to slightly expand their gross domestic product.
Adjus­ted for number of working days, the German economy
only grew moderately, by 1.4%. Major drivers here were
above-average wage and salary increases, along with low
­inflation rates, significantly increasing the purchasing power of
­private households. Positive stimulus was also provided by the
eurozone’s demand for exports. Demand was weaker from
outside the eurozone, especially China.
The countries in central and eastern Europe developed
positively in light of low energy prices, rising export demand
from the eurozone, and comparatively low interest rates. In
Russia (–3.7%), however, the recession intensified in an
­environment of low oil prices, a weak ruble and ongoing trade
sanctions.

Management’s Report 
The BASF Group business year — Economic environment ﻿

In the first quarter of 2015, growth in the United States
­remained considerably behind our expectations on account of
unfavorable weather conditions and long-running harbor
strikes that negatively impacted exports. Yet the U.S. ­economy
was able to stabilize over the course of the year (+2.4%).
­Private consumption, employment, and wages and salaries all
developed well while the inflation rate remained low. Low interest rates spurred growth in the construction and automotive
sector.
Growth continued to weaken in the emerging markets of
Asia, although it remained at a high level (+6.2%). In China,
growth especially decelerated in the manufacturing industry
and the construction sector. The Chinese government combated this economic cooldown with monetary and fiscal
measures. The slowdown in China also dampened economic
­activity in neighboring Asian countries; South Korea, Taiwan,
Singapore and Malaysia all saw substantially lower growth
rates than in the previous year.
Japan was also negatively affected by developments in
China, its most important trading partner apart from the United
States. Despite the depreciation of the yen against other
­currencies, exports to China and to Europe and the United
States remained modest. Private consumption and the propen­
sity for investment were also dampened. Gross domes­
tic
product was hardly able to grow in these conditions (+0.4%).
In South America, gross domestic product shrank by
2.1% overall in 2015. Many countries in the region suffered
from China’s weaker demand for raw materials, as well as from
falling raw material prices. Brazil fell into a severe recession. As
a result of the 32% drop in value of the Brazilian real over the
course of the year, consumers and producers were left struggling with rising prices for imported goods. Deteriorating
­economic conditions and a crisis of confidence in the government brought consumer sentiment and investor confidence to
record lows. The Argentinian peso also depreciated by around
30% compared with the average of the previous months after
exchange rates were allowed to float in December.

BASF Report 2015

In the European Union, industrial growth was able to expand
slightly from 1.3% to 1.5%, whereas North America saw a
substantial overall decline from 3.4% to 1.2%. At 5.4%, industrial growth in the emerging markets of Asia remained around
1.7 percentage points behind the previous year’s levels. Industry in China grew at only 6.1%, a rate considerably slower than
in previous years. South America fell into a downright slump:
Industrial production in Brazil shrank by 8.4%.
Against this backdrop, growth in key customer industries
and in the chemical industry also remained below prior-year
levels. Automotive manufacturing saw considerably slower
growth due to sales developments in China, South America
and Russia. In the construction industry, China’s economic
cooldown and the sharp decline in construction activities in
Russia and Brazil led to lower growth rates worldwide. Agriculture grew by 2.1%, somewhat behind the previous year’s rate
but with regional developments varying widely.

Trends in the chemical industry

Important raw material price developments

▪▪ Growth below our expectations

▪▪ Prices continue to fall for crude oil and naphtha
▪▪ Gas prices below previous year’s level

In light of the dampened dynamic in its key customer industries, the chemical industry (excluding pharmaceuticals) grew
by 3.6%. Our original forecast of 4.2% had been much higher.
This development was largely a factor of slower momentum in
China, the world’s largest chemical market. There, chemical
production gained 7.0%, around 2.3 percentage points under
the previous year’s rate.
Growing at 0.3% (2014: +0.6%), the chemical industry in
the European Union continued to lag behind the total industry.
As in the previous year, momentum was provided by the
United Kingdom and the eastern E.U. countries. Chemical
­
production again declined slightly in Germany. In the United
States, the 3.5% growth rate was 2.1 percentage points
stronger than in the previous year, although momentum decelerated as the year progressed. At –1.7%, chemical production
in South America declined at the same rate as in the previous
year. Production volumes rose slightly in Japan, growing by
1.6% (2014: –0.8%).

At an average of around $52 per barrel in 2015, the price of
Brent blend crude oil dropped by 47% compared with the
previous year ($99 per barrel). The oil price fluctuated over the
course of the year between $64 per barrel in May and $38 per
barrel in December.
Average monthly prices for the chemical raw material
naphtha ranged over the course of 2015 between $551 per
metric ton in May and $387 per metric ton in December. At
$462 per metric ton, the annualized average price of naphtha
in 2015 was below the level of 2014 ($837 per metric ton).
The average price of gas in the United States was
$2.61 per mmBtu, below the level of the previous year
($4.37 per mmBtu). In Europe, the average price of gas on
spot markets remained substantially higher, at $6.49 per
mmBtu (2014: $8.21 per mmBtu).2 Gas prices in China were
around $9.81 per mmBtu on national average, while the
­average price in the coastal regions was $11.20 per mmBtu.

The BASF Group business year — Results of operations ﻿

BASF Report 2015

Results of operations
The market environment continued to be volatile and
challenging in 2015. Growth rates for the global economy,
industrial production and the chemical industry all lagged
considerably behind our expectations. The economic
environment deteriorated in important emerging markets,
especially China. The sharp drop in the price of oil led to
falling prices for basic chemicals in particular. The divestitures completed in 2015 also put a strain on both sales
and ­income from operations (EBIT) before special items.
Impair­ments in the Oil & Gas segment resulting from the
reduced forecast for oil and gas prices led to considerably
lower EBIT. In light of these factors, our overall business
development remained behind our expectations.

Sales and income from operations before
special items
▪▪ Sales decline by 5% to €70,449 million
▪▪ At €6,739 million, income from operations before

Factors influencing sales
Sales volumes in 2015 rose slightly overall, mainly as a result
of higher volumes in the Oil & Gas segment. Volumes were
slightly down overall in the chemicals business. Sales prices
fell in nearly all divisions, strongly affected by the sharp drop in
raw material prices. We were able to raise volumes and prices
in the Agricultural Solutions segment. Currency effects positively influenced sales in all segments. Sales were reduced by
the asset swap with Gazprom, through which contributions to
the Oil & Gas segment from the gas trading and storage business in particular ceased as of the fourth quarter of 2015.

Sales decreased by €3,877 million to €70,449 million in 2015,
largely on account of the significant drop in prices – especially
in the Chemicals segment – in relation to oil price developments. In addition, the asset swap with Gazprom completed
at the end of September particularly contributed to the decline.
This transaction meant the discontinuation of contributions to
the Oil & Gas segment mainly from the natural gas trading and
storage business as of the fourth quarter of 2015. We could
only partly compensate for this through sales increases in the
other three segments.
At €6,739 million, income from operations before special
items was 8% below the level of the previous year. Major influences here were the oil-price-related decline in sales from our
oil and gas production as well as decreased earnings in Other,
which was particularly the result of currency effects. Earnings
­increased slightly in the chemicals business1 but fell ­slightly in
the Agricultural Solutions segment.

Sales and income from operations before
special items in the segments
Sales in the Chemicals segment declined by 14%, largely due
to lower prices on account of decreased raw material costs,
especially in the Petrochemicals division. Income from operations before special items fell by 9% compared with the previous year. This was primarily attributable to the declining TDI
margins in the Monomers division as well as rising fixed costs
from the startup of new production plants, such as in Camaçari,
Brazil, and Chongqing, China.
In the Performance Products segment, sales were up by
1%. Positive currency effects in all divisions were able to more
than compensate for lower sales prices and weaker volumes.
Income from operations before special items was 6% below
the prior year’s level because of higher fixed costs. These
resul­ted from negative currency effects, the startup of new
plants – such as those in Camaçari, Brazil, and Freeport,
­Texas – and inventory reductions.

Our chemicals business comprises the Chemicals, Performance Products and Functional Materials & Solutions segments.

Management’s Report 
The BASF Group business year — Results of operations ﻿

We raised sales by 5% in the Functional Materials & Solutions segment thanks to positive currency effects in all divisions. Prices declined slightly overall, with volumes stable. We
improved income from operations before special items by
38%, mainly because of the considerable earnings increase in
the Performance Materials and Construction Chemicals divisions.
Sales in the Agricultural Solutions segment exceeded
the level of 2014 by 7%, primarily driven by higher sales prices.
Over the course of the year, we experienced a slowdown in
demand for crop protection products, while prices for agricultural products remained low. In emerging markets in particular,
our business development was hindered by the volatile environment and depreciation of local currencies. Income from
operations before special items was down by 2%. This was
primarily attributable to higher fixed costs, mainly through
a decrease in plant capacity utilization rates from the startup of
new production capacities, along with reductions in inventories.
Sales declined by 14% in the Oil & Gas segment in 2015.
This was largely a result of the asset swap with Gazprom
completed at the end of September, through which contributions from the natural gas trading and storage business, as
well as from Wintershall Noordzee B.V., ceased as of the fourth
quarter of 2015. The significant drop in the price of oil led to
slightly lower sales in the Exploration & Production business
sector. Higher volumes in both the Exploration & Production
and Natural Gas Trading business sectors had a positive effect
on sales. Income from operations before special items d
­ eclined
by 24% as a result of the reduced sales level.
Sales in Other shrank by 23%, mainly on account of a
­reduced contribution from raw materials trading. The decline
was also influenced by the disposal of our share in the Ellba
Eastern Private Ltd. joint operation in Singapore at the end of
2014, as well as by lower plant availability from the outage at
the Ellba C.V. joint operation in Moerdijk, Netherlands. Income
from operations before special items dropped by 57% compared with the previous year. Major factors were a lower currency result and higher expenses for provisions for our longterm incentive program.

BASF Report 2015

Income from operations and special items
▪▪ Income from operations declines considerably
▪▪ Premium once again earned on cost of capital
At €6,248 million, income from operations for the BASF Group
in 2015 was considerably below the previous year’s level
(€7,626 million).
Included in this figure is income from companies a
­ ccounted
for using the equity method, which declined from €273 million
to €251 million.
Special items in 2015 resulted in an earnings contribution
to EBIT of minus €491 million (2014: €269 million). This was
largely the result of other special charges and income totaling
minus €729 million, mostly from impairments on assets in the
Oil & Gas segment. In 2014, other special charges and income
totaling minus €369 million had especially pertained to impairment charges in the Oil & Gas, Chemicals, and Functional
Materials & Solutions segments.
Divestitures in 2015 resulted in an earnings contribution of
€476 million (2014: €712 million). This amount included the
asset swap with Gazprom as well as the disposal of the white
expandable polystyrene (EPS) business, the global textile
chemicals business, and parts of the pharmaceutical ingredients and services business.
Compared with 2014, special charges from various
restruc­turing measures rose by €155 million to €223 million
and expenses for the integration of acquired busi­nesses by
€9 million to €15 million.
We once again earned a premium on our cost of capital in
2015. EBIT after cost of capital amounted to €194 million after
€1,368 million in the previous year. Cost of capital increased
particularly as a result of the higher amount of fixed assets.
Contrasting this was the reduction of inventories and other
receivables.

Financial result and net income

Adjusted earnings per share

▪▪ Financial result and net income considerably down
year-on-year
▪▪ Earnings per share declines from €5.61 to €4.34

▪▪ At €5.00, adjusted earnings per share down by €0.44

The financial result fell to minus €700 million in 2015, compared with minus €423 million in the previous year.
Income from shareholdings decreased from €278 million in
2014 to €9 million. The previous year had contained special
income of €220 million from the disposal of our shares in VNG
– Verbundnetz Gas AG.
The interest result improved from minus €504 million in
2014 to minus €425 million, largely due to lower interest
expen­
ses from financial indebtedness as a result of more
favor­able refinancing conditions.
Other financial result declined from minus €197 million in
the previous year to minus €284 million in 2015. The main
reason for this was a higher net interest expense from underfunded pension plans and similar obligations, in addition to a
higher level of other financial expenses resulting primarily from
hedging expenses.
Earnings before taxes decreased by €1,655 million in 2015
to €5,548 million. Return on assets1 amounted to 8.7%, compared with 11.7% in the previous year.
Income taxes were reduced from €1,711 million in 2014 to
€1,247 million in 2015. The tax rate fell from 23.8% to 22.5%,
predominantly due to lower earnings contributions in countries
with higher tax rates, especially Norway, as compared with the
prior year.
Income before minority interests declined from €5,492 million to €4,301 million. Minority interests amounted to €314 million, compared with €337 million in 2014.
Net income amounted to €3,987 million, below the previous year’s level of €5,155 million. Earnings per share dipped
from €5.61 to €4.34.
For information on the items in the statement of income, see the Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 183 onward

By eliminating special items and the amortization of intangible
assets, adjusted earnings per share serves as a more suitable
ratio for long-term comparability and predicting the company’s
future profitability. In 2015, adjusted earnings per share
amounted to €5.00 compared with €5.44 in the previous year.

For sales, “slight” represents a change of 1–5%, while “considerable” applies to changes of 6% and higher. “At prior-year level” indicates no change (+/–0%). For earnings, “slight”
means a change of 1–10%, while “considerable” is used for changes of 11% and higher. “At prior-year level” indicates no change (+/–0%).

Actual development compared with outlook
for 2015
For 2015, we had anticipated a slight increase in sales and
posted a slight decline. This was predominantly an effect of
the sharp drop in oil prices as well as the divestiture of the gas
trading and storage business at the end of September 2015.
We were able to raise our sales volumes excluding the effects
of acquisitions and divestitures, as predicted. Income from
operations before special items did not match the previous
year’s level as expected, but rather decreased slightly. It was
especially down in the Performance Products segment,
­although earnings in the Agricultural Solutions segment and in
Other were also weaker than anticipated. The impairments in
the Oil & Gas segment made necessary by our reduced oil and
gas price forecast particularly contributed to a significant – and
therefore unexpectedly sharp – decline in income from operations. The considerably lower EBIT after cost of capital corresponds to our forecast.
Declining considerably rather than slightly, sales in the
Chemicals segment lagged behind our expectations. This
was largely the result of an even lower level of oil and gas
prices than we had assumed, which led to a sharp drop in
prices in some business areas. Income from operations before
special items was slightly below prior-year levels, as predicted.
Sales grew slightly in the Performance Products segment, and thus somewhat below our expectations. With positive currency effects and lower sales prices, volumes declined
slightly, contrary to our assumptions. Contributing factors here
included intense competition in the pigments business; the
significant, oil-price-related decrease in demand for oilfield
chemicals; and the sale of parts of our pharmaceutical ingredients and services business as well as of our textile chemicals
business. The considerable rise expected in income from
opera­tions before special items could not be achieved; we
posted a slight decline. Earnings were particularly below our
expectations in the Care Chemicals and Nutrition & Health
divi­sions.

1

In the Functional Materials & Solutions segment, we raised
sales by 5%, which was just below the considerable growth
we had predicted. Higher demand, primarily from the automotive industry, was unable to offset lower sales in precious
metal trading. Weighed down by the price of oil, prices in the
Performance Materials division also put a strain on sales. We
achieved a considerable increase in income from operations
before special items, as planned.
Sales in the Agricultural Solutions segment grew considerably, in line with our expectations. With income from operations before special items slightly below 2014 levels, we did
not achieve our ambitious aim of considerable improvement.
Dampened demand and higher fixed costs from decreased
plant capacity utilization and simultaneous inventory reductions
had a more negative impact on our business than expec­ted.
We had anticipated a slight sales decline in the Oil & Gas
segment. Our 2015 planning had not included the asset swap
with Gazprom. The completion of the asset swap at the end of
September 2015 resulted in the discontinuation of contributions mainly from the natural gas trading and storage business
as of the fourth quarter of 2015, which is usually a seasonally
strong quarter. Sales therefore fell considerably. The considerably lower level of income from operations before special items
conforms to our expectations.
Sales in Other decreased considerably, as predicted.
Contrary to our expectations, income from operations before
special items declined considerably, owing to a lower currency
result not allocated to the segments.
We invested a total of €5.2 billion1 in property, plant and
equipment in 2015, exceeding the forecasted amount of
around €4.0 billion. This higher level of investment is partly
attrib­utable to currency effects and to expenditures on nonBASF-­operated field development projects in the Oil & Gas
segment.
For information on our expectations for 2016, see page 124 onward

▪▪ Total assets slightly below prior-year level
▪▪ Noncurrent assets rise, mostly through investments
▪▪ Current assets decline, mainly due to asset swap
with Gazprom
Amounting to €70,836 million, the level of total assets was
€523 million below that of the previous year.
Noncurrent assets grew by €2,331 million to €46,270 million. The €430 million decline in intangible assets resulted
espe­cially from amortization and impairments as well as from
the asset swap with Gazprom. Currency effects particularly
contrasted this development.
The value of property, plant and equipment grew by
€1,764 million to €25,260 million. At €5,742 million, additions
considerably exceeded depreciation of €3,600 million. Investments amounted to €5,651 million in 2015 and primarily concerned the construction of an integrated TDI complex in
Ludwigs­hafen, Germany; an aroma ingredients plant in Kuantan, Malaysia; an acrylic acid and superabsorbent production
complex in Camaçari, Brazil; and field development projects in
Argentina, Norway and Russia. Currency effects additionally
increased the value of property, plant and equipment. Disposals were mainly attributable to the asset swap with Gazprom.

Investments accounted for using the equity method increased
by €1,191 million to €4,436 million. This rise was primarily
attrib­utable to the asset swap with Gazprom, where BASF
­acquired shares in blocks IV and V of the Achimov formation of
the Urengoy natural gas and condensate field in western Siberia, and through which Wintershall Noordzee B.V. was reclassified to an investment accounted for using the equity method.
The value of other financial assets fell by €14 million to
€526 million in 2015, while deferred tax assets declined from
€2,193 million to €1,791 million.
Other noncurrent receivables and miscellaneous assets
were up by €222 million to €1,720 million year-on-year. This
was mainly due to the increase in the positive fair value of
deriva­tives.
The value of current assets declined by €2,854 million to
€24,566 million. In addition to the asset swap with Gazprom,
this was largely attributable to the reduction of inventories as
well as other receivables and miscellaneous assets.
At €2,241 million, cash and cash equivalents were
€523 million above the level of December 31, 2014.

Equity and liabilities
▪▪ Equity ratio rises from 39.5% to 44.5%
▪▪ Net debt shrinks slightly
Equity grew by €3,350 million to €31,545 million compared
with the previous year. Retained earnings increased by
€1,343 million to €30,120 million. Other comprehensive
­income rose by €1,961 million to minus €3,521 million, primarily because of currency translation effects and the remeasurement of defined benefit plans. The equity ratio was 44.5%
(2014: 39.5%).
Compared with the end of 2014, noncurrent liabilities
­declined by €2,216 million to €25,055 million. All line items
contributed to this development. Provisions for pensions and
similar obligations were reduced by €1 billion, predominantly
as a result of the decline in the projected pension ­increase and
higher discount rates. Long-term financial indebted­ness fell by
€716 million due to the reclassification into short-term fi­ nancial
indebtedness of three bonds due in 2016 with a nominal value
totaling €900 million. Other liabilities declined by €328 million,
other provisions by €133 million and deferred taxes by
€39 million.
Current liabilities fell by €1,657 million to €14,236 million,
predominantly due to the €841 million decline in trade a
­ ccounts
payable and a €1,044 million decline in other liabilities, both of
which mainly resulted from the asset swap with Gazprom. In

addition, short-term provisions fell by €304 million. Short-term
financial indebtedness rose by €529 million, largely on account
of the €1,590 million year-on-year increase in outstanding U.S.
dollar commercial paper as of December 31, 2015, as well as
the previously mentioned reclassification of bonds. Contrasting this was the scheduled repayment of two bonds with a
nominal value of €2 billion and CHF 200 million in 2015. Tax
liabilities r­emained at the prior-year level.
Financial indebtedness decreased overall by €187 million

Financing policy and credit ratings
▪▪ Financing principles remain unchanged
▪▪ “A” ratings conﬁrmed
Our ﬁnancing policy is aimed at ensuring our solvency at all
times, limiting the risks associated with ﬁnancing and optimizing our cost of capital. We preferably meet our ﬁnancing needs
on international capital markets.
We strive to maintain at least a solid “A” rating, which a
­ llows
us unrestricted access to money and capital markets. Our
finan­cing measures are aligned with our operative business
planning as well as the company’s strategic direction and also
ensure the financial flexibility to take advantage of strategic
options.

BASF has good credit ratings, especially in comparison with
competitors in the chemical industry. Rating agency Moody’s
last confirmed their rating of “A1/P-1/outlook stable” on
­November 4, 2015. Standard & Poor’s adjusted the outlook of
their “A+/A-1” rating to “negative” on April 10, 2015. This was
primarily because of an increase in pension provisions as a
result of lower capital market interest rates.
We have solid financing. Corporate bonds form the basis
of our medium to long-term debt financing. These are issued
in euros and other currencies with different maturities as part
of our €20 billion debt issuance program. The goal is to create
a balanced maturity profile and diverse range of investors, and
to optimize our debt capital financing conditions.

For short-term ﬁnancing, we use BASF SE’s U.S. dollar commercial paper program, which has an issuing volume of up to
$12.5 billion. On December 31, 2015, $1,869 million worth of
commercial paper was outstanding under this program. Firmly
committed, syndicated credit lines of €6 billion serve to cover
the repayment of outstanding commercial paper, and can also
be used for general company purposes.
These credit lines were not used at any point in 2015. Our
external financing is therefore largely independent of shortterm fluctuations in the credit markets.

Off-balance-sheet financing tools, such as leasing, are of
­minor importance to us. BASF Group’s most important ﬁnancial contracts contain no side agreements with regard to
speciﬁc ﬁnancial ratios (ﬁnancial covenants) or compliance
with a speciﬁc rating (rating trigger).
For more on the financing tools used, see the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements from page 210 onward

To minimize risks and exploit internal optimization potential
within the Group, we bundle the ﬁnancing, ﬁnancial investments and foreign currency hedging of BASF SE’s subsidiaries
within the BASF Group where possible. Foreign currency risks
are primarily hedged centrally by means of derivative financial
instruments in the market.
Our interest risk management generally pursues the goal
of reducing interest expenses for the Group and minimizing
interest risks. Interest rate hedging transactions are therefore
conducted with banks in order to turn selected capital market
liabilities from fixed interest to variable rate or vice versa.

Management’s Report 
The BASF Group business year — Financial position ﻿

Statement of cash flows
▪▪ Cash provided by operating activities and free cash
flow significantly exceed prior-year levels
At €9,446 million, cash provided by operating activities in
2015 was €2,488 million above the level of the previous year.
This was largely attributable to a decrease in the amount of
capital tied down in net working capital as a result of reduced
inventories and other operating receivables. The line item
“miscellaneous items” particularly contained the transfer of
gains from the asset swap with Gazprom into cash used in
investing activities. In the previous year, this item had primarily
included the reclassification of gains from the disposal of our
50% share in Styrolution Holding GmbH.
Cash used in investing activities amounted to minus
€5,235 million in 2015 compared with minus €4,496 million in
2014. Payments for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets were at €5,812 million, surpassing both the prior
year’s level (€5,296 million) and the level of depreciation and
amortization (€4,448 million).
Acquisitions and divestitures in 2015 resulted in net payments received of €436 million (2014: €373 million).
Cash inﬂow of €141 million from ﬁnancial investments and
other items in 2015 was primarily attributable to the decrease
in other financial receivables. In 2014, the disposal of financial
assets, other financial receivables, and miscellaneous items
had led to €427 million in payments received.
For more on investments and acquisitions, see page 39 onward

BASF Report 2015

Cash used in financing activities amounted to minus
€3,673 million in 2015, compared with minus €2,478 million in
the previous year. The contribution from minority interests to a
capital increase in one Group company was primarily responsible for cash inflow of €66 million in 2015. Cash outflow from the
change in financial indebtedness amounted to €933 million. This
was largely from the scheduled repayment of two bonds; the
expansion of BASF SE’s U.S. dollar commercial paper program
had a countering effect. In 2015, dividends of €2,572 million
were paid to shareholders of BASF SE and €234 million to
­minority interests.
In total, cash and cash equivalents increased by €523 million
compared with the previous year, amounting to €2,241 million as
of December 31, 2015.
Free cash flow rose by €1,972 million to €3,634 million in
2015 on account of higher cash provided by operating activities.

How we create value – an example
Sulfuric acid for the electronics industry
Ultrapure cleaning chemical for microchip production
Value for BASF
Expected annual sales
growth for this application
through 2025

Value for our customers

8%

As a cleaning chemical, sulfuric acid plays a critical role in the
electronics industry when it comes to producing microchips.
The product’s increased purity reduces deposits to the point
that very fine structures can be created. Our sulfuric acid
provides a level of purity 20 times higher than existing
­standards. We expect annual sales growth in this application
of 8% through 2025.

Greater speed in
computer chips

7-fold

Semiconductor manufacturing companies are constantly
competing to develop even higher-performance computer
chips for electronic devices. BASF’s sulfuric acid is so ultrapure that, for the first time, our customers can produce surface
patterns on a 10-nanometer scale – that is, 10,000 times
thinner than a human hair. This allows for chips that are
7 times faster and 2.5 times more energy efficient than today’s
usual 22-nanometer scale.

Strategy
▪▪ Integrated production facilities form core of Verbund
▪▪ Technology and cost leadership provide most
­important competitive edge
With our production facilities, we form the core of the Verbund
structure and supply BASF’s segments with basic chemicals
for the production of downstream products. We add value
with innovations in processes and production, and invest in
future markets to ensure the growth of the entire BASF
­Verbund. As a reliable supplier, we market our products to
customers in downstream industries. We continually improve
our value chains and are expanding our market position –
­particularly outside Europe – with new processes and techno­
logies, as well as through investments and collaborations in
­future markets.

We invest in research and development in order to develop
new technologies and to make our existing technologies even
more efﬁcient. Cost leadership and a clear orientation along
individual value chains are among our most important competitive advantages. We concentrate on the critical success
­factors of the classical chemicals business: making use of
economies of scale, the advantages of our Verbund, high
­capacity utilization, continuous optimization of access to raw
materials, lean processes, and reliable, cost-effective logistics.
Furthermore, we are constantly improving our global
­production structures and aligning these with regional market
requirements.

Chemicals

Petrochemicals

Sales to third parties declined by €2,298 million to
€14,670 million in the Chemicals segment in 2015. This was
essentially due to lower prices on account of decreased raw
material costs, especially in the Petrochemicals division
­(volumes –2%, prices –17%, portfolio –2%, currencies 7%).
Sales were also reduced by the disposal of our share in the
Singapore-based Ellba Eastern Private Ltd. joint operation.
Income from operations before special items fell by €211 million to €2,156 million. This was primarily attributable to the
declining TDI margins in the Monomers division as well as
­rising fixed costs from the startup of new production plants.
Income from operations decreased by €265 million to
€2,131 million. Special items had no material effect on ­earnings
in 2015.
For 2016, we expect a slight decrease in sales. Higher
sales volumes in the Monomers and Intermediates divisions
from the startup of production plants will not be able to offset
lower prices resulting from reduced raw material costs. We
continue to anticipate intense competitive pressure, especially
in the markets for MDI, TDI, acrylic acid and caprolactam.
­Income from operations before special items is likely to decline
considerably. We expect higher fixed costs in the Monomers
and Intermediates divisions due to plant startups and foresee
margin declines, especially in the Petrochemicals division.

▪▪ Sales down by €2,104 million to €5,728 million
due to price declines
▪▪ Earnings slightly below prior-year level due to
higher fixed costs, with improved margins
Sales to third parties decreased in the Petrochemicals division
by €2,104 million to €5,728 million in 2015, mostly because of
a sharp drop in sales prices (volumes –4%, prices –25%,
portfolio –4%, currencies 6%). This development was largely
the result of the sharp decrease in raw material prices since
the fourth quarter of 2014, especially for naphtha. Sales were
furthermore diminished by the consequences of a production
outage at the Ellba C.V. joint operation at the Moerdijk,
­Netherlands, site since June 2014 as well as the divestiture of
our shares in the Singapore-based Ellba Eastern Private Ltd.
joint operation at the end of 2014. In North America, higher
prices for condensate led to reduced c
­ apacity utilization of the
condensate splitter and therefore to lower sales volumes.
Currency effects, however, were overall positive.
For steam cracker products as well as ethylene oxide and
glycols, we saw good margin development in the first half of
2015 in both Europe and North America as a result of market
scarcity. As the second half of the year progressed, margins
weakened perceptibly as product availability on the market
increased. In the industrial petrochemicals business, margins
improved for solvents and plasticizers in Europe, and for solvents and acrylic monomers in North America. The startup of
new plants led to higher fixed costs overall. As a result, income
from operations before special items remained slightly below
the high level of 2014, despite improved margins overall.

Monomers
▪▪ Sales decrease by €244 million to €6,093 million ­
due mainly to lower prices
▪▪ Significant earnings decline due to competitive
­pressure in TDI business as well as startup costs
for new plants
In 2015, sales to third parties in the Monomers division were
down by €244 million to €6,093 million (volumes –1%, prices
–10%, portfolio –1%, currencies 8%). This was predominantly
a result of lower sales prices for polyamides and isocyanates
due to lower raw material costs. The appreciation of currencies, especially the U.S. dollar, relative to the euro had a positive effect on sales.
Volumes growth for MDI and the polyamide-6 extrusion
polymers was not fully able to offset the decline in the TDI
business; sales volumes fell slightly as a result.
Income from operations before special items declined
considerably, largely influenced by lower margins for TDI.
This came especially from slower growth in China and intense
competitive pressure through newly expanded capacities
on the market. Earnings were additionally weighed down by
­startup costs for new production plants.
In China, we began operations at the MDI complex in
Chongqing and a polyamide-6 extrusion plant in Shanghai in
2015. The TDI production complex in Ludwigshafen, ­Germany,
gradually began operations starting November 2015.

Sales to third parties in the Intermediates division rose by
€50 million to €2,849 million year-on-year due to positive
­currency effects and higher sales volumes. Prices were lower
than in the previous year as a result of significantly reduced
raw material prices (volumes 3%, prices –9%, portfolio –1%,
currencies 9%).
Volumes growth was particularly observed in both the
amines and polyalcohol businesses, as well as in specialties,
primarily in North America and Asia. Competitive pressure
from the startup of new capacities in the butanediol and derivatives business had a negative effect on sales.
Income from operations before special items rose slightly
compared with the previous year, predominantly from volumes
growth, an increased proportion of specialties in our product
mix, and improved margins, especially for amines. This
­enabled us to more than compensate for overall higher fixed
costs resulting from the greater number of scheduled plant
turnarounds.
We concluded numerous investment projects in 2015,
especially at BASF’s Verbund sites: We started up a formic
acid plant in Geismar, Louisiana, while new facilities began
operations for special amines in Ludwigshafen, Germany, and
in Nanjing, China. With our joint venture partner Sinopec, we
completed the construction of a neopentyl glycol plant in
­Nanjing, China.

How we create value – an example
Natuphos® E
New generation of phytase enzymes with environmental and economical impact in animal nutrition
Value for BASF
Expected average annual
­sales growth per year
through 2018

Value for our customers and the environment

>5%

In today’s animal nutrition, the enzyme phytase helps nonruminants such as pigs and poultry to ingest and absorb
phosphorus, an essential mineral in feed plants. BASF’s new
phytase, Natuphos® E, can release far more phosphorus for
the animals from the plant than previous generations of the
enzyme. With an average annual sales growth of more than
5% expected through 2018, Natuphos® E is a growth driver
for BASF’s animal nutrition business.

Average annual
savings per
production site

€1 million

Natuphos® E allows our customers to use fewer inorganic
sources of phosphate in their feed production. Each production
site1 can therefore save an average of €1 million per year.
­Phytase-enriched feed also reduces the amount of phosphate
excreted by pigs and poultry by 30%, which in turn benefits the
environment. Through its elevated efficiency, Natuphos® E
­exceeds this figure by a third, significantly reducing phosphate
pollution in soil and water.

Strategy
▪▪ Tailor-made products that improve our customers’
applications and processes
▪▪ Global presence ensures reliable supply to
customers in all regions
▪▪ New structure for pigments business
We take on the challenges arising from important future issues,
especially population growth: scarce resources, environmental
and climatic stressors, greater demand for food and the desire
for better quality of life. In doing so, we focus on research and
development and maintain close relationships to leading companies in our key customer industries. We position ourselves
globally in order to reliably supply customers in all regions. We
invest in the development of innovations that enable our products and processes – as well as our customers’ applications
and processes – to make a contribution to sustainability: for
example, enabling the more efficient use of resources.
Industry-specific specialties make up a major part of our
product range. These products create additional value for our
customers, which allows them to stand out from the competition. We develop new solutions together with our customers

1

Assumption: annual feed production of 200,000 to 250,000 metric tons

and strive for long-term partnerships, which create profitable
growth opportunities for both sides.
We pursue a different business model for standard
­products, such as vitamins or dispersions for paper coatings.
Here, efficient production setups, backward integration in our
Production Verbund’s value chains, capacity management,
and technology and cost leadership are all essential.
We support our customers by serving as a reliable supplier
with consistent product quality, a good value for money and
lean processes.
In January 2016, we combined our pigments activities into
a new global business unit (GBU) based in Ludwigs­hafen,
Germany. The plan is to transfer this business into separate
legal entities. All employees in the pigments business are part
of the new GBU. This reorganization allows for better adaptation to the challenges facing the pigment industry.

Since the dissolution of the Paper Chemicals division on January 1, 2015, we have been continuing its business in the Dispersions & Pigments and Performance Chemicals divisions.
The 2014 figures for both divisions have been adjusted accordingly to ensure better comparability.

Performance Products
At €15,648 million, sales to third parties in the Performance
Products segment in 2015 were €215 million above the level
of the previous year. Positive currency effects in all divisions
were able to more than compensate for lower sales prices and
weaker volumes (volumes –1%, prices –4%, portfolio –1%,
currencies 7%). Decreased volumes were mainly brought
about by lower volumes of pigments and weak demand in the
oilfield chemicals ­business in connection with the price of oil,
as well as the ­unscheduled shutdown of a polyisobutene plant
in Antwerp, Belgium. The market environment for paper
chemi­cals ­remained difficult. Our prices were also negatively
impacted by factors such as intense competition in the ­hygiene
business and vitamin E, along with lower raw material costs.
Income from operations before special items declined by
€89 million to €1,366 million owing to higher fixed costs. These
resulted from negative currency effects and the startup of new
plants – such as those in Camaçari, Brazil, and Freeport,

­ exas – as well as inven­tory reductions. Income from operaT
tions fell by €77 million to €1,340 million. Special charges were
predominantly attributable to restructuring measures. By contrast, special income arose mainly from the sale of our textile
chemicals business, as well as parts of our pharmaceutical
ingredients and services business.
In a market environment that continues to be challenging,
we expect sales in 2016 to match the prior-year levels, despite
lower prices. We want to increase sales volumes in all divisions. Factors supporting this endeavor include new production capacities in the Dispersions & Pigments and Care
Chemicals divisions. Income from operations before special
items should rise slightly above 2015 levels, bolstered by strict
cost discipline and measures to increase competitiveness in all
divisions.

▪▪ Sales rise by €128 million to €4,629 million,
boosted mainly by positive currency effects
▪▪ Slight, margin-driven earnings improvement

▪▪ Currency-driven sales increase of €65 million to
€4,900 million compared with 2014
▪▪ Earnings considerably down due to rise in fixed costs

Sales to third parties in the Dispersions & Pigments division in
2015 rose year-on-year by €128 million to €4,629 million,
mainly as a result of currency developments. Prices and
­volumes fell slightly (volumes –1%, prices –4%, portfolio 1%,
currencies 7%).
In the pigments business, an intense competitive environment led to a significant decline in volumes. Sales volumes in
the paper chemicals business integrated into our division since
2015 decreased in step with the development of the relevant
market. Volumes developed positively in the dispersions business – especially in North America, due to new ­capacities in
Freeport, Texas – and grew slightly overall. The startup of new
plants since the fourth quarter of 2014 led to considerable
sales growth for resins in all regions. We were also able to raise
sales of additives in all regions.
We slightly improved income from operations before special items compared with 2014 through higher margins. Fixed
costs rose, especially because of new plant startups in Freeport, Texas, and Dahej, India. Special charges were above the
level of the previous year, and were mostly related to restructuring measures.
In January 2016, we combined our pigments­­activities into
a new global business unit (GBU) based in Ludwigshafen,
Germany.

In the Care Chemicals division, sales to third parties rose by
€65 million to reach €4,900 million in 2015. This was largely
the result of positive currency effects, especially in connection
with the U.S. dollar. Prices declined, predominantly as a
­consequence of the decrease in raw material costs but also as
a result of competitive pressure, especially in the hygiene
business. Sales volumes matched the level of the previous
year (volumes 0%, prices –5%, portfolio 0%, currencies 6%).
A raw material bottleneck in the production of a range of
Care Chemicals products reduced sales volumes. In a market
environment that continues to be challenging, we were able to
compensate for this development through volumes i­ncreases
in other business areas, especially in Asia. Oleochemical surfactants and fatty alcohols made the strongest contributions.
Income from operations before special items fell considerably due to higher fixed costs. Contributing factors included
the startup of new plants as well as a lower level of capacity
utilization than in the previous year, due in part to a reduction
in inventories. Special charges were largely attributable to
restruc­turing measures.
In the second quarter of 2015, we began operations at a
superabsorbent production plant in Camaçari, Brazil. Moreover, we invested in the modification of a new superabsorbent
technology platform in Antwerp, Belgium, and in new capacities for chelating agents in Theodore, Alabama.

▪▪ Sales decrease by €31 million to €1,998 million due
mainly to lower prices
▪▪ Earnings considerably down due to margin pressure,
plant shutdowns and divestitures

▪▪ Sales grow by €53 million to €4,121 million through
positive currency effects
▪▪ Higher margins lead to significant earnings increase

In the Nutrition & Health division, sales to third parties
­decreased by €31 million to €1,998 million despite positive
currency effects (volumes 1%, prices –7%, portfolio –3%,
currencies 7%). Intense competitive pressure, especially in the
vitamin E business, along with decreased raw material costs in
the ­aroma chemicals business, led to a decline in prices. Sales
were furthermore reduced by the disposal of parts of our
pharma­
ceutical ingredients and services business, which
invol­ved the custom synthesis business and parts of the active
pharmaceutical ingredients portfolio.
Sales volumes were slightly up compared with 2014,
thanks to a large extent to increased volumes in our ­businesses
with human and animal nutrition as well as flavors and fragrances.
Income from operations before special items declined
considerably. This was mainly because of margin pressure, in
addition to effects from plant shutdowns and divestitures. We
were able to stabilize fixed costs on the prior-year level by
­implementing further efficiency measures.
We carried out numerous measures to increase our competitiveness. Special charges arose from, for example, the
closure of the sterol site in Pasadena, Texas, at the end of
2015. These charges were contrasted by special income from
the disposal of parts of our pharmaceutical ingredients and
services business.

In the Performance Chemicals division, sales to third parties
rose by €53 million to €4,121 million compared with 2014.
This was mainly the result of positive currency effects with
lower ­volumes and prices (volumes –3%, prices –2%, portfolio
–2%, currencies 8%).
In all regions except Europe, we achieved considerable
sales growth, which was supported to a large extent by our
business with plastic additives. Sales volumes were in total
slightly below 2014 levels. This is mostly attributable to the
unscheduled shutdown of a polyisobutene plant in Antwerp,
Belgium, as well as the significant, oil-price-related decrease
in demand for oilfield chemicals. We also posted a volumes
decline in the portion of our paper chemicals business that has
been ­allocated to the division since 2015. Our sales prices fell
particularly as a result of a drop in raw material costs. In addition, sales were weighed down by the disposal of our textile
chemicals business at the end of June 2015.
Income from operations before special items rose considerably compared with 2014. Higher margins in almost every
business area were able to more than offset a currency-­driven
rise in fixed costs.
Special income arose from the sale of our textile chemicals
business. Special charges came in part from measures to
restructure our businesses with water, oilfield, mining, and
­
paper chemicals.

Functional Materials & Solutions

Catalysts

In the Functional Materials & Solutions segment, we increased
sales to third parties by €798 million to €18,523 million as
compared with the previous year. This development was
essen­
tially due to ­
positive currency effects in all divisions.
Prices dipped slightly overall, while volumes remained stable
(volumes 0%, prices –4%, portfolio 0%, currencies 9%).
­Higher demand, especially from the automotive industry, was
not able to offset lower sales volumes in precious metal trading. At €1,649 million, income from operations before special
items exceeded 2014 levels by €452 million, primarily thanks
to the sharp earnings increases in the Performance Materials
and Construction Chemicals divisions. Despite higher special
charges in the Catalysts division, income from operations for
the segment grew by €457 million to €1,607 million.
For 2016, we expect continuing high demand from our key
customer industries, automotive and construction, and are
planning on volumes increases in all divisions. We do, how­
ever, anticipate negative effects from continuing declines in
precious metal prices and predict overall that sales will match
the prior-year level. We aim to slightly raise income from
opera­tions before special items.

▪▪ Sales rise by €171 million to €6,306 million,
boosted mainly by positive currency effects
▪▪ Considerable earnings decline due in part to
lower contribution from precious metal trading
In the Catalysts division, sales to third parties rose by
€171 million to €6,306 million in 2015, mostly through highly
positive currency effects from the U.S. dollar (volumes –2%,
prices –8%, portfolio 1%, currencies 12%).
The decline in volumes and prices in the Catalysts division was largely attributable to lower volumes and prices in
precious metal trading, reducing this business’s contribution
by €187 million to €2,388 million. Greater sales volumes of
mobile emissions catalysts in Europe and Asia positively
­affected sales. We posted a decline in volumes of chemical
and refinery catalysts, especially in Asia.
Income from operations before special items dropped
considerably compared with the previous year, due in particular to lower contributions from precious metal trading and
battery materials. The decline in precious metal trading
was essentially the result of lower precious metal prices. In
the battery materials business, fixed costs rose partly on
­account of increased investment in research and development. The gradual startup of plants in Środa Śla˛ska, Poland,

79

80

Management’s Report 
The BASF Group business year — Functional Materials & Solutions ﻿

BASF Report 2015

and Ludwigs­hafen, Germany, for mobile emissions catalysts
and chemical catalysts also contributed significantly to the
rise in fixed costs. Special charges arose mainly through an
impairment on intangible assets.
In February 2015, we acquired from TODA ­
KOGYO
CORP. a 66% share in a company that specializes in cathode
materials for lithium-ion batteries in Japan, thus expanding
our global battery materials network.

Construction Chemicals
▪▪ Currency and volumes-related sales growth of

▪▪ Considerable rise in earnings as a result of
volumes growth and positive currency effects
In the Construction Chemicals division, sales to third parties
rose by €244 million year-on-year to €2,304 million. This was
predominantly the result of positive currency effects in almost
every region, as well as higher volumes (volumes 5%, prices
–1%, portfolio 0%, currencies 8%).
In Europe, sales especially increased on account of greater
demand. In North America, considerable year-on-year sales
growth was mainly attributable to positive currency effects,
in addition to slightly higher volumes and prices. Positive
­currency effects and a rise in volumes were largely responsible
for considerably improved sales in the region South America,
Africa, Middle East. Demand for our products grew ­particularly
in the countries of the Middle East. Sales in Asia increased
predominantly on account of positive currency effects, with
volumes growing slightly and prices down.
Income from operations before special items considerably
surpassed the level of 2014, especially because of higher
­volumes and positive currency effects.

Coatings
▪▪ Sales improve by €182 million to €3,166 million,
­driven mostly by currencies
▪▪ Earnings rise slightly, mainly through contribution
from automotive OEM coatings
In the Coatings division, sales to third parties grew by
€182 million to €3,166 million in 2015, predominantly through
positive currency effects. Portfolio effects, along with higher
volumes and prices, also contributed to this sales increase
(volumes 1%, prices 1%, portfolio 1%, currencies 3%). We
raised prices in all business areas. Increased volumes especially in North America and Europe more than compensated
for a volumes decline in South America.
Our sales of automotive OEM coatings saw considerable
growth, driven both by currency effects and by higher volumes
in Europe and North America. For automotive refinish coatings, we were able to more than offset weaker demand in
South America and Asia through higher sales prices and
­positive currency effects. The rise in sales in the industrial
coatings business was partly attributable to positive currency
effects. Sales fell sharply in the decorative paints business in
Brazil, despite i­ncreased sales prices. This was predominantly
the result of negative currency effects as well as overall weak
demand.
We were able to slightly raise income from operations
before special items, mostly through the contribution from
­
automotive OEM coatings.
In 2015, we began operations at our new coating resins
plant in Shanghai, China, to support our growth in the region
with innovative products from local production.

Performance Materials
▪▪ Sales up by €201 million to €6,747 million
through positive currency effects
▪▪ Considerable earnings growth due to higher margins
We increased sales to third parties by €201 million to
€6,747 million in the Performance Materials division in 2015
(volumes 0%, prices –4%, portfolio 0%, currencies 7%). This
was largely the result of positive currency effects in North
America and Asia. While volumes shrank in South America
and Asia, we achieved higher volumes in Europe and North
America. Sales prices fell as a consequence of lower raw
­material prices.
We considerably increased sales to the automotive industry thanks to significantly higher demand in Europe, Asia and
North America. With currency effects positive overall, we were
able to raise sales volumes, particularly in the businesses with
engineering plastics, polyurethane (PU) systems, and the
special elastomer Cellasto®.
Our business with the consumer goods industry also
developed well, despite lower volumes in Asia and South
­
America. This was essentially thanks to volumes growth for
polyurethane systems in Europe and North America as well as
for thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU) and biopolymers.
Sales to the construction industry declined, however, due
primarily to the divestiture of our white expandable polystyrene
(EPS) business in North and South America. Volumes rose
in the polyurethane systems business despite a decrease in
Asia.

81

Management’s Report
The BASF Group business year — Functional Materials & Solutions﻿

We achieved considerably higher income from operations
before special items. This was predominantly because of
­
higher margins resulting from lower raw material prices as well
as the positive development of our high-margin specialties
businesses.
In 2015, we expanded our specialties business, especially
Cellasto®, through investments at the site in Shanghai, China.
Moreover, we started operations at a new compounding plant
for Ultramid® and Ultradur® at the site in Yesan, South Korea,
and at a new polyurethane system house in Geismar, L
­ ouisiana.
With the acquisition of Taiwan Sheen Soon Co. Ltd. completed

Value for the environment

>10%

Limus®, our patented formulation from the Functional Crop
Care business unit, both improves the ecological profile of
urea-based fertilizers and makes them more efficient. Limus®
blocks urease enzymes more effectively than comparable
products. This improves plants’ nitrogen supply and fulfills
­increased legal mandates to reduce nitrogen loss. We anticipate annual market growth of over 10% for urease inhibitors
from 2015 to 2020.

Reduced loss of nitrogen
from urea-based fertilizers
into the atmosphere

up to

90%

Farmers use mainly urea-based fertilizers to ensure sufficient
nitrogen supply, which is crucial for plant growth. However,
urease enzymes break down about 50% of the nitrogen contained in the fertilizer into gaseous ammonia. Released into the
atmosphere, this negatively impacts the environment. Limus®
is an innovative combination of two urease inhibitors able to
reduce nitrogen loss from fertilizers by up to 90%.

Strategy
▪▪ Helping to feed a growing world population
▪▪ Long-term innovation strategy ensures future growth
▪▪ Development of solutions that go beyond
­conventional crop protection
Our strategy is based on long-term market trends. A key challenge of the future will be to ensure sufficient food for a growing
world population. To do so, farmers around the world will need
to increase their yields – and yet the natural resources for
­doing so, such as water and arable land, are limited. We see it
as our duty to provide farmers with professional support in
producing more – and more nutritious – food as efficiently as
possible.
We are committed to the responsible treatment of our
products and the environment. We offer our customers a
broad portfolio of integrated solutions and continually invest in
our development pipeline to create chemical and biological
innovations in crop protection.
Our research and development activities range from solutions for protecting plants against fungi, insects and weeds, to
seeds and soil management, to plant health.

For example, the Functional Crop Care business unit not only
provides products for improving seeds and innovations for
better soil management, but also biological and chemical
technologies that make plants better able to withstand stress
factors like heat, cold and nutrient deficiency.
We are intensifying our investment in growth markets and
continuing to expand our good position in our core markets.
In collaboration with seed companies, we benefit from the
technological competence of BASF Plant Science. In addition,
we work together with other BASF divisions and with external
partners to be able to offer the best solutions for our ­customers.
Together with John Deere, we collaborate with farmers to
­further the development of integrated IT applications for precision agriculture. These will provide not only more exact information on crop development, but also support farmers in
carrying out the legally required procedures for application and
documentation of crop protection measures. In Brazil, our
customers can already make use of the DigiLab application to
easily diagnose plant diseases and access information on
possible and recommended treatments.

in Functional Crop Care. Examples include our new research
and development center for seed solutions in Limburgerhof,
Germany, and the ramped up production facility in Littlehampton, England, that strengthens our portfolio of biological
solutions for agriculture and gardening. In order to continue
meeting ­ongoing high demand for our innovative products in
the ­future, we will invest around €810 million in developing
and expanding our production and formulation capacities for
­active ingredients between 2016 and 2020.

BASF Plant Science
Plant biotechnology at BASF
BASF Plant Science is one of the world’s leading suppliers of
plant biotechnology for agriculture. Our headquarters at the
Research Triangle Park site near Raleigh, North Carolina,
­ensure our proximity to our main markets in North and South
America. With our global network of research sites, we help
farmers meet the growing demand for increased agricultural
productivity as well as better nutrition. BASF invested around
€150 million for this purpose in 2015. Research expenses,
sales, earnings and all other data of BASF Plant Science are
not included in the Agricultural Solutions segment; they are
reported in Other.

With a pioneering platform for gene identification, BASF Plant
Science has specialized in the development of plant characteristics such as higher yield, herbicide tolerance and disease
resistance. Our goal is to optimize crops so that farmers can
achieve greater and more secure yields. In this way, we make
an important contribution to securing a better food supply for
a growing world population. We also contribute to sustainable
agriculture, as the cultivation of these plants significantly
­reduces the amount of land, water and energy required to
produce each metric ton of harvested crops. One example is
the drought-resistant corn launched on the market in 2013,
which can protect farmers in the United States from harvest
losses in times of drought.

Agricultural ­Solutions
In the Agricultural Solutions segment, we raised sales to third
parties by €374 million to €5,820 million in 2015, primarily
through higher sales prices. We observed decreased demand
for crop protection products over the course of the year, as
crop commodity prices remained at a low level. A volatile
environment and the depreciation of local currencies,
­
­especially in the emerging markets, had a negative effect on
our business. In this challenging environment, income from
operations before special items declined by €19 million to
€1,090 million. Income from operations fell by €25 million to
€1,083 million.
For 2016, we expect continued slow market growth and
high exchange rate volatility in some of our key growth markets. Despite this difficult economic environment, we plan to
increase our sales volumes, especially of innovative herbicides. Through increased sales and continued strict cost
management, we aim to slightly improve sales and income
from operations before special items.

Crop Protection
▪▪ Sales improve by €374 million to €5,820 million,
­driven mainly by prices
▪▪ At €1,090 million, earnings 2% below prior-year level
due to higher fixed costs
We improved sales to third parties by €374 million to
€5,820 million compared with the previous year. This was
­primarily attributable to higher contributions from the herbicide
business in North America and from the fungicide business in
Europe and South America. In the second half of the year, we
were able to offset the depreciation of emerging-market
­currencies by raising prices (volumes 1%, prices 5%, currencies 1%).
In Europe, sales rose by €61 million to €2,107 million,
mainly through strong demand for fungicides as well as higher
prices in the first half of the year. This allowed us to more than

compensate for weaker demand in the second half of the year
due to dry conditions in western Europe. Our business in
Russia and Ukraine grew, despite a difficult political environment.
Sales in North America exceeded the previous year’s
level by €296 million, reaching €1,870 million. Higher herbicide
sales, especially of Kixor®, and positive currency effects from
the U.S. dollar supported this growth. In the fungicides business, sales declined on account of lower crop commodity
prices and unfavorable weather conditions.
At €525 million, sales in Asia matched prior-year levels as
positive currency effects compensated for a sharp drop in
volumes. Lower demand for soy herbicides in India was a
major factor behind the volumes decline, and was attributable
to reduced soybean acreage, a very dry season, and increased
competition from generic manufacturers.
Our sales in South America grew by €18 million to
€1,318 million, while the total South American crop protection
market shrank in 2015. In this difficult environment, we considerably increased sales volumes of fungicides, especially
­Xemium®. In the second half of the year, price increases were
unable to fully offset currency losses from the depreciation of
the Brazilian real.
Income from operations before special items amounted to
€1,090 million, which was €19 million below the level of the
previous year. This slight decrease was attributable to higher
fixed costs arising mainly from lower plant capacity utilization
as a result of the startup of new capacities and inventory
reduc­tion at the same time.

How we create value – an example

Reduction of
investment costs
around

50%

Through an innovative development concept and the involvement of other companies, we can develop the Maria oilfield in
Norway without building a new production platform. Instead,
we are using external partners’ existing infrastructure and
have developed intelligent technical solutions for this. Doing so
allows us to increase profitability and reduce development
­
costs by around half when compared with new construction.

Reduction of
carbon emissions

>50%

In the Maria oilfield, a subsea tieback will connect two wellhead installations on the sea floor to three platforms over a
distance of up to 45 kilometers. This consumes significantly
less material than the construction of a new production facility.
Existing infrastructure is put to its best possible use, and less
energy is required for oil production and processing, thereby
reducing carbon emissions by more than half.

Strategy
▪▪ Pursuit of our growth strategy through
exploration, acquisitions, strategic partnerships
and technological expertise
▪▪ Asset swap with Gazprom
▪▪ Contribution to securing Europe’s natural gas supply
In the future, crude oil and natural gas will continue to
contribute significantly toward covering the rising energy
­
­demand of a growing world population. That is why we invest
in the exploration and production of oil and gas, primarily in
our core ­
regions Europe, North Africa, Russia and South
America, thereby continuing along our growth course. We also
aim to establish the Middle East as another core region in our
­portfolio.
Selected collaborations, strategic partnerships, innovative
technologies and the responsible development and production of hydrocarbons all form the basis of our growth-oriented
strategy. Through the continuous optimization of our cost
structure and portfolio of oil and gas activities, we ensure our
future competitive viability, even in times when oil and gas
prices are low. Measured by production volumes as well as by
contribution to income from operations before special items,
gas activities comprised around 70% of our portfolio in 2015.
Handling hydrocarbons in a responsible manner demands
special measures for the protection of people and the environment. We therefore carefully assess the potential effects of

every project before we begin. Together with experts, contractors and relevant stakeholders, we develop methods and
­implement measures to be able to use resources even more
efficiently and minimize the impact on the environment. In
­doing so, we act in accordance with international agreements,
legal requirements and our own, self-imposed high standards.
On September 30, 2015, we and our partner Gazprom
completed the swap of assets of equivalent value that had
originally been planned for the end of 2014. The swap took
place with retroactive ﬁnancial effect to April 1, 2013. This
transaction gave BASF the economic equivalent of 25.01% of
the blocks IV and V in the Achimov formation of the Urengoy
natural gas and condensate field in western Siberia. These
two blocks will be developed jointly by Gazprom and Winters­
hall. According to the development plan originally confirmed
by Russian authorities, they contain total hydrocarbon
resources of 274 billion cubic meters of natural gas and
­
74 million metric tons of condensate. As these figures are still
undergoing review, new findings may give rise to adjustments.
Production is scheduled to start in 2018.
In return, BASF transferred its shares in the previously
jointly run natural gas trading and storage business to ­Gazprom.
This included the 50.02% shares in the following: the natural
gas trading company WINGAS GmbH, Kassel, Germany; the
storage company astora GmbH & Co. KG, Kassel, Germany,
which operates natural gas storage facilities in Rehden and

87

Management’s Report 
The BASF Group business year — Oil & Gas ﻿

Jemgum, Germany; and WINGAS Holding GmbH, Kassel,
Germany, including its share in the natural gas storage facility
in Haidach, Austria. BASF also transferred its 50% share in
each of the natural gas trading companies Wintershall Erdgas
Handelshaus GmbH & Co. KG, Berlin, Germany, and
­
­W intershall Erdgas Handelshaus Zug AG, Zug, Switzerland.
Gazprom furthermore became a 50% share­holder in Winters­
hall ­Noordzee B.V. in Rijswijk, Netherlands, which is active in
the ­exploration and production of natural gas and crude oil
­deposits in the North Sea. In the first three quarters of 2015,
these activities contributed a total of around €10.1 billion to
sales, about €260 million to income from operations before
special items, and approximately €650 million to EBITDA. This
­EBITDA figure includes special income from the asset swap.
Our cooperation with Gazprom in the natural gas transport
business will continue unaltered. With western Europe’s
demand for natural gas steadily on the rise while its local
­
production simultaneously decreases, it is becoming more
and more important to secure sufficient imports. For this
reason, we and other European partners want to participate
in the expansion of the Nord Stream Pipeline. The Nord
Stream 2 project intends to build two additional offshore
pipelines from Russia to Germany through the Baltic Sea,
helping ensure a long-term and reliable supply of natural gas
to the European Union.

Exploration & Production
▪▪ Active portfolio management, including
expansion of our position in Norway
Europe: The Mittelplate field off the North Sea coast is the
cornerstone of our crude oil production in Germany. We own
a 50% stake in this field, the largest known oil deposit in the
country. At the Bockstedt oilfield, the field test for increasing
recovery rates using the biopolymer Schizophyllan was
­continued.
With the acquisition of shares in the Vega and Gjøa fields
in Norway at the end of 2014, Wintershall established itself as
one of the largest producers on the Norwegian continental
shelf. In March 2015, Wintershall Norge AS took over operatorship of the Vega oil and gas field from Statoil.
We began production in the Knarr field in the Norwegian
North Sea in March 2015. We continued work on developing
the Edvard Grieg oilfield, and the first volumes were produced
at the end of November. At the beginning of September, the
Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy approved the
plan for development and operation of the Maria field submitted by Wintershall, the field’s operator. The plan involves linking
the field to the Kristin, Heidrun and Åsgard B production platforms via subsea ties.

BASF Report 2015

We began production of natural gas at the unmanned
L6-B “minimum facility” platform in the Dutch North Sea.
This miniplatform is one of a new generation of facilities that
can be deployed in especially shallow waters, enabling economic yield from even very small deposits. We ceased the
production of crude oil from the Kotter and Logger developments in the Dutch North Sea, as the limited volumes remaining can no longer be produced in an economical manner.
Russia: The Yuzhno Russkoye natural gas ﬁeld in western
Siberia, in which we have a 35% economic interest, has been
operating at plateau production since 2009. The first wells
were successfully drilled for the development of the Turon
horizons, a further formation in this natural gas field. We hold a
50% stake in the development of Block IA of the Achimov
formation in the Urengoy ﬁeld in western Siberia. The gradual
development of this field was continued; 62 wells were producing at the end of 2015. We will develop blocks IV and V of
the Achimov formation together with Gazprom.
North Africa / Middle East: In Libya, we are the operator
of eight oilﬁelds in the onshore concessions 96 and 97. Due to
difficult political conditions, we were only able to produce in
concession 96 from February to May 2015 and from September to the beginning of November 2015, for a total of 125 days.
Operations were able to continue uninterrupted at the Al Jurf
offshore oilfield in Libya, in which we have a stake.
In Abu Dhabi, we completed our first exploration drilling as
operator in the development of the Shuweihat sour gas field;
preparations are underway for a further exploration well. Our
activities in Qatar were suspended in May of 2015 with the
expiration of the concession license.
South America: We hold shares in a total of fifteen ­onshore
and offshore ﬁelds in Argentina. We began two shale drillings
as operator in the Vaca Muerta formation in the Neuquén
province in March, as stipulated in the joint operation agreement between Wintershall Energía and Gas y Petróleo del
Neuquén. In December 2015, we increased our share in the
Aguada Federal block – part of the Vaca Muerta formation in
the Neuquén province – from 50% to 90%. In Chile, we hold
10% of the San Sebastian block.

Natural Gas Trading
▪▪ Gas trading and storage business transferred to
­Gazprom in asset swap
▪▪ Natural gas transport activities to be continued
­together with Gazprom
Our natural gas trading and storage activities were transferred
to Gazprom with the asset swap completed in September
2015. We will continue our joint activities in the gas transport
sector with Gazprom in the Oil & Gas segment, but they will
not be separately reported.
As a holding company for the German subsidiaries in natural gas transport, WIGA Transport Beteiligungs-GmbH & Co.
KG (WIGA) mainly fulfills a reporting and financing capacity.
GASCADE Gastransport GmbH, OPAL Gastransport GmbH &
Co. KG, and NEL Gastransport GmbH all act as independent
subsidiaries under the umbrella of the holding company. This
organizational structure allows us to meet the unbundling
require­ments set down by the German Energy Act. The widely
regulated transport sector is characterized by stable conditions and yields based on ­approved costs and tariffs.

Startup

The companies under the WIGA umbrella operate a
3,300 kilometer long-distance network that includes the pipeline links to the Nord Stream Pipeline, the Baltic Sea Pipeline
Link (OPAL) and the North European Gas Pipeline (NEL).
We hold a 15.5% share in the Nord Stream Pipeline
through Nord Stream AG, which is accounted for in the BASF
Group’s financial statements using the equity method. Other
shareholders are Gazprom (51%) and E.ON (15.5%), as well
as N.V. Nederlandse Gasunie and GDF Suez (9% each). With
a total capacity of 55 billion cubic meters of natural gas per
year, this pipeline, which stretches from Russia to the German
coast over the Baltic Sea, helps shore up supply security in
Europe.
In order to carry out the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, we
signed the contracts in September 2015 to build two a
­ dditional
offshore pipelines through the Baltic Sea. The project will be
developed by the company Nord Stream 2 AG. Gazprom
holds a 50% share in the project company; BASF/Wintershall,
ENGIE, E.ON, OMV and Shell will each hold a 10% share upon
approval by the relevant authorities.

Oil & Gas
At €12,998 million, the Oil & Gas segment’s sales to third
parties were €2,147 million lower than in 2014 (volumes 15%,
prices/currencies –9%, portfolio –20%). This was largely a
­result of the asset swap with Gazprom completed at the end
of September, which meant that contributions from the natural
gas trading and storage business, as well as from Wintershall
Noordzee B.V., ceased starting in the fourth quarter of 2015.
The significant drop in the price of oil led to slightly lower sales
in the Exploration & Production business sector. However,
sales were positively impacted by a volumes increase in both
the Exploration & Production and Natural Gas Trading b
­ usiness
sectors. The drop in sales meant a decline in income from
opera­tions before special items by €429 million to €1,366 million. Special charges totaled €636 million in 2015; these arose
predominantly from ­impairments on exploration and production projects and on goodwill as a result of our r­ educed oil and
gas price assumptions. Special income of €342 million, particularly from the asset swap with Gazprom, was only partly able
to compensate for this. Income from opera­
tions therefore
decreased by €616 million to €1,072 million. Net income
­
­declined by €414 million to €1,050 million.

Our planning for the 2016 business year is based on an
­average oil price of Brent crude of $40 per barrel and an
­exchange rate of $1.10 per euro. On average, gas prices are
likely to hover considerably below the level of 2015. We expect
to expand production; however, sales and income from operations before special items are likely to see a considerable
decline compared with 2015, largely on account of the significant drop in oil and gas prices as well as the divestiture of the
gas trading and storage business. Furthermore, we will generate lower sales and earnings from our share in the Yuzhno
Russkoye natural gas field, as the surplus ­quantities produced
over the last ten years will be compensated in 2016 as
­contractually agreed with our partner Gazprom.

Exploration & Production

Natural Gas Trading

▪▪ At €2,809 million, sales down by 4%, mainly owing
to lower prices
▪▪ Crude oil and natural gas production up by 13%
▪▪ Declining production in Germany due to
authorization status for fracking plans
▪▪ Earnings below prior-year level, mainly weighed down
by prices

▪▪ Sales decline by 17% to €10,189 million as
­contribution from trading and storage activities
­ceases in fourth quarter
▪▪ Earnings rise significantly through contribution
from trading business

Sales to third parties in the Exploration & Production business
sector amounted to €2,809 million, 4% below the level of the
previous year. Higher volumes in Russia and portfolio-driven
growth in Norway were unable to offset the sharp drop in
prices. Furthermore, sales at Wintershall Noordzee B.V. have
not been included in BASF Group sales since the fourth quarter of 2015, as the asset swap with Gazprom resulted in
accoun­ting for the company using the equity method instead
of full consolidation.
The price of Brent crude oil fell by 47% compared with
2014, to $52 per barrel. In euro terms, this was a d
­ ecrease of
37% to €47 per barrel (2014: €74 per barrel).
Income from operations before special items fell considerably compared with the previous year, mainly as a result of
lower prices.
We increased our crude oil and natural gas production by
13%, up to 153 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE). Production rose substantially both in Norway and in our joint operation
Achimgaz in Russia. Despite difficult political conditions, we
were were able to produce in onshore concession 96 in Libya
from February to May and from September to the begin­ning of
November 2015 for a total of 125 days. Contrasting this was
the further decrease of production in Germany, which was
influ­enced by both a natural production decline and the authorization logjam for fracking plans in conventional deposits that
has continued for more than four years.
In the search for new crude oil and natural gas deposits,
we ﬁnished drilling a total of 25 exploration and appraisal wells
in 2015, of which 17 were successful.
Our proven crude oil and natural gas reserves increased
by 2% compared with the end of 2014, to 1,744 million BOE.
We replenished 123% of the volumes produced in 2015. The
­reserve-to-production ratio is around 11 years (2014: 13 years).
This is based on Wintershall’s share of production in 2015 and
refers to the reserves at year-end.
For more on our crude oil and natural gas reserves,
see page 225 onward

In the Natural Gas Trading business sector, sales to third
­parties decreased by 17% million to €10,189 million. This
was due to the asset swap completed with Gazprom on
September 30, 2015, through which the contributions from
trading and storage activities were discontinued in the fourth
quarter. In the first three quarters of 2015, these activities had
contributed around €10.1 billion to sales. In the same period,
497 billion kilowatt hours in volumes were generated, which
was 88 billion kilowatt hours more than in the same period of
the previous year. As a consequence of the transaction, sales
volumes decreased by 64 billion kilowatt hours compared with
the full 2014 business year. WINGAS provided 3% of its volumes to BASF Group companies outside of the Oil & Gas
segment.
Income from operations before special items considerably
exceeded the level of the prior year. Lower contributions from
both the storage and transport businesses were more than
offset by higher earnings from the trading business.

▪▪ At €38,675 million, sales down by 10% from level of
previous year
▪▪ Ludwigshafen Verbund site strengthened by further
investments

▪▪ Sales rise by 1% to €15,665 million compared with
previous year
▪▪ Startup of dispersions plant in Freeport, Texas, and
formic acid production in Geismar, Louisiana

At €38,675 million, sales at companies headquartered in the
region Europe in 2015 were 10% below the level of 2014. This
was largely due to lower sales prices in addition to the asset
swap with Gazprom completed at the end of September,
through which the the natural gas trading and storage business in particular ceased its contributions to the Oil & Gas
segment in the fourth quarter of 2015.
The Chemicals segment saw a mainly price-related decline
in sales. With volumes stable, sales in the Performance Products segment were slightly below the previous year’s level. In
the Functional Materials & Solutions segment, we were able to
compensate for lower prices through higher demand and
positive currency effects. Sales rose slightly in the Agricultural
Solutions segment. This was primarily the result of positive
price developments.
Income from operations before special items amounted to
€4,527 million, a decrease of 5% compared with 2014. This
was mainly because of the significantly lower contribution from
the Oil & Gas segment on account of the lower price of oil as
well as considerably lower earnings in Other. The sharp earnings improvement in the chemicals business1 could only partly
offset this.
We want to continue expanding our position on the market
and with our customers through investments and innovations.
For this reason, we strengthened the Ludwigshafen Verbund
site with further investments. A multiple-product facility for
special amines with multifaceted applications began production in 2015, and the new TDI complex gradually started
opera­tions beginning in November 2015.

Sales at companies headquartered in North America grew by
1% year-on-year to €15,665 million. In local currency terms,
they fell by 15% in the region. The sales increase was essentially due to positive currency effects in all divisions, which
more than compensated for raw material cost-related price
drops in the chemicals business – especially in the Petrochemicals division – as well as an overall slight decline in sales
volumes.
In 2015, income from operations before special items fell
to €1,425 million and therefore decreased by 9% compared
with the previous year, mainly as a result of unfavorable sales
and margin developments in the Chemicals segment. A lower
contribution came from the Performance Products segment,
as well. Considerable earnings improvement in the Functional
Materials & Solutions segment and a slight increase in Agricultural Solutions partially offset the decrease.
In this region, we continue to focus on innovation, attractive market segments and cross-business initiatives in order to
ensure profitable growth. At the same time, we are enhancing
our operational excellence through ongoing improvements.
Attractive growth prospects in North America and cost-­
effective raw material prices are strengthening our investment
plans in the region. At our site in Freeport, Texas, we commenced operations at a new dispersions plant and began
construction of a new ammonia plant together with Yara.
Our production facility for formic acid started up in Geismar,
Louisiana, making us the first formic acid producer in North
America. We are explor­
ing an investment in a world-scale
methane-to-propylene complex on the U.S. Gulf Coast.

With decelerating market growth, sales at companies headquartered in the Asia Pacific region rose by 1% to €11,712 million. In local currency terms, sales declined by 12%.
Considerable sales increases, primarily in the Catalysts,
Coatings and Care Chemicals divisions, were able to more
than compensate, in particular, for declines in the Petrochemicals and Monomers divisions as well as in Other. Currency
effects posi­tively influenced sales, especially in the first half of
the year. In the Chemicals segment in particular, lower raw
material costs and higher production capacities on the market
resulted in falling prices. Sales were furthermore weighed
down by the disposal of our shares in the Ellba Eastern Private
Ltd. joint opera­tion in Singapore and by the divestiture of our
textile chemicals business.
Income from operations before special items fell by 33% to
€409 million. Significant factors here were higher fixed costs
stemming from the startup of new plants and from lower plant
capacity utilization, which was mainly attributable to several
scheduled maintenance shutdowns in the first half of the year.
As part of our regional strategy, we are striving to further
raise the proportion of sales coming from local production in
Asia Pacific in the years ahead. We once again made progress
toward this goal: In China, we started operations at new production sites and plants in Chongqing, Nanjing, Maoming and
Shanghai. Further investment projects are currently in the
construction phase, as planned. The continuing expansion of
our Innovation Campus Asia Pacific in Shanghai, China,
strengthens the presence of this growth region within the
global Research Verbund. To improve profitability in Asia
­Pacific, we intensified our measures to increase efficiency and
effec­tiveness.

Sales at companies headquartered in the region South America,
­Africa, Middle East grew by 1% to €4,397 million compared
with 2014. In local currency terms, sales were up by 7%.
Gross domestic product shrank in South America as a
consequence of the recession in Brazil and the deteriorating
economic environment in other countries in the region. Our
sales declined slightly under these conditions. We were only
partly able to offset negative currency effects, especially from
the depreciation of the Brazilian real, by raising prices. Sales
decreased in the chemicals business but rose in the crop
protection business and in the Oil & Gas segment.
Companies in Africa and in the Middle East showed considerable sales growth, driven by volumes and currencies. In
Africa, we raised sales primarily in the Functional Materials &
Solutions segment. In the Middle East, substantially increased
demand in the Construction Chemicals division had a positive
effect on sales.
Income from operations before special items declined by
10% to €378 million, essentially because of higher fixed costs
in the Petrochemicals and Care Chemicals divisions from
starting up the acrylic acid and superabsorbent production
complex in Camaçari, Brazil, in the second quarter of 2015.
In addition to our growth strategy, we implemented a
­series of structural measures in South America that increase
our productivity and sharpen the focus on our customers’
needs. With operations beginning at the production complex
in Camaçari, Brazil, we are well positioned to take part in the
­region’s growing demand, viewed over the long term.
We continued to expand our local presence in Africa in
2015 with a range of measures. This included inaugurating a
production plant for concrete additives in Lagos, Nigeria, in
October 2015.

contribution to sustainable development transparent. In order
to achieve this, we set ourselves an ambitious goal: By 2020,
we aim to evaluate the sustainability performance of 70% of
the BASF Group’s relevant suppliers1 pursuant to our riskbased approach and develop action plans for any necessary
improvements. The proportion of evaluated relevant suppliers
was at 31% by the end of 2015. Furthermore, our Procurement competence center supports BASF’s business units in
developing solutions to stand out from the competition in
addres­sing market-specific requirements.

What we expect from our suppliers
▪▪ Global Supplier Code of Conduct
▪▪ Country-specific risk analysis forms basis of new
supplier selection
Both new and existing suppliers are selected and evaluated
not only on the basis of economic criteria, but also on environmental, social and corporate governance standards. Our
Supplier Code of Conduct is founded on internationally recognized guidelines, such as the principles of the United Nations’
Global Compact, the International Labor Organization (ILO)
conventions and the topic areas of the Responsible Care
Initiative. Available in 26 languages, the Code of Conduct
­
covers environmental protection as well as compliance with
human rights, labor and social standards, and antidiscrimination and anticorruption policies.
A country-based risk analysis forms the basis of our selection process for new suppliers. As a result of the country-­
related risks identified in South America and Asia, we queried
around 1,500 suppliers in 2015 on their commitment to the
values of our Supplier Code of Conduct. Moreover, we pro­
vided training to a total of 525 suppliers with an elevated
sustain­ability risk, especially in Asia and South America.
In addition, we instructed 363 procurement employees on
sustainability-oriented supplier management. These are ways
in which potential supply chain risks can be identified and
minimized together with our suppliers.

Worldwide procurement
From our suppliers, we obtain raw materials, technical goods,
and services – from technical to logistics and building facility
services. BASF acquired raw materials, goods and services for
our own production totaling approximately €35 billion in value
from more than 75,000 suppliers around the world in 2015.
Around 90% of this was locally sourced. With regard to our
suppliers, there were no substantial changes in our value chain
in 2015.

1

We define relevant suppliers as those showing an elevated sustainability risk potential as identified by risk matrices and with respect to corresponding country risks. Our suppliers are
evaluated based on risk due to the size and scale of our supplier portfolio.

Evaluating our suppliers
▪▪ “Together for Sustainability” initiative aims to
harmonize and standardize supplier assessments
and audits
▪▪ 135 raw material supplier sites audited
BASF is a founding member of the Together for Sustainability
(TfS) initiative of leading chemical companies for the global
standardization of supplier evaluations and auditing. With the
help of TfS, we advance sustainability in the supply chain. The
initiative aims to develop and implement a global program for
the responsible supply of goods and services and improve
suppliers’ environmental and social standards. The evaluation
process is simpliﬁed for both suppliers and TfS member companies by a globally uniform questionnaire. The initiative’s
members conducted a total of 2,580 sustainability assessments and 179 audits in 2015. The number of members rose
from twelve to 18. Together with the TfS initiative, we con­
ducted a Supplier Day in São Paulo, Brazil, in 2015. TfS also
held a joint conference in Shanghai, China, with the China
Petroleum and Chemical Industry Federation (CPCIF) with the
goal of enhancing mutual understanding of the challenges
associated with sustain­ability.
In 2015, we held our first global Supplier Day in Ludwigs­
hafen in order to set up new modes of collaboration together
with selected suppliers.
Using TfS evaluations, we pursue a risk-oriented ­approach
with clearly defined, BASF-specific follow-up processes. We
drive these processes through a sustainability-oriented IT tool.
Suppliers with an elevated sustainability risk are identified
­using risk matrices. Furthermore, our purchasers indi­cate the
suppliers for whom they see a potentially elevated ­sustainability
risk. We additionally check various information sources to
see if any suppliers have been observed in connection with
negative sustainability incidents. Based on these analyses,
we conducted sustainability standard audits for a total of 135
raw material supplier sites and initiated 1,044 sustainability
­assessments through an external service provider in 2015.
In 2015, for example, we audited a supplier of mineral raw
materials in South Africa and identified room for improvement
primarily in the areas of environment and safety.

Management’s Report
Responsibility along the value chain — Suppliers﻿

If we identify potential for improvement, we support suppliers
in developing measures to fulfill our standards. We conduct
another review according to a defined timeframe based on the
sustainability risk measured. If the weak points discovered
were particularly severe and we are unable to confirm any
improve­ment, we reserve the right to terminate the business
relationship.
This occurred in four cases in 2015. We use this approach
to evaluate suppliers with an elevated sustainability risk at
least every five years. The approach itself is reviewed every
two years to identify possibilities for optimization.

Supplier training
In 2015, we continued the collaborations begun in China and
Brazil in 2014 to instruct suppliers on sustainability standards.
We have developed a training program together with the East
China University of Science and Technology in Shanghai, and
plan to educate around 2,000 suppliers by 2019. We are pursuing the same approach in Brazil together with the Espaço
ECO® Foundation. Through these cooperations, 485 suppliers
already received training in 2015.

Audit results
Our audits have revealed some deviations with respect to
working hours and payment of the minimum wage, especially
in China. Here, we have called for improvements on the part of
our suppliers. None of our 2015 audits identified instances of
child labor. For the suppliers we reviewed, persons under 18
were excluded from overtime, night shifts and dangerous
work. We did not find any incidences of forced labor or other
human rights violations in 2015.

BASF Report 2015

Raw materials

Suppliers

Production

Responsible resource management is an integral part of
our strategy. It is applied within the company through our
Verbund concept, our innovative products and the use of
renewable raw materials. In the search for alternative raw
materials, we employ solutions that contribute to sustainability. We as a company are dependent on ecosystem
services and also have an impact on them. Examples
include the availability of clean water and renewable
­
­resources, or even the effects of ecosystem services on
the preservation of air, water and soil quality.

Strategy
The Verbund system is an important cornerstone of our
resource efficiency strategy: The by-products of one plant
­
­often serve as feedstock elsewhere, thus helping us to use
raw ­materials more efficiently. In 2015, BASF purchased a
­total of around 30,000 different raw materials from more than
6,000 suppliers. Some of our most important raw materials
are ­naphtha, natural gas, methanol, ammonia and benzene.
We apply the “mass balance approach” in our Verbund system
for the use of renewable raw materials. Furthermore, we are
­involved in the responsible cultivation and utilization of renewa­bles in ­numerous projects along the value chain.

Renewable resources
▪▪ Bio-based PolyTHF® 1000 offered for testing
­purposes for the first time
▪▪ New voluntary commitment and goals for procuring
palm oil products
In 2015, around 5.8% of the raw materials we purchased
worldwide were from renewable resources. To make the use of
these materials more competitive, we work on product
­innovations based on renewable raw materials as well as on
enhancing production processes in reaction technology and
preparation.
We also further promoted our “mass balance” method on
the market in 2015. This approach uses renewable raw materials from certified sustainable production from the very beginning of the value chain in the existing Production Verbund in
order to save fossil resources. The proportion of renewable
raw materials is allocated to customer-selected products
accor­ding to their formulations. The quality of the final product
remains unchanged. This method is currently being applied for
numerous BASF products – for example, for superabsorbents,
­dispersions, plastics such as polyamides and polyurethanes,
and for intermediates available on the market as “drop-in
products.” These can be used in place of previously employed
products in the production process without having to change
the process itself.

Customers

Since 2013, we have provided our customers with 1,4-butane­
diol (BDO) on a commercial scale using sugars as a renewable
feedstock based on a licensing agreement with the U.S.
company Genomatica Inc. BDO and its derivatives are
used, for example, to manufacture plastics for the automotive
and textile industries. We use BDO produced with the
­Genomatica license to make bio-based polytetrahydrofuran
1000 (PolyTHF® 1000), which we offered to customers for
testing purposes for the first time in 2015. PolyTHF® 1000
primarily serves as a chemical component in thermoplastic
polyurethane (TPU), an ingredient used to manufacture skis
and roller skates, shoe soles, d
­ ashboard films in the automotive industry, and many other products.
In 2015, we completed our joint project with Cargill and
the German governmental agency for international cooperation on the sustainable production of coconut oil in the Philippines. Small farmers now produce the world’s first Rainforest
Alliance-certified dried coconut meat (copra), from which the
oil is extracted.
Palm oil, palm kernel oil, and their derivatives are some of
our most important renewable raw materials. We want to
­ensure that the raw materials we use stem from sustainable,
certified sources and actively support the Roundtable on
Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). In 2015, we revised and
­
expanded our voluntary commitment to the sustainable
­
­procurement of palm oil products. This is to contain guidelines
for procuring palm oil and palm kernel oil, as well as their
­primary derivative products. The guidelines involve requirements for protecting and preserving forests and peatland,
along with the involvement of local residents in decision-­
making processes. In order to further increase the availability
of sustainable, RSPO-certified palm oil and palm kernel oil, we
will involve more and more small farmers by supporting suitable projects. Our goal is to exclusively obtain palm oil and
palm kernel oil that has been certified by the RSPO insofar as
this is available on the market. The voluntary commitment has
been expanded to include the most important intermediate
products based on palm oil and palm kernel oil up through
2025; these include fractions and primary oleochemical derivatives as well as edible oil esters.
For more on our voluntary commitment, see basf.com/en/palm-dialog

BASF Report 2015 

Mineral raw materials
We procure a number of mineral raw materials, like precious
metals, that we use to produce process and mobile emissions
catalysts. In suspected cases, we investigate the origins of
minerals – as defined in the Dodd Frank Act – to see if they
come from conflict mines. We reserve the right to conduct an
external audit and, if necessary, terminate our business relationship. The suppliers addressed have confirmed to us that
they do not source minerals matching this definition from the
Democratic Republic of Congo or its neighboring countries.

Preserving ecosystems
▪▪ Our production sites reviewed for proximity
to internationally protected areas
▪▪ BASF partnership supports preservation
of biodiversity
Biodiversity forms the foundation of ecosystem services. Internationally protected areas play a critical role in maintaining
biodiversity around the world. This is why, in 2015, we once
again investigated our production sites to discover which are
located near internationally protected areas: 2% of production
sites (excluding Oil & Gas) are adjacent to a Ramsar Site and
2% to a Category I, II or III protected area of the International
Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). None of our production sites are adjacent to a UNESCO protected area. Our 2015
analyses revealed no impact of our activities on biodiversity in
these areas. In 2016, we will review the evaluation methods
we have used up to now in order to even better identify any
relevant impacts in the future.
Furthermore, we promote projects that contribute to the
preservation of biodiversity. These include, for example, the
“Farm Network” – a partnership brought to life by BASF in
2002 between independent farms, environmental protection
organizations, universities and agricultural technology suppliers. The partners concentrate on strengthening biodiversity as
well as responsible use of water and soil in commercial agriculture. By developing practical and locally adaptable measures for modern farms, the Farm Network has already helped
numerous farmers increase the biodiversity of birds and
insects in their fields and save water and soil resources.
­
The first Farm Network conference took place in 2015,
where BASF invited experts from six European countries to
share their experiences with new agricultural practices and
­strengthen their network.

We act responsibly as an integral part of society and have
set out the framework for our voluntary commitments in
our Responsible Care Management System. We never
compromise on the safety and security of our employees,
contractors and neighbors as well as our facilities, transportation and products.

Strategy
▪▪ Revised and updated goals for safety, security, health
and environmental protection
BASF’s Responsible Care Management System comprises the
global rules, standards and procedures for safety, security,
health and environmental protection for the various stations
along our value chain. Our regulations cover the transportation
of raw materials, activities at our sites and warehouses, and
distribution of our products as well as our customers’ application of the products. At our sites, we address energy and
­climate protection as one of the topics covered by our energy
management. Specifications for implementing these measures
are laid out in binding directives that are introduced in consultation with employee representatives. These describe the relevant responsibilities, requirements and assessment methods.
We regularly conduct audits to monitor our performance and
progress. We use the ﬁndings from these audits for continual
improvement.
We set ourselves ambitious goals for safety, security,
health and environmental protection. Our guidelines and
­requirements are constantly updated. We revised our goals in
2015. For example, we replaced our previous goals for water
with an ­expanded goal for sustainable water management. We
introduced a new, ambitious goal for process safety, which
aims to reduce the number of plant safety incidents. In addition, we set ourselves a new energy and climate protection
goal for the global implementation of our energy management
system. In this way, we can identify and launch measures to
increase ­energy efficiency in an even more flexible manner,
depending on local raw material and energy prices.
We assess potential risks and weak points in all areas
ranging from research and production to logistics, and how
these could affect the environment, the surrounding ­community
or the safety and security of our employees. In our databases,
we document accidents, near misses and safety-related incidents at our sites as well as along our transportation routes.
We foster awareness of workplace safety and safe behavior in
every individual with our worldwide safety initiatives.

Audits
▪▪ 130 environmental, safety and security audits
­conducted at 82 sites
Regular audits help ensure that standards are met for safety,
security, health and environmental protection. We carry out
audits at BASF sites and at companies in which BASF is a
majority shareholder. We have defined our regulations for
­Responsible Care audits in a global Group directive. During
our audits, we create a safety and environmental profile that
shows if our performance is sufficient to properly address
the existing hazard potential. If this is not the case, we agree
on measures and conduct follow-up audits on their implementation soon afterward. One result of the audits showed the
­necessity of swiftly implementing new guidelines and processes,
for example.
Our internal audit system complies with the standards for
external auditing procedures ISO 19011 and OHSAS 18001.
Worldwide, 180 BASF production sites are certified in accordance with ISO 14001 (2014: 191)1. We conducted short-­notice
audits on various topics worldwide in 2015, which ­included
­facility inspections and document reviews. In 2015, 130 environmental, safety and security audits were carried out at
82 sites, along with 68 short-notice ­audits on various topics at
44 sites in the BASF Group. We audited 53 sites with r­ espect to
occupational medicine and health protection.

Accident prevention and emergency response
▪▪ Revised questionnaire for assessing transportation
safety of chemicals and gases on seagoing vessels
▪▪ Risk assessment conducted for shipments involving
high hazard potential

Strategy

In 2014, we had already nearly achieved our goal of reducing
the number of worldwide transportation accidents per 10,000
shipments by 70% from 2003 to 2020. That is why we redesigned our reporting on transportation accidents in 2015.
From now on, we are focusing on transportation incidents with
dangerous goods spillages that significantly impacted the
environ­
ment. We will report on dangerous goods leaks of
BASF products in excess of 200 kilograms on public transportation routes, provided BASF arranged the transport. The
global requirement for reporting on transportation incidents
was adjusted accordingly and implemented worldwide.

We stipulate worldwide requirements for our logistics service
providers and assess them in terms of safety and quality. In
2015, we evaluated around 500 companies in all regions. Our
experts use our own evaluation and monitoring tools as well as
internationally approved schemes.
We revised our questionnaire for the transportation of
chemicals and gases on seagoing vessels to align with that of
the Chemical Distribution Institute in 2015. Particular emphasis is placed on crew training and experience, especially in the
selection of service providers.
We regularly evaluate the risks in transporting raw materials with high hazard potential using our global guideline. This
is based on the guidelines of the European Chemical Industry
Council, CEFIC.

Transportation incidents

Activities in external networks

In 2015, there were two incidents resulting in product spillage
of more than 200 kilograms of dangerous goods (2014: 5).
None of these transportation incidents had a significant impact
on the environment (2014: 1).

We are actively involved in external networks, which quickly
provide information and assistance in emergencies. These
­include the International Chemical Environmental (ICE) initiative
and the German Transport Accident Information and
­Emergency Response System (TUIS), in which BASF plays a
coordinating role. In 2015, we provided assistance to other
companies in around 200 cases worldwide. We apply the
­experience we have gathered to set up similar systems in
other countries: For example, in 2015 we were able to connect
our site in India to just such a system.

our health protection goal. We have furthermore defined a new
goal for process safety.
In our guidelines and requirements, we stipulate globally
mandatory standards for safety, security and health protection. A global network of experts supports us in their implementation through standardized processes. We regularly
conduct audits on safety, security, health and environmental
protection in order to monitor our performance. We especially
promote safe conduct at work through systematic risk assessments and specific qualification measures.
Based on our corporate values, leaders serve as safety
role models for our employees. Together, they contribute to
the constant development of our safety culture.

Occupational safety

We revised our global directive for contract manufacturing in
2015, including the new definition of audit processes on compliance with stipulated standards on safety, security, health
and environmental protection.
We bolstered our safety culture in 2015 through intensive
exchange and a worldwide safety initiative – the Global Safety
Days – involving over 700 activities that focused on key topics
like risk assessment and business travel safety. Around
75,000 employees and contractors actively participated at
over 400 sites.
Going beyond legally prescribed safety instructions, we
provided more than 77,000 participants around the world with
training on occupational safety in 2015. For example, we
trained more than 13,000 participants at our “Safety
­Champions Training Center” at the Ludwigshafen site in order
to promote safety-conscious behavior and prevent work-­
related accidents.

▪▪ 2015 focuses on nutrition
▪▪ Regular health promotion programs

▪▪ New process safety goal
▪▪ Initiative begun to reduce process safety incidents
▪▪ Special training methods introduced

Our global health management serves to promote and maintain the health and productivity of our employees. This was
supported by numerous emergency drills and health promotion measures in 2015.
We measure our performance in health protection using
the Health Performance Index (HPI). The HPI comprises ﬁve
components: conﬁrmed occupational diseases, medical
emergency drills, ﬁrst aid training, preventive medicine and
health promotion. Each component contributes a maximum of
0.2 to the total score. The highest possible score is 1.0. Our
goal is to reach a value of more than 0.9 every year.

We have implemented a worldwide guideline for the safe construction and operation of our plants as well as the protection
of our employees and the environment. Our safety strategy is
based on prevention. That is why, when designing a new
­facility, we apply a five-step review system from conception to
startup. It involves early consideration of the most important
aspects of safety and protection of health and the environment, and monitors these in every stage of planning. We use a
risk matrix to assess potential incident probability and impact,
and determine the appropriate protective measures.
In order to constantly improve the safety of our production
facilities worldwide, we regularly update the safety concepts in
all of our plants. We review their implementation in ten-year
­intervals in plants with a medium to high hazard potential. The
documentation of these safety reviews was standardized
through software in 2014, and introduced all over the world in
2015. Moreover, we further continued to supervise the process safety management system in all regions. We completed
the worldwide implementation of our requirements for explosion protection in 2015.
The number of Process Safety Incidents has served as an
important key performance indicator since 2008, and is ­largely
based on the definition set by the European Chemical Industry
Council (CEFIC). This KPI mainly tracks the release of
­substances, in addition to fire and explosions. In 2015, we
­recorded 2.1 process safety incidents per one million working
hours (2014: 2.21). In order to constantly improve, we set
ourselves the goal in 2015 of achieving a rate of 0.5 or below
by 2025. To this end, we began a worldwide initiative focusing
on plant maintenance, repair and operation. We perform a
­detailed investigation into every incident, analyzing root ­causes
and using the findings to derive suitable measures to take.

Numerous offers and initiatives promoting good nutrition support our employees’ health and performance, while making a
contribution to BASF’s voluntary commitment to the United
Nations’ Global Nutrition Compact. In 2016, the global health
campaign will focus on heart attack and stroke prevention. We
raise employee awareness of these topics through offers
­tailored toward specific target groups.

▪▪ SPIDER Emergency Response and Information
Center Verbund enhanced in Europe
▪▪ Online training introduced for information protection
In order to ensure uniformly high standards around the world
for safety, security, health and environmental protection, we
implemented our requirements for emergency response planning and fire prevention in the BASF Group in 2015. To be
prepared for a potential incident in our production plants, we
work with specific emergency response plans that involve –
depending on the situation – partners and suppliers as well as
cities, communities and neighboring companies.
We regularly check our emergency systems and drill procedures with employees, contractors and local authorities.
Through 224 drills and simulations in 2015, we trained the
participants in our emergency response measures, such as
preventive fire protection.
In 2015, we enhanced our SPIDER Emergency Response
and Information Center Verbund in Europe by improving expert
involvement. This enables our specialists from the site fire
­department, emergency medical team, site security and environmental protection around Europe to work together even
more quickly and reliably across different sites. Our central
emergency response supports local emergency response
units around the world and around the clock. We also have
been using the KATWARN system at the Ludwigshafen site
since 2015, an app-based warning system that serves as an
additional communication channel to inform site employees of
dangerous situations.

BASF Report 2015

Through audits and reviews, we monitor the implementation of
measures for the comprehensive protection of our employees
and the company – for example, from loss of knowledge – as
well as for the worldwide protection of our sites against
third-party interference. All of our security personnel have
been instructed on aspects of human rights related to site
security, such as the right to liberty and security of person.
We also require all contractors involved in this area to comply
with human rights and we conduct regular inspections. As part
of investment projects, we are performing comprehensive
analyses of potential risks. In 2015, we standardized the use
of security services even more across our European sites in
order to increase ­effectiveness and efficiency. Business travelers, transferees, and local employees in countries with elevated security risks are informed about appropriate protection
measures and individually counseled where necessary.
Due to the increasing risks associated with the use of
information technology, we started a global campaign for
­
employees to even better protect our company knowledge.
This i­ncludes a new online platform that educates employees
as to how they can use available information and communications technology in a secure manner. Our worldwide network
of information protection officers comprises more than 600
employees. They support the implementation of our globally
mandatory requirements and conduct seminars on secure
behaviors. We provided information protection instruction to
more than 3,000 participants in 2015. At the end of 2015, we
began the introduction of an online training module for information and knowledge protection that is mandatory for all
employees.

production, all the way to our customers’ use of the products. We work continually to ensure that our products
pose no risk to people or the environment when they are
used responsibly and in the manner intended.

Strategy

Customers

In addition, we are also involved in workshops and training
seminars in developing countries and emerging markets.
In 2015, for example, we conducted training sessions for
chemical industry representatives on GPS in China and Thailand. In order to facilitate public access to information, we are
participating in the setup of an ICCA online portal that provides
more than 4,600 GPS safety summaries.			
For more on GPS, see basf.com/en/gps

▪▪ Global directives with uniformly high standards for
product stewardship
We ensure uniformly high standards for product stewardship
worldwide and our voluntary initiatives go beyond legal
­requirements. We monitor the compliance of our guidelines
with regular audits.
We provide extensive information on our chemical sales
products to our customers with safety data sheets in more
than 30 languages. This is achieved with the help of a global
database in which we maintain and evaluate continuously
­updated environmental, health and safety data for our substances and products. Our global emergency hotline network
provides information around the clock.
We offer our customers training in the safe use of our
products and keep them informed early on of any changes in
regulations. For example, we were one of the first companies
to offer product-specific information and solutions to pharmaceutical manufacturers on the topic of metallic contaminants,
as well as web-based consultation to customers in the pharmaceutical industry and authorities. In the Crop Protection
division, we provide special safety training to farmers. We
­
­expanded our stewardship program for banana farmers to
Latin America, China and the Philippines, where on-site BASF
experts show how crop protection products can be used and
stored in an effective and safe manner for people and the
­environment.
With an eye on consumer protection criteria, we also work
continuously with our customers on the optimization of our
products. Furthermore, we use our Eco-Efficiency Analysis
to advise our customers on the evaluation of product risks
and support them in improving the carbon footprint of their
products.
With our global risk assessment goal, we are supporting
the implementation of initiatives such as the Global Product
Strategy (GPS) of the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA). GPS is establishing worldwide standards and
best practices to improve the safe management of chemical
substances.

Global goal
By 2020, we will conduct risk assessments for all substances
and mixtures BASF sells worldwide in quantities of more than
one metric ton per year. We already reached 67.8% of this
goal in 2015 (2014: 61.4%). The risk associated with using
a substance is determined by the combination of its
hazardous properties and its potential exposure to people
and the ­environment.

2020 Goal
Risk assessment of products
that we sell in quantities of more
than one metric ton per year

>99%

REACH and other legal requirements
▪▪ Third registration phase of REACH in progress
We are working continuously on registering substances produced in annual volumes between one and one hundred
metric tons for the third phase of the E.U. chemicals regulation,
REACH. We have already registered over 200 substances to
this end. The registration phase should be completed by May
of 2018. At the same time, we also constantly update the
­existing registration dossiers and support the relevant E.U.
member state authorities in evaluating an increasing number
of substances. When it comes to REACH, we maintain close
contact with our customers and suppliers.
Another contribution BASF makes to international c
­ hemical
safety is through our support of the United Nations’ initiative to
implement a Globally Harmonized System of Classification
and Labeling of Chemicals. This has already been i­mplemented
in nearly every country in the world. It was also made mandatory in the United States in the middle of 2015, which was the
reason we reclassified 36,000 products there.

Environmental and toxicological testing

Management of new technologies

▪▪ Use of alternative and complementary methods
for animal studies

▪▪ Continual safety research on
nano- and biotechnology

Before launching products on the market, we subject them to
a variety of environmental and toxicological testing. We apply
state-of-the-art knowledge in the research and development
of our products. We only conduct animal studies when they
are required by law. In some cases, animal studies are
­stipulated by REACH and other national legislation outside the
European Union in order to obtain more information on the
properties and effects of chemical products.
We adhere to the specifications laid down by the German
Animal Welfare Act as well as the requirements of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care – the highest standard for laboratory animals in the world.
We are continually developing and optimizing alternative and
complementary methods, and we put these into practice
wherever it is possible and approved by the authorities. BASF
spent €2.7 million for this purpose in 2015. We use alternative
and complementary methods in more than a third of our tests.
Currently, 30 alternative methods are being used in our labs
and another 12 are in the development stage. One focus area
of our research in 2015 and subsequent years is the development of alternative methods for testing the potential of
substances that negatively affect organisms’ growth and
­
­development.
In 2015, our Experimental Toxicology and Ecotoxicology
department received, together with partners, a grant to conduct one of the largest European collaborative projects for
alter­native methods. The project aims to develop alternative
methods to the point that chemical risk assessments can be
efficiently conducted with the least amount of animal testing
possible.

Technologies such as nanotechnology or biotechnology offer
solutions for key societal challenges – for example, in the areas
of climate protection or health and nutrition.
We developed a “Nanotechnology Code of Conduct” that
stipulates the safe handling of nanomaterials. We are constantly expanding our knowledge of nanomaterial safety. Over
the past years, we have conducted more than 230 toxico­
logical and ecotoxicological studies and participated in over
30 different projects related to the safety of nanomaterials. We
published the results in 71 scientific articles. One important
finding is that toxicity is determined not by the size of the
­particles but by the intrinsic properties of the substance.
In 2015, we published a framework for the specific testing
of nanomaterials together with the European Centre for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals (ECETOC). We are
working with the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), the
OECD and national authorities on its further development. In
an E.U. project, we are collaborating with partners from
­science, industry and the authorities to develop an approach
for the analytical identification of nanomaterials.
In the use of biotechnology, we follow the code of conduct
of EuropaBio, the European association for biotechnology
­industries. We constantly improve our product safety activities
in the field of biotechnology in order to effectively minimize
potential risks and ensure that all standards and national laws
are met. Our internal risk management is based on the protection of people, animals and the environment. To monitor the
risks of working with ­biotechnology, we implemented a system
that ensures compliance with standards and transparent
­processes at BASF.

Energy and climate protection
Suppliers

Production

As an energy-intensive company, we are committed to
energy efficiency and global climate protection. We want
to reduce emissions along the value chain and utilize, for
­example, efﬁcient technologies for generating steam and
electricity, energy-efficient production processes, and
comprehensive energy management. Our climate protection products make an important contribution toward
helping our customers avoid emissions.

Strategy
▪▪ We are committed to energy efﬁciency and global
climate protection along the value chain
We want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our production and along the entire value chain. To this end, we have
thoroughly analyzed the greenhouse gas emissions from our
production in the past few years and implemented comprehensive reduction measures. This is how, for example, we
have been able to significantly reduce nitrous oxide emissions
since 1997.
Comparisons with European emissions trading benchmarks show that our greenhouse gas-intensive chemical
plants operate at above-average efficiency. To supply our
production sites with energy, we rely on highly efficient com+0.1
bined heat and power plants with gas and steam turbines, and
on the use of heat released by production processes. Around
50% of BASF Group emissions in 2015 resulted from steam
and electricity generation in our power plants as well as in our
energy suppliers’ power plants.
Our success also depends on the long-term security and
competitiveness of our energy supplies. Furthermore, we are
committed to energy management that helps us analyze and
continue to improve the energy efficiency of our plants.
We offer our customers solutions that help prevent greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy and resource efficiency. About half of our total annual research spending goes
toward the development of these products and the optimization of our processes.

Customers

Our climate protection activities are based on comprehensive
emissions controlling. We report on greenhouse gas emissions
in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Standard,
as well as the sector-specific standard for the chemical industry. We applied the new Scope 2 standard for the first time in
2015. According to CDP, an international organization that
analyzes companies’ climate protection data, BASF is among
the top companies in the world in terms of transparency and
completeness in climate protection reporting. In reporting to
CDP, our experts perform an annual analysis of the opportunities and risks that climate change poses for BASF.
We also advocate economically efficient and environ­
mentally effective climate protection by supporting endeavors
to this effect. For example, we joined the U.N.’s C
­ aring for
Climate initiative in 2015 – with over 400 companies from 60
countries, this is the largest global business movement in the
search for climate change solutions. BASF also advocates the
Paris Agreement on climate protection and a global carbon
price.

BASF reports separately on direct and indirect emissions from the purchase of energy. Scope 1 emissions encompass both direct emissions from production and generation
of steam and electricity, as well as direct emissions from the generation of steam and electricity for sale. Scope 2 emissions comprise indirect emissions from the purchase of
energy for BASF‘s use.

Emissions of N2O, CH4, HFC and SF6 have been translated into CO2 emissions using the Global Warming Potential, or GWP, factor. GWP factors are based on the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 1995 (2002 emissions) and IPCC 2007, errata table 2012 (2014 and 2015 emissions). HFC (hydroﬂuorocarbons) are
calculated using the GWP factors of the individual components.

Global goals
▪▪ Specific greenhouse gas emissions reduced
▪▪ New goal for energy management system
We aim to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions per metric
ton of sales product by 40% by 2020, compared with baseline
2002. In 2015, we achieved a reduction of 34.6% (2014:
­reduction of 33.9%). Since 1990, we have been able to lower
our overall greenhouse gas emissions from BASF operations
(excluding Oil & Gas) by 49.8% and even reduce s­pecific
emissions by 74.4%.
We set ourselves a new energy efficiency goal in 2015
covering both the chemicals and the oil and gas businesses.
By 2020, we want to have introduced certified energy
management systems (DIN EN ISO 50001) at all relevant
­
­production sites1. Taken together, this represents 90% of
BASF’s primary energy demand. This is one of the ways in
which we ­intend to identify and carry out improvements in
energy efficiency, reducing not only greenhouse gas emissions
and saving valuable energy resources, but also increasing the
BASF Group’s competitive ability. In 2015, we were able to
complete the ISO 50001 energy management system certification of two additional sites in Germany. This brings the
current total to 27 certified sites worldwide, representing
­
39.5% of our primary energy demand.

Energy supply and efficiency
▪▪ Verbund system as important component of our
energy efficiency strategy
Gas and steam turbines in our combined heat and power
plants enable us to fulfill around 70% of the electricity demand
of the BASF Group. Compared with separate methods of
generating steam and electricity, we saved 13.5 million MWh
of fossil fuels and prevented 2.7 million metric tons of carbon
emissions in 2015. The Verbund system is an important component of our energy efficiency strategy: Waste heat from one
plant’s production process is used as energy in other plants. In
this way, we saved around 17.6 million MWh in 2015, which
corresponds to a savings of 3.5 million metric tons’ worth of
carbon emissions. With combined power and steam generation as well as our continuously enhanced Energy Verbund, we
were thus able to prevent a total of 6.2 million metric tons of
carbon emissions in 2015.
We were able to further optimize the resource and energy
consumption of our production in numerous projects around
the world in 2015. Various process improvements led to steam
and electricity savings. At the Ludwigshafen site, for example,
we implemented an integrated steam network between the
ethanolamine facility and the Ultrason® plant, making use of
significant amounts of heat. The startup of the new, gas-based
combined heat and power plant at the Münster site of BASF
Coatings additionally supported our endeavors toward efficient
and environmentally friendly energy sourcing practices.

We also rely on locally available energy sources for energy
supply at our sites. Especially in the growing Asian market, we
and our energy suppliers also utilize coal as an energy source
since the more climate-friendly natural gas is not available in
sufficient quantities at competitive prices.
We are exploring the use of renewable energies. These
can only become a permanent part of our energy mix if they
are competitive in terms of supply security and cost. Our
­research also contributes to increasing the efficiency of technologies for the use of renewable energy sources. For example, Deutsche Nanoschicht GmbH – a 100% subsidiary of
BASF – has developed an innovative method for producing
high-temperature superconductors in a more efficient and
environmentally friendly manner. Deutsche Nano­
­
schicht will
start operations at a further pilot plant at its Rheinbach, Germany, site in 2016. In cooperation with the Karlsruhe Institute
of Technology, high-temperature superconductors are to be
optimized for various applications in energy technology.

Corporate carbon footprint and climate
protection products
▪▪ Reporting on greenhouse gas emissions along
the entire value chain
▪▪ Customers’ use of climate protection products
sold in 2015 avoids 530 million metric tons of
CO2 equivalents
BASF has been publishing a comprehensive corporate carbon
footprint since as early as 2008. This reports on all emissions
along the value chain and shows the volume of emissions
prevented through the use of our climate protection products.
We plan our climate protection activities along the value chain
based on our corporate carbon footprint.
Through various measures to reduce our raw material and
energy requirements, the emission of greenhouse gases
­associated with producing the raw materials was decreased
by a total of around 160,000 metric tons in 2015.
We completed the systematic evaluation of our product
portfolio in terms of sustainability considerations in 2015. This
included identifying solutions whose application makes a
­positive contribution in terms of climate protection and energy.
Dubbed “Accelerator” products, these are what we focus on
when refer­ring to climate protection products. They help us
offer solutions to our customers to avoid greenhouse gas
emissions over their entire lifecycle as compared with r­ eference
products. One example is our Keropur® line of fuel addi­tives,
which reduces fuel consumption by optimizing combustion in
comparison with conventional fuels.

Water is of fundamental importance in chemical production. It is used as a coolant, solvent and cleaning agent, as
well as to make our products. We are committed to its
responsible use in our production sites’ water catchment
areas, and along the entire value chain. We have set ourselves a global goal for sustainable water management.

Customers

In order to ensure transparency in our reporting on water, we
once again took part in CDP reporting in 2015 and received a
very good score. According to CDP, this was particularly

Strategy
Global goal
▪▪ BASF products contribute to sustainable water
management
We aim to use water as sparingly as possible and further
­reduce emissions to water. To do so, we have set out a Group
directive with globally applicable standards. We are exploring
measures for implementing sustainable water management,
especially at production sites in water stress areas. One of our
aims here is to identify savings potential in order to use as little
water as possible, particularly in water stress areas. We consider this topic from all aspects, including societal implications.
We offer our customers solutions that help purify water,
use it more efficiently and reduce pollution. Seawater desalination plants make an important contribution to supplying the
world’s population with water. The Middle East’s dry climate,
for example, makes the region particularly dependent on this
technology. The largest desalination plant in the United Arab
Emirates is located in Jebel Ali. BASF supplies it with more
than 3,000 metric tons of Sokalan® PM 15l per year; this product prevents the buildup of deposits, enabling the plant to
generate up to 2 million cubic meters of desalinated water
each day.

Water stress areas around the world

Source: Pfister et. al., 2009

▪▪ Goals achieved for reducing emissions
▪▪ Goal expanded for sustainable water management
We have already achieved our 2020 goal of decreasing emissions to water of organic substances and nitrogen by 80% and
of heavy metals by 60% compared with baseline 2002. In
2015, we reached 28.2% (2014: 26.3%) of our goal to halve
the withdrawal of drinking water for production purposes from
2010 to 2020. We integrated this target into our goal for sustainable water management in 2015. We are a
­ nalyzing water
management practices at relevant production sites with
­respect to sustainability criteria. Our aim to establish sustainable water management at all sites in water stress a
­ reas was
expanded in 2015: We now also want to introduce sustainable
water management at all Verbund sites by 2025. This will
cover 92% of BASF’s entire water abstraction. We achieved
36.2% of this goal in 2015, and are pursuing it through the
application of the European Water Stewardship (EWS) standard. After introducing the standard at our ­European sites in
2013, we furthered its implementation in China and North and
South America in 2015. This once again earned gold-level
certification in 2015 for our production site in Tarragona, Spain,
after an external audit.

Our wastewater is treated through different methods ­depending
on the type and degree of contamination – including biological
processes, oxidation, membrane technologies, precipitation or
adsorption.
In order to prevent unanticipated emissions and the pollution of surface or groundwater, we create water protection
strategies for our production sites. This is mandatory for all
production plants as part of the Responsible Care initiative. The
wastewater protection plans involve evaluating wastewater in
terms of risk and drawing up suitable monitoring approaches.
We use audits to check that these measures are being implemented and complied with.

Further reduction of emissions
Water use
▪▪ Reduction of emissions to water achieved
▪▪ Using water responsibly
A total of around 207 million cubic meters of wastewater were
discharged from BASF production sites in 2015 (2014: 194 million cubic meters). Emissions of nitrogen to water amounted
to 3,000 metric tons (2014: 3,200 metric tons). We were able
to make this improvement by optimizing processes and
­e­xchanging products, for example. Around 17,300 metric tons
of organic substances were emitted in wastewater (2014:
18,700 metric tons). Our wastewater contained 25 metric tons
of heavy metals (2014: 21.5 metric tons). Phosphorus emissions amounted to 460 metric tons (2014: 341 metric tons).

We recirculate water as much as is feasible in order to withdraw less from supply sources. Our larger sites have recooling
plants that allow water to be reused several times and that
reduce the temperature of used cooling water before it is discharged back into a body of water.
The supply, treatment, transportation and recooling of
water is associated with a high energy demand. We employ
various means in our efforts to keep this as low as possible.
We are constantly working to optimize our energy consumption and the amount of water we use, and to adapt to the
needs of our business and the environment.

Regular monitoring of our emissions to air is a part of environmental management at BASF. Aside from greenhouse gases,
we also measure emissions of other pollutants into the atmosphere. Our reporting does not take into account air pollutant
emissions from oil and gas operations due to their substantial
ﬂuctuation during exploration phases.
Our Raw Material Verbund helps us prevent and reduce
waste. We regularly carry out audits to inspect external waste
management companies, ensuring that our hazardous waste
in particular is properly disposed of. In this way, we are also
contributing to preventive soil protection and keeping today’s
waste from becom­ing tomorrow’s contamination.

Emissions to air
▪▪ Further reduction of emissions
We were able to reduce absolute emissions of air pollutants
from our chemical plants to 28,585 metric tons in 2015. This
is a decrease of 66.6%, which means that our goal of a 70%
reduction worldwide from 2002 to 2020 has almost been
achieved. Emissions of ozone-depleting substances as
deﬁned by the Montreal Protocol totaled 23 metric tons in
2015 (2014: 36 metric tons). Emissions of heavy metals
amounted to 4 metric tons (2014: 4 metric tons).
We were able to reduce emissions of sulfur oxides in
2015, particularly at our site in Hannibal, Missouri: There, we
­exchanged coal-fired boilers for gas-powered burners, saving
around 1,000 metric tons of sulfur oxide.
Our product portfolio contains a variety of catalysts used in
the automotive sector and in industry to reduce the emission
of air pollutants. BASF’s Camet® series of CO catalysts, for
example, decreases the amount of carbon monoxide released
by gas turbine plants in partial-load mode. As a complement
to the use of renewable energies, this now environmentally
friendly partial-load mode will become increasingly necessary
in the future.

Management of waste and contaminated sites
▪▪ Reduction of total waste volume
▪▪ Systematic processing of contaminated sites ensured
We regularly explore possibilities for preventing waste. If waste
is unavoidable, we perform an analysis for recycling or energy
recovery. Total waste volume declined slightly in 2015 (–2.4%).
We develop remediation solutions in order to combine
nature conservation, climate protection concerns, costs, and
social responsibility. This means making decisions on a caseby-case basis, founded on the legal framework and current
technological possibilities. We set out global standards for our
approach to contaminated site management. A worldwide
network of experts ensures their proper implementation.
We have been documenting relevant sites in a contamin­
ated site database since 2013. Ongoing remediation work
around the world continued on schedule and planning was
concluded on future landfill remediation projects.

Identifying opportunities
and risks as early as possible
and planning effective
courses of action

The goal of BASF’s risk management is to identify and
evaluate opportunities and risks as early as possible and
to take appropriate measures in order to seize opportunities and limit business losses. The aim here is to avoid
risks that pose a threat to BASF’s continued existence
and to make improved managerial decisions to create
lasting value. We understand risk to be any event that can
negatively impact the achievement of our short-term
operational or long-term strategic goals. We define
­
opportunities as possible successes that exceed our
­
­defined goals.

Potential short-term effects on EBIT of key opportunity
and risk factors subsequent to measures taken1

In order to effectively measure and manage identiﬁed opportunities and risks, we quantify these in terms of probability and
economic impact in the event they occur. We use statistical
methods to aggregate opportunities and risks into risk factors.
This way, we achieve an overall view of opportunities and risks
at a portfolio level, allowing us to take effective measures for
risk management.

Company-specific opportunities and risks

Overall assessment

Finance

▪▪ Significant risks and opportunities arise from
overall economic developments and volatility
in exchange rates and margins
▪▪ No threat to continued existence of BASF

Other financial opportunities and risks

We expect the global economy to continue to grow in the next
two years. We continue to see significant risks in a considerable slowdown of the Chinese economy. Such a development
would negatively impact demand for intermediate goods and
investment goods, and affect emerging markets that export
raw materials as well as the advanced economies. Any escalation of geopolitical conflicts also poses risks to the global
economy. Important opportunities and risks for our earnings
are also associated with uncertainty regarding growth in
Europe, the development of key customer industries, and
­
volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and margins.

According to our assessment, there continue to be no signiﬁcant individual risks that pose a threat to the continued

individual risks, even in the case of another global economic
crisis.
Ultimately, however, residual risks remain in all entrepreneurial activities which even comprehensive risk management

Risk management process
▪▪ Integrated process for identification, assessment
and reporting
▪▪ Decentralized management of specific opportunities
and risks
▪▪ Aggregation at a Group level
The BASF Group’s risk management process is based on the
international risk management standard COSO II Enterprise
Risk Management – Integrated Framework (2004), and has
the following key features:
Organization and responsibilities
––Risk management is the responsibility of the Board of
­Executive Directors, which also determines the processes
for approving investments, acquisitions and divestitures.
––The Board of Executive Directors is supported by the corporate units Finance; Corporate Controlling; Strategic Planning
& Controlling; Legal, Taxes, Insurance & Intellectual Property;
and the Chief Compliance Ofﬁcer. They coordinate the risk
management process at a Group level and provide the
structure and appropriate methodology. Opportunity and
risk management is thus integrated into the strategy, planning and budgeting processes.
––A network of risk managers in the business and corporate
units advances the implementation of appropriate risk
­management practices in daily operations.
––The management of speciﬁc opportunities and risks is ­largely
delegated to the business units and is steered at a local
level. Risks relating to exchange rates and raw material
prices are an exception. In this case, there is an initial consolidation at a Group-wide level before derivative hedging
instruments, for example, are used.
––BASF’s Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) manages the implementation of our Compliance Management System, suppor­
ted by additional compliance officers worldwide. The CCO
regularly reports to the Board of Executive Directors on

Legal, Taxes, Insurance
& Intellectual Property

Verbund Sites

Competence Centers

progress in the program’s implementation as well as on any
signiﬁcant results. Furthermore, the CCO provides a status
report to the Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee in at least
one of its meetings each year, including any major developments. In the event of signiﬁcant incidents, the Audit Committee is immediately informed by the Board of Executive
Directors.
––The internal auditing unit (Corporate Audit) is responsible for
regularly auditing the risk management system established
by the Board of Executive Directors in accordance with
Section 91(2) of the German Stock Corporation Act. Furthermore, as part of its monitoring of the Board of Executive Directors, the Supervisory Board considers the effectiveness
of the risk management system. The suitability of the early
detection system we set up for risks is evaluated by our
­external auditor.
Instruments
––The Risk Management Process Manual, applicable throughout the Group, forms the framework for risk management
and is implemented by the business units according to their
particular business conditions.
––A catalog of opportunity and risk categories helps to identify
all relevant opportunities and risks as comprehensively as
possible.
––We use standardized evaluation and reporting tools for the
identiﬁcation and assessment of risks. The aggregation of
opportunities, risks and sensitivities at the business and
Group level using a Monte Carlo simulation helps us to identify effects and trends across the company.
––Company management is informed about operational
opportunities and risks (observation period of up to one
­
year) in the monthly management report produced by the
Corporate Controlling unit. In addition, the corporate units
Corporate Controlling and Finance provide information twice
a year about the aggregated opportunity/risk exposure of
the BASF Group. Furthermore, if a new individual risk is
identiﬁed which bears reputational risks or has a more than

BASF Report 2015 

€10 million impact on earnings, it must be immediately
­reported.
––As part of our strategy development, the Strategic Planning
& Controlling unit conducts strategic opportunity/risk analyses with a ten-year assessment period. These analyses are
annually reviewed as part of strategic controlling and are
adapted if necessary.
––Our Group-wide Compliance Program serves to ensure
­adherence to legal regulations and the company’s internal
guidelines. Our global employee Code of Conduct firmly
embeds these mandatory standards into everyday business.
Members of the Board of Executive Directors are also
­expressly obligated to follow these principles.

Signiﬁcant features of the internal control and
risk management system with regard to the
Group ﬁnancial reporting processs
▪▪ Conducted in accordance with standardized Group
guidelines
▪▪ Segregation of duties, four-eyes principle, and clearly
regulated access rights
▪▪ Annual evaluation of control environment and relevant
processes at significant companies
The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared by a unit
in the corporate division Finance. BASF Group’s accounting
process is based on a standardized accounting guideline that
sets out accounting policies and the signiﬁcant processes and
deadlines on a Group-wide basis. There are binding directives
for the internal reconciliations and other accounting operations. Standard software is used to carry out the accounting
processes for the preparation of the individual financial statements as well as for the Consolidated Financial Statements.
There are clear rules for the access rights of each participant
in these processes.
Employees involved in the accounting and reporting process meet the qualitative requirements and participate in
training on a regular basis. There is a clear assignment of
­responsibilities between the specialist units, companies and
regional service units involved. We strictly adhere to the principles of segregation of duties and dual control, or the “four-eyes
principle.” Complex actuarial reports and evaluations are produced by specialized service providers or specially qualiﬁed
employees.
An internal control system for ﬁnancial reporting continuously monitors these principles. To this end, methods are
provided for the structured and Group-wide uniform evaluation
of the internal control system in ﬁnancial reporting.

Management’s Report
Forecast — Opportunities and risks report﻿

The signiﬁcant risks for the BASF Group regarding a reliable
control environment for proper ﬁnancial reporting are reviewed
and updated on an annual basis. Risks are compiled into a
standardized questionnaire and presented in a central risk
catalog.
Moreover, a centralized selection process identifies companies that are exposed to particular risks, that have a ­material
impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the BASF
Group, or that provide service processes. The selection process is conducted annually. In the relevant companies, one
person is given the responsibility of monitoring the execution
of the annual evaluation process.
In these companies, the process comprises the following
steps:
––Evaluation of the control environment
Adherence to internal and external guidelines that are
­relevant for the maintenance of a reliable control environment
is checked by means of a standardized questionnaire and
evidenced by sample taking.
––Identiﬁcation and documentation of control activities
In order to mitigate the risks to the ﬁnancial reporting processes listed in our central risk catalog, critical processes
and control activities are documented.
––Assessment of the control activities
After documentation, a test is performed to verify whether
the described controls are capable of adequately mitigating
the risks. In the subsequent test phase, samples are taken
to test whether, in practice, the controls were executed as
described and effective.
––Monitoring of control weaknesses
The managers responsible receive reports on any control
weaknesses identiﬁed and their resolution, and an interdisciplinary committee investigates their relevance for the BASF
Group. The Board of Executive Directors and the Audit
Committee are informed once control weaknesses have
been identiﬁed that have a considerable impact on ﬁnancial
reporting. Only after material control weaknesses have been
resolved does the company’s managing director confirm the
effective internal control system.
––Internal conﬁrmation of the internal control system
All managing directors and chief ﬁnancial ofﬁcers of each
consolidated Group company must confirm to the Board of
Executive Directors of BASF SE every half-year and at the
end of the annual cycle, in writing, that the internal control
system is effective with regard to accounting and reporting.

Short-term opportunities and risks
Development of demand
▪▪ Development of our sales markets among greatest
opportunities and risks
▪▪ Negative impact from economic slowdown in China
and escalation of geopolitical conflicts possible
The development of our sales markets is one of the strongest
drivers of opportunities and risks. More details on our assumptions regarding short-term growth rates for the global
­economy, regions and key customer industries, such as the
chemicals, automotive and construction sectors, can be found
from pages 121 to 123. In accordance with this scenario, we
are planning to achieve volumes growth in all segments exclu­
ding the effects of acquisitions and divestitures.
In addition to this scenario, we also consider risks from
deviations in assumptions. We continue to see a significant
macroeconomic risk in an increased slowdown of the Chinese
economy, which would have considerable impact on demand
for intermediate goods for industrial production as well as
­investment goods. This would have an effect on emerging
markets that export raw materials as well as on advanced
economies that specialize in technological goods. Risks to the
global economy would also be posed by the possible escalation of geopolitical conflicts.
Should the macroeconomic environment develop more
weakly than we predict, a further drop in the price of oil can be
expected. In this case, we would also expect the euro to
­depreciate relative to the U.S. dollar as compared with our
planning assumptions, as the eurozone’s economy shows a
high level of dependency on exports and, in times of global
economic weakness, the U.S. dollar is preferred by portfolio
investors as a safe haven.
Weather-related influences can result in positive or negative effects on our crop protection business.
Margin volatility
▪▪ Possible oversupply could lead to lower margins
in some value chains
▪▪ Opportunities and risks from decreasing raw
material costs
We generally anticipate stable margins in 2016. For some
products and value chains, it is possible that margin pressure
could be increased by new capacities, for example. This would
have a negative effect on our EBIT.
The year’s average oil price for Brent crude was around
$52 per barrel in 2015, substantially lower than in the previous
year. For 2016, we anticipate an average oil price of $40 per
barrel. We therefore expect the low price levels to continue for

BASF Report 2015

the raw materials and petrochemical basic products that are
important to our business. Yet an oil price level below the
expected average would pose risks for our oil and gas
­
­business, whose EBIT dips by approximately €20 million for
every $1 decrease in the average annual barrel price of Brent
crude.
Regulation and political risks
▪▪ Risks posed by factors such as regulation of
­chemicals use
▪▪ Energy policy gives rise to both risks and
­opportunities
Due to the European chemicals regulation REACH, which
came into force in 2007, BASF and our European customers
face the risk of being placed at a disadvantage to our nonEuropean competitors due to the cost-intensive test and
­registration procedures.
Other risks for us would arise from further regulation, for
example, of the use of chemicals; the intensification of geopolitical tensions; the destabilization of political systems; and the
imposition of trade barriers, such as sanctions in Ukraine crisis
or OPEC quotas for oil production. Furthermore, we are ­closely
observing the political situation in Argentina, where economic
policy reforms could revitalize the business environment.
The German Renewable Energy Act (EEG) is poised for
reform in 2016. This regulates the expansion of electricity
generation from renewables and passing on costs to energy
customers through the EEG surcharge. Currently, existing
power plants for self-generated energy are not subject to the
EEG surcharge. Consequently, there is currently no additional
financial burden for the electricity BASF generates in its
­existing power plants. The upcoming EEG amendment, however, means that the German federal government needs to
review, and possibly revise, this matter in accordance with the
E.U. Commission’s mandate. It is possible that these plants
would need to pay a portion of the EEG surcharge in the
­future, which would negatively affect the competitive ability of
the affected production sites. A proportional EEG surcharge of
20% would translate into additional charges of €75 million per
year (before taxes), and the complete EEG surcharge would
lead to expenses of around €400 million each year. It is
­important that negotiations between the federal government
and the E.U. Commission find a solution that avoids putting a
considerable strain on the affected companies.
We view the worldwide support for the expansion of
­renewable energy and measures to increase energy efficiency
as an opportunity for increased demand for our products. For
example, we offer diverse solutions for wind turbines in
addition to insulation foams for buildings. Our catalysts
­
­business beneﬁts from the tightening of automobile emissions
regulations.

BASF Report 2015 

Production and delivery bottlenecks
We try to prevent unscheduled plant shutdowns by adhering
to high technical standards and continuously improving our
plants. We reduce the effects of unscheduled shutdowns
through diversification within our global production Verbund.
We minimize procurement risks through our broad
­portfolio, global purchasing activities and the purchase of raw
materials on spot markets, as well. If possible, we avoid
procuring raw materials from a single supplier. When this
­
­cannot be avoided, we try to foster competition or we knowingly enter into this relationship and assess the consequences
of potential nondelivery. We continuously monitor the credit
risk of important business partners.
Information technology risks
▪▪ Global procedures and systems for IT security
▪▪ Regular training for employees
▪▪ Cyber Defense Center established
BASF relies on a number of IT systems. Their nonavailability,
violation of confidentiality or the manipulation of data in critical
IT systems and applications can all have a direct impact on
production and logistics processes. The threat environment
has changed in recent years, as attackers have become better
organized, use more sophisticated tools, and have far more
resources available. If data are lost or manipulated, this can,
for example, negatively affect process safety and the accuracy
of our ﬁnancial reporting. Unauthorized access to sensitive
data, such as personnel records, competition-related information or research results, can result in legal consequences or
jeopardize our competitive position. This would also be
­accompanied by the associated loss of reputation.
To minimize such risks, BASF has implemented globally
applicable processes and systems to ensure IT security, such
as stable and redundantly designed IT systems, backup
processes, virus and access protection and encryption
­
­systems as well as integrated, Group-wide standardized IT
infrastructure and applications. The systems used for information security are constantly tested, continuously updated, and
expanded if necessary. In addition, our employees receive
regular training on information and data protection. IT-related
risk management is conducted using Group-wide regulations
for organization and application, as well as an internal control
system based on these regulations.

Management’s Report
Forecast — Opportunities and risks report﻿

BASF also established a Cyber Defense Center in 2015; is a
member of the Cyber Security Sharing and Analytics e.V.
(CSSA); and is a founding member of the German Cyber
Security ­
­
Organization (DCSO) together with Allianz SE,
Bayer AG and Volkswagen AG.
Litigation and claims
▪▪ Regular reporting on risks from litigation
▪▪ Risk assessment based on probability of occurrence
We constantly monitor current and potential legal disputes and
proceedings, and regularly report on these to the Board of
Executive Directors and Supervisory Board. In order to assess
the risks from current legal disputes and proceedings and any
potential need to recognize provisions, we prepare our own
analysis and assessment of the circumstances and claims
considered. In addition, in individual cases, we consider the
results of comparable proceedings and, if needed, independent legal opinions. Risk assessment is particularly based on
estimates as to the probability of occurrence and the range of
possible claims. These estimates are the result of close cooperation between the affected operating and functional units
together with the Legal and Finance departments. If sufficient
probability is identified, a provision is recognized accordingly
for each dispute. Should a provision be unnecessary, general
risk management ­continues to assess whether these litigations
nevertheless present a risk for the EBIT of the BASF Group.
We use our internal control system to limit risks from
poten­tial infringements of rights or laws. For example, we try
to avoid patent and licensing disputes whenever possible
through extensive clearance research. As part of our Groupwide Compliance Program, our employees receive regular
training.

Financial opportunities and risks
The management of liquidity, currency and interest rate risks is
conducted in the Treasury unit. The management of ­commodity
price risks takes place in the Procurement competence center
or in the appropriately authorized Group companies. Detailed
guidelines and procedures exist for dealing with ﬁnancial risks.
Among other things, they provide for the segregation of ­trading
and back ofﬁce functions.

BASF Report 2015

Exchange rate volatility

Liquidity risks

▪▪ Opportunities and risks especially from U.S. dollar
exchange rate fluctuations

Risks from ﬂuctuating cash ﬂows are recognized in a timely
manner as part of our liquidity planning. We have access to
extensive liquidity at any time thanks to our good ratings, our
unrestricted access to the commercial paper market and
committed bank credit lines. In the short to medium term,
BASF is largely protected against potential refinancing risks by
a balanced maturity profile for financial indebtedness as well
as through diversification in various financial markets.

Our competitiveness on global markets is influenced by
­fluctuations in exchange rates. For BASF’s purchasing, opportunities and risks arise in particular when the U.S. dollar
­exchange rate fluctuates. A full-year rise in the value of the
U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate by $0.01 would result in an
­increase of around €40 million in BASF’s EBIT, assuming other
conditions remain the same. On the production side, we
­mitigate foreign currency risks by having production sites in
the respective currency zones.
Financial currency risks result from the translation of
­receivables, liabilities and other monetary items in accordance
with IAS 21 at the closing rate into the functional currency of
the respective Group company. In addition, we incorporate
planned purchase and sales transactions in foreign currencies
in our ﬁnancial foreign currency risk management. These risks
are hedged using derivative instruments, if necessary.
Interest rate risks
▪▪ Market interest rates and credit risk premiums to
be paid have major impact on financing costs
Interest rate risks result from potential changes in prevailing
market interest rates. These can cause a change in the p
­ resent
value of ﬁxed-rate instruments and fluctuations in the interest
payments for variable-rate instruments, which would positively
or negatively affect earnings. To hedge these risks, interest
rate swaps and combined interest rate and currency derivatives are used in individual cases.
In addition to market interest rates, BASF’s ﬁnancing costs
are determined by the credit risk premiums to be paid. These
are mainly influenced by our credit rating and the market
­conditions at the time of issue. In the short to medium term,
BASF is largely protected from the possible effects on its
­interest result thanks to the well-balanced maturity proﬁle of its
ﬁnancial indebtedness.
Risks from metal and raw material trading
In the catalysts business, BASF employs commodity derivatives for precious metals and trades precious metals on behalf
of third parties and on its own account. In addition, we use our
knowledge of the markets for crude oil and oil products to
generate earnings from the trade of raw materials. To address
specific risks associated with these trades, which are not part
of our operating business, we set and continuously monitor
limits with regard to the type and size of the deals concluded.

For more on financial risks, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements from page 210 onward
For more on the maturity profile of our financial indebtedness, see the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 206

Risk of asset losses
We limit country-speciﬁc risks with measures based on internally determined country ratings, which are continuously
updated to reﬂect changing environment conditions. We
­
­selectively use export credit insurance and investment guarantees to limit specific country-related risks. We lower credit
risks for our ﬁnancial investments by engaging in transactions
only with banks with good credit ratings and by adhering to
ﬁxed limits. The credit ratings are continuously monitored and
the limits are adjusted accordingly. We reduce the risk of
­default on receivables by continuously monitoring the creditworthiness and payment behavior of our customers and by
setting appropriate credit limits. Due to the global activities
and diversiﬁed customer structure of the BASF Group, there
are no major concentrations of credit default risk. Risks are
also limited through the use of credit insurance and bank
guarantees.
Impairment risks
The risk of an asset impairment occurs if the assumed interest
rate in an impairment test increases or the predicted cash
flows decline. In the current business environment, we
­consider the risk of impairment of individual assets such as
customer relationships, technologies and brands, as well as
goodwill, to be nonmaterial. Nevertheless, a continuing decline
in the price of oil below our assumed planning level would
­result in impairment risks for the Oil & Gas segment’s assets,
especially the recently acquired fields measured at fair value.
Long-term incentive program for senior executives
Our executives have the opportunity to participate in a shareprice-based compensation program. The need for provisions
for this program varies according to the development of the
BASF share price and the MSCI World Chemicals Index; this
leads to a corresponding increase or decrease in personnel
costs.

BASF Report 2015 

Risks from pension obligations
Most employees are granted company pension benefits from
either defined contribution or defined benefit plans. We
­predominantly ﬁnance company pension obligations externally
through separate plan assets. This particularly includes BASF
Pensionskasse VVaG and BASF Pensionstreuhand e.V. in
Germany, in addition to the large pension plans of our Group
companies in North America, the United Kingdom and
Switzerland. To address the risk of underfunding due to
­
­market-related fluctuations in plan assets, we have investment
strategies that align return and risk optimization to the structure of the pension obligations. Stress scenarios are also
­simulated regularly by means of portfolio analyses. An adjustment to the interest rates used in discounting pension obligations leads immediately to changes in equity. To limit the risks
of changing financial market conditions as well as d
­ emographic
developments, employees have been almost exclusively
­offered defined contribution plans for future years of service in
recent years.

Long-term opportunities and risks
Long-term demand development
▪▪ Annual average growth of nearly 4% expected
for global chemical production
In our “We create chemistry” strategy, we assume that
­chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) will grow by
nearly 4% each year through 2020. Chemical production
would therefore grow considerably faster than global gross
domestic product and at about the same level as the previous
five-year average. Through our market-oriented and broad
portfolio, which we will continue to strengthen in the years
ahead through investments in new production capacity,
­research and development activities and acquisitions, we aim
to achieve sales growth that slightly exceeds this market
growth.
Should global economic growth see unexpected, considerable deceleration, due for example to an ongoing weak
­period in the emerging markets or to geopolitical crises, these
goals could prove too ambitious. As a result of our high degree
of diversiﬁcation across various customer industries and
­regions, we would still expect our growth to be above the
market average, even under these conditions.
For more on the “We create chemistry” strategy, see page 24 onward

Development of the competitive and customer landscape

Management’s Report
Forecast — Opportunities and risks report﻿

We are addressing this risk through active portfolio management. We exit markets where risks outweigh opportunities,
and in which we do not see satisfactory long-term opportunities to stand out from our competitors.
In order to remain competitive, we continuously improve
our operational excellence. Our new strategic excellence program, DrivE, also contributes to this aim. Starting at the end of
2018, we expect this program to contribute around €1 billion
in earnings each year compared with baseline 2015.
In order to achieve long-term proﬁtable growth, our
­research and business focus is on highly innovative business
areas, which we sometimes enter into through strategic cooperative partnerships.
Innovation
▪▪ Chances of success in research and development
­increased by Know-How Verbund
We are observing a trend toward more sustainability in our
customer industries. We want to take advantage of the resulting opportunities with innovations. In the long term, we aim to
continue significantly increasing sales of new and improved
products.
To achieve this goal, we continue to aim to invest around
3% of our sales (excluding Oil & Gas) in research and development. At the beginning of 2015, we pooled the central research
­areas Process Research & Chemical Engineering, Advanced
Materials & Systems Research and Bioscience Research into
three global platforms headquartered in one of the regions
particularly significant for us: Europe, Asia Pacific and North
America. Stronger regional presence opens up new opportunities to participate in local innovation processes and gain
­access to local talent. We also address the risk of the technical
or economic failure of research and development projects
by maintaining a balanced and comprehensive project port­
folio, as well as through professional, milestone-based project
­management.
We optimize the efﬁciency and effectiveness of our
­research activities through our global Know-How Verbund as
well as through collaboration with partners and customers.
Furthermore, in a program and project management process,
we continuously review the chances of success and the
underlying assumptions of research projects; this review
­
­includes all phases from idea generation to product launch.
The trust of customers and consumers is essential for the
successful introduction of new technologies. That is why
we enter into dialog with stakeholders at an early stage of
­development.

▪▪ Opportunities from active portfolio management
and focus on innovative business areas
We expect competitors from emerging markets to gain considerable significance in the years ahead. Furthermore, we
predict that many raw material suppliers will expand their value
chains.

Portfolio development through investments

Recruitment and long-term retention of qualified employees

▪▪ 2016–2020: More than a quarter of our investing
­volume to go into emerging markets

▪▪ Risk of retirement-related loss of expertise

We expect the increase in chemical production in emerging
markets in the coming years to be significantly above the
global average. This will create opportunities that we want to
exploit by expanding our presence in these economies; therefore, more than a quarter of our investment volume will be
spent in emerging markets over the next five years. We also
want to intensify investment in North America in light of the
attractive growth prospects and low raw material prices: for
example, we are constructing an ammonia production plant
with Yara in Freeport, Texas. In addition, we are exploring an
investment in a world-scale methane-to-propylene complex
on the U.S. Gulf Coast.
Our decisions on the type, size and locations of our investment projects are based on assumptions related to the longterm development of markets, margins and costs, as well as
raw material availability and country, currency and technology
risks. Opportunities and risks arise when actual developments
deviate from our assumptions.
In the implementation phase, we use our experience in
project management and controlling to minimize short-term
technical risks as well as risks from cost overruns or missed
deadlines.
For more on our investment plans, see page 125 onward

Acquisitions
▪▪ Detailed assessment of opportunities and risks
as part of due diligence
In the future, we will continue to refine our portfolio through
acquisitions that promise above-average profitable growth,
are innovation-driven and offer added value for our customers
while reducing the cyclicality of our earnings.
The evaluation of opportunities and risks already plays a
signiﬁcant role during the assessment of potential acquisition
targets. A detailed analysis and quantiﬁcation are conducted
as part of due diligence. Examples of risks include increased
staff turnover, delayed realization of synergies, and the
­assumption of obligations that were not precisely quantiﬁable
in advance. If our expectations in this regard are not fulﬁlled,
risks could arise, such as the need to impair intangible assets;
however, there could also be opportunities, for example, from
additional synergies.
For more on our acquisitions, see page 39 onward

BASF, too, is adjusting to a medium to long-term shortage of
skilled employees due to demographic changes, especially in
North America and Europe. As a result, there is an increased
risk that job vacancies may not be ﬁlled with suitable applicants, or only after a delay. We address these risks through
our Best Team Strategy and the global initiatives derived
from it, covering demographic and knowledge management,
Diver­sity + Inclusion, employee and leadership develop­ment,
intensified employer branding, and supplementary regional
initiatives. With these measures, we increase BASF’s attractiveness as an employer and retain our employees in the long
term.
For more on the individual initiatives and our goals, see page 42 onward

Sustainability
▪▪ Identification of upcoming opportunities and risks
▪▪ Risk management established for material aspect
“energy and climate”
BASF uses sustainability management tools to identify
­upcoming opportunities and risks that arise in connection with
the topic areas environment, society and governance. Their
long-term effect on our business activities and their associated
relevance are assessed through such instruments as our
­materiality analysis, along with our experiences from continuous dialog with our stakeholders. We have established global
monitoring systems which also include our suppliers – these
enable us to check adherence to laws and our voluntary
­commitments in the areas of environment, safety, security,
society, and governance.
In terms of upcoming opportunities and risks, material
aspects identified included: energy and climate, water,
­
resources and ecosystems, responsible production, and
­
­employment and employability. In addition to specific requirements for these aspects, discussion is growing surrounding
the internalization of external effects.
The material aspect “energy and climate” is analyzed as
part of our risk management process in order to allow us
to identify, assess and direct climate-related risks and opportunities.
For BASF as an energy-intensive company, opportunities
and risks arise particularly from regulatory changes in carbon
prices through emissions trading systems, taxes or energy
legislation.

Forecast — Economic environment in 2016﻿

Economic environment in 2016
The global economy will presumably grow by 2.3% in
2016, about as fast as in 2015 (+2.4%). Growth in the
Euro­pean Union will remain comparable with prior-year
levels. In the United States, growth is expected to slow
down somewhat. We forecast that Chinese economic
growth will continue to decelerate slightly and that the
recession will ease up somewhat in Russia and Brazil.
Global chemical production is likely to grow by 3.4% in
2016, slower than 2015 (+3.6%). The global economy
continues to face increas­ing risks. For 2016, we assume
an average price of $40 per barrel for Brent blend crude oil
and an exchange rate of $1.10 per euro.

Trends in the global economy in 2016
▪▪ Stable growth expected for the European Union
▪▪ Economic cooldown in China with dampening effects
on Asia’s emerging markets
▪▪ Recovery of Japanese economy unlikely
▪▪ Continued, but milder, deceleration predicted for
South America
For 2016, we anticipate growth in the Euro­pean Union’s
economy on approximately the same level as the previous
year. Low oil prices, largely stable prices, reduced interest
rates and favorable euro exchange rates will support this
develop­ment, although these factors do not represent additional growth stimulus as they have already been in effect
since 2015. The economy will stabilize noticeably in southern
­Europe. In northwestern Europe and the eastern European
E.U. countries, growth will hover at prior-year levels. We
expect the recession to continue in Russia and Ukraine,
­
­although the decline is likely to ease off compared with 2015.
Growth in the United States will probably slacken somewhat in the face of slower industrial growth. Benefiting from
the positive job market situation and low inflation rates, private
consumption will provide some stability. Experience shows
that rising real estate value also has a positive effect on consumption. Increasingly better production capacity utilization
along with continuing low interest rates are likely to support
the propensity to invest.
In the emerging markets of Asia, we assume that growth
will weaken to a moderate level overall. Gross domestic product growth will continue to slow in China. The government’s

monetary and fiscal easing measures could bolster the real
estate market and automotive sector, but the growth stimulus
will remain modest. China’s economic cooldown will continue
to negatively impact trading partners in the region. Currently,
the greatest risk for the global economy would be posed
by growth in China that proves even weaker than our expectations.
Japan’s gross domestic product is expected to continue
growing only minimally in 2016. Despite the weak yen, the
current global economic environment gives no cause to ­believe
that exports will significantly increase. Domestic demand may
also grow only modestly. The sales tax increase expected for
the spring of 2017 could, however, stimulate private consumption to grow faster than usual toward the end of 2016.
For South America, we expect a continued, if somewhat
weaker, decline in gross domestic product overall. Structural
reforms in Argentina should revive the economy in the medium
term; in the short term, however, they will weaken private
­demand. We therefore anticipate a slight decrease in gross
domestic product. Leading indicators do not yet point to an
upswing in Brazil. We nevertheless do not expect the downward trend to continue unabated, especially since the sharp
depreciation of the Brazilian real will support the export business.

Management’s Report 
Forecast — Economic environment in 2016 ﻿

Outlook for key customer industries
▪▪ Same level of growth expected in global industrial
production for 2016
Global industrial production will probably grow by 2.0%, no
stronger than in 2015. Industry in the advanced economies will
keep growing modestly, by around 1%. In the emerging markets of Asia, we anticipate industrial growth at a level somewhat below that of 2015 (+4.7%). After a decline in the previous
year, we anticipate slight growth again for the remaining
emerging markets in 2016 (+0.7%).
We foresee overall recovery for the transportation sector
compared with 2015. After two years of dynamic development
in western Europe, we assume that growth will slow down in
2016. It will probably slacken in the United States, as well. By
contrast, China’s automotive industry will show moderate
recov­ery as a result of the decrease in purchase taxes for
small-motor vehicles. This should mean a slight increase in
automobile production in Asia’s other emerging markets for
this reason, as well. Slight growth in the automotive industry is
also anticipated in Japan after the previous year’s considerable
decline. In Brazil, automobile production is likely to decrease
once again and Russia’s market could grow slightly at best.
Production in the energy and raw materials sector will
see only marginal gains in 2016 in light of lower raw material
prices and moderate growth in the global economy. We antici­
pate only marginal production increases in western and eastern Europe as well as in the Middle East. In Asia, domestic
energy and raw material production is likely to see slight
growth. We expect production to decline in North and South
America.
For the construction industry, we predict stable growth
rates on a global level, with regions varying widely. Construction activity will likely continue to stabilize in western E
­ urope.
Low interest rates and increased real income will be a boon to
housing construction in northwestern Europe. The branch has
been shrinking for years in Italy and France and could bottom
out. In the United States, the industry saw a significant u
­ pswing
in 2015 and the number of construction starts increased
sharply. We therefore anti­cipate robust growth in 2016, as

BASF Report 2015

well. In China, however, production growth will probably continue to slow; the housing market in particular is suffering from
oversupply. We expect the other Asian emerging markets to
show stable growth rates in the construction industry. The
South American market is likely to slightly shrink.
We assume that the consumer goods industry ­will grow
somewhat faster than in the previous year. In Asia, demand for
consumer goods is likely to remain stable: this prediction is
supported by the realignment of China’s economy toward a
more consumer-oriented growth model and Japan’s upcoming sales tax increase in 2017. We anticipate restrained growth
in production in western Europe’s consumer goods industries.
In the United States, production growth will remain far behind
private demand, as the strong U.S. dollar will favor the import
of consumer goods.
The electronics industry is set to grow as fast in 2016 as
it did in the previous year. We anticipate stable growth in Asia,
the global center of the electronic industry. We foresee slight
deceleration in China and South Korea, whereas Taiwan and
Japan will probably show rising growth rates. Growth is
­expected to be slower in North America and stable in western
Europe.
We predict solid global growth roughly comparable with
prior-year levels for production in the health and nutrition
sector. In Europe, we anticipate slightly higher growth rates
overall. In North America, the industry is likely to be somewhat
outpaced by the growth rate of gross domestic product.
Growth rates in this sector will probably decline slightly in Asia,
but at a high level. Production in South America will continue
to decrease slightly.
For agriculture, we anticipate worldwide growth on par
with the average rate of the past few years. Rising demand
from China and India suggests solid production growth at
home as well as in Brazil and the United States, two major
exporting countries. In Europe, production growth will follow
the weak regional trends in demand. The severe economic
crisis in Ukraine and the ongoing conflict in the eastern part of
the country will be reflected in decreasing agricultural production. The low price of oil will continue to curtail global demand
for bioethanol. We expect prices for agricultural raw materials
to remain under pressure in 2016.

BASF Report 2015 

Outlook for the chemical industry
▪▪ Global growth slightly below the level of 2015
Global chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) will
probably grow by 3.4% in 2016, slightly slower than in 2015
(+3.6%). We expect production in the advanced economies to
expand by 1.3%, somewhat slower than in the previous year
(+1.6%). At 5.0%, overall growth in the emerging markets will
also approximate prior-year levels.
The global growth rate of the chemical market will be
largely determined by developments in China, which accounts
for more than a third of worldwide production. China will presumably contribute more than two percentage points to the
rate of global chemical industry growth in 2016. All growth
forecasts for China are currently fraught with high levels of
uncertainty; this applies to our prognosis for global chemical
growth, as well.
Chemical production in the European Union is likely to
grow only slowly in 2016. Demand from customer industries in
the region will grow moderately, yet we do not anticipate any
additional growth stimulus beyond this from the export business for Europe’s chemical producers. Overall, competitive
pressure could remain high on an international level, even as
European chemical sites – as in the previous year – benefit
from low oil prices compared with U.S. competitors whose
production is based on gas.
We expect chemical production to expand in the United
States against the backdrop of solidly growing demand overall
from customer industries. However, momentum let up considerably over the course of 2015, which may be reflected in a
lower growth rate for 2016.

Management’s Report
Forecast — Economic environment in 2016﻿

Chemical growth will decelerate somewhat overall in the
emerging markets of Asia. While it will probably continue to
shrink in China, it will hover around prior-year levels in the
­region’s other countries. The higher growth rates we expect for
the automotive industry will support demand for chemicals.
Slower construction activity in China will presumably have a
dampening effect. In Japan, we anticipate a weak economic
environment overall and minimal growth in chemical production.
The chemical industry in South America will stagnate
overall. Demand is likely to remain weak in Argentina; in Brazil,
it will continue to decline. In the other South American countries, however, we expect solid growth on average.

Outlook 2016
We expect conditions to remain challenging in 2016. The
global economy and industrial production will presumably
grow at a level approximating that of 2015. Chemical production is likely to grow at a slower rate than in 2015. For
2016, we assume an average price of $40 for a barrel of
Brent blend crude oil and an exchange rate of $1.10 per
euro. The global economy continues to face increasing
risks. We nevertheless aim to raise sales volumes in all
segments. BASF Group sales will decline considerably,
however, espe­cially as a result of the divestiture of the gas
trading and storage business as well as lower oil and gas
prices. We expect income from operations before special
items to be slightly below 2015 levels. This is an ambitious
goal in the current volatile and challenging environment,
and is particularly dependent on oil price developments.
For more information on our expectations for the economic environment
in 2016, see page 121 onward

Sales and earnings forecast for the BASF Group
▪▪ Considerable sales decline due to divestiture of
gas trading and storage business
▪▪ Income from operations before special items
­expected at level slightly below 2015
BASF Group sales will decrease considerably in 2016. As a
consequence of the asset swap with Gazprom, contributions
to the Oil & Gas segment have ceased from the natural gas
trading and storage business in particular. In the first three
quarters of 2015, these activities contributed a total of around
€10.1 billion to sales. Sales will be furthermore reduced by
lower prices for oil and gas. We want to increase sales volumes in all segments, excluding the effects of acquisitions and
divestitures. Income from operations before special items is
expected to be slightly below 2015 levels. This is an ambitious
goal in the current volatile and challenging environment, and is
­particularly dependent on oil price developments. We anticipate considerably lower contributions from the Chemicals and
Oil & Gas segments. In the other segments, we aim to slightly
increase earnings.
We expect EBIT to decline slightly overall in 2016. In addition to a lower level of EBIT before special items, this assumption reflects the charges expected to arise from restructuring
measures. The contribution from the Oil & Gas segment is

1

likely to shrink considerably in 2016; we anticipate a slight
decrease in the chemicals business1 and a slight gain in the
Agricultural Solutions segment. In Other, EBIT is forecast to
rise considerably. Yet because EBIT of Other is not factored
into the calculation of our EBIT after cost of capital, the BASF
Group’s EBIT after cost of capital will presumably see a considerable decline. We will still earn a premium on our cost of
capital. In the Performance Products, Functional Materials &
Solutions, and Agricultural Solutions segments, we anticipate
a considerable boost in EBIT after cost of capital.
The significant risks and opportunities that could affect our
forecast are described on pages 113 to 120.
For more on the cost of capital percentage, see page 30

Sales and earnings forecast for the segments
Sales in the Chemicals segment are likely to decline slightly in
2016. Higher volumes in the Monomers and Intermediates
­divisions due to the startup of plants will not be able to offset
the lower prices resulting from decreased raw material costs.
We continue to anticipate intense competitive pressure, especially in the markets for MDI, TDI, acrylic acid and caprolactam.
Income from operations before special items is e
­ xpected to fall
considerably. We foresee higher fixed costs in the Monomers
and Intermediates divisions from plant startups and shrinking
margins, especially in the Petrochemicals division.
In an environment that remains challenging, we plan on
sales in the Performance Products segment that match
­prior-year levels, despite lower prices. We want to raise sales
volumes in all divisions. Factors supporting this endeavor
include new production capacities in the D
­
­ ispersions &
Pigments and Care Chemicals divisions. Income from operations before special items should slightly exceed the level of
2015, supported by strict cost discipline and measures to
­increase competitiveness in all divisions.
In the Functional Materials & Solutions segment in 2016,
we expect demand to remain high from our key customer
sectors, the automotive and construction industries, and aim
to raise sales volumes in all divisions. We nevertheless foresee
negative effects from the continuing decrease in precious
metal prices and overall sales that remain at a prior-year level.
We aim to slightly raise our income from operations before
special items.

Our chemicals business comprises the Chemicals, Performance Products and Functional Materials & Solutions segments.

For sales, “slight” represents a change of 1–5%, while “considerable” applies for changes of 6 % and higher. “At prior-year level” indicates no change (+/–0 %). For earnings, “slight”
means a change of 1–10%, while “considerable” is used for changes of 11% and higher. “At prior-year level” indicates no change (+/–0 %).

For 2016, we are anticipating continued slow market growth
in the Agricultural Solutions segment and high exchange
rate volatility in some of our key growth markets. Despite
this difficult economic environment, we aim to increase our
sales volumes, especially of innovative herbicides. Through
­increased sales and continued strict cost management, sales
and income from operations before special items should both
improve slightly.
The Oil & Gas segment is likely to see expanded production, but a considerable drop in sales and income from operations before special items compared with 2015. Lower prices
for oil and gas, together with the divestiture of our gas trading
and storage business, are the major factors behind this forecast. Moreover, we will achieve lower sales and earnings from
our share in the Yuzhno Russkoye natural gas field: In 2016,
the excess amounts produced over the last ten years will
be compensated, as contractually agreed with our partner,
Gazprom.
In Other, sales are likely to decline considerably due to
supply contracts in Asia that expired at the end of 2015. A
considerable rise is expected in income from operations
before special items, which should result in part from an
­
­improved currency result.

Financing

In the Oil & Gas segment, our currently planned investments
of around €4.8 billion between 2016 and 2020 will focus
­mainly on the development of proven gas and oil deposits in
­Argentina, Norway and Russia. The actual amount of expenditure will depend on oil and gas price developments and b
­e
reduced as needed.
For 2016, we plan total investments of around €4.2 billion,
particularly for the major projects in the countries listed above.

Our ﬁnancing policy is aimed at ensuring our solvency at all
times, limiting the risks associated with ﬁnancing and optimizing our cost of capital. We strive to maintain at least a solid
“A” rating, which allows the BASF Group unrestricted access
to money and capital markets.
From the scheduled repayment of bonds, we expect cash
outflows in the equivalent amount of around €900 million in
2016. To refinance mature bonds and to optimize our maturity
profile, we continue to have medium to long-term corporate
bonds and our U.S. dollar commercial paper program at our
disposal.

On February 17, 2016, we announced that a general agreement had been reached with AkzoNobel on the sale of the
Coatings division’s industrial coatings business for €475 million. The transaction would include technologies, patents and
trademarks, as well as the transfer of two production sites in
England and South Africa. The planned transaction is subject
to the required consultation with employee ­

Corporate governance refers to the entire system for
­managing and supervising a company. This includes the
organization, values, corporate principles and guidelines
as well as internal and external control and monitoring
mechanisms. Effective and transparent corporate governance guarantees that BASF is managed and monitored
in a responsible manner focused on value creation. This
fosters the confidence of our domestic and international
­investors, the financial markets, our customers and other
business partners, employees, and the public in BASF.
The fundamental elements of BASF SE’s corporate governance system are: its two-tier system, with a transparent and
effective separation of company management and supervision
between BASF’s Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board; the equal representation of shareholders and
employees on the Supervisory Board; and the shareholders’
rights of co-administration and supervision at the Annual
Shareholders’ Meeting.

Direction and management by the Board of
­Executive Directors
▪▪ Board of Executive Directors strictly separated from
the Supervisory Board
▪▪ Determines corporate goals and strategic orientation
▪▪ Reports to Supervisory Board
The Board of Executive Directors is responsible for the
­management of the company, and represents BASF SE in
business undertakings with third parties. BASF’s Board of
­Executive Directors is strictly separated from the Supervisory
Board, which monitors the activity of the Board of Executive
­Directors and decides on its composition. A member of the
Board of Executive Directors cannot simultaneously be a
member of the Supervisory Board. As the central duty of company management, the Board of Executive Directors agrees
on the corporate goals and strategic direction of the BASF
Group as well as their individual business areas; determines
the company’s internal organization; and decides on the composition of management on the levels below the Board. It also
manages and monitors BASF Group business through the
planning and setting of the corporate budget, the allocation of
resources and management capacities, the monitoring and
decision-making regarding significant individual measures,
and the control of the operational management.

The Board’s actions and decisions are aligned with the company’s best interests. It is committed to the goal of sustainably
increasing the company’s value. Among the Board’s responsibilities is the preparation of the consolidated and individual
ﬁnancial statements of BASF SE. Furthermore, it must ensure
that the company’s activities comply with legal requirements
and internal corporate directives. This includes the establishment of appropriate controls and risk management systems.
Decisions that are reserved for the Board as a whole by
law, through the Board of Executive Directors’ Rules of Procedure or through resolutions adopted by the Board, are made
at regularly held Board meetings called by the Chairman of the
Board of Executive Directors. Board decisions are generally
based on detailed information and analyses provided by the
business areas and specialist units, and, if deemed necessary,
by external consultants. Board decisions can generally be
made via a simple majority. In the case of a tied vote, the
casting vote is given by the Chairman of the Board. However,
the Chairman of the Board does not have the right to veto the
­decisions of the Board of Executive Directors. Members of the
Board of Executive Directors are authorized to make decisions
individually in their assigned areas of responsibility.
The Board can set up Board Committees to consult and
decide on individual issues; these must include at least three
members of the Board of Executive Directors. For the preparation of important decisions, such as those on acquisitions,
­divestitures, investments and personnel, the Board has various
commissions at the level below the Board that carefully assess
the planned measure and evaluate the associated opportunities and risks, and based on this information, report and make
recommendations to the Board – independently of the affected
business area.
The Board of Executive Directors informs the Supervisory
Board regularly, without delay and comprehensively, of all
issues important to the company with regard to planning,
­
­business development, risk situation, risk management and
compliance. Furthermore, the Board of Executive Directors
coordinates the company’s strategic orientation with the
­Supervisory Board.

The Statutes of BASF SE deﬁne certain transactions that

visory Board’s approval prior to their conclusion. Such cases
­include the acquisition and disposal of enterprises and parts of
enterprises, as well as the issue of bonds or comparable ﬁnancial instruments. However, this is only necessary if the
­acquisition or disposal price or the amount of the issue in an
individual case exceeds 3% of the equity reported in the last
approved Consolidated Financial Statements of the BASF
Group.

The members of the Board of Executive Directors, including their areas
of responsibility and memberships on the supervisory bodies of other
companies, are listed on page 138. Compensation of the Board of
­Executive Directors is described in detail in the Compensation Report
from page 140 onward.

Supervision of company management by the
­Supervisory Board
▪▪ Supervisory Board appoints, monitors and advises
Board of Executive Directors
▪▪ Four Supervisory Board committees
The Supervisory Board appoints the members of the Board of
Executive Directors and supervises and advises the Board on
management issues. As members of the Supervisory Board
cannot simultaneously be on the Board of Executive Directors,
a high level of autonomy is already structurally ensured with
regard to the supervision of the Board of Executive Directors.

Together with the SE Council Regulation, the Statutes of
BASF SE and the Agreement Concerning the Involvement of
­Employees in BASF SE (Employee Participation Agreement)
constitute the relevant legal basis for the size and composition
of the ­Supervisory Board. In November 2015, the Employee
Participation Agreement was supplemented by several stipulations implementing the statutory regulations on the minimum
percentage of women and men in the Supervisory Board as of
January 1, 2016. The German Codetermination Act does not
apply to BASF as a European stock corporation (Societas
Europaea, SE).
The Supervisory Board of BASF SE comprises twelve
members. Six members are elected by the shareholders at the
­Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. The remaining six members
are elected by the BASF Europa Betriebsrat (European Works
Council), the European employee representation body of the
BASF Group.
Resolutions of the Supervisory Board are passed by a
­simple majority vote of the participating members. In the event
of a tie, the vote of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board,
who must always be a shareholder representative, shall be the
­casting vote. This resolution process is also applicable for the
appointment and dismissal of members of the Board of Execu­
tive Directors by the Supervisory Board.
BASF SE’s Supervisory Board has established a total of
four Supervisory Board Committees: the Personnel Committee, the Audit Committee, the Nomination Committee and, as
of 2015, the Strategy Committee.

Corporate Governance 
Corporate governance report ﻿﻿

Objectives for Supervisory Board composition
▪▪ Composition criteria: professional and personal
­qualifications, diversity, and independence
One important concern of good corporate governance is to
ensure that seats on the responsible corporate bodies, the
Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board, are
appropriately ﬁlled. Seats on the Board of Executive Directors
and Supervisory Board should be ﬁlled with members who
­ensure a well-balanced consideration of all the knowledge,
skills and personal qualiﬁcations necessary to manage and
supervise BASF as a large, globally operating, capital market-oriented company in the chemical industry.
On October 21, 2010, the Supervisory Board agreed upon
objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board in
accordance with Section 5.4.1 of the German Corporate
­
­Governance Code; these were supplemented in the Supervisory Board meetings of December 20, 2012, and October 22,
2015. According to these objectives, the Supervisory Board
shall be composed in such a way that the members as a group
possess knowledge, ability and expert experience
––In the management of an internationally operating company
––In cross-industry value creation along different value chains
––In the application of accounting principles and internal control procedures
––In the ﬁeld of technical and scientiﬁc innovations in the
chemical sector and associated industries as well as in the
sectors using chemical products.
At least one independent member of the Supervisory Board
must have expertise in the fields of accounting or auditing as
per Section 100(5) of the German Stock Corporation Act. With
­regard to diversity, the Supervisory Board shall consider a
­variety of professional and international experience as well as
the participation of women. With regard to independence, the
­Supervisory Board aims to ensure that all Supervisory Board
members are independent as defined by the terms of the
Code. Individuals who may have a conflict of interest shall not
be nominated for election to the Supervisory Board. The same
applies to candidates who will have reached the age of 70 by
the day of the election. Since October 2015, there has been
an additional objective for the composition: Membership on
the Supervisory Board should generally not exceed 15 years;
this corresponds to three regular statutory periods in office.
The members of the Supervisory Board elected at the ­Annual
Shareholders’ Meeting already fulfill this new objective with
one exception.
In assessing independence, the Supervisory Board
­assumes that neither election as an employee representative,
nor membership on the Board of Executive Directors more
than two years in the past, taken together or in isolation, precludes the classiﬁcation as independent.

BASF Report 2015

On this basis, the Supervisory Board has determined that all
of its current members can be considered independent. We
firmly believe that the current composition fulfills the objectives
with the aforementioned exception regarding the period of
membership.

Commitments to promote the participation of
women in leadership positions at BASF SE
▪▪ Minimum quota on Supervisory Board, target
figures for Board of Executive Directors and top
­management
On April 24, 2015, the Law on Equal Participation of Women
and Men in Leadership Positions in the Private and Public
Sector came into force in Germany.
At BASF SE, this law is being put into practice as follows:
According to Section 17(2) of the SE Implementation Act, the
supervisory board of a publicly listed European society (SE)
that is composed of the same number of shareholder and
employee representatives must consist of at least 30% each of
women and men. The Supervisory Board of BASF SE c
­ urrently
comprises nine men and three women. Two of the six shareholder representatives elected at the Annual Shareholders’
Meeting are women. Should any reappointments be necessary
on the Supervisory Board of BASF SE, legal regulations – and
the stipulations of the BASF SE Employee Participation Agreement based on them – dictate that the percentage of women
be increased from the current figure of 25% to at least 30%;
that is, four women. The legal minimum quota will therefore be
reached after the next regular Supervisory Board election in
2019 at the latest.
Furthermore, pursuant to Section 111(5) of the German
Stock Corporation Act, the Supervisory Board determined as
a target figure for the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE
that the Board of Executive Directors should have at least one
female member. This represents 12.5% of currently eight
members of the Board of Executive Directors; the goal had
already been reached at the time the target figure was determined.
In addition, the Board of Executive Directors decided on
target figures for the proportion of women in the two management levels below the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE
as per the legal requirements in Section 76(4) of the German
Stock Corporation Act: Women are to make up 9.4% of the
leadership level directly below the Board, and the level below
that is to comprise 11.8% women. This corresponds to the
status at the time these target figures were determined.
The deadline for achieving these goals for the Board of
­Executive Directors of BASF SE and both management levels
below has been set for December 31, 2016. After that, the
­company will review the numbers and subsequently decide on
new target figures for BASF SE.

Shareholders’ rights
▪▪ Shareholders’ rights of co-administration and
­supervision at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting
▪▪ One share, one vote
Shareholders exercise their rights of co-administration and
­supervision at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. The Annual
Shareholders’ Meeting elects half of the members of the
­Supervisory Board and, in particular, decides on the formal
discharge of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board, the distribution of proﬁts, capital measures, the
authorization of share buybacks, changes to the Statutes and
the selection of the auditor.
Each BASF SE share represents one vote. All of BASF SE’s
shares are registered shares. Shareholders are obliged to have
themselves entered with their shares into the company share
register and to provide the information necessary for registration in the share register according to the German Stock
Corporation Act. There are no registration restrictions and
­
there is no limit to the number of shares that can be registered
to one shareholder. Only the persons listed in the share register are entitled to vote as shareholders. Listed shareholders
may ­exercise their voting rights at the Annual Shareholders’
Meeting either personally, through a representative of their
choice or through a company-appointed proxy authorized by
the shareholders to vote according to their instructions. There
are neither voting caps to limit the number of votes a shareholder may cast nor special voting rights. BASF has fully
­implemented the ­principle of “one share, one vote.”
All shareholders entered in the share register are entitled to
participate in the Annual Shareholders’ Meetings, to have their
say concerning any item on the agenda and to request information about company issues insofar as this is necessary to
make an informed judgment about the item on the agenda
under discussion. Registered shareholders are also entitled to
file motions pertaining to proposals for resolutions made by
the Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board at the
Annual Shareholders’ Meeting and to contest resolutions of
the Meeting and have them evaluated for their lawfulness in
court.
Shareholders who hold at least €500,000 of the company’s share capital, a quota corresponding to 390,625 shares,
are furthermore entitled to request that additional items be
added to the agenda of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting.

Implementation of the German Corporate
­Governance Code
▪▪ BASF SE follows all recommendations of German
Corporate Governance Code
BASF supports the German Corporate Governance Code,
which is regarded as an important tool in the capital marketfocused continuing development of corporate governance
and control, and advocates responsible corporate governance
that focuses on sustainably increasing the value of the
­company.
BASF SE follows all recommendations of the German
Corporate Governance Code in its most recently revised
­version of May 2015. This also applies to the new recommendations regarding the Supervisory Board, for example, the
determination of a maximum membership period on the
­Supervisory Board. In the same manner, BASF has followed
nearly all of the nonobligatory suggestions of the German
Corporate Governance Code. We have not implemented the
suggestion to enable shareholders to follow the proceedings
of the entire Annual Shareholders’ Meeting online. The Annual
Shareholders’ Meeting is publicly accessible via online broadcast until the end of the speech by the Chairman of the Board
of Executive Directors. The subsequent discussion of items on
the agenda is not accessible online in order to preserve the
character of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting as a meeting
attended by our shareholders on-site.
The joint Declaration of Conformity 2015 by the Board of Executive
­ irectors and Supervisory Board of BASF SE is rendered on page 152.

Disclosure according to Section 315(4) of the
German Commercial Code and the explanatory
report of the Board of Executive Directors
­according to Section 176(1) Sentence 1 of the
German Stock Corporation Act
As of December 31, 2015, the subscribed capital of BASF SE
was €1,175,652,728.32 divided into 918,478,694 registered
shares with no par value. Each share entitles the holder to one
vote at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. Restrictions on the
right to vote or transfer shares do not exist. The same rights
and duties apply to all shares. According to the Statutes,
shareholders are not entitled to receive share certificates.
There are neither different classes of shares nor shares with
preferential voting rights (golden shares).
The appointment and dismissal of members of the Board
of Executive Directors is legally governed by the regulations in
Article 39 of the SE Council Regulation, Section 16 of the SE
Implementation Act and Sections 84, 85 of the German Stock
Corporation Act, as well as Article 7 of the BASF SE Statutes.
Accordingly, the Supervisory Board determines the number of
members of the Board of Executive Directors (at least two),
appoints the members of the Board of Executive Directors,
and can nominate a chairperson, as well as one or more
vice-chairpersons. The members of the Board of Executive
Directors are appointed for a maximum of five years, and
­reappointments are permissible. The Supervisory Board can
dismiss a member of the Board of Executive Directors if there
is serious cause to do so. Serious cause includes, in particular,
a gross breach of the duties pertaining to the Board of
­Executive Directors and a vote of no confidence at the Annual
Shareholders’ Meeting. The Supervisory Board decides
on appointments and dismissals according to its own best
judgment.
According to Article 59(1) SE Council Regulation, amendments to the Statutes of BASF SE require a resolution of the
Annual Shareholders’ Meeting adopted with at least a twothirds majority of the votes cast, provided that the legal provisions applicable to German stock corporations under the
German Stock Corporation Act do not stipulate or allow for
larger majority requirements. In the case of amendments to
the Statutes, the Section 179(2) of the German Stock Corporation Act requires a majority of at least three-quarters of the
subscribed capital represented. Pursuant to Article 12(6) of
the Statutes of BASF SE, the Supervisory Board is authorized
to resolve upon amendments to the Statutes that merely concern their wording. This applies in particular to the adjustment
of the share capital and the number of shares after the
­redemption of repurchased BASF shares and after a new issue
of shares from the authorized capital.

BASF Report 2015

Until May 1, 2019, the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE
is empowered by a resolution passed at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting of May 2, 2014, to increase the subscribed
capital – with the approval of the Supervisory Board – by a
total amount of €500 million through the issue of new shares
against cash or contributions in kind (authorized capital). A
right to subscribe to the new shares shall be granted to shareholders. This can also be done by a credit institution acquiring
the new shares with the obligation to offer these to shareholders (indirect subscription right). The Board of Executive Directors is authorized to exclude the statutory subscription right of
shareholders to a maximum amount of a total of 20% of share
capital in certain exceptional cases that are defined in Section
5(8) of the BASF SE Statutes. This applies in particular if, for
capital increases in return for cash contributions, the issue
price of the new shares is not substantially lower than the
stock market price of BASF shares and the total number of
shares issued under this authorization is not more than 10% of
the stock of shares on the date of issue or, in eligible individual
cases, to acquire companies or shares in companies in
­exchange for surrendering BASF shares.
At the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on April 27, 2012,
the Board of Executive Directors was authorized to purchase
up to 10% of the shares existing at the time of the resolution
(10% of the company’s share capital) until April 26, 2017. At
the discretion of the Board of Executive Directors, the purchase can take place on the stock exchange or by way of a
public purchase offer directed to all shareholders. The Board
of Executive Directors is authorized to sell the repurchased
company shares (a) through a stock exchange, (b) through a
public offer directed to all shareholders and – with the a­­pproval
of the Supervisory Board – to third parties, (c) for a cash payment that is not significantly lower than the stock exchange
price at the time of sale and (d) for contributions in kind, particularly in connection with the acquisition of companies, parts
of companies or shares in companies or in connection with
mergers. In the cases specified under (c) and (d), the shareholders’ subscription right is excluded. The Board of Executive
Directors is furthermore authorized to redeem the shares
bought back and to reduce the share capital by the proportion
of the share capital accounted for by the redeemed shares.

BASF Report 2015 

Bonds issued by BASF SE grant the bearer the right to request
early repayment of the bonds at nominal value if one person
– or several persons acting in concert – hold or acquire a
BASF SE share volume after the time of issuance which corresponds to more than 50% of the voting rights (change of
control), and one of the rating agencies named in the bond’s
terms and conditions withdraws its rating of BASF SE or the
bond, or reduces it to a noninvestment grade rating within 120
days after the change-of-control event.
In the event of a change of control, members of the Board
of Executive Directors shall, under certain additional conditions, receive compensation (details of which are listed in the
Compensation Report on page 146). A change of control is
assumed when a shareholder informs BASF of a shareholding
of at least 25% or the increase of such a holding. In addition,
employees of BASF SE and its subsidiaries who are classed
as senior executives will receive a severance payment if their
contract of employment is terminated by BASF within 18
months of the occurrence of a change of control, provided the
employee has not given cause for the termination. The
employee whose service contract has been terminated in
­
such a case will receive a maximum severance payment of
1.5 times the annual salary (ﬁxed component) depending on
the number of months that have passed since the change-­
of-control event.
The remaining specifications stipulated in Section 315(4) of
the German Commercial Code refer to situations that are not
applicable to BASF SE.

Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance
BASF SE has taken out liability insurance that covers the
­activities of members of the Board of Executive Directors and
the Supervisory Board (D&O insurance). This policy provides
for the level of deductibles for the Board of Executive Directors
as prescribed by Section 93(2)(3) of the German Stock
­Corporation Act and for the level of deductibles for the Supervisory Board as recommended in Section 3.8(3) of the German
Corporate Governance Code.

Share ownership by Members of the Board of
Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board
No member of the Board of Executive Directors or the Supervisory Board owns shares in BASF SE and related options or
other derivatives that account for 1% or more of the share
capital. Furthermore, the total volume of BASF SE shares and
related financial instruments held by members of the Board of
Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board accounts for
less than 1% of the shares issued by the company.

Share dealings of the Board of Executive
­Directors and Supervisory Board (Directors’
Dealings under Section 15a of German
­Securities Trading Act)
In accordance with Section 15a of the German Securities
Trading Act (Wertpapierhandelsgesetz), all members of the
Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board as
well as certain members of their families are required to disclose the purchase or sale of BASF shares and other related
rights to the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht) and to the company
if transactions within the calendar year exceed the threshold
of €5,000.
In 2015, a total of four purchases by members of the
Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board and
members of their families subject to disclosure were reported
as Directors’ Dealings, involving between 338 and 10,500
BASF shares. The price per share was between $75.99 and
€85.92. The volume of the individual trades was between
€28,184.13 and $797,895.00. The disclosed share transactions are published on the website of BASF SE.

Information on the auditor
The Annual Shareholders’ Meeting of April 30, 2015, elected
KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft as the auditor of

on compliance

With our Group-wide Compliance Program, we aim to
ensure adherence to legal regulations and the company’s
internal guidelines. We have integrated compliance into
our “We create chemistry” strategy. Our employee Code
of Conduct firmly embeds these mandatory standards
into everyday business. Members of the Board of Executive Directors are also expressly obligated to follow these
principles.

Compliance Program and Code of Conduct
▪▪ Compliance standards integrated
into corporate values
▪▪ Regular compliance training for employees
Based on international standards, BASF’s Compliance Program combines important laws and company-internal policies
– themselves exceeding legal requirements – with external
voluntary commitments to create a framework regulating how
all BASF employees interact with business partners, officials,
colleagues and society. At the core of our Compliance Program
is the global, standardized Code of Conduct received by every
employee. All employees and managers are obligated to
­adhere to its guidelines, which describe proper conduct not

only in terms of corruption and antitrust legislation, but also
topics like human rights, labor and social standards, conflicts
of interest, trade control, and protection of data privacy.
Abiding by compliance standards is the foundation of
­responsible leadership. This has been expressly embedded in
our values, where we state: “We strictly adhere to our compliance standards.” We are convinced that compliance with these
standards will not only prevent the disadvantages associated
with violations, such as penalties and fines; we also view
­compliance as the right path toward securing our company’s
long-term success.
Our efforts are principally aimed at preventing violations
from the outset. To this end, all employees are required within a
prescribed time frame to take part in basic compliance training,
refresher courses and special tutorials dealing with, for example, antitrust legislation or trade control regulations. Training
takes place in different formats, including face-to-face training,
e-learning or workshops. In addition, we introduced a new
e-learning program on trade control in 2015, focusing on
export controls and embargos. In total, more than 64,000
­
employees worldwide took part in around 70,000 hours of
­
compliance training in 2015.

Compliance culture at BASF
We firmly believe that for corporate responsibility to be a
­success, there must be an active culture of living these guidelines within the company. This culture takes years to develop,
and requires the consistent, reliable application of compliance
standards. Because our Code of Conduct was introduced
early on, these standards are already established and undisputed. In the Global Employee Survey conducted in 2015, the
vast majority of our employees confirmed that their work environment places high value on proper conduct in alignment with
internal company guidelines and standards. We consistently
investigate any cases in which the answer to the corresponding
question showed unit-specific anomalies.

Monitoring adherence to our Compliance
­principles
▪▪ Central role of Chief Compliance Officer and
­compliance officers
▪▪ 50 external hotlines worldwide
▪▪ Numerous internal compliance audits
BASF’s Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) manages the implementation of our Compliance Management System, supported
by 94 compliance officers worldwide. The CCO regularly
­reports to the Board of Executive Directors on progress in the
program’s implementation as well as on any signiﬁcant ﬁndings.
Furthermore, the CCO reports to the Supervisory Board’s Audit
Committee in at least one of its meetings each year on the
status of the Compliance Program as well as any major
­developments. In the event of signiﬁcant incidents, the Audit
Committee is immediately informed by the Board of Executive
Directors.
We particularly encourage our employees to actively and
promptly seek guidance if in doubt. For this, they can consult
not only their managers but also dedicated specialist departments and company compliance ofﬁcers. We have also set up
50 external hotlines worldwide which our employees can turn
to anonymously. We make sure that all concerns are processed
and answered within a short amount of time.
In 2015, 357 calls and emails were received by our external
hotlines (2014: 276). Concerns involved questions ranging
from personnel management and handling of company
­property, to information on the behavior of business partners or
human rights issues – such as labor and social standards.
­I­ncreasing awareness was observed when it came to ­potential
conflicts of interest. We launched case-specific investigations,
in accordance with applicable law and internal regulations,
into all cases of suspected misconduct that we became aware
of. Confirmed violations were penalized, up to and including
dismissal.

Corporate Governance
Compliance﻿

This involved making sure that the necessary action was taken
in accordance with standardized company criteria. In the case
of suspected corruption we reported to the relevant authorities
in 2014, the penal proceedings against a former employee and
the employee of a customer company did not confirm the
corruption allegations.
BASF’s Corporate Audit department monitors adherence
to compliance principles, covering all areas in which compliance violations could occur. They check that employees uphold
regulations and make sure that the established processes,
procedures and monitoring tools are appropriate and sufficient
to minimize potential risk or preclude violations in the first place.
In 2015, 92 Group-wide audits of this kind were performed
(2014: 104), predominantly in the areas of antitrust law, imports
and exports, and gifts and entertainment. If compliance audits
reveal a need to optimize procedures or hone control ­measures,
we implement them immediately.
We introduced a new global guideline on April 1, 2015, on
“Due Diligence with Business Partners.” Based on this guideline, all of our business partners in sales and marketing are
monitored for potential compliance risks. This is done by
means of a checklist, a questionnaire distributed to the
­business partner, and an internet-based analysis; afterward,
we document the results. We furthermore expect all suppliers
to know of and act in accordance with our global Code of
Conduct.
We support the United Nations’ Guiding Principles on
Business and Human Rights and are constantly working to
enhance our internal guidelines and processes in keeping with
these principles. For example, we established an interdisciplinary, BASF-internal work group on this topic in 2015 in order to
pool responsibilities in this area. Also outside of our company,
we support the respect of human rights and the ﬁght against
corruption: We are, for example; a founding member of the
United Nations Global Compact. As a member of Transparency
International Deutschland and the Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI) of the World Economic Forum, we assist in
the implementation of these organizations’ objectives. As a
member of the U.N. Global Compact LEAD, we report in
accordance with the Blueprint for Corporate Sustainability
­
Leadership.

Corporate Governance 
Compensation report ﻿﻿

BASF Report 2015

Compensation report

This report outlines the main principles of the compensation for the Board of Executive Directors and discloses the
amount and structure of the compensation of each Board
member. Furthermore, it provides information on end-ofservice undertakings with respect to Board members, as
well as information on the compensation of Supervisory
Board members.

Compensation of the Board of Executive
­Direc­tors
This report meets the disclosure requirements of the
German Commercial Code, supplemented by the additional
requirements based on the German Act on Disclosure of
­
Management Board Remuneration (Vorstandsvergütungs-­
­
Offenlegungsgesetz) as well as the German Act on the Appropriateness of Management Board Remuneration (Gesetz zur
Angemessenheit der Vorstandsvergütung), and is aligned with
the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance
Code (GCGC) in its version of May 5, 2015.
Based on a proposal by the Personnel Committee, the
Supervisory Board determines the amount and structure of
compensation of members of the Board of Executive ­Directors.
The amount and structure of compensation is determined
by the company’s size, complexity and financial position, as
well as the performance of the Board of Executive Directors.
Internal and external appropriateness of the Board’s compensation is reviewed by external auditors on a regular basis.
Globally operating companies based in Europe serve as an
external reference. For internal comparison, compensation is
considered in total as well as over time, especially for senior
executives.
For more on the Supervisory Board and its committees, see page 139
and from page 149 onward

Principles
The compensation of the Board of Executive Directors is
­designed to promote sustainable corporate development. It is
marked by a pronounced variability in relation to the performance of the Board of Executive Directors and BASF Group’s
return on assets.

The compensation of the Board of Executive
­Directors comprises:
1. Fixed salary
2. Annual variable compensation
3. Share-price-based, long-term incentive (LTI) program
4. Nonmonetary compensation and other additional
­compensation
5. Company pension benefits

The compensation components are shown in
detail below:
1. The fixed salary is a set amount of yearly compensation
paid out in even installments. It is regularly reviewed by the
Supervisory Board and adjusted, if necessary.
2. The actual annual variable compensation (variable
bonus) is based on the performance of the entire Board of
Executive Directors and the return on assets. The return on
assets is also used to determine the variable compensation of
all other employee groups.
In order to assess the sustainable performance of the
Board of Executive Directors, each year the Supervisory Board
sets a target agreement with the entire Board of Executive
­Directors that primarily contains medium and long-term goals.
The Supervisory Board assesses the goal achievement of
the current year and the previous two years. A performance
factor with a value between 0 and 1.5 is determined on the
basis of the goal achievement ascertained by the Supervisory
Board. The variable bonus for the prior fiscal year is payable
after the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting.
Board members, like other employee groups, may con-­
tribute a portion of their annual variable bonus into a deferred
compensation program. For members of the Board of Executive Directors, as well as for all other senior executives of the
BASF Group in Germany, the maximum amount that can be
contributed to this program is €30,000. Board members have
taken advantage of this offer to varying degrees.
3. A share-price-based, long-term incentive (LTI) program exists for members of the Board of Executive Directors.
It is also offered to all other senior executives of BASF Group.
Members of the Board of Executive Directors are subject to a
stricter set of rules than are contained in the general program
conditions: They are required to participate in the program
with at least 10% of their variable bonus. This mandatory
­investment consisting of BASF shares is subject to a holding
period of four years. For any additional voluntary investment of
up to 20% of the variable bonus, the general holding period
of two years applies. Members of the Board of Executive
­Directors may only exercise their options at least four years
after they have been granted (vesting period). This compensation component is limited, too, by the structure of the LTI program as well as by the upper limit on the options’ exercise
value. Because the exercise period spans multiple years, it can
occur that gains allocated from several LTI program years all
accumulate into one year; there can also be years in which no
gains are allocated.
For more on share ownership by members of the Board of Executive
­ irectors, see page 135
D
For more on the LTI program, see page 47 and from page 218 onward

BASF Report 2015 

4. Included in nonmonetary compensation and other
­additional compensation (fringe benefits) are the following:
delegation allowances, accident insurance premiums and
other similar benefits, and benefits from means of transport
and security measures provided by the company. The members of the Board did not receive loans or advances from the
company in 2015.
The members of the Board are covered by a directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance (D&O insurance) concluded by the
company, which includes a deductible.
For more on the D&O insurance of the Board of Executive Directors,
see page 135

5. As part of the pension benefits granted to the Board of
Executive Directors (Board Performance Pension), company
pension benefits are intended to accrue annual pension units.
The method used to determine the amount of the pension
benefits generally corresponds to that used for the other s­ enior
executives of the BASF Group in Germany. The method is
­designed such that both the performance of the company and
the progression of the individual Board member’s career
­significantly affect the pension entitlement.
The annual pension benefits accruing to Board members
in a given reporting year (pension unit) are composed of a fixed
and a variable component. The fixed component is calculated
by multiplying the annual fixed salary above the Social Security
Contribution Ceiling by 32% (contribution factor). The variable
component of the pension unit is the result of multiplying the
fixed component with a factor that is dependent on the return
on assets in the reporting year and the performance factor,
which is decisive for the variable bonus. The amount resulting
from the fixed and the variable component is converted into a
pension unit (lifelong pension) using actuarial factors based on
an actuarial interest rate (5%), the probability of death, invalidity and bereavement according to Heubeck Richttafeln, 2005G
(modified), and an assumed pension increase (at least 1% per
annum).
The sum of the pension units accumulated over the reporting years determines the respective Board member’s pension
benefit in the event of a claim. This is the amount that is payable upon retirement. Pension benefits take effect at the end of
service after completion of the member’s 60th year of age, or
on account of disability or death. Pension payments are
­reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted by at least 1% each
year.

Corporate Governance
Compensation report﻿

The pension units also include survivor benefits. Upon the
death of an active or former member of the Board, the surviving spouse receives a survivor pension amounting to 60% of
the Board member’s pension entitlement. The orphan pension
amounts to 10% for each half-orphan, 33% for an orphan,
25% each for two orphans and 20% each for three or more
orphans of the pension entitlement of the deceased (former)
Board member. Total survivor benefits may not exceed 75%
of the Board member’s pension entitlement. If the survivor
pensions exceed the upper limit, they will be proportionately
reduced.
Board members are members of the BASF Pensionskasse
VVaG, as are generally all employees of BASF SE. Contributions and benefits are determined by the Statutes of the BASF
Pensionskasse VVaG and the General Conditions of Insurance.

Amount of total compensation
The tables on pages 142 to 145 show the granted and
­allocated compensation as well as service cost of each member of the Board of Executive Directors in accordance with
Section 4.2.5(3) of the German Corporate Governance Code
(GCGC) in its version of May 5, 2015.
Compensation granted in accordance with the German
Corporate Governance Code (GCGC)
The table “Compensation granted in accordance with GCGC”
shows: fixed salary, fringe benefits, annual variable target
compensation, LTI program measured at fair value at the grant
date, and service cost. The individual compensation components are supplemented by individually attainable minimum
and maximum compensation.
Furthermore, a reconciliation statement for total compensation to be reported is provided below the table “Compensation granted in accordance with GCGC” due to the disclosures
required by Section 314(1)(6a) of the German Commercial
Code (HGB) in connection with the German Accounting
­Standard Number 17 (GAS 17).
The fixed salary and annual variable target compensation
were last adjusted on January 1, 2014.

At the end of the regular term of the LTI program 2006, exercise gains which were realized in 2010 or 2011 were allocated to Dr. Kurt Bock and Dr. Hans-Ulrich Engel in 2014

5

At the end of the regular term of the LTI program 2007, exercise gains which were realized in 2009, 2012 or 2013 were allocated to Dr. Kurt Bock, Dr. Hans-Ulrich Engel and
Wayne T. Smith in 2015 in accordance with the special conditions of the U.S. LTI program.

Accounting valuation of multiple-year variable
compensation (LTI programs)
While the options granted had resulted in a gain for BASF in
2014 – except in the case of Dr. Andreas Kreimeyer – they led
to an expense in 2015. This expense refers to the total of all
options from the LTI programs 2007 to 2015 and is calculated
as the difference in the value of the options on December 31,
2015, compared with the value on December 31, 2014, considering the options exercised and granted in 2015. The value
of the options is based primarily on the development of the
BASF share price and its relative performance compared with
the benchmark index specified for the LTI programs 2007 to
2015. Because the value of options on December 31, 2015,

was greater than that of December 31, 2014, an expense
rather than a gain arose for 2015.
The expenses reported below are purely accounting figures
which do not equate with the allocated actual gains should
options be exercised. Each member of the Board may decide
individually on the timing and scope of the exercise of options
of the LTI programs, while taking into account the terms and
conditions of the program.
The expenses for 2015 relating to all options issued were
as follows: Dr. Kurt Bock €1,058 thousand (2014: gain of
€97 thousand); Dr. Martin Brudermüller €788 thousand (2014:
gain of €333 thousand); Dr. Hans-Ulrich Engel €660 thousand
(2014: gain of €90 thousand); Sanjeev Gandhi €17 thousand;
Michael Heinz €517 thousand (2014: gain of €146 thousand);

Dr. Andreas Kreimeyer €1,023 thousand (2014: expense of
€446 thousand); Dr. Harald Schwager €642 thousand (2014:
gain of €388 thousand); Wayne T. Smith €616 thousand (2014:
gain of €165 thousand); and Margret Suckale €419 thousand
(2014: gain of €145 thousand).
For more on the LTI program, see page 47 and from page 218 onward

Pension benefits
The values for service cost incurred in 2015 contain service
cost for BASF Pensionskasse VVaG and Board Performance
Pension. Service cost for the members of the Board of Executive Directors is shown individually in the tables “Compensation
granted in accordance with GCGC” and “Compensation
­allocated in accordance with GCGC.”
The present value of pension benefits (defined benefit
­obligation) is an accounting figure for the entitlements that the
Board members have accumulated in their years of service at
BASF. The defined benefit obligations up to and including
2015 were as follows: Dr. Kurt Bock €15,684 thousand (2014:
€18,571 thousand); Dr. Martin Brudermüller €13,148 thousand (2014: €13,259 thousand); Dr. Hans-Ulrich Engel
€9,068 thousand (2014: €10,165 thousand); Sanjeev Gandhi
€1,588 thousand (2014: €1,193 thousand); Michael Heinz
€8,226 thousand (2014: €8,295 thousand); Dr. Andreas
Kreimeyer €13,502 thousand (2014: €14,582 thousand);
Dr. Harald Schwager €9,157 thousand (2014: €9,680 thousand); Wayne T. Smith €2,355 thousand (2014: €1,933 thousand); and Margret Suckale €3,518 thousand (2014:
€3,290 thousand).

End-of-service benefits
In the event that a member of the Board of Executive Directors
retires from employment before the age of 60, either because
their appointment was not extended or was revoked for an
important reason, they are entitled to pension benefits if they
have served on the Board for at least ten years or if the time
needed to reach legal retirement age is less than ten years.
The company is entitled to offset compensation received for
any other work done against pension benefits until the legal
retirement age is reached.
The following applies to end of service due to a change-­
of-control event: A change-of-control event, in terms of this
provision, occurs when a shareholder informs BASF of a
shareholding of at least 25%, or the increase of such a holding.
If a Board member’s appointment is revoked within one year
following a change-of-control event, the Board member will
receive the contractually agreed payments for the remaining
contractual term of office as a one-off payment (fixed salary
and annual variable target compensation). The Board member
may also receive the fair value of the option rights acquired in
connection with the LTI program within a period of three
months or may continue to hold the existing rights under the
terms of the program. For the determination of the accrued
pension benefits from the Board Performance Pension, the
time up to the regular expiry of office is taken into c
­ onsideration.

BASF Report 2015

There is a general limit on severance pay (severance payment
cap) for all Board members. Accordingly, payments made to a
Board member upon premature termination of their contract,
without serious cause, may not exceed the value of two years’
compensation, including fringe benefits, nor compensate
more than the remaining term of the contract. The severance
payment cap is to be calculated on the basis of the total compensation for the past business year and, if appropriate, also
the expected total compensation for the current business year.
If the appointment to the Board of ­Executive Directors is prematurely terminated as the result of a change-of-control event,
the payments may not exceed 150% of the severance compensation cap.

Former members of the Board of Executive ­	
­Directors
Total compensation for previous Board members and their
surviving dependents amounted to €10.4 million in 2015
(2014: €6.5 million). This figure also contains payments that
previous Board members have themselves financed through
the ­deferred compensation program and the expense or gain
for 2015 relating to options that previous members of the
Board still hold from the time of their active service period.
The continuation of the options that have not yet been
­exercised at the time of retirement, along with the continuation
of the associated holding period for individual investment in
BASF shares under the conditions of the program, is intended
in order to particularly emphasize how sustainability is
­incorporated into the compensation for the Board members.
Pension provisions for previous Board members and their
surviving d
­ependents amounted to €126.5 million (2014:
€143.5 million).

Compensation of Supervisory Board members
The disclosure of compensation of the Supervisory Board is
based on the German Commercial Code and is aligned with
the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance
Code (GCGC). The compensation of the Supervisory Board is
regulated by the Statutes of BASF SE passed by the Annual
Shareholders’ Meeting.
Each member of the Supervisory Board receives an ­annual
fixed compensation of €60,000 and a performance-related
variable compensation for each full €0.01 by which the
­earnings per share of the BASF Group, as declared in the
BASF Group Consolidated Financial Statements for the year
for which the remuneration is paid, exceeds the minimum
earnings per share. For the 2015 business year, minimum
earnings per share amounted to €1.70 (2014: €1.65). The
performance-related variable remuneration is €800 for each
€0.01 of earnings per share up to an earnings per share of
€2.45, €600 for each further €0.01 of earnings per share up to
an earnings per share of €2.95, and €400 for each €0.01
beyond this. The minimum earnings per share and the
­
corresponding thresholds shall increase by €0.05 for each
­
subsequent business year. The performance-related variable
compensation is limited to a maximum amount of €120,000.

BASF Report 2015 

Corporate Governance
Compensation report﻿

Based on the earnings per share of €4.34 published in the
BASF Group Consolidated Financial Statements 2015, the
performance-related compensation reached the maximum
amount of €120,000 (2014: €120,000).
The chairman of the Supervisory Board receives two-and-­
a-half times and a vice chairman one-and-a-half times the
compensation of an ordinary member. Members of the Supervisory Board who are members of a committee, except for the
­Nomination Committee, receive a further fixed compensation
for this purpose in the amount of €12,500. For the Audit
­Committee, the further fixed compensation is €50,000. The
chairman of a committee shall receive twice and a vice chairman one-and-a-half times the further fixed compensation.
The company reimburses members of the Supervisory
Board for out-of-pocket expenses and value-added tax to be

paid with regard to their activities as members of the Supervisory Board or of a committee. The company further grants the
members of the Supervisory Board a fee of €500 for attending
a meeting of the Supervisory Board or one of its committees to
which they belong and includes the performance of the duties
of the members of the Supervisory Board in the cover of a
direc­
tors’ and officers’ liability insurance (D&O insurance)
concluded by it, which i­ncludes a deductible.
For more on the D&O insurance of the Supervisory Board, ­see page 135

Total compensation of the Supervisory Board for activities in
2015, including attendance fees, was around €3 million (2014:
around €3 million). The compensation of the individual Supervisory Board members was as follows.

Corporate Governance 
Report of the Supervisory Board ﻿﻿

BASF Report 2015

Report of the Supervisory Board

visory Board regarding current developments and signiﬁcant
items. The Supervisory Board was always involved at an early
stage in decisions of major importance. The Supervisory
Board passed resolutions on all of those individual measures
taken by the Board of Executive Directors which by law or the
Statutes required the approval of the Supervisory Board. In the
2015 business year, these concerned approval for the swap
with Gazprom of investments in WINGAS’s natural gas trading
and storage business for further shares in a gas field in western Siberia, as well as the completion guarantee for the Nord
Stream 2 natural gas pipeline project.

Supervisory Board meetings

For our anniversary in 2015 celebrating BASF’s 150 years of
existence, we had expected more favorable conditions. Over
the course of the year, the business environment deteriorated
as political and macroeconomic challenges increased. Oil prices
and growth both dropped sharply. Sales and earnings fell in
this difficult environment, primarily from the dives­titure of our
natural gas trading and storage b
­usiness; cash flow was
­increased. The entrepreneurially deman­ding journey to further
shape the “We create chemistry” strategy will be continued,
and has the full support of the Super­visory Board.

Monitoring and consultation in an ongoing
­dialog with the Board of Executive Directors
In 2015, the Supervisory Board of BASF SE exercised its
­duties as required by law and the Statutes with the utmost
care. We regularly monitored the management of the Board of
Executive Directors and provided advice on the company’s
strategic development and important individual measures,
about which the Supervisory Board was regularly and
­thoroughly informed by the Board of Executive Directors. This
occurred in the form of written and oral reports on, for example, all of the company’s and the segments’ major financial
KPIs for the general economic situation in the main sales and
procurement markets, and on deviations in business developments from original plans. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board
tackled fundamental questions of corporate planning, including financial, investment, sales volumes and personnel planning, as well as measures for designing the future of research
and development.
The Supervisory Board discussed in detail the reports from
the Board of Executive Directors, and also deliberated on
prospects for the company and its individual business areas
with the Board of Executive Directors. Outside of Supervisory
Board meetings, the Chairman of the Board of Executive
­Directors also promptly informed the Chairman of the Super-

The Supervisory Board held ﬁve meetings in the 2015 reporting year. With the exception of one meeting at which one
member of the Supervisory Board was absent, all Supervisory
Board members attended all Supervisory Board meetings in
2015. The members of the Supervisory Board elected by
shareholders and those elected by the employees prepared
for the meetings in separate preliminary discussions.
A significant component of all Supervisory Board meetings
was the Board of Executive Directors’ reports on the current
business situation with detailed information on sales and earnings growth, as well as on opportunities and risks for business
development, the status of important current and planned
investment projects, developments on the capital markets,
­
and significant managerial measures taken by the Board of
Executive Directors. Innovation projects were also discussed,
including science symposia and the Creator Space tour as
part of the activities in honor of BASF’s 150th anniversary.
In its meetings, the Supervisory Board additionally discussed the further development of the BASF Group’s business
activities through acquisitions, divestitures and investment
projects. Significant matters of consultation comprised the
­divestiture of the pharmaceutical custom synthesis business
as well as portions of the active pharmaceutical ingredients
business to Siegfried Holding AG; the above-mentioned BASF
stake in the Nord Stream 2 project company for constructing
an additional natural gas pipeline through the Baltic Sea with
Gazprom, E.ON, ENGIE, Shell and OMV; the divestiture of the
industrial coatings business; and the conclusion of the sale of
the 25% share in the SolVin joint venture. Ongoing topics in
the Board of Executive Directors’ reports furthermore included
major capital-intensive investment projects, such as the
­construction of a TDI complex in Ludwigshafen, Germany; an
MDI plant in Chongqing, China; and an acrylic acid plant in
Camaçari, Brazil, all of which began operations in 2015.
Changes in the regulatory environment and their implications
for the company’s business activities were also discussed.
At its meeting of February 25, 2015, the Supervisory Board
reviewed and approved the Consolidated Financial Statements, Management’s Report and the proposal for the appropriation of profit for the 2014 business year as presented by
the Board of Executive Directors. The meeting on April 30,
2015, served to prepare for the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting.

BASF Report 2015 

In addition to strategically signiﬁcant individual measures, the
Supervisory Board also addressed BASF’s strategy and longterm business prospects in individual business areas and
regions. At its meeting on July 22, 2015, the Supervisory
­
Board, together with the Board of Executive Directors, reassessed the implementation of the “We create chemistry”
strategy established in 2011. Focus areas included the
­Agricultural Solutions and Oil & Gas segments, the further
development of research and development, and the opportunities and risks for the company posed by Industry 4.0. The
restructuring of the pigments business was also conferred
upon.
At the meeting on October 22, 2015, the Board of Execu­
tive ­Directors reported on the region Europe’s organi­zational
and business-model enhancement as well as on the restructuring of the business with paper, water, oilfield and mining
chemicals.
At its meeting of December 17, 2015, the Supervisory
Board discussed the Board of Executive Directors’ operative
and financial planning including the investment budget for
2016, and as usual empowered the Board of ­Executive Directors to procure necessary financing in 2016. An additional
­focus topic was consultation on the further ­development of the
Agricultural Solutions segment.
The Supervisory Board thoroughly considered the personnel issues of the Board of Executive Directors during the
meetings of February 25, July 22, and December 17, 2015.
Based on preparations conducted by the Personnel Com­
mittee, the Supervisory Board determined the targets for the
Board of Executive Directors for the 2015 business year at its
meeting on February 25, 2015. The meeting on July 22, 2015,
dealt with the composition of the Board of Executive Directors.
The terms of office expiring on April 29, 2016, for Chairman
Dr. Kurt Bock, Vice Chairman Dr. Martin Brudermüller, and
members Dr. Hans-Ulrich Engel and Dr. Harald Schwager
were each extended by five years, up to the conclusion of the
Annual Shareholders’ Meeting in 2021. According to preparations made by the Personnel Committee, the Supervisory
Board determined the performance evaluation of the Board of
Executive Directors for the 2015 business year at its meeting
on December 17, 2015.
At its meetings on October 22 and December 17, 2015,
the Supervisory Board also addressed topics pertaining to its
own organization. For example, the Strategy Committee was
deployed at the meeting on October 22, 2015. At both meetings, the Super­visory Board also advised on the change in
BASF SE’s E
­ mployee Participation Agreement, which provides
the material legal foundation for the Supervisory Board. The
changes made to the Employee Participation Agreement
mainly concerned the implementation of the law introducing a
minimum percentage of women and men on the Supervisory
Board.

Corporate Governance
Report of the Supervisory Board﻿

Committees
The Supervisory Board of BASF SE has four committees:
1. the committee for personnel matters of the Board of
­Executive Directors and the granting of loans in accordance
with Section 89(4) of the German Stock Corporation Act (Personnel Committee); 2. the Audit Committee; 3. the Nomination
Committee; and 4. the Strategy Committee, newly established
in 2015. Following each Committee meeting, the chairpersons
of the Committees reported in detail about the meetings and
the activities of the Committees at the subsequent meeting of
the Supervisory Board.
 or more on the composition of the committees and the tasks assigned
F
them by the Supervisory Board, see the Corporate Governance Report
on page 131

The Personnel Committee met three times during the
­reporting period. With the exception of one meeting at which
one member was absent, all committee members participated
in the meetings. At its meeting on February 25, 2015, the
Personnel Committee advised on the targets for the Board of
Executive Directors for the 2015 business year. Topics at the
meeting on July 22, 2015, included succession planning for
the Board of Executive Directors, including the extension of
their terms for Dr. Kurt Bock, Dr. Martin Brudermüller,
Dr. Hans-Ulrich Engel and Dr. Harald Schwager, and the determination of target figures for the proportion of women on the
Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE. At the meeting on
December 17, 2015, the Personnel Committee particularly
focused on the Board of Executive Directors’ performance
evaluation and matters concerning their compensation.
The Audit Committee is responsible for all the tasks listed
in Section 107(3)(2) of the German Stock Corporation Act and
in Subsection 5.3.2 of the German Corporate Governance
Code in its version of June 24, 2014. The Audit Committee
met ﬁve times during the reporting period. All committee members attended all meetings. Its core duties were to review
BASF SE’s Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial
Statements, as well as to discuss the quarterly and ﬁrst-half
ﬁnancial reports with the Board of Executive Directors prior to
their publication.
At the meeting on July 21, 2015, KPMG – the auditor
elected at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting – was charged
with the audit for the 2015 reporting year and auditing fees
were agreed upon. The focus areas for the annual audit were
discussed and defined together with the auditor. The Audit
Committee categorically excluded any service relationships
between auditor and BASF Group companies outside of the
audit of the annual financial statements, including beyond
prevailing legal limitations. These services may only be
­performed upon approval by the Audit Committee. For certain
nonaudit services beyond the scope of the audit of the financial reports, the Audit Committee either granted approval for
individual cases or authorized the Board of Executive Directors
to engage KPMG for such services. The authorization of each
service applies for one reporting year and is limited in amount.

Corporate Governance 
Report of the Supervisory Board ﻿﻿

One of the Committee’s core tasks in 2015 was preparing a
proposal for the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on April 29,
2016, on the election of the auditor for the 2016 business year.
From August to December 2015, the Audit Committee
­sel­ected the auditor to be recommended at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting by means of a tendering process conducted
in line with the regulations set forth by the new E.U. regulatory
framework on statutory audit, effective as of 2016. After
­assessment and extensive discussion of the tenders submitted through the tendering process by a total of five auditing
firms, the Audit Committee decided to recommend to the
Supervisory Board that the previous auditor, KPMG AG
­
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, once again be nominated for
election at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. KPMG has been
auditor of BASF SE’s separate and consolidated financial
statements since the 2006 business year.
Other important activities included advising the Board of
Executive Directors on accounting issues and the internal
control system. The internal auditing system and compliance
in the BASF Group were each a focus at one meeting of the
Audit Committee. In these meetings, the head of the Corporate Audit department and the Chief Compliance Ofﬁcer
­reported to the Audit Committee and answered its questions.
At the meeting on February 23, 2016, the auditor reported
in detail on its audits of BASF SE’s consolidated and separate
financial statements for the 2015 business year and discussed
the audit’s results with the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee once again conducted a selfevaluation of its activities in 2015. No new steps were found to
be necessary in terms of the duties of the committee or the
content, frequency and procedure of meetings.
The Nomination Committee is responsible for preparing
candidate proposals for the election of those Supervisory
Board members who are elected by the Annual Shareholders’
Meeting. The Nomination Committee is guided by the objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board adopted by
the Supervisory Board. No appointments to the Supervisory
Board, or reappointments of former Supervisory Board members, took place in 2015. The Nomination Committee nevertheless met once in 2015 in order to focus especially on risk
provision for succession planning for the Supervisory Board,
and determine a control limit for the term of membership on
the Supervisory Board as recommended by the revised German Corporate Governance Code. All committee members
attended the meeting.
Newly established in 2015, the Strategy Committee held
one meeting during the reporting period, attended by all
members. The discussion centered on possible significant individual measures for the internal implementation of BASF’s
“We ­create chemistry” strategy and strategic options for the
further ­development of the BASF Group. Following this, the
Strategy Committee was informed of progress in the preparation of potential individual measures that may require Super­
visory Board approval should they be carried out.

BASF Report 2015

Corporate governance and Declaration of
­Conformity
The Supervisory Board places great value on ensuring good
corporate governance: In 2015, it was therefore once again
intensely occupied with the corporate governance standards
practiced in the company, the implementation of the German
Corporate Governance Code’s recommendations and
suggestions, and the implementation of the new law on the
partici­
pation of women on the Supervisory Board and the
Board of Executive Directors. At our meeting of October 22,
2015, we discussed the current recommendations and proposals made for the German Corporate Governance Code
and their implementation at BASF.
At its meeting of December 17, 2015, the Supervisory
Board approved the joint Declaration of Conformity by the
Supervisory Board and the Board of Executive Directors in
accordance with Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act, and carried out assessments of efﬁciency and independence. BASF complies with the recommendations of the
German Corporate Governance Code in its version of May 5,
2015, without exception. This also applies to the Code’s
­recommendations made in 2015, such as the determination of
a control limit for the term of membership on the Supervisory
Board, which was fixed by the Supervisory Board at three
regular statutory periods in office, or around 15 years.
 he entire Declaration of Conformity is rendered on page 152 and can
T
also be found at basf.com/en/governance

An important aspect of good corporate governance is the
­independence of Supervisory Board members and their freedom from conflicts of interest. According to estimations of the
Supervisory Board, all of its members can be considered independent as deﬁned by the German Corporate Governance
Code. The criteria used for this evaluation can be found in the
Corporate Governance Report on page 132. In cases where
Supervisory Board members hold supervisory or management
positions at companies with which BASF has business relations, we see no impairment of their independence. The scope
of these businesses is relatively marginal and furthermore
takes place under conditions similar to those of a third party.
To avoid an individual case of potential conflict of interest, one
Supervisory Board member refrained from participating in
consultation on a particular matter at a Supervisory Board
meeting in 2015. The Corporate Governance Report of the
BASF Group provides extensive information on BASF’s corporate governance. It also includes the Compensation Report,
containing full details on the compensation for the Board of
Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board.

Annual Financial Statements of BASF SE and
Consolidated Financial Statements
KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, the auditor e
­ lected
by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting for the 2015 ­reporting
year, has audited the Financial Statements of BASF SE and
the BASF Group Consolidated Financial Statements, including
the ­Management’s Report and the accounting r­ecords from
which they were prepared, and have approved them free of
qualiﬁcation. Furthermore, the auditor certified that the Board
of ­Executive Directors had taken the measures incumbent on
it under Section 91(2) of the German Stock Corporation Act in
an appropriate manner. In particular, it had instituted an appropriate information and monitoring system that fulfilled the
require­ments of the company and is applicable for the early
identification of developments that could pose a risk to the
continued existence of the BASF Group.
The documents to be examined and the auditor’s reports
were sent in a timely manner to every member of the
­Supervisory Board. The auditor attended the accounts review
meeting of the Audit Committee on February 23, 2016,
as well as the accounts meeting of the Supervisory Board on
February 24, 2016, and reported on the main ﬁndings of the
audit. The auditor also provided detailed explanations of the
reports on the day before the accounts meeting of the Supervisory Board.
The Audit Committee reviewed the Financial Statements
and Management’s Report at its meeting on February 23,
2016, and discussed them in detail with the auditor. The Chairwoman of the Audit Committee gave a detailed account of the
preliminary ­review at the Supervisory Board meeting on February 24, 2016. On the basis of this preliminary review by the
Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board has examined the
Financial Statements and Management’s Report of BASF SE
for 2015, the proposal by the Board of Executive Directors for
the appropriation of proﬁt as well as the Consolidated Financial
Statements and Management’s Report for the BASF Group for
2015. The Supervisory Board has reviewed, acknowledged
and approved the auditor’s reports. The results of the preliminary review by the Audit Committee and the results of the
Supervisory Board’s examination fully concur with those of the
audit. The Supervisory Board sees no grounds for objection to
the management and submitted ­reports.
At the Supervisory Board’s accounts meeting on February 24, 2016, we approved the Financial Statements of
BASF SE and the Consolidated Financial Statements of the
BASF Group prepared by the Board of Executive Directors,
making the BASF SE Financial Statements final. We concur
with the proposal of the Board of Executive Directors regarding
the appropriation of proﬁt and the payment of a dividend of
€2.90 per share.

Statement by the Board of Executive Directors﻿

Statement by the Board of Executive Directors
and ­assurance pursuant to Sections 297(2) and 315(1)
of the German Commercial Code (HGB)
The Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE is responsible
for preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements and
­Management’s Report of the BASF Group.
The Consolidated Financial Statements for 2015 were
prepared according to the International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS), which are published by the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB), London, and have been
endorsed by the European Union.
We have established effective internal control and steering
systems in order to ensure that the BASF Group’s Consoli­
dated Financial Statements and Management’s Report comply with applicable accounting rules and to ensure proper
corporate reporting.
The risk management system we have set up is designed
such that the Board of Executive Directors can identify
material risks early on and take appropriate defensive
­
­measures as necessary. The reliability and effectiveness of
the internal control and risk management system are
­continually audited throughout the Group by our internal audit
department.

To the best of our knowledge, and in accordance with the
applicable reporting principles, the Consolidated Financial
Statements of the BASF Group give a true and fair view of the
net assets, financial position and results of operations of the
Group, and the Management’s Report of the BASF Group
­includes a fair review of the development and performance
of the business as well as position of the BASF Group,
­together with a description of the principal opportunities
and risks associated with the expected development of the
BASF Group.

Auditor’s report

We have audited the consolidated financial statements
prepared by BASF SE, Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Germany,
comprising the statement of income, statement of income
and ­expense recognized in equity, balance sheet, statement
of cash flows, statement of equity and the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements together with the Group
Management’s Report for the business year from January 1 to
December 31, 2015. The preparation of the Consolidated
Finan­cial Statements and the Group Management’s Report in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union,
and the additional requirements of German commercial law
pursuant to Section 315a(1) of the German Commercial Code
(HGB) are the responsibility of the parent company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements and on the Group Management’s Report based on our audit. In addition, we have been
instructed to express an opinion as to whether the consoli­
dated financial statements comply with full IFRS.
We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Finan­
cial
Statements in accordance with Section 317 HGB and German
generally accepted standards for the audit of financial
statements promulgated by the Institute of Public Auditors
in Germany (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer, IDW). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit such
that misstatements materially affecting the presentation of
the net assets, financial position and results of operations in
the Consolidated Finan­
cial Statements in accordance with
the applicable financial reporting framework and in the
Group Management’s Report are detected with reasonable

assurance. Knowledge of the business activities and the
economic and legal environment of the Group and expectations as to possible misstatements are taken into account
in the determination of audit procedures. The effectiveness
of the accounting-related internal control system and the
evidence supporting the disclosures in the Consolidated
­
Finan­cial Statements and the Group Management’s Report
are examined primarily on a test basis within the framework of
the audit. The audit includes assessing the annual financial
statements of those entities included in consolidation, the
deter­mination of entities to be included in consolidation, the
accounting and consolidation principles used and significant
estimates made by the Board of Executive Directors, as well
as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
finan­cial statements and the group management report. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
Our audit has not led to any reservations.
In our opinion, based on the findings of our audit, the
consolidated financial statements comply with IFRSs as
­adopted by the E.U., the additional requirements of German
commercial law pursuant to Section 315a(1) HGB and full
IFRS and give a true and fair view of the net assets, financial
position and results of operations of the Group in accordance
with these requirements. The Group Management’s Report
is consistent with the Consolidated Finan­cial Statements and
as a whole provides a suitable view of the Group’s position
and suitably presents the opportunities and risks of future
development.

Consolidated Financial ­Statements 
Notes — Policies and scope of consolidation

BASF Report 2015

1 Summary of accounting policies
1.1

General information

BASF SE is a publicly listed corporation headquartered in
Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Germany. Its official address is
­Carl-Bosch-Str. 38, 67056 Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Germany.
The Consolidated Financial Statements of BASF SE as of
December 31, 2015, have been prepared in accordance with
the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) of the
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and Section
315a (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). IFRSs are
generally only applied after they have been endorsed by the
European Union. For the 2015 fiscal year, all of the binding
IFRSs and pronouncements of the International Financial
­Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) were applied.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in
euros. All amounts, including the figures for previous years, are
given in million euros unless otherwise indicated.
The individual financial statements of the consolidated
companies are prepared as of the balance sheet date of the
Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies
that have been applied are largely the same as those in 2014,
with the exception of any changes arising from the application
of new or revised standards.
In its meeting on February 22, 2016, the Board of ­Executive
Directors prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements,
submitted them to the Supervisory Board for approval, and
released them for publication.

1.2

Changes in accounting principles

Change in presentation of joint operation sales in BASF
Group Financial Statements
At its meeting on March 24, 2015, the IFRS Interpretation
Committee determined that, according to IFRS 11.20(d), a
joint operator’s share of the output purchased by another
partner cannot be recognized as revenue as long as these
sales correspond to the operator’s share of ownership interest
in the joint operation. As a consequence of this determination,
this portion of the joint operation’s sales to other partners
ceased to be recognized as of January 1, 2015. Partners’
share of the output purchased in excess of their ownership
interest will continue to be shown as sales to third parties in
the BASF Group Financial Statements. Sales by the joint
opera­tion to BASF Group companies will also continue to be
eliminated.
Sales revenue for 2014 contained sales of €415 million
that, according to the new recognition method, would have
been eliminated against cost of sales. If the recognition m
­ ethod
had remained unchanged, sales and cost of sales for 2015
would each have been €76 million higher. A restatement of the
prior-year figures was not necessary, as this change in recognition would have had no material impact on the presentation
of the net assets, financial position and results of operations of
the BASF Group in 2014.

Change in presentation of hedges for financial receivables
and payables in the statement of cash flows
The presentation in the statement of cash flows of hedges for
financial receivables and payables was adjusted as of
­January 1, 2015. Without changing cash provided by ­operating
activities, hedging is now better reflected by offsetting
­adjustment effects from underlying transactions with changes
in the market value of hedging transactions. The effects from
hedging transactions were previously contained in the item
“changes in receivables” and those from underlying transactions in the item “changes in pension provisions, defined benefit assets and other items.” The figures for 2014 have been
adjusted accor­dingly.
In 2014, this led to an increase of €76 million in the line
item changes in receivables and a decrease in the line item
changes in pension provisions, defined benefit assets and
other items in the amount of €76 million.
Changes in the measurement of emission right certificates
granted free of charge
To improve the presentation of net assets and the financial
position, the measurement of emission right certificates
­granted free of charge was conducted according to the net
method for the first time as of December 31, 2015. According
to this method, emission right certificates are no longer
­recognized at the applicable market prices (fair value) at the
time they are credited to the electronic register run by the
­relevant governmental authority, but are recognized on the
balance sheet with a value of zero. Accordingly, the counter
items (deferred income and provisions for emission right certificates) are also reported with a value of zero. The conversion
from gross method to the net method led to balance sheet
contraction in the amount of €153 million with no effect on
­income.
IFRSs and IFRICs not yet to be considered
The effects on the BASF Group financial statements of the
­IFRSs and IFRICs not yet in force or not yet endorsed by the
European Union in 2015 were reviewed and are explained
below. Other new standards or interpretations and amendments of existing standards and interpretations have no
­material impact on the BASF Group. Early adoption of the
standards before endorsement by the European Union is not
planned.
IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments
On July 24, 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 –
Financial Instruments, concluding the multiyear project to
replace IAS 39 – Financial Instruments: Recognition and
­
Measurement. IFRS 9 contains new requirements for the
­
classification and measurement of financial instruments,
­
­fundamental changes regarding the accounting treatment of
financial asset impairments, and a reformed approach to
hedge accounting.

BASF Report 2015 

IFRS 9 retains “amortized cost” and “fair value” as the criteria
for measuring financial instruments. Whether financial assets
are measured at amortized cost or fair value will depend on
two factors: the entity’s business model for managing the
portfolio to which the financial asset belongs and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.
In the future, the recognition of financial asset impairments
is based on expected losses according to IFRS 9. The general
approach adopts a three-stage model to assess the provisions
for risks. The model requires different degrees of impairment
based on the credit default risk of the counterparties. For
certain financial instruments, such as trade accounts
­
­receivable, operational simplifications for recognizing impairment losses apply.
The IFRS 9 regulations on hedge accounting aim for a
closer alignment of hedge accounting with the entity’s risk
management strategy.
The new standard will be effective for reporting periods
beginning on or after January 1, 2018. An endorsement by the
European Union is still pending. The new requirements could
have an impact on the accounting treatment of other shareholdings. The further potential impact on BASF is currently
being ­analyzed.
IFRS 15 – Revenues from Contracts with Customers
The IASB published the new standard on revenue recognition,
IFRS 15 – Revenues from Contracts with Customers, on May 28,
2014. The revised standard particularly aims to ­standardize
exis­ting regulations and thus improve trans­parency and the
comparability of financial information. The rules and definitions
of IFRS 15 supersede the content of IAS 11, IAS 18, IFRIC 13,
IFRIC 15, IFRIC 18, and SIC 31.
The new standard does not differentiate between different
types of contracts and services, but rather introduces uniform
criteria for the timing of revenue recognition. According to
IFRS 15, sales revenue is recognized when control of the
agreed-upon goods or services and the benefits obtainable
from them are transferred to the customer. The transfer of
major risks and rewards of ownership of the goods is no longer
the deciding factor. Sales revenue is measured as the amount
the entity expects to receive in exchange for goods and
­services.
The new model for the determination of revenue recognition is based on five steps, whereby the contract with the
customer and the individual performance obligations within
the contract are initially identified. The transaction price is then
determined and allocated to the performance obligations in
the contract. Finally, sales are recognized for each performance obligation in the amount of the allocated portion of the
transaction price as soon as the agreed-upon good or service
has been provided or the customer receives control over it.
Principles are set out for determining whether the good or
service has been provided over time or at one point in time.

Consolidated Financial S
­ tatements
Notes — Policies and scope of consolidation

The new standard will be effective for reporting periods
­beginning on or after January 1, 2018. An endorsement by the
European Union is still pending. The potential impact on BASF
is currently being analyzed.
IFRS 16 – Leasing
The IASB published standard IFRS 16 Leases on January 13,
2016. The rules and definitions of IFRS 16 supersede the
content of IAS 17, IFRIC 4, SIC 15 and SIC 27. The new
standard introduces a single lessee accounting model. It
­
requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities for all
­
­leases with a term of more than twelve months, unless the
underlying asset is of low value. As for the lessor, the new
standard substantially carries forward the lessor accounting
requirements of IAS 17. The new standard will be effective for
reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. An
endorsement by the European Union is still pending. The
­potential impact on BASF is currently being analyzed.
Disclosure Initiative (Amendments to IAS 1)
On December 18, 2014, the IASB issued amendments made
to IAS 1. The revisions pertain to various disclosure requirements, and clarify that information needs to be disclosed in the
notes only if it is material for the company. This explicitly
­applies if a standard calls for a list of minimum disclosures.
Explanations are moreover provided on the aggregation and
disaggregation of line items in the balance sheet and ­income
statement. Furthermore, the revised standard clarifies how an
entity’s share of the other comprehensive income of equity-­
accounted companies is to be presented in the income statement. The changes will be effective for reporting periods
begin­ning on or after January 1, 2016. An endorsement by the
European Union was issued on December 19, 2015. The
amendments are not expected to have a material effect on
BASF.
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of
Accep­table Methods of Depreciation and Amortization
The IASB issued amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 on
May 12, 2014. These revisions provide further guidance on
determining an acceptable method of depreciation and
­amortization. Revenue-based methods are not permissible for
property, plant and equipment and are only permissible for
intangible assets in specific exceptional cases (rebuttable
presumption of inappropriateness). The changes will be effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1,
2016. The European Union’s endorsement was issued on
December 3, 2015. The amendments are not expected to
have a material effect on BASF.

Notes — Policies and scope of consolidation

Amendments to IAS 19 – Employee Contributions to
­Defined Benefit Plans
The IASB issued amendments to IAS 19 on November 11,
2013. The revisions clarify the requirements that relate to how
contributions from employees or third parties that are linked to
service should be attributed to periods of service. In addition,
practical expedients are permitted if the amount of the contributions is independent of the number of years of service. The
European Union endorsed the changes on January 9, 2015. In
a deviation from the IASB’s effective date (reporting periods
beginning on or after July 1, 2014), IFRS-based financial
­statements of the European Union must apply the changes for
reporting periods beginning on or after February 1, 2015. The
amendments are not expected to have a material effect on
BASF.
Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 – Sale or Contribution
of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint
Venture
The IASB issued amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 on
September 11, 2014. The amendments address a known
inconsistency between the requirements of IFRS 10 and
­
IAS 28 (2011) in the case of the sale of an asset to an
­associated company or a joint venture or the contribution of an
asset to an associated company or a joint venture. According
to IFRS 10, if the disposal of a subsidiary by a parent company
results in a loss of control, it recognizes the gain or loss on the
sale of the subsidiary in the full amount in the income statement. In contrast, the currently applicable IAS 28.28 requires
that a gain on sales transactions between an investor and an
investment accounted for using the equity method – whether
it be an associated company or joint venture – is recognized
only to the extent of the investor’s interests in the associated
company or joint venture. In the future, the entire gain or loss
arising from a transaction shall only be recognized when the
assets sold or contributed constitute a business combination
according to IFRS 3. This applies regardless of whether the
transaction is a share or asset deal. Only a pro rata recognition
of gain is permissible if the assets do not constitute a business
combination. IASB has postponed the effective date of the
changes indefinitely. The potential impact on BASF is cur­rently
being analyzed.
Amendments to IFRS 11 – Accounting for Acquisitions of
Interests in Joint Operations
The IASB issued amendments to IFRS 11 on May 6, 2014.
IFRS 11 includes regulations on the recognition of assets and
liabilities and gains or losses of joint ventures and joint operations. Whereas joint ventures are accounted for using the​​
­equity method, joint operations, according to IFRS 11, are
recognized in a similar fashion to proportional consolidation.
With the changes in IFRS 11, IASB regulates the accounting
for the acquisition of shares in a joint operation, which constitutes a business according to IFRS 3 – Business Combinations.
In such cases, the acquirer shall apply the principles of the
­accounting for business combinations according to IFRS 3.

BASF Report 2015

Furthermore, the disclosure requirements in IFRS 3 also apply
in such cases. The changes will be effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016. An endorsement
by the European Union was issued on November 25, 2015.
The amendments are not expected to have a material effect
on BASF.
IFRS Annual Improvements Cycle 2010–2012
Under its Annual Improvement Project, the IASB issued
amendments to several standards on December 12, 2013.
The affected standards are IFRS 2, IFRS 3, IFRS 8, IAS 16,
IAS 24, and IAS 38. The amendments address details of the
recognition, measurement and disclosure of business trans­
actions or serve to standardize terminology. The European
Union endorsed the changes on January 9, 2015. In a deviation from the IASB’s effective date (reporting periods beginning
on or after July 1, 2014), IFRS-based financial statements in
the European Union must apply the changes for reporting
­periods beginning on or after February 1, 2015. The amendments are not expected to have a material effect on BASF.
IFRS Annual Improvements Cycle 2012–2014
Under its Annual Improvement Project, the IASB issued
amendments to several standards on September 25, 2014.
The affected standards are IAS 19, IAS 34, IFRS 5 and IFRS 7.
The amendments address details of the recognition, measurement and disclosure of business transactions or serve to
standardize terminology. The changes will be effective for
­reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016. An
endorsement by the European Union was issued on December 16, 2015. The amendments are not expected to have a
material effect on BASF.

1.3

Group accounting principles

Scope of consolidation: The scope of consolidation is based
on the application of the standards IFRS 10 and 11.
According to IFRS 10, a group consists of a parent entity
and the subsidiaries controlled by the parent. “Control” of an
investee assumes the simultaneous fulfillment of the following
three criteria:
––The parent company holds decision-making power over the
relevant activities of the investee,
––The parent company has rights to variable returns from the
investee, and
––The parent company can use its decision-making power to
affect the variable returns.
Based on corporate governance and potential supplementary
agreements, companies are analyzed for their relevant activities and variable returns, and the link between the variable
­returns and the extent to which their relevant activities could
be influenced.

BASF Report 2015 

According to IFRS 11, which regulates the accounting of joint
arrangements, a distinction must be made between joint
­ventures and joint operations. In the case of a joint venture, the
parties that have joint control of a legally independent c
­ ompany
have rights to the net assets of that arrangement. In joint
­operations, the parties that have joint control have direct rights
to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the
arrangement. This requirement is particularly fulfilled if the
production output of the joint arrangement is almost entirely
transferred to the partners, through which the partners guarantee the joint arrangements’ ongoing financing.
Companies whose corporate governance structures
­classify them as joint arrangements are analyzed to determine
if they meet the criteria for joint ventures or joint operations as
per IFRS 11. This requires an analysis of the joint arrangement’s structure and, if the arrangement is structured through
a separate vehicle, its legal form, contractual arrangements
and all other facts and circumstances are reviewed.
Consolidation: In addition to BASF SE, the Consolidated
Financial Statements include all material subsidiaries on a fully
consolidated and all material joint operations on a proportionally consolidated basis. Companies whose business is dormant or of low volume, and are of secondary importance for
the presentation of a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations, are not consolidated,
but rather are reported under other shareholdings. These
companies are carried at amortized cost and are written down
in the case of an impairment. The aggregate assets and equity
of these companies amount to less than 1% of the corresponding value at the Group level.
Joint ventures and associated companies are accounted
for using the equity method in the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Associated companies are entities in which
­significant influence can be exercised over their operating and
financial policies and which are not subsidiaries, joint ventures
or joint operations. In general, this applies to companies in
which BASF has an investment of between 20% and 50%.
Equity-accounted income is reported as part of income from
operations (EBIT).
Consolidation methods: Assets and liabilities of con­
solidated companies are uniformly recognized and measured
in accordance with the principles described herein. For
­equity-accounted companies, material deviations in measurement resulting from the application of other accounting
­principles are adjusted for.
Transactions between consolidated companies as well as
intercompany profits resulting from trade between consoli­
dated companies are eliminated in full; for joint operations,
they are proportionally eliminated. Material intercompany
profits related to companies accounted for using the equity
method are eliminated.

Consolidated Financial S
­ tatements
Notes — Policies and scope of consolidation

Capital consolidation is conducted at the acquisition date
­according to the purchase method. Initially, all assets, liabilities
and additional intangible assets that are to be capitalized are
measured at fair value. Finally, the acquisition cost is compared with the proportional share of the net assets acquired at
fair value. The resulting positive differences are capitalized as
goodwill. Negative differences are reviewed once more, then
recognized directly in the income statement.
The incidental acquisition costs of a business combination
are recognized in the income statement under other operating
expenses.
Foreign currency translations: The cost of assets
acquired in foreign currencies and revenue from sales in
­
­foreign currencies are determined by the exchange rate on the
date of the transaction. Foreign currency receivables and
liabilities are valued at the exchange rates on the balance
­
sheet date. Changes in assets and liabilities arising from
foreign currency translation are recognized in the income
­
statement and reported under other operating expenses or
income, other financial result, and available-for-sale financial
assets in other comprehensive income.
Translation of foreign currency financial statements:
The translation of foreign currency financial statements
depends on the functional currency of the consolidated
­
­companies. For companies whose functional currency is not
the euro but a local currency, translation into the reporting
currency is based on the closing rate ­method: Balance sheet
items are translated into euros using closing rates on the
­balance sheet date; expenses and income are translated into
euros at monthly average rates and a
­ ccumulated for the year.
The difference between a company’s translated equity at
historical rates at the time of acquisition and its equity at
­
­closing rates on the balance sheet date is r­eported separately
in equity under other comprehensive ­
income (translation
adjustments) and is recognized in income only upon the
­
­company’s disposal.
For certain companies outside the eurozone or U.S. dollar
zone, the euro or U.S. dollar is the functional currency. In such
cases the translation into the functional currency of financial
statements prepared in the local currency is done according to
the temporal method: All nonmonetary assets and related
depreciation and amortization as well as equity are translated
at the exchange rate applying to the respective transactions.
All other balance sheet items are translated using closing rates
on the balance sheet date; other expenses and income are
translated at monthly average rates. The resulting translation
differences are recognized in the income statement under
other operating income or expenses. If necessary, financial
statements in the functional currency are translated into the
presentation currency according to the closing rate method.

Accounting policies

Revenue recognition
Revenues from the sale of goods or the rendering of services
are recognized upon the transfer of ownership and risk to the
buyer. They are measured at the fair value of the consideration
received. Sales revenues are reported without sales tax.
­Expected rebates and other trade discounts are accrued or
deducted. Provisions are recognized according to the principle
of individual measurement to cover probable risks related to
the return of products, future warranty obligations and other
claims.
Revenues from the sale of precious metals to industrial
customers as well as revenues from natural gas trading are
recognized at the time of shipment and the corresponding
purchase prices are recorded at cost of sales. In the trading of
precious metals and their derivatives with broker-traders,
where there is usually no physical delivery, revenues are netted
against their corresponding costs. Revenues from marketing
the natural gas from the Yuzhno Russkoye gas field are treated
in the same manner.
Income relating to the sale or licensing of technologies or
technological expertise are recognized in the income statement according to the contractually agreed-upon transfer of
the rights and obligations associated with those technologies.
Assets
Acquired intangible assets (excluding goodwill) with defined
useful lives are valued at cost less scheduled straight-line
­amortization. The useful life is determined using the period of
the underlying contract or the period of time over which the
­intangible asset can be expected to be used.

Impairments are recognized if the recoverable amount of the
asset is lower than the carrying amount. The recoverable
amount is the higher of either fair value less costs to sell or the
value in use. The value in use is determined on the basis of
­future cash inflows and outflows and the weighted average cost
of capital after taxes, depending on tax rates and country-­
related risks. If the reasons for an impairment no longer exist,
the write-downs are reversed up to the value of the asset, had
an impairment not been recognized. Depending on the type
of intangible asset, amortization is reported under cost of
sales, selling expenses, research expenses or other operating
expenses.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are trade names
and trademarks that have been acquired as part of acquisitions.
These are measured at cost and tested for impairment annually,
or if there is an indication that their value has declined.
Internally generated intangible assets primarily comprise internally developed software. Such software and other
internally generated assets are measured at cost and
­amortized over their estimated useful lives. Impairments are
­recognized if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the
recoverable amount. In addition to those costs directly
­
­attributable to the asset, costs of internally generated intan­
gible assets also include an appropriate portion of overhead
costs. Borrowing costs are capitalized to the extent that they
apply to the purchase or the period of construction of qualifying assets.
The estimated useful lives and amortization methods of
intangible assets are based on historical values, plans and
estimates. These estimates also consider the period and
­distribution of future cash inflows and outflows. The amortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at
each balance sheet date. The weighted average amortization
periods of i­ntangible assets amounted to:

Emission rights: Emission right certificates, granted free of
charge by the German Emissions Trading Authority (Deutsche
Emissionshandelsstelle) or a similar authority in other countries, are recognized on the balance sheet with a value of zero.
Certificates purchased on the market are capitalized at cost as
intangible assets. Emissions generated create an obligation to
surrender the emission certificates. Emission certificates
­purchased on the market are subsequently measured at fair
value, up to a maximum of the amount of the acquisition costs.
If the fair value is lower than the carrying amount on the
­balance sheet date, the emission rights are impaired.

Goodwill is only written down if there is an impairment.
­Impairment testing takes place once a year and whenever
there is an indication of an impairment.
Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost
less depreciation and impairment over their useful lives. The
revaluation method is not applied. Low-value assets are fully
written off in the year of acquisition.
The cost of self-constructed plants includes direct costs,
appropriate allocations of material and manufacturing costs,
and a share of the general administrative costs of the divisions
involved in the construction of the plants. Borrowing costs are
capitalized to the extent that they apply to the purchase or the
period of construction of qualifying assets.
Expenditures related to the scheduled maintenance of
large-scale plants are separately capitalized and depreciated
using the straight-line method over the period until the next
planned turnaround. Costs for the replacement of components
are recognized as assets when an additional future benefit is
expected. The carrying amount of the replaced components is
derecognized. Costs for maintenance and repair as part of
normal business operations are recognized as an expense.
Both movable and immovable fixed assets are for the most
part depreciated using the straight-line method, with the
­exception of production licenses and plants in the Oil & Gas
segment, which are primarily depreciated based on use in
accordance with the unit of production method. The estimated
useful lives and depreciation methods applied are based on
historical values, plans and estimates. These estimates also
consider the period and distribution of future cash inflows and
outflows. The depreciation methods, useful lives and residual
values are ­reviewed at each balance sheet date. The weighted
average depreciation periods were as follows:

Impairments are recognized if the recoverable amount of the
asset is lower than the carrying amount. The measurement is
based on fair value less costs to sell or the value in use. The
value in use is determined on the basis of future cash inflows
and outflows, and the weighted average cost of capital after
taxes, depending on tax rates and country-related risks. An
impairment is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount. If the reasons for an
impairment no longer exist, the write-downs are reversed up to
the value of the asset, had an impairment not been recognized.

Investment properties held to realize capital gains or rental
­income are immaterial. They are valued at the lower of fair value
or acquisition cost less depreciation.
Leases: A lease is an agreement whereby the lessor
­conveys to the lessee the right to use an asset for an agreed
period of time in return for a payment or series of payments.
Leasing contracts are classified as either finance or operating
leases.
Assets subject to operating leases are not capitalized.
Lease payments are recognized in the income statement in
the period they are incurred.
A lease is classified as a finance lease if it substantially
transfers all the risks and rewards related to the leased asset.
Assets subject to a finance lease are capitalized at the lower of
the fair value of the leased assets or the present value of the
minimum lease payments. A leasing liability is recorded in the
same amount. The periodic lease payments must be divided
into principal and interest components. The principal component reduces the outstanding liability, while the interest component represents an interest expense. Depreciation takes
place over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the
­period of the lease.
Leases can be embedded within other contracts. If separation is required under IFRS, then the embedded lease is
­recorded separately from its host contract and each component of the contract is carried and measured in accordance
with the applicable regulations.  	
Borrowing costs: Borrowing costs directly incurred as part
of the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying
­asset are capitalized as part of the acquisition or production
cost of that asset. A qualifying asset is an asset for which the
time period necessary to make it ready for its intended use or
sale is longer than one year. Borrowing costs are capitalized up
to the date the asset is ready for its intended use. The borrowing
costs were calculated based on a rate of 3.0% (2014: 4.0%),
adjusted on a country-specific basis. All other borrowing costs
are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are
incurred.
Government grants: Government grants related to the
acquisition or construction of property, plant and equipment
reduce the acquisition or construction cost of the respective
assets. Other government grants or government assistance
are recognized immediately as other operating income or
treated as deferred income and reversed over the underlying
period.
Investments accounted for using the equity-method:
The carrying amounts of these companies are adjusted
­annually based on the pro rata share of net income, dividends
and other changes in equity. Should there be indications of a
permanent reduction in the value of an investment, an impairment is recognized in the income statement.

Consolidated Financial ­Statements 
Notes — Policies and scope of consolidation

Inventories are measured at acquisition cost or cost of conversion based on the weighted average method. If the market
price or fair value of the sales product which forms the basis
for the net realizable value is lower, then the sales products are
written down to this lower value. The net realizable value is the
estimated price in the ordinary course of business less the
estimated costs of completion and the estimated selling costs.
In addition to direct costs, cost of conversion includes an
appropriate allocation of production overhead costs based on
normal utilization rates of the production plants, provided that
they are related to the production process. Pensions, social
services and voluntary social benefits are also included, as
well as allocations for administrative costs, provided they
­relate to the production. Borrowing costs are not included in
cost of conversion.
Inventories may be written down if the prices for the sales
products decline, or in cases of a high rate of days sales of
inventory (DSI). Write-downs on inventories are reversed if the
reasons for them no l­onger apply.
The exception made by IAS 2 for traders is applied to the
measurement of precious metal inventories. Accordingly,
inven­
tories held exclusively for trading p
­ urposes are to be
measured at fair value less costs to sell. All changes in value
are recognized in the income statement.
Deferred taxes: Deferred taxes are recorded for temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and
liabilities in the financial statements and the carrying amounts
for tax purposes as well as for tax loss carryforwards and
­unused tax credits. This also comprises temporary differences
arising from business combinations, with the exception of
goodwill. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated
­using the respective country-specific tax rates applicable for
the period in which the asset or liability is realized or settled.
Tax rate changes enacted or substantively enacted on or
­before the balance sheet date are taken into consideration.
Deferred tax assets are offset against deferred tax liabilities
provided they are related to the same taxation authority and
have the same maturities. Surpluses of deferred tax assets are
only recognized provided that the tax benefits are likely to be
realized. The valuation of deferred tax assets is based on the
estimated probability of a reversal of the differences and the
ability to utilize tax loss carryforwards and unused tax credits.
This depends on whether future taxable profits will exist during
the period in which temporary differences are reversed and in
which tax loss carryforwards and unused tax credits can be
claimed. Based on experience and the expected development
of taxable income, it is assumed that the benefits of the recognized deferred tax assets will be realized. The valuation of
­deferred tax assets is based on internal projections of the
­future earnings of the particular Group company.

BASF Report 2015

Changes in deferred taxes in the balance sheet are recorded
as deferred tax expense or income if the underlying trans­
action is not to be recognized directly in equity or in income
and expenses recognized in equity. For those effects which
have been recognized in equity, changes to deferred tax
­assets and tax liabilities are also recognized directly in equity.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for differences
­between the proportional IFRS equity and the tax base of the
investment in a consolidated subsidiary if a reversal of these
differences is expected in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax
liabilities are recognized for dividend distributions which are
planned for the following year if these distributions lead to a
reversal of temporary differences.
For more information, see Note 11 from page 186 onward

Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized in the
balance sheet when the BASF Group becomes a party to a
financial instrument. Financial assets are derecognized when
the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset
expire or when the financial asset, with all risks and rewards of
ownership, is transferred. Financial liabilities are derecognized
when the contractual obligation expires, is discharged or cancelled. Regular way purchases and sales of financial instruments are accounted for using the settlement date; in precious
metals trading, the day of trading is used.
The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. When pricing on an active market is available, for example on a stock exchange, this price is used for
the measurement. Otherwise, the measurement is based on
internal measurement models using current market parameters or external measurements, for example, from banks.
These internal measurements predominantly use the net
present value method and option pricing models.
If there is objective evidence of a permanent impairment of
a financial instrument that is not measured at fair value through
profit or loss, an impairment loss is recognized. If the reason
for the impairment of loans and receivables as well as
held-to-maturity financial instruments no longer exists, the
impairment is reversed up to the amortized cost and recognized in the income statement. Impairments on financial
­instruments are booked in separate accounts.

BASF Report 2015 

Financial assets and liabilities are divided into the following
measurement categories:
––Financial assets and liabilities at fair value recognized in
the income statement consist of derivatives and other
trading instruments. At BASF, this measurement category
only includes derivatives. Derivatives are reported in other
receivables and miscellaneous assets or other liabilities.
BASF does not make use of the fair value option under
IAS 39. The calculation of fair values is based on market
parameters or measurement models based on such parameters. In some exceptional cases, the fair value is calculated
using parameters which are not observable on the market.
––Loans and receivables comprise financial assets with fixed
or determinable payments, which are not quoted on an
active market and are not derivatives or classified as
­
available-for-sale. This measurement category includes
­
trade accounts receivable as well as other receivables and
loans reported under other receivables and miscellaneous
assets. Initial measurement is done at fair value, which
­generally matches the nominal value of the receivable or
loan. Interest-free and low-interest long-term loans and
receivables are recorded at present value. Subsequent
­
­measurement recognized in income is generally made at
amortized cost using the effective interest method. ­	­
If there is objective evidence for an impairment of a receivable or loan, an individual valuation allowance is made.
When assessing the need for a valuation allowance, regional
and sector-specific conditions are considered. In addition,
use is made of internal and external ratings as well as the
assessments of debt collection agencies and credit insurers,
when available. A portion of receivables is covered by credit
insurance. Bank guarantees and letters of credit are used to
an insignificant extent. Valuation allowances are only recognized for those receivables which are not covered by insurance or other collateral. The valuation allowances for receivables whose insurance includes a deductible are not recognized in excess of the amount of the deductible. Write-downs
are based on historical values relating to customer solvency
and the age, period overdue, insurance policies and
customer-­specific risks. In addition, a valuation allowance
must be recognized when the contractual conditions which
form the basis for the receivable are changed through renegotiation in such a way that the present value of the future
cash flows decreases.
In addition, valuation allowances are made on receivables
based on transfer risks for certain countries.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the valuation
allow­
ance decreases and the decrease can be related
objec­tively to an event occurring after the valuation allowance was made, then it must be reversed in the income
statement. Reversals of valuation allowances may not
­exceed amortized cost. Loans and receivables are derecognized when they are definitively found to be uncollectible.

Consolidated Financial S
­ tatements
Notes — Policies and scope of consolidation

––Held-to-maturity financial assets consist of nonderivative
financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and a
fixed term, for which there is the ability and intent to hold
until maturity, and which do not fall under other valuation
categories. Initial measurement is done at fair value, which
matches the nominal value in most cases. Subsequent
­measurement is carried out at amortized cost, using the
­effective interest method.
For BASF, there are no material financial assets that fall
under this category.
–– Available-for-sale financial assets comprise financial assets
which are not derivatives and do not fall under any of the
previously stated valuation categories. This measurement
­
category comprises shareholdings reported under the item
other financial assets which are not accounted for using the
equity method as well as short and long-term securities.
The measurement is carried out at fair value. Changes in
fair value are recognized directly in equity under the item
other comprehensive income and are only recognized in the
income statement when the assets are disposed of or have
been impaired. Subsequent reversals are recognized directly
in equity (other comprehensive income). Only in the case of
debt instruments are reversals up to the amount of the
original impairment recognized in the income statement;
­
­reversals above this amount are recognized directly in equity.
If the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets drops
below acquisition costs, the assets are impaired if the d
­ ecline
in value is significant and can be considered lasting. The fair
values are determined using market prices. Shareholdings
whose fair value cannot be reliably determined are carried at
acquisition cost and are written down in the case of an
­impairment. When determining the value of these shareholdings, the acquisition costs constitute the best estimate of
their fair value. This category of shareholdings includes
investments in other shareholdings, provided that these
­
shares are not publicly traded. There are no plans to sell
significant stakes in these shareholdings.
––Financial liabilities which are not derivatives are initially
measured at fair value, which normally corresponds to the
amount received. Subsequent measurement is carried out at
amortized cost, using the effective interest method.
––Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on
hand and bank balances with maturities of less than three
months.
There were no reclassifications from one measurement category to another in 2015 and 2014. The same applies for
transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy.
Revenue from interest-bearing assets is recognized on the
outstanding receivables on the balance sheet date using interest rates calculated by means of the effective interest method.
Dividends from shareholdings not accounted for using the
equity method are recognized when the shareholders’ right to
receive payment is established.

Consolidated Financial ­Statements 
Notes — Policies and scope of consolidation

Derivative financial instruments can be embedded within other
contracts. If IFRS requires separation, then the embedded
derivative is accounted for separately from its host contract
and measured at fair value.
Financial guarantees of the BASF Group are contracts
that require compensation payments to be made to the
­guarantee holder if a debtor fails to make payment when due
under the terms of the financial guarantee. Financial guarantees given by BASF are measured at fair value upon initial
recognition. In subsequent periods, financial guarantees are
carried at the higher of amortized cost or the best estimate of
the present obligation on the financial reporting date.
Cash flow hedge accounting is applied for selected
deals to hedge future transactions. The effective portion of the
change in fair value of the derivative is thereby recognized
­directly in equity under other comprehensive income, taking
deferred taxes into account. The ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the income statement. In the case of
­future transactions that will lead to a nonfinancial asset or a
nonfinancial debt, the cumulative fair value changes in equity
are either charged against the acquisition costs on initial
recognition or recognized in profit or loss in the reporting
­
­period in which the hedged item is recorded in the income
statement. For hedges based on financial assets or debts, the
cumulative fair value changes of the hedges are transferred
from equity to the income statement in the reporting period in
which the hedged item is recognized in the income statement.
The maturity of the hedging instrument is determined based
on the effective date of the future transaction.
When fair value hedges are used, the asset or liability is
hedged against the risk of a change in fair value. Here, c
­ hanges
in the market value of the derivative financial instruments are
recognized in the income statement. Furthermore, the carrying
amount of the underlying transaction is adjusted by the profit
or loss resulting from the hedged risk, offsetting the effect in
the income statement.
The derivatives employed by BASF for hedging purposes
are effective hedges from an economic point of view. Changes
in the fair value of the derivatives almost completely offset the
changes in the value of the underlying transactions.
Other comprehensive income
The income and expenses shown in other comprehensive
income are divided into two categories. Items that will be
­
­recognized in the income statement in the future (known as
“recycling”) and those that will not. The first category includes
translation adjustments, the measurement of securities at fair
value, and changes in the fair value of derivatives held to
hedge future cash flows and net investments in a foreign
­operation. Items in other comprehensive income that will not
be reclassified to the income statement at a future date include
effects from the remeasurement of defined benefit plans.

BASF Report 2015

Debt
Provisions for pensions and similar obligations: Provisions
for pensions are based on actuarial computations made
­according to the projected unit credit method, which applies
valuation parameters that include: future developments in
compensation, pensions and inflation, employee turnover and
the life expectancy of beneficiaries. The resulting obligations
are discounted on the balance sheet date using the market
yields on high-quality corporate fixed-rate bonds with a
­minimum of one AA rating.
Similar obligations, especially those arising from commitments by North American Group companies to pay the
­healthcare costs and life insurance premiums of retired staff
and their dependents, are reported under provisions for similar
obligations.
The calculation of pension provisions is based on actuarial
reports.
Actuarial gains and losses from changed estimations with
regard to the actuarial assumptions used for calculating
­defined benefit obligations, the difference between standardized and actual returns on plan assets as well as the effects of
the asset ceiling are recognized directly in equity as other
comprehensive income.
For more information on provisions for pensions and similar obligations,
see Note 22 from page 199 onward

Other provisions: Other provisions are recognized when there
is a present obligation as a result of a past event and when
there is a probable outflow of resources whose amount can be
reliably estimated. Provisions are recognized at the probable
settlement value.
Provisions for German trade income tax, German corporate income tax and similar income taxes are determined and
recognized in the amount necessary to meet the expected
payment obligations less any prepayments that have been
made. Other taxes to be assessed are considered accor­
dingly.
Provisions are established for certain environmental
­protection measures and risks if there exist present legal or
constructive obligations arising from a past event, and the
expected cash outflow can be estimated with sufficient
reliability. Provisions for restoration obligations primarily
­
concern the filling of wells and the removal of production
­
­facilities upon the termination of production in the Oil & Gas
segment. When the obligation arises, the provision is measured at the present value of the future restoration costs. An
asset is capitalized for the same amount as part of the carrying
amount of the plant concerned and is depreciated along with
the plant. The discount on the provision is unwound annually
until the time of the planned restoration.

BASF Report 2015 

Other provisions also include expected charges for the rehabilitation of contaminated sites, the recultivation of landfills, the
removal of environmental contamination at existing production
or storage facilities and other similar measures. If BASF is the
only responsible party that can be identified, the provision
covers the entire expected claim. At sites operated together
with one or more partners, the provision generally covers only
BASF’s share of the expected claim. The determination of the
amount of the provision is based on the available technical
­information on the site, the technology used, legal regulations,
and official obligations.
Provisions are recognized for expected severance payments or similar personnel expenses as well as for demolition
expenses and other charges related to restructuring measures
that have been planned and publicly announced by management.
Provisions for long-service and anniversary bonuses are
predominantly calculated based on actuarial principles. For
contracts signed under the early retirement programs,
­approved supplemental payments are accrued in installments
until the end of the exemption phase at the latest. Accounting
and measurement follow the German Accounting Standards
Committee e.V.’s Application Note 1 (IFRS) of December 2012.
Other provisions also cover risks resulting from legal disputes and proceedings, provided the criteria for recognizing a
provision are fulfilled. In order to determine the amount of the
provisions, the Company takes into consideration the facts
related to each case, the size of the claim, claims awarded in
similar cases and independent expert advice as well as
­assumptions regarding the probability of a successful claim
and the range of possible claims. The actual costs can deviate
from these estimates.
For more information, see Note 26 from page 209 onward

The probable amount required to settle noncurrent provisions is discounted if the effect of discounting is material. In
this case, the provision is recognized at present value.
­Assumptions must be made in determining the discount rate
used for calculating noncurrent provisions. Financing costs
related to unwinding the discount on provisions in subsequent
periods are shown in other financial result.
Other accounting policies
Business combinations: In business combinations, the
­acquired assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value on
the date the acquirer effectively obtains control. The fair value
of acquired assets and assumed liabilities at the date of
­exchange, as well as the useful lives of the acquired assets,
are determined on the basis of assumptions. The measurement is largely based on projected cash flows. The actual cash
flows can differ significantly from the cash flows used to
­determine the fair values. Independent external appraisals
are used for the purchase price allocation of business combinations. Valuations in the course of business combinations are
based on existing information as of the acquisition date.

Groups of assets and liabilities held for disposal or disposal groups: These comprise those assets and directly
­associated liabilities shown on the balance sheet whose sale
in the context of a single transaction is highly probable. The
assets and liabilities of disposal groups are recognized at the
lower of the sum of their carrying amounts or fair value less
costs to sell; this does not apply to assets which do not fall
under the valuation principles of IFRS 5. Scheduled depreciation of noncurrent assets and the use of the equity method are
suspended.
Oil and gas production: Exploration and development
expenditures are accounted for using the successful efforts
method. Under this method, costs of successful exploratory
drilling as well as successful and dry development wells are
capitalized.
An exploration well is a well located outside of an area with
proven oil and gas reserves. A development well is a well
which is drilled to the depth of a reservoir of oil or gas within an
area with proven reserves.
Exploratory drilling is generally reported under construction
in progress until its success can be determined. When the
presence of hydrocarbons is proven such that the economic
development of the field is probable, the costs remain capitalized as suspended well costs. At least once a year, all suspended wells are assessed from an economic, technical and
strategic viewpoint to see if development is still intended. If this
is not the case, the capitalized costs for the well in question
are impaired. When reserves are proven, the exploration wells
are reclassified as machinery and technical equipment when
production begins.
Production costs include all costs incurred to operate,
­repair and maintain the wells as well as the associated plant
and ancillary production equipment, including the associated
depreciation.
The unit of production method is used to depreciate assets
from oil and gas production at the field or reservoir level.
­Depreciation is generally calculated on the basis of the production of the period in relation to the proven, developed
­reserves.
Exploration expenses pertain exclusively to the Oil & Gas
segment and include all costs related to areas with unproven
oil or gas deposits. These include costs for the exploration of
areas with possible oil or gas deposits, among others. Costs
for geological and geophysical investigations are always
­reported under exploration expenses. In addition, this item
includes valuation allowances for capitalized expenses for
­
­exploration wells which did not encounter proven reserves.
Depreciation of successful exploratory drilling is reported
­under cost of sales.

Consolidated Financial ­Statements 
Notes — Policies and scope of consolidation

An Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement is a type of
contract in crude oil and gas concessions whereby the
­expenses and profits from the exploration, development and
production phases are divided between the state and one or
more exploration and production companies using defined
keys. The revenue BASF is entitled to under such contracts is
reported as sales.
The intangible asset from the marketing contract for ­natural
gas from the Yuzhno Russkoye natural gas field is amortized
based on BASF’s share of the produced and distributed
­volumes.
Intangible assets in the Oil & Gas segment relate primarily
to exploration and production rights. During the exploration
phase, these are not subject to scheduled amortization but are
tested for impairment annually. When economic success is
determined, the rights are amortized in accordance with the
unit of production method.
Use of estimates and assumptions in the preparation of
the Consolidated Financial Statements
The carrying amount of assets, liabilities and provisions,
contingent liabilities and other financial obligations in the
­
Consolidated Financial Statements depends on the use of
­
estimates, assumptions and use of discretionary scope.
Specific estimates or assumptions used in individual
­
accounting or valuation methods are disclosed in their
­
­respective sections. They are based on the circumstances and
estimates on the balance sheet date and affect the reported
amounts of income and expenses during the reporting
­periods. These assumptions particularly concern discounted
cash flows in the context of impairment tests and purchase
price allocations; the determination of useful lives of property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets; the carrying
amount of investments; and the measurement of provisions for
such things as employee benefits, warranties, trade discounts,
­environmental protection and taxes. Although uncertainty is
appropriately incorporated in the valuation factors, actual
­results can differ from these estimates.
The assumptions for oil and gas prices concern internal
company projections. The projections are based on an
­empirical analysis of the global oil and gas supply and ­demand.
Short-term estimates up to three years consider the current
prices on active markets or forward transactions. In long-term
estimates, assumptions are made regarding factors such as
inflation, production quantities and costs as well as energy
efficiency and the substitution of energy sources. Using external sources and ­reports, the oil and gas price estimates are
regularly checked for plausibility.

BASF Report 2015

Impairment tests on assets are carried out whenever certain
triggering events indicate that an impairment may be necessary. External triggering events include, for example, changes
in customer industries, technologies used and economic
downturns. Internal triggering events for an impairment test
include lower product profitability, planned restructuring measures or physical damage to assets.
Impairment tests are based on a comparison of the carrying amount and the recoverable amount. The recoverable
amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the
value in use. Value in use is generally determined using the
discounted cash flow method. The estimation of cash flows
and the assumptions used consider all information available
on the respective balance sheet date on the future development of the operating business. Actual future developments
may vary. Impairment testing relies upon the cash-generating
unit’s long-term earnings forecasts, which are based on
economic trends. The weighted average cost of capital
­
(WACC) based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model plays an
important role in impairment testing. It comprises a risk-free
rate, the market risk premium and the spread for the credit
risk. Additional important assumptions are the forecasts for
the detailed planning period and the terminal growth rates
used.
For more information, see Note 14 from page 189 onward

An impairment is recognized if the recoverable amount of
the asset is lower than the carrying amount. The impairment of
the asset (excluding goodwill) is made in the amount of the
difference between these amounts.
The goodwill impairment test is based on cash-generating
units. At BASF, the cash-generating units are predominantly
the business units, or in certain cases, the divisions. If there is
a need for a valuation allowance, the existing goodwill is, if
necessary, completely written off as a first step. If there is
­further need for a valuation allowance, this is allocated to the
remaining assets of the cash-generating unit. Goodwill
impairments are reported under other operating expenses.
­
Impairment reversals are not conducted for ­goodwill.

2.1

Changes in scope of consolidation

In 2015, the scope of consolidation for the Consolidated
Financial Statements encompassed 258 companies (2014:
­
281). Of this number, five companies were first-time con­
solidations (2014: four). Since the beginning of 2015, a total of
28 companies (2014: 32) were deconsolidated due to
­divestiture, merger, liquidation or immateriality.
First-time consolidations in 2015 comprised:
––A newly acquired company headquartered in Japan
––An additional four companies which had previously not been
consolidated, headquartered in Germany, China, India and
Pakistan

First-time consolidations in 2014 comprised:
––Two newly established companies with headquarters in
Germany and China
––Two additional companies which had previously not been
consolidated, headquartered in Germany and Peru
While BASF does not hold majority shares in ZAO Gazprom
YRGM Trading, BASF is entitled to the earnings of the c
­ ompany
due to profit distribution arrangements, so that the company is
fully consolidated in the Group Consolidated Financial
­Statements.
A list of companies included in the Consolidated Financial
Statements and a list of all companies in which BASF SE has
a shareholding as required by Section 313(2) of the German
Commercial Code is provided in the List of Shares Held.

Joint operations

Proportionally consolidated joint operations particularly
­comprise:
––Ellba C.V., Rotterdam, Netherlands, which is operated
­jointly with Shell and produces propylene oxide and styrene
­monomer
––BASF DOW HPPO Production B.V.B.A., Antwerp, Belgium,
which is operated jointly with The Dow Chemical Company
to produce propylene oxide
––AO Achimgaz, Novy Urengoy, Russia, which is jointly
­operated with Gazprom for the production of natural gas
and condensate
BASF holds a 50% share in each of these companies and
controls them jointly with the respective partner. The companies sell their products directly to the partners. The partners
ensure the ongoing financing of the companies by purchasing
the production. They were therefore classified as joint operations in accordance with IFRS 11.
In the following table, the previous year’s income ­statement
and statement of cash flows include the share in Ellba Eastern

Noncurrent assets

A majority of the activities in the Oil & Gas segment’s Exploration & Production business sector take place through joint
activities which are not incorporated in separate companies.
This primarily r­elates to activities in Germany, Norway and
Argen­tina. These are generally accounted for as joint operations in accordance with IFRS 11 and contribute the largest
part of the sales, depreciation and amortization, and fixed
­assets in the Oil & Gas segment.

Equity-accounted associated companies particularly comprise:
––Achim Development, a limited liability company in Novy
Urengoy, Russia (BASF stake: 25.01%) and Achim Trading,
a closed joint stock company in Moscow, Russia (BASF
stake 18.01%, economic share 25.01%), which together
with Gazprom, develop and market the output from blocks
IV and V of the Achimov formation
––Wintershall AG, Kassel, Germany, which operates Libyan
exploration and production activities together with Gazprom
Libyen Verwaltungs GmbH (BASF stake: 51%). Despite an
investment of 51%, BASF does not exercise control according to IFRS 10, as contractual arrangements with the Libyan
government strictly limit influence on variable returns after
income taxes.
––Although BASF only has a 15.5% share in Nord Stream AG,
Zug, Switzerland, this was classified as associated ­company,
as BASF exercises significant influence over the company as
its approval is required for relevant board r­esolutions

BASF Report 2015 

––OAO Severneftegazprom, Krasnoselkup, Russia (BASF

––GASCADE Gastransport GmbH, Kassel, Germany (BASF
stake: 50.02%)
––NEL Gastransport GmbH, Kassel, Germany (BASF stake:

governance structure of
GASCADE Gastransport GmbH, Kassel, Germany, and NEL
Gastransport GmbH in connection with requirements of
Section 10 of the Energy Management Act (EnWG), BASF
only exercises significant influence over both companies,
despite an investment of more than 50%.

industries. BASF can now offer its customers complete
solutions for TPUs and TPU adhesives. At BASF, the activities have been integrated in the Performance Materials
­division.
––On February 18, 2015, BASF took over technologies,
­patents and know-how for silver nanowires from Seashell
Technology LLC, based in San Diego, California. Through
this acquisition, BASF has extended its product portfolio for
displays in the Electronic Materials business unit, which is
part of the Monomers division.

Acquisitions and divestitures

Acquisitions
In 2015, BASF acquired the following activities:
––On February 12, 2015, BASF concluded the acquisition,
announced on December 8, 2014, of the business from
Taiwan Sheen Soon Co., Ltd. (TWSS), Lukang Town, Taiwan.
TWSS is a leading manufacturer of precursors for adhesives
based on thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU). Following
­receipt of the official approval, BASF also took over TWSS’s
activities on the Chinese mainland, effective December 1,
2015. The takeover consolidated BASF’s market position in
the areas of TPU extrusion and injection molding for various

Notes — Policies and scope of consolidation

––On February 24, 2015, BASF acquired a 66% share from
TODA KOGYO CORP., based in Hiroshima, Japan, in a
company to which TODA had contributed its business with
cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries, patents and production capacities in J­apan. The transaction had been
announ­ced on October 30, 2014. The company focuses
on the research, development, production, marketing and
sales of a number of cathode materials. At BASF, the activities were assigned to the Catalysts division.
––On March 31, 2015, BASF concluded the acquisition of the
polyurethane (PU) business from Polioles, S.A. de C.V.,
based in Lerma, Mexico, that was announced on July 10,
2014. Polioles is a joint venture with the Alpek Group. BASF
holds a 50% share, which is accounted for using the equity
method. The acquisition comprised marketing and selling
rights, current assets, and to a minor extent, production
­facilities. The business has been assigned to the Performance Materials division.
––On April 23, 2015, BASF concluded an agreement with
Lanxess Aktiengesellschaft, Cologne, Germany, on the
acqui­
sition and use of technologies and patents for the
production of high-molecular-weight polyisobutene (HM
PIB). The transaction furthermore included the acquisition of
selling rights and current assets as well as a manufacturing
agreement in which Lanxess will produce HM PIB exclu­sively
for BASF. The activities were allocated to the Performance
Chemicals division.
The purchase prices for businesses acquired in 2015 totaled
€224 million; as of December 31, 2015, payments made for
these amounted to €142 million. The purchase price allocations were carried out in accordance with IFRS 3. The resulting
goodwill amounted to €19 million. In the course of the acquisition from TODA, minority interests in the amount of €42 million
were recognized, measured at fair value. The purchase price
allocations consider all the facts and circumstances prevailing
as of the respective dates of acquisition which were known
prior to the preparation of the Consolidated F
­ inancial Statements. In accordance with IFRS 3, should f­urther facts and
circumstances become known within the 12-month evaluation
period, the purchase price allocation will be adjusted accor­
dingly.
In 2014, BASF acquired the following activities:
––On October 31, 2014, BASF completed the acquisition of a
2.5% share in the Brage production field in the Norwegian
North Sea from Tullow Oil Norge AS, Oslo, Norway, in the
Oil & Gas segment. With this acquisition, BASF increased its
investment in Brage to a total of 35.2%.
––On December 1, 2014, in its Oil & Gas segment, BASF
concluded the acquisition agreed upon with Statoil Petrol­
eum AS (Stavanger, Norway) on September 12, 2014, of
shares in the Gjøa (5%) and Vega (24.5%) production fields,
the Aasta Hansteen development project (24%), the Asterix
discovery (19%) and the Polarled pipeline project (13.2%), in
addition to four exploration l­icenses near Aasta Hansteen.

BASF Report 2015

Along with Gjøa and Vega, Aasta Hansteen – with Polarled
as its technical link to the European gas distribution network
– and Asterix were also classified as businesses according
to IFRS 3. Together with the exploration licenses, they were
measured in accordance with IFRS 3. The purchase price
amounted to $1.25 billion, or €1.0 billion. Furthermore, BASF
agreed to pay up to an addi­tional $50 million if the Aasta
Hansteen field is developed according to the project plan.
The preliminary purchase price allocation from the previous
year for the acquisition of assets from Statoil on December 1,
2014, was reviewed at the end of the 12-month evaluation
period as per IFRS 3; parts were adjusted on the basis of more
detailed information on the production and cost profiles of the
acquired fields and licenses. This led to a €74 million reduction
in n
­oncurrent assets to €1,089 million, and a €57 million
reduc­tion in noncurrent liabilities to €517 million. Furthermore,
the expected value of the payment obligation to Statoil in
connection with the development of the Aasta Hansteen field
was ­reduced by €10 million to zero. Taking into account a
cash-­
effective adjustment of €4 million, the total purchase
price was €961 million. The adjustments led to a total increase
of goodwill in the amount of €7 million to €590 million. The
goodwill recognized was nearly entirely due to deferred tax
liabilities.
The purchase price allocation in connection with the
­acquisition of a 2.5% stake in Brage from the previous year
was not adjusted.
The following overview shows the effects of the acquisitions
conducted in 2015 and 2014 on the Consolidated Financial
Statements. If acquisitions resulted in the transfer of assets or
the assumption of additional liabilities, these are shown as a
net impact.

Divestitures
In 2015, BASF divested the following activities:
––On March 31, 2015, BASF sold its white expan­dable polystyrene (EPS) business in North and South A
­ merica to Alpek
S.A.B. de C.V., Monterrey, Mexico. The sale comprised
customer lists and current assets in addition to production
facilities in Canada, Brazil, Argentina and the United States.
The disposed activities had been part of BASF’s Performance Materials division. The shares in ­Aislapol S.A., based
in Santiago de Chile, Chile, were also sold. Polioles, a joint
venture accounted for using the equity method, transferred
its white EPS business to Alpek.
––On June 30, 2015, BASF concluded the divestiture
­announced on October 16, 2014, of its global textile chemicals business to Archroma Textiles S.à r.l., Luxembourg. The
portfolio comprised products for pretreatment, printing and
coating. The transaction furthermore involved the transfer of
the subsidiary BASF Pakistan (Private) Ltd., based in K
­ arachi,
Pakistan, completed in the third quarter of 2015. The textile
chemicals business had been part of the Performance
Chemicals division.
––Effective July 1, 2015, BASF sold its 25% share in SolVin to
its partner, Solvay. SolVin was established in 1999 by Solvay
and BASF for the production of polyvinylchloride (PVC). At
BASF, the SolVin investment and the income associated
with it had been allocated to the Monomers division.
––On September 30, 2015, BASF concluded the agreed-upon
sale of portions of its pharmaceutical ingredients and
services business to Siegfried Holding AG, based in
­
­Zofingen, Switzerland. This involved the custom synthesis
business and parts of the active pharmaceutical ingredients
portfolio. The transaction comprised the divestiture of the
production sites in Minden, Germany; Evionnaz, Switzerland;
and Saint-Vulbas, France. At BASF, the activities had been
allocated to the Nutrition & Health division.

––On November 1, 2015, BASF divested its global paper
hydrous kaolin business to Imerys Kaolin, Inc., Roswell,
­
Georgia, as a
­ nnounced on June 8, 2015. The divestiture
­included the kaolin processing production site in Wilkinson
County, G
­ eorgia. For a limited period of time, BASF will take
care of the order production for the paper hydrous kaolin
business on behalf of Imerys, in order to smooth the transfer
for the customers. The activities at BASF had been allocated
to the Performance Chemicals division.
In the first-half and third quarter interim reports for 2015, an
agreement was reported with Tellus Petroleum AS, Oslo,
­Norway, to sell shares in several fields and exploration licenses
on the Norwegian continental shelf. On December 22, 2015,
BASF complied with the request from Tellus Petroleum to
­release it from its obligation arising from the purchase c
­ ontract,
announced on June 18, 2015. The disposal group created for
this planned transaction was dissolved.
Asset swap with Gazprom
In its Oil & Gas segment, BASF concluded the swap of assets
of equal value with Gazprom on September 30, 2015, with
retroactive economic effect to April 1, 2013. As a result of the
transaction, BASF received an economic share of 25.01% in
blocks IV and V of the Achimov formation of the Urengoy
­natural gas and condensate field in western Siberia. According
to the development plan originally confirmed by Russian
autho­rities, blocks IV and V have total hydrocarbon resources
of 274 billion cubic meters of natural gas and 74 million metric
tons of condensate. As these figures are still undergoing
­review, new findings may give rise to adjustments. Production
is scheduled to start up in 2018.

In return, BASF transferred its shares in the previously jointly

included the 50.02% shares in the following: the natural gas
trading company WINGAS GmbH, Kassel, Germany; the storage company astora GmbH & Co. KG, Kassel, Germany,
which operates natural gas storage facilities in Rehden and
Jemgum, Germany; and WINGAS Holding GmbH, Kassel,
Germany, including its share in the natural gas storage facility
in Haidach, Austria. BASF also transferred its 50% share in
each of the natural gas trading companies Wintershall Erdgas
Handelshaus GmbH & Co. KG, Berlin, Germany, and
­
­W intershall Erdgas Handelshaus Zug AG, Zug, Switzerland.
Gazprom furthermore became a 50% share­holder in Wintershall ­Noordzee B.V. in Rijswijk, Netherlands, which is active in
the ­exploration and production of natural gas and crude oil
deposits in the North Sea. Because the transaction is
­
economically retroactive to April 1, 2013, BASF will pay
­
­Gazprom a cash compensation estimated to total €50 million.
As a result of the disposal of its 50% share in Wintershall
Noordzee B.V., BASF no longer exerts control over the
­company alone, but rather shares joint control with Gazprom.
In accordance with IFRS 10, Wintershall Noordzee B.V. was
reclassified in the Consolidated Financial Statements from a
fully consolidated company to a joint venture accounted for
using the equity method from this point in time.
The following table shows the balance sheet values of the
assets and liabilities that went to Gazprom as a result of the
swap, taking into account 100% of the balance sheet values
of Wintershall Noordzee B.V., as of the point of transfer from
full consolidation to the equity method:

The swap of assets of equal value is treated in accordance
with IAS 16.26. As per this regulation, the fair value of the
­assets received is deemed to constitute their acquisition cost.

The acquisition of the 25.01% economic share in blocks IV
and V of the Achimov formation was conducted through a
capital share in two Russian companies that will be equity
­accounted as associated companies in BASF’s Consolidated
Financial Statements due to the material influence BASF
exercises over them. As of September 30, 2015, both
­
­companies, together with the now-50% share in Wintershall
Noordzee B.V., were measured at fair value and reported as
investments accounted for using the equity method.
The following overview shows the individual components
of BASF’s profit realization from the asset swap with Gazprom
and the reclassification of Wintershall Noordzee B.V.:

To determine the fair value of the investments in Achimov IV/V
and Wintershall Noordzee B.V. as per IAS 28, the proportional
share of assets and liabilities was measured in accordance with
IFRS 3. As per IFRS 3, the purchase price allocation is to be
adjusted ­accordingly if facts and circumstances become known
within the 12-month evaluation period that apply at the time of
sale or transfer. Accordingly, the determined fair values and the
­resulting earnings arising from the asset swap and the transfer
from Wintershall Noordzee B.V. are to be seen as preliminary.
In 2014, BASF divested the following activities:
––On March 25, 2014, BASF concluded the sale of selected oil
and gas investments in the North Sea to the Hungarian MOL
Group, as agreed upon on December 12, 2013. In addition
to 14 licenses, MOL also purchased BASF’s shares in the
infrastructure of the Sullom Voe Terminal and in the Brent
Pipeline System.
––On June 2, 2014, BASF completed the sale of its PolyAd
Services business to Edgewater Capital Partners, L.P. The
activities had been allocated to the Performance Chemicals
division.
––Effective as of November 17, 2014, BASF sold its 50% share
in Styrolution Holding GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, Germany,
to the INEOS Group. The partnership agreement of 2011
already included a cross option, giving BASF the option to
sell its share in Styrolution and INEOS the option to buy
BASF’s share in Styrolution. The share in Styrolution and the
related income had been allocated to Other.
––On December 31, 2014, BASF completed the sale of its
50% stake in the joint operation Ellba Eastern Private Ltd.,
Singapore, which produces propylene oxide and styrene
monomers, to its partner Shell. The activities of Ellba Eastern
had been allocated to BASF’s Petrochemicals division as
well as to Other.

Reporting by segment and region

Since January 1, 2015, BASF’s business has been conducted
by 13 operating divisions aggregated into five segments for
reporting purposes. The divisions are allocated to the
­segments based on their business models.
The Chemicals segment entails the classical chemicals
business with basic chemicals and intermediates. It forms the
core of BASF’s Production Verbund and is the starting point
for a majority of the value chains. In addition to supplying the
chemical industry and other sectors, the segment ensures that
other BASF divisions are supplied with chemicals for producing downstream products. The Chemicals segment comprises
the Petrochemicals, Monomers and Intermediates divisions.
Until the end of 2014, the Performance Products segment
consisted of the Dispersions & Pigments, Care Chemicals,
Nutrition & Health, Paper Chemicals and Performance
­Chemicals divisions. Customized products allow customers to
make their production processes more efficient or to give
their products improved application properties. The Paper
­Chemicals division was dissolved as of January 1, 2015. The
paper chemicals business is being continued in the Performance Chemicals and Dispersions & Pigments divisions.

The Functional Materials & Solutions segment bundles
­system solutions, services and innovative products for specific
sectors and customers, in particular for the automotive,
­electronic, chemical and construction industries. It is made
up of the Catalysts, Construction Chemicals, Coatings, and
Performance Materials divisions.
The Agricultural Solutions segment consists of the Crop
Protection division, whose products secure yields and guard
crops against fungal infections, insects and weeds, in addition
to serving as biological and chemical seed treatments. Plant
biotechnology research is not assigned to this segment; it is
reported in Other.
Until September 30, 2015, the Oil & Gas segment
comprised the Oil & Gas division with its Exploration &
­
­Production and Natural Gas Trading business sectors. At the
end of the third quarter of 2015, BASF exited the natural gas
trading and storage business, operated together with
­Gazprom to that point in time, and as of October 1, 2015, has
concentrated on the exploration and production of oil and gas
as well as on the transport of natural gas.

Activities not assigned to a particular division are reported
under Other. These include the sale of raw materials, engineering and other services, rental income and leases, the production of precursors not assigned to a particular segment, the
steering of the BASF Group by corporate headquarters, and
corporate research.
With cross-divisional corporate research, BASF is creating
new businesses and ensuring its long-term competence with
regard to technology and methods. This includes plant biotechnology research.
Earnings from currency conversion that are not allocated
to the segments are also reported under Other, as are earnings
from the hedging of raw material prices and foreign currency

exchange risks. Furthermore, revenues and expenses from the
long-term incentive (LTI) program are reported here.
Transfers between the segments are generally executed at
adjusted market-based prices which take into account the
higher cost efficiency and lower risk of Group-internal transactions. Assets, as well as their depreciation and amortization,
are allocated to the segments based on economic control.
Assets used by more than one segment are allocated based
on the percentage of usage.

Furthermore, the item foreign currency results, ­hedging

2014. This was partly due to higher currency losses. It was

also the result of expenses arising from the addition to provisions for the long-term incentive p

in the amount of €54 million had been recognized from the
reversal of such provisions.
Miscellaneous income and expenses ­decreased espe­
cially as a result of expenses for BASF’s 150th anniver­sary
celebrations in 2015.

Consolidated Financial S
­ tatements
Notes — Policies and scope of consolidation

The reconciliation reporting Oil & Gas reconciles the income
from operations in the Oil & Gas segment with the contribution
of the segment to the net income of the BASF Group.
Income from operations declined due to lower oil and
gas prices, and the currency-related decrease in earnings
contributions from BASF’s share in the Yuzhno Russkoye
­natural gas field. Impairments for exploration and production
licenses dampened earnings by €609 million in 2015 and
€230 million in 2014.
In 2015, the asset swap with Gazprom led to income in the
amount of €314 million. In 2014, the sale of oil and gas investments in the North Sea to the MOL Group ­resulted in income
of €132 million. As a result of the asset swap with Gazprom on
September 30, 2015, the share of earnings from the exited
natural gas trading and storage business as well as from the

50% share in Wintershall Noordzee B.V., Rijswijk, Netherlands,
was no longer included in the income from operations in the
fourth quarter of 2015.
Income from shareholdings in the Oil & Gas segment
­decreased significantly. This was due to the sale of VNG –
Verbundnetz Gas AG, Leipzig, Germany, to EWE AG in 2014.
Other income in the oil and gas business relates to i­ncome
and expenses not included in the segment’s income from
­operations, interest result and other financial result. As in the
previous year, other income largely consisted of currency
­effects from Group loans.
Significantly lower earnings contributions from Norway,
due in part to the impairments recognized there as well as to
currency effects, led to a considerable decline in income tax
and the tax rate.

The sum of sales including intersegmental transfers for all the regions can differ from the sum of sales including intersegmental transfers for all the segments, as the segments are
viewed globally, and therefore shipments and services between regions within the same segment are not classified as transfers.

In the United States, sales to third parties in 2015 amounted to
€13,831 million (2014: €13,877 million) according to company
location and €13,302 million (2014: €13,329 million) according
to customer location. In the United States, intangible assets,

5

property, plant and equipment, and investments accounted
for using the equity method amounted to €9,262 million
­compared with €7,983 million in the previous year.

In accordance with IAS 33, a potential dilutive effect must be
considered in the diluted earnings per share for those BASF
shares which will be granted in the future as a part of the BASF
share program “plus.” This applies regardless of the fact that
the necessary shares are acquired by third parties on the
market on behalf of BASF, and the fact that there are no plans
for the issuance of new shares. The dilutive effect of the issue
of plus shares amounted to €0.01 in 2015 (2014: €0.01).

Functional costs

Under the cost-of-sales method, functional costs incurred by
the operating functions are determined on the basis of cost
center accounting. The functional costs particularly contain
the personnel costs, depreciation and amortization accumulated on the underlying final cost centers as well as allocated
costs within the cost accounting cycle. Operating expenses

Income from the adjustment and reversal of provisions
recognized in other operating expenses in 2014 included
income of €79 million from the reversal of the provision for the
long-term incentive (LTI) program; this was due to the decline
in the BASF share price in 2014. In 2015, however, an expense
of €53 million arose from the LTI program, and was recognized
in other operating expenses.
For more information, see Note 8 from page 184 onward

Furthermore, the reversal of provisions in both years was
largely related to closures and restructuring measures,
­employee obligations, risks from lawsuits and damage claims,
and various other items as part of the normal course of
­business. Provisions were reversed if the circumstances on
the balance sheet date were such that utilization was no longer
expected, or expected to a lesser extent.

Revenue from miscellaneous revenue-generating activities primarily included income from rentals, property sales,
catering operations, cultural events and logistics services.
Income from foreign currency and hedging transactions pertained to the foreign currency translation of receivables and payables as well as changes in the fair value of
currency derivatives and other hedging transactions. The
­decline in comparison with the previous year was attributable
to lower income as a result of the depreciation of the Russian
ruble.
Income from the translation of financial statements in
foreign currencies contained gains from the translation of
companies whose local currency is ­different from the func­
tional currency.

Consolidated Financial ­Statements 
Notes — Notes on statement of income

Gains on the disposal of fixed assets and divestitures in
the amount of €314 million resulted from the asset swap with
Gazprom. Income of €71 million was related to the sale of the
global textile chemicals business to Archroma Textiles S.à r.l.,
Luxembourg. Additional income of €39 million was attributable to the sale of the white expandable polystyrene (EPS)
business to ­Alpek S.A.B. de C.V., Monterrey, Mexico. Furthermore, ­income in the amount of €37 million arose from the sale
of buildings in China and India as well as income in the amount
of €29 million from the sale of the custom synthesis business
and parts of the active pharmaceutical ingredients portfolio to
Siegfried Holding AG, Zofingen, Switzerland. The previous
­
year mainly included gains from the sale of the 50% share in
­Styrolution Holding GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, in
the amount of €458 million to INEOS. Further income of
€132 million was related to the sale of selected oil and gas
investments in the North Sea to the Hungarian MOL Group.
Additional income in the amount of €109 million resulted from
the sale to Shell of the share in the Ellba Eastern Private Ltd.
joint operation in Singapore, as well as €31 million from the
sale of the PolyAd Services business to Edgewater Capital
Partners, L.P., Cleveland, Ohio.
Income from the reversal of valuation allowances for
business-related receivables resulted mainly from the
­settlement of customer-related receivables for which a valuation allowance had been recorded.

BASF Report 2015

Other income included government grants and government
assistance from several countries amounting to €135 million in
2015 and €112 million in 2014. In both years, these were
primarily attributable to price compensation from the
­
Argentinian government for gas producers, which was
­
­introduced in connection with the New Gas Price Scheme
(NGPS) in response to the lower, partly locally regulated gas
prices.
Further income resulted from refunds in the amount of
€254 million in 2015 and €122 million in 2014. These were
predominantly due in both years to insurance refunds arising
from a plant outage at the Ellba C.V. joint operation in Moerdijk,
Netherlands. In 2015, income also arose from a one-off
payment for a price revision relating to the previous year in
the Oil & Gas segment as well as a one-off payment from
Tellus Petroleum AS, Oslo, Norway, in connection with the
intended sale of selected assets on the Norwegian continental shelf, which was not completed. The previous year had
included income from reimbursement claims in the amount of
€43 million.
Moreover, income in both years was related to gains from
precious metal trading, the reversal of impairments on
­property, plant and equipment, tax refunds, income from the
adjustment of pension plans, and a number of other items.

2015 and €40 million in 2014. Further expenses for restructuring ­measures amounting to €15 million concerned one site in
the United States in the Petrochemicals division. In the
Dispersions & Pigments division, expenses arose in the
­
amount of €16 million in 2015 and €12 million in 2014; these
concerned several sites worldwide. Furthermore, expenses of
€15 million were incurred for a regional restructuring project in
South America as well as the outsourcing of the computer
centers. In 2014, expenses of €9 million had arisen from measures at several sites in the Care Chemicals division.

Expenses arose from environmental protection and safety
measures, demolition and removal, and planning expenses related to capital expenditures that are not subject to
mandatory capitalization according to IFRS. Expenses for
demolition, removal and project planning totaled €376 million
in 2015 and €286 million in 2014. These especially pertained
to the Ludwigshafen site in both years. Further expenses of
€37 million in 2015 and €19 million in 2014 were due to
­additional environmental provisions. In both years, these primarily concerned several discontinued sites in North America
and Switzerland.

Amortization, depreciation and impairments of intangible
assets and property, plant and equipment arose from
­
impairments in the Oil & Gas segment in the amount of
­
€500 million in 2015 and €230 million in 2014. Further impairments of €57 million concerned the Functional Materials &
Solutions segment in 2015 (2014: €42 million). Impairments
of €53 million were recognized the Performance Products
segment in 2015. Impairments in the Chemicals segment
amounted to €18 million in 2015 and €33 million in 2014.
Costs from miscellaneous revenue-generating activities
concerned the respective item presented in other operating
income.
For more information, see Note 7 from page 183 onward

Losses from the disposal of fixed assets and divestitures
in 2015 mainly stemmed from the sale of the global paper
hydrous kaolin business to Imerys Kaolin, Inc., Roswell,
­
­Georgia. Losses in 2014 arose p
­ redominantly from losses of
€9 million in connection with the disposal of the Brattvåg site
in Norway in the Nutrition & Health division.
Other expenses included expenses of €121 million for
BASF’s 150th anniversary.
The previous year had included strike-related expenses in
connection with the construction of the acrylic acid and superabsorbent production complex in Camaçari, Brazil, in the
amount of €16 million. Furthermore, in both years, expenses
arose from the implementation of further projects, REACH,
and the provision of services.

Expenses from foreign-currency and hedging transactions
as well as from the measurement of LTI options were
related to foreign currency translations of receivables and
­
payables as well as changes in the fair value of currency
­derivatives and other hedging transactions. Compared with
the previous year, higher expenses particularly arose from the
appreciation of the U.S. dollar against various currencies. In
2015, there was also an expense for the long-term ­incentive
(LTI) program of €53 million. In 2014, an expense of €25 million
was recognized for newly issued LTI options at the end of the
year.

The Oil & Gas segment contributed €106 million to income
from companies accounted for using the equity method.
Especially contributing to this total were OAO Severnefte­
gazprom, ­
Krasnoselkup, Russia; Nord Stream AG, Zug,
Switzerland; and GASCADE Gastransport GmbH, Kassel,
Germany. Further significant earnings contributions were
made by shareholdings in BASF-YPC Company Ltd., Nanjing,
China; Lucura Versicherungs AG, Ludwigshafen am Rhein,
Germany; and BASF SONATRACH Propanchem S.A.,
­Tarra­gona, Spain.

The decline in income from companies accounted for
using the equity method was predominantly the result of an
impairment at Wintershall Noordzee B.V., Rijswijk, Netherlands. The reduction was partly alleviated by higher earnings
contributions from other shareholdings, particularly OAO Sever­nefte­gazprom, Krasnoselkup, Russia, and BASF-YPC Company Ltd., Nanjing, China.

Income from shareholdings was €269 million lower in 2015
than in the previous year. In 2014, higher income from the
disposal of shareholdings was reported, particu­
larly
€220 million from the disposal of the share in VNG –
­Verbundnetz Gas AG, Leipzig, Germany.
The interest result improved by €79 million compared with
the previous year. This was primarily attributable to lower­
­interest expenses as a result of more favorable refinancing
conditions.
The net interest expense from underfunded pension
plans and similar obligations increased compared with the
­previous year, mainly as a result of the higher defined benefit
obligation as of December 31, 2014.
Compared with the previous year, income from the
­capitalization of borrowing costs slightly decreased as a

11

result of the startup of major investment projects, particularly
the TDI complex in Ludwigshafen, ­Germany; the production
complex for acrylic acid and superabsorbents in Camaçari,
Brazil; the MDI plant in Chongqing, China; and oil and gas
production facilities.
Miscellaneous financial expenses in 2015 predomi­
nantly included hedging costs from the hedging of loans in
U.S. dollars. In addition to expenses for hedging loans in
U.S. dollars, the previous year had included an expense of
­€42 million for the market valuation of options for the disposal
of shares in Styrolution. Effective as of November 17, 2014,
BASF sold its share in Styrolution to the INEOS Group.

Income taxes

In Germany, a uniform corporate income tax rate of 15.0% as
well as a solidarity surcharge of 5.5% thereon is levied on all
paid out and retained earnings. In addition to corporate income
tax, income generated in Germany is subject to a trade tax that
varies depending on the municipality in which the company is
represented. Due to an increase in the rate of assessment for
Ludwigshafen, Germany, the weighted average trade tax rate
was 14.1% in 2015 (2014: 13.4%). As the increase had already

been enacted in the previous year, the 30% rate used to calculate deferred taxes for German Group companies remained
unchanged in 2015. The profits of foreign Group companies
are assessed using the tax rates applicable in their respective
countries. These are also generally used to calculate deferred
taxes to the extent that tax rate adjustments for the future have
not yet been ­enacted.

income in connection with the disposal of investments,
­especially of the shares in Styrolution and in VNG – Verbundnetz
Gas AG, as well as the sale of oil and gas fields in the North
Sea to the MOL Group.

Nondeductible expenses particularly i­ncluded an impairment
of the goodwill of the Exploration & Production business sector.
Future reversals of temporary differences for shares in
invest­ments that are assumed to have a planning horizon of
one year led to deferred tax income of €28 million in 2015
(2014: €7 million).

Deferred taxes result from temporary differences between tax
balances and the measurement of assets and liabilities
­according to IFRS as well as from tax loss carryforwards and
unused tax credits. The remeasurement of all the assets and
liabilities associated with acquisitions according to IFRS 3 has
resulted in significant deviations between fair values and the
values in the tax accounts. This leads primarily to deferred tax
liabilities.
Undistributed earnings of subsidiaries resulted in ­temporary
differences of €9,241 million in 2015 (2014: €7,472 million) for
which deferred tax liabilities were not recognized, as they are
either not subject to taxation on payout or they are expected
to be reinvested for indefinite periods of time.

sales ­volumes and more favorable procurement conditions in
the natural gas trading business.
Minority interests in losses in 2015 arose particularly
at Shanghai BASF Polyurethane Company Ltd., Shanghai,

Number of employees

Personnel expenses increased by 8.2%, from €9,224 million
in 2014 to €9,982 million in 2015, largely owing to currency
effects. The rise was also due in part to wage and salary
­increases as well as ­expenses for the anniversary bonus to
employees and the long-term incentive (LTI) program.

The number of employees was 112,435 on December 31,

Intangible assets

The goodwill of BASF is allocated to 21 cash-generating units
(2014: 23), which are defined either on the basis of business
units or on a higher level.
Annual impairment testing took place in the fourth quarter
of the year on the basis of the cash-generating units. Recov­
erable amounts were determined in each case using the value
in use. This was done using plans approved by company
management and their respective cash flows, generally for the
next five years. For the time period after the fifth year, a terminal value was calculated using a forward projection from the
last detailed planning year as a perpetual annuity. The planning
is based on experience, current performance and management’s best possible estimates on the future ­development of

indi­vidual parameters, such as raw material prices and profit
margins. The oil price is also among the main input parameters
that provide the basis for the forecast of cash inflows in the
current financial plans. Market assumptions ­
­
regarding, for
exam­
ple, economic development and market growth are
inclu­ded based on external macroeconomic ­sources as well
as sources specific to the industry.
The weighted average cost of capital rate after tax required
for impairment testing is determined using the Capital Asset
Pricing Model. It comprises a risk-free rate, a market risk premium, and a spread for credit risk based on the respective
­industry-specific peer group. The calculation also takes into
account capital structure and the beta factor of the respective

189

190

Consolidated Financial ­Statements 
Notes — Notes on balance sheet

peer group as well as the average tax rate of each cash-­
generating unit. Impairment tests were conducted assuming a
weighted average cost of capital rate after taxes between
6.04% and 7.67% (2014: b
­ etween 6.60% and 7.76%). This
represents a weighted ­
average cost of capital rate before
­taxes between 7.77% and 10.81% (2014: between 8.19%
and 10.30%). For the Exploration & Production business
sector in the Oil & Gas segment, a cost of capital rate after
taxes of 10.93% (2014: 9.46%) or before taxes of 16.66%
(2014: 17.72%) was ­applied, taking ­country-specific risks into
­account.
In determining the value in use for the great majority of
cash-­generating units, BASF generally anticipates that a reasonably possible deviation from the key assumptions will not
lead to the carrying amount of the units exceeding their
respec­
tive recoverable amounts. For the goodwill of the
Construction C
­ hemicals division and the cash-­
generating
units Pigments (in the Dispersions & Pigments division),
Catalysts (excluding battery materials), and Exploration &
Production (in the Oil & Gas segment), this is not the case.
In the 2015 business year, the recoverable amount of the
Construction Chemicals unit exceeded the carrying amount by
around €397 million. Earnings in the Construction Chemicals
division are influenced by the growth of the construction
indus­try. The weighted average cost of capital rate after taxes
used for impairment testing was 7.67% (2014: 7.76%). The
recoverable amount would equal the unit’s carrying amount if
the cost of capital rate increased by 0.96 percentage points
(2014: by 0.5 percentage points) or if income from operations
of the last detailed planning year – as the basis for the terminal
value – were lower by 16.65% (2014: by 9.10%).
The weighted average cost of capital rate after taxes used
for impairment testing for Pigments was 6.07% (2014: 6.64%).
In 2015, the recoverable amount of this unit ­exceeded the
carrying amount by €15 million, so that even slightly unfavor-

BASF Report 2015

able changes in the assumptions would lead to an impairment.
An increase of 0.5% in the cost of capital rate would result in
impairments amounting to €163 million; a 10% decrease in
income from operations of the last detailed p
­ lanning year –
used as the basis for the terminal value – would result in
impair­ments of €143 million.
In 2015, the recoverable amount of Catalysts (excluding
battery materials) ­exceeded the carrying amount by €708 million. The weighted average cost of capital rate after taxes used
for the impairment testing of this unit was 7.66% (2014: 7.75%).
The recoverable value of the unit would equal the carrying
amount if the cost of capital rate increased by 0.73 percentage
points or if income from ­operations of the last detailed planning
year – as the basis for the terminal value – were 14.52% lower.
For impairment testing in the ­
Exploration & Production
business sector in the Oil & Gas segment, ­assumptions regar­
ding expected price development were ­adjusted to r­eflect the
current oil price development. BASF now assumes an aver­age
oil price of $40 per barrel (Brent) in 2016, and expects this to
rise again in subsequent years to over $100 per barrel (Brent)
in deter­mining the terminal value. The revised assump­tions
resul­ted in an impairment of goodwill for Explora­tion & Production in the amount of €137 million. The recoverable amount
­corresponds to the value in use of the unit, amounting to
€8,746 million as of Decem­ber 31, 2015. A decrease of $10
per barrel of Brent crude in the average oil price assump­tion
would reduce i­ncome from operations by roughly €200 million
each year. Such a reduction over the entire planning period
would lead to an impairment of €1 billion in the Exploration &
­Production cash-generating unit. Irrespective of the price of
oil, an ­increase in the cost of capital rate by 0.5% would lead
to an additional impairment of €526 million. Impairments may
be allocated to i­ntangible assets, goodwill and property, plant
and equipment depen­ding on the nature, timing and size of
changes in the individual parameters.

Including licenses to such rights and values

Besides goodwill, intangible assets also include acquired
intangible assets as well as internally generated intangible
­
­assets. In addition, they include rights belonging to the Oil &
Gas segment, which are amortized in accordance with the
unit of production method. As of December 31, 2015, their
acquisition costs amounted to €835 million and accumulated
amortization to €246 million; amortization in 2015 amounted
to €41 million.
Additions from acquisitions amounted to €136 million in
2015. Significant acquisitions concerned the purchase of a
66% share in a company to which TODA KOGYO CORP.,
Hiro­shima, Japan, contributed its business, and the purchase
of the ­polyurethane (PU) business from Polioles, S.A. de C.V.,
Lerma, Mexico. In connection with these transactions, additions to intangible assets amounted to €87 million. Moreover,
BASF concluded an agreement with Lanxess on the acqui­
sition and use of technologies and patents for the ­production
of high-molecular-weight polyisobutene (HM PIB), which
­added €23 million to intangible assets.
Concessions for oil and gas production under the category
product rights, licenses and trademarks with a net carrying
amount of €480 million in 2015 authorize the exploration and
production of oil and gas in certain areas. At the end of the
term of a concession, the rights are returned. Aside from
transfers to property, plant and equipment, transfers in 2015
included €54 million from the subsequent adjustments of the
purchase price allocation for the acquisition of assets from
Statoil.

Other rights and values under transfers also included
derecognitions of €153 million resulting from the change in
accounting to the net method for emission right certificates
granted free of charge in 2015. Disposals of €17 million were
attributable to the asset swap with Gazprom.
Related to this, goodwill of €173 million was derecognized, €32 million of which was reported under transfers.
In 2015, additions to accumulated amortization included
impairments of €205 million. These primarily concerned the
Oil & Gas segment. The revised assumptions for oil and gas
prices led to €137 million in goodwill impairments as well as
€27 million in impairments on a license in Norway. Furthermore, under the cate­gory know-how, patents and production
technologies, a once-advantageous supply contract of
€36 million in the Functional Materials & Solutions segment
was fully impaired due to lower market prices.
In 2015, additions to accumulated amortization included
write-ups of €2 million.

Including licenses to such rights and values

Besides goodwill, intangible assets also include acquired
intangible assets as well as internally generated intangible
­
­assets. In addition, they include rights belonging to the Oil &
Gas segment, which are amortized in accordance with the unit
of production method. As of December 31, 2014, their acquisition costs amounted to €916 million and accumulated amortization to €235 million; amortization in 2014 amounted to
€52 million.
In connection with the acquisition of assets from Statoil,
Stavanger, Norway, €704 million was added to intangible
assets in 2014. Of this amount, €121 million pertained to
­
­exploration rights and licenses and €583 million to goodwill.
Concessions for oil and gas production under the category
product rights, licenses and trademarks with a net carrying
amount of €579 million in 2014 authorize the exploration and
production of oil and gas in certain areas. Some of these rights
entail obligations to deliver a portion of the production output
to local companies. At the end of the term of a concession, the
rights are returned.

In other rights and values, the line item transfers includes
­additions and fair value adjustments of emission rights recognized directly in equity as of the balance sheet date.
Disposals were largely attributable to the sale of selected
oil and gas investments in the North Sea to the Hungarian
MOL Group.
Impairments of €56 million were recognized in 2014. Due
to the weak development of the coal mining business in China,
impairments of €40 million relating to distribution, supply and
similar rights were recognized in the Construction Chemicals
division. The recoverable amount equals the value in use,
amounting to €10 million. The value in use was determined
using a weighted average cost of capital rate before taxes
of 11.02%.
In 2014, transfers included a write-up of €5 million.

Additions to property, plant and equipment arising from
investment projects amounted to €5,651 million in 2015.
­
Significant investments were primarily related to the
­
­construction of a TDI complex in Ludwigshafen, Germany; a
­production complex for acrylic acid and superabsorbents in
Camaçari, Brazil; and an MDI plant in Chongqing, China. Each
of these began operations either fully or partly in 2015. Further
significant ­investments included the construction of an integrated aroma ingredients complex in Kuantan, Malaysia, and
oil and gas production facilities and wells in Europe and South
America. Investments for expansion purposes were particu­
larly made at the sites in Ludwigshafen, Germany; Freeport,
Texas; Geismar, Louisiana; and Antwerp, Belgium. Government grants of €10 million related to tangible assets were
deduc­ted. Due to acquisitions, property, plant and equipment rose by €91 million primarily from the acquisition of
BASF TODA Battery Materials LLC, Tokyo, Japan.
In 2015, impairments of €485 million were included in
accumulated depreciation. Of this amount, €336 million
­pertained to impairments on oil and gas fields in Norway, Libya
and Germany in the Oil & Gas segment. These impairments
arose particularly from the ongoing low o
­ il and gas price level
and the resulting revision of planning assumptions. These
fields were written down to their recoverable amount, totaling

€1,338 million. The weighted a
­verage cost of capital rate
­before taxes used ranged between 9.13% and 88.83%. The
high cost of capital rates were due to the special income tax
for the oil and gas industry in Norway. The recoverable amount
for impaired property, plant and equipment equals their value
in use. In 2015, additions to accumulated d
­ epreciation contained write-ups of €5 million.
For more information on oil price sensitivity and property, plant and
equipment, see Note 14 from page 189 onward

Disposals of property, plant and equipment were primarily
attributable to the asset swap with Gazprom and related
­primarily to the transferred natural gas trading and storage
business. Furthermore, BASF’s share in Wintershall Noordzee B.V., Rijswijk, Netherlands, was reduced to 50%. With this
loss of control, the company was reclassified as an investment
accounted for using the equity method. 50% of the property,
plant and equipment was reported in disposals and the
remain­ing 50% in transfers.
Exchange differences arose particularly from the
­appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro.

Additions to property, plant and equipment from investment
projects in 2014 amounted to €5,368 million. Significant
­investments particularly concerned the construction of a TDI
complex in Ludwigshafen, Germany; a production complex for
acrylic acid and superabsorbents in Camaçari, Brazil; an MDI
plant in Chongqing, China; and oil and gas production facilities
and wells in Europe and South America. Investments for
expan­
sion purposes were particularly made at the sites in
Ludwigshafen, Germany; Antwerp, Belgium; Geismar, Loui­
siana; and Freeport, Texas. Property, plant and equipment
rose by €1,001 million primarily from the acquisition of assets
from Statoil, Stavanger, Norway.
In 2014, the impairments of €298 million recognized
­under accumulated depreciation primarily concerned the Oil &
Gas segment. They resulted mainly from the complete writedown of property, plant and equipment from projects for the
development of a gas field in Qatar in the amount of €81 million
as well as an oilfield in the United Kingdom in the amount of

€44 million. Furthermore, impairments of €94 million were
recognized on oil and gas fields in Norway and Germany. The
oil and gas fields were written down to their recoverable
amount of €554 million. The recoverable amounts for the individual oil and gas fields were calculated using a weighted
aver­age cost of capital rate before taxes ranging between
8.46% and 73.56%. The high cost of capital rates were due to
the special income tax for the oil and gas industry in Norway.
A plant in the Chemicals segment was written down to its
recov­erable amount of €31 million, ­requiring the recognition of
an impairment in the amount of €27 million. The weighted
aver­age cost of capital rate before taxes used was 9.38%. The
recoverable amount for impairments was determined on the
basis of value in use.
Disposals of property, plant and equipment were largely
attributable to the sale of selected oil and gas investments in
the North Sea to the Hungarian MOL Group.
In 2014, transfers included a write-up of €3 million.

Additions of €847 million to investments accounted for using
the equity method were primarily due to the asset swap with
Gazprom. As a result, the closed joint stock ­company Achim
Trading in Moscow, Russia, and the limited l­iability company
Achim Development in Novy Urengoy, ­Russia, were a
­ ccounted
for using the equity method for the first time.
Disposals totaling €107 million were primarily attributable
to the sale of BASF’s 25% share in SolVin to its partner Solvay,
effective July 1, 2015. In the previous year, the sale of BASF’s
share in Styrolution Holding GmbH to the INEOS Group had
been primarily responsible for disposals of €781 million.
Transfers include €407 million from the first-time use of
the equity method to account for Wintershall Noordzee B.V.,
Rijswijk, Netherlands. As a result of the disposal of its 50%
share in Wintershall Noordzee B.V. to Gazprom, BASF no
longer exercises control over this company alone but rather
shares control with Gazprom. Wintershall Noordzee B.V. must
now therefore be accounted for using the equity method in the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Due to ongoing low prices

17

for oil and gas and the resulting revision of planning assumptions, the share in Wintershall Noordzee B.V. was impaired by
€109 million. This amount is also reflected in transfers. The
recoverable amount of €291 million c
­ orresponds to the value
in use of the company, and was determined using the after-tax
cash flows from the oil and gas fields in which the company
has interests. They were discounted using a cost of capital
rate after taxes of 7.8%. In 2014, transfers had included
impair­
ments of €25 million. Transfers additionally contains
­income and dividend distributions from c
­ ompanies accounted
for using the equity method.
	For a detailed overview of income from companies accounted for using
the equity method, see Note 9 on page 185

The change in other shareholdings resulted from ­additions
of €24 million and disposals of €57 million. ­Impairments
amounted to €47 million. Other shareholdings increased by
€26 million as a result of reclassifications and transfers. Currency effects amounted to €12 million.

Noncurrent loans and interest receivables in 2015 predominantly included loans granted by WIGA Transport Beteili­
gungs-­GmbH & Co. KG, Kassel, Germany, to NEL Gastransport GmbH, K
­ assel, Germany, and GASCADE Gastransport
GmbH, ­Kassel, Germany, in the amount of €398 million to
­finance the pipeline network, as well as loans granted by BASF
Belgium Coordination Center Comm. V., Antwerp, Belgium, in
the amount of €216 million mainly to finance the business
expansion of Asian companies. This item also included
­
receiva­bles in favor of BASF SE from the B
­ ASF Pensions­
kasse arising from an agreement regarding the granting of
proﬁt participation capital in the amount of €
­ 80 milion.
The increase in noncurrent derivatives with positive fair
values was largely attributable to the increase in interest rate
and currency swaps. The decrease in current derivatives with
positive fair values was mainly due to the disposal of
­WINGAS GmbH, Kassel, Germany. In connection with this,
derivatives with positive fair values amounting to €158 million
were derecognized. This was partially offset by increasing fair
values of ­precious metal derivatives.

Prepaid expenses in 2015 included prepayments of €41 million related to operating activities compared with €58 million in
2014, as well as €36 million in prepayments for license costs
in 2015 compared with €29 million in 2014. At €30 million,
­prepayments for insurance in 2015 remained at the prior-year
level.
The increase in other receivables from tax refund claims
was largely due to higher income tax receivables as a result of
prepayments.
Precious metal trading items primarily comprise physical
items and precious metal accounts as well as long positions in
precious metals, which are largely hedged through sales or
derivatives. In comparison with the previous year, there was a
decline particularly relating to the physical items.
Other receivables and assets which qualify as financial
instruments include financial receivables, such as receivables
from the sale of assets. The decrease in 2015 was primarily
­attributable to the settlement of the receivable in the amount of
€200 million arising from the sale of Styrolution Holding GmbH.

Valuation allowances for receivables 2014 (in million €)

The changes recognized in income contained individual
­valuation allowances, group-wise individual valuation allowances and valuation allowances due to transfer risks.
The changes not recognized in income were primarily
­related to changes in the scope of consolidation, translation
adjustments and derecognition of uncollectible receivables.
Even in the current economic environment, BASF has not
observed any material changes in the credit quality of its
receiv­
ables. In 2015, individual valuation allowances of
€57 million were recognized for accounts receivable, trade,
and ­
valuation allowances of €17 million were reversed.
In 2014, individual valuation ­allowances of €65 million were
recognized for trade accounts receivable and valuation allowances of €23 million were ­reversed.

At BASF, a new comprehensive, global credit insurance
program covers trade accounts receivable incurred since
­
January 1, 2015. As part of a global excess of loss policy, an
essential part of future bad debts of the BASF Group are
­insured. There were no compensation claims in 2015.
In 2015, individual valuation allowances of €18 million were
recognized for other receivables. In 2014, individual valuation
allowances of €1 million were recognized for other receivables
and €1 million were reversed.
The recognition and reversal of individual valuation
­allowances for trade accounts receivable and other receivables are recognized in the income statement.

Capital, reserves and retained earnings

Authorized capital
At the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 2, 2014,
­shareholders authorized the Board of Executive Directors, with
the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the
­subscribed capital by issuing new registered shares up to a
total of €500 million against cash or contributions in kind
through May 1, 2019. The Board of Executive Directors is
empowered, following the approval of the Supervisory Board,
to decide on the exclusion of shareholders’ subscription rights
for these new shares in certain predefined cases covered by
the enabling resolution. Until now, this option has not been
exercised and no new shares have been issued.
BASF SE has only issued fully paid-up registered shares
with no par value. There are no preferences or other ­restrictions.
BASF SE does not hold any treasury shares.
Reserves and retained earnings
Capital surplus includes effects from BASF’s share program,
premiums from capital increases and consideration for warrants and negative goodwill from the capital consolidation
result­ing from acquisitions of subsidiaries in exchange for the
issue of BASF SE shares at par value.

Payment of dividends
In accordance with the resolution of the Annual Shareholders’
Meeting on April 30, 2015, BASF SE paid a dividend of €2.80
per share from the retained profit of the 2014 fiscal year. With
918,478,694 shares entitled to dividends, this amounts to a

Transfers from other retained earnings increased legal
­reserves by €60 million in 2015 (2014: €46 million).
Due to the disposal of the 25% share in SolVin to partner
Solvay, of parts of the ­pharmaceutical ingredient business to
Siegfried Holding AG, Zofingen, Switzerland, and the asset
swap with Gazprom, an amount of €68 million resulting from
the remeasure­ment of defined benefit plans was transferred
from other comprehensive income into retained earnings.
The acquisition of shares in companies which BASF
already controls or includes as a joint arrangement in the
­
­Consolidated Financial Statements is treated as a transaction
between shareholders, as long as this does not lead to a
change in the consolidation method. There were no trans­
actions of this type in 2015, as in the previous year.

Other comprehensive income

Translation adjustments

Remeasurement of defined benefit plans

The strong decline in the value of the euro relative to the
U.S. dollar in the 2015 business year was the main factor
leading to an increase of €911 million in the translation adjustment to €652 million.

Due to the disposal of the 25% share in SolVin to partner
Solvay, parts of the pharmaceutical ingredients and services
business to Siegfried Holding AG, Zofingen, Switzerland, and
the asset swap with Gazprom, an amount of €68 million resulting from the remeasurement of defined b
­ enefit plans was
reclassi­fied from other comprehensive i­ncome into retained
earnings.

Cash flow hedges
The significant decline in the hedging of future cash flows in
2015 was primarily a result of the disposal of the negative fair
values of commodity derivatives at WINGAS GmbH, Kassel,
Germany, in connection with the asset swap with ­Gazprom.
Hedging future cash flows at Nord Stream AG, Zug,
Switzerland, a company accounted for using the equity
­
­method, resulted in a change of €16 million in 2015 and of
minus €29 million in 2014.

Provisions for pensions and similar obligations

In addition to state pension plans, most employees are g
­ ranted
company pension benefits from either defined contribution or
defined benefit plans. Benefits generally depend on years of
service, contributions or compensation, and take into
consideration the legal framework of labor, tax and social
­
security laws of the countries where the companies are
­
located. To limit the risks of changing financial market
­
­conditions as well as demographic developments, employees
have been almost exclusively offered defined contribution
plans for future years of service in recent years.
The Group Pension Committee monitors the risks of all
pension plans of the Group. In this connection, it issues
­guidelines regarding the governance and risk management of
pension plans, particularly with regard to the funding of the
pension plans and the portfolio structure of the existing plan
assets. The organization, responsibilities, strategy, implementation and reporting requirements are documented for the
units involved.
Economic and legal environment of the plans
In some countries – especially in Germany, the United
­Kingdom, Switzerland and Belgium – there are pension obligations subject to government supervision or similar legal restrictions. For example, there are minimum funding requirements

to cover pension obligations, which are based on actuarial
assumptions that may differ from those in IAS 19. Furthermore,
there are restrictions in qualitative and quantitative terms relating to parts of the plan assets for the investment in certain
asset categories. This could result in fluctuating employer
contributions, financing requirements and the assumption of
obligations in favor of the pension funds to comply with the
regulatory requirements.
The obligations and the plan assets used to fund the
­obligations are exposed to demographic, legal and economic
risks. Economic risks are primarily due to unforeseen
­developments on commodity and capital markets. They affect,
for example, pension adjustments based on the level of inflation in Germany and in the United Kingdom, as well as the
impact of the discount rate on the amount of the defined
benefit obligation. In previous years, measures taken to close
plans with defined benefits for future service, especially
­benefits based on final pay promises and the assumption of
healthcare costs for former employees, however, led to a
reduc­tion in risk with regard to future benefit levels.

Consolidated Financial ­Statements 
Notes — Notes on balance sheet

The strategy of the BASF Group with regard to financing
pension commitments is aligned with country-specific
­
­supervisory and tax regulations.
Description of the defined benefit plans
Germany
For BASF SE and German Group companies, a basic level of
benefits is provided by BASF Pensionskasse VVaG, a legally
independent funded plan, which is financed by contributions
of employees and the employer as well as the return on plan
assets. BASF SE ensures the necessary contributions to
­adequately finance the benefits promised by BASF Pensions­
kasse VVaG. Some of the benefits financed via the BASF
Pensionskasse VVaG are subject to adjustments that must be
borne by its member companies to the extent that these
­cannot be borne by BASF Pensionskasse VVaG due to the
regulations imposed by the German supervisory authority. In
2004, the basic benefits plan at BASF was closed for new
employees at German BASF companies and replaced by a
defined contribution plan. At BASF SE, occupational pension
promises that exceed the basic level of benefits are financed
under a contractual trust arrangement by BASF Pensionstreuhand e.V.; at German Group companies, these benefits are
almost exclusively financed via pension provisions. The
­benefits are largely based on cash balance plans. Furthermore,
employees are given the option of participating in various
­deferred compensation schemes.
United States
Employees are granted benefits based on defined contribution
plans.
The existing defined benefit plans were closed to further
increases in benefits based on future years of service, and
benefits earned in the past have been frozen. There is no
entitlement to pension adjustments to compensate for
­
­cost-of-living increases.
The legal and regulatory frameworks governing the plans
are based on the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security
Act (ERISA), which requires the plan sponsor to ensure a
minimum funding level. Any employer contributions necessary
to meet the minimum funding level would be based on the
results of an actuarial valuation. Furthermore, there are
­
­unfunded pension plans that are not subject to ERISA.
Additional similar obligations arise from plans which
­assume the healthcare costs and life insurance premiums of
retired employees and their dependents. Such plans are
closed to new entrants since 2007. In addition, the amount of
the ­benefits for such plans is frozen.

BASF Report 2015

Switzerland
The employees of the BASF Group in Switzerland receive a
company pension, which is financed through a pension fund
by employer and employee contributions as well as the return
on assets. The pension plan is accounted for as a defined
benefit plan, as the obligatory minimum pension guaranteed
by law according to the Swiss law “Berufliche Vorsorge (BVG)”
is included in the scheme. All benefits vest immediately.
According to government regulations, the employer is
­
­obligated to make contributions, so that the pension fund is
able to grant minimum benefits guaranteed by law. The pension fund is managed by a board, where employer and
­employees are equally represented, that steers and monitors
the benefit plan and assets.
United Kingdom
Employees are granted benefits based on a defined
­contribution plan.
A part of the workforce received benefit increases
depending on service period in connection with a career
­
average plan until December 31, 2015. The BASF Group
­
maintains defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom, which
were closed for further increases in benefit from future years of
service. Adjustments to compensate for increases in the cost
of living until the beginning of retirement are legally required for
beneficiaries of defined benefit plans.
The financing of the pension plans is determined by the
provisions of the regulatory authority for pensions and the
­relevant social and labor law requirements. The defined benefit
plans are administered by a trust company, whose Board of
Trustees, according to the trustee agreement and law,
­represents the interests of the beneficiaries and ensures that
the benefits can be paid in the future. The required funding is
determined using technical valuations according to local
­regulations every three years.
Other countries
In the case of subsidiaries in other countries, defined benefits
are covered in some cases by pension provisions, but mainly
by external insurance companies or pension funds.

The assumptions used to ascertain the defined benefit
­obligation as of December 31 are used in the following year to
determine the expenses for pension plans.
A Group-wide, uniform procedure is used to determine the
discount rates used for the valuation of material pension
obligations of the BASF Group. Accordingly, the discount
­
rates were derived from the yields on corporate bonds in the
respective currency zones with an issuing volume of more than
100 million units of the respective currency with a minimum
rating of AA– up to AA+ from one of the three rating agencies:
Fitch, Moody’s, or Standard & Poor’s.

The valuation of the defined benefit obligation is generally
made using the most recent actuarial mortality tables as of
December 31 of the respective financial year, which in
­Germany and the United States are derived from the BASF
Group population and were last updated for the pension obligations in Germany in 2015 and for the pension obligations in
the United States in 2014.

Expenses for defined benefit plans increased significantly in

current service cost in 2015.
The net interest on the defined benefit liability is recognized

Explanations regarding plan assets
The target asset allocation has been defined by using asset
liability studies and is reviewed regularly. Accordingly, plan
assets are are aligned with the long-term development of the
obligations, taking into consideration the risks associated with
the specific asset classes and the regulations relating to the
investment of plan assets. The existing port­folio structure is
oriented towards the target asset allocation. In addition,
­current market assessments are taken into consideration. In
order to mitigate risks and maximize returns, a widely spread
global portfolio of individual asset classes is held.
Liability-driven investment (LDI) techniques, such as hedging the risk of changes in interest rates and inflation, are used
in some pension plans, especially in the U.K. and U.S. plans.

The asset class debt instruments comprises promissory notes
and debentures (Pfandbriefe) in addition to corporate and government bonds. Government bonds primarily concern bonds
from those countries enjoying the highest credit ratings, such as
the United States, United Kingdom, Germany and Switzerland.
Corporate bonds mainly comprise i­nvestment-grade bonds,

whereby particular high-yield bonds are also held to a limited
extent. In connection with the ongoing monitoring of default
risk based on a given risk budget and on the continuous
obser­
vation of the development of the creditworthiness of
issu­ers, an adjustment of plan asset allocation to a revised
market assessment may be made, if necessary. Alter­native
investments largely comprise investments in private equity,
absolute return funds and senior secured loans.
Almost all of the equities are priced on active markets.
The category debt instruments includes promissory notes
and debentures (Pfandbriefe), which were acquired through
private placements with a market value in the amount of
€1,072 million as of December 31, 2015, and €1,381 million
as of December 31, 2014. For such securities, especially
those held by domestic pension plans, there is no active market. The capital market compensates for this lack of fungibility
with yield premiums depending on the maturity. With only a
few exceptions, there is no active market for plan assets in
real estate and alternative investments.
On December 31, 2015, plan assets contained securities
issued by BASF Group companies with a market value of
€11 million in 2015 and €10 million in 2014. The market value
of the properties of legally independent pension funds rented
to BASF Group companies amounted to €151 million on
Decem­ber 31, 2015, and €168 million on December 31, 2014.
Since 2010 there has been an agreement between
BASF SE and BASF Pensionskasse about the granting of
profit participation capital with a nominal value of €80 million,
which is used to strengthen the financing of the BASF Pensionskasse. No material transactions beyond this took place
between the legally independent pension funds and BASF
Group companies in 2015.
The funding of the plans was as follows:

Restoration obligations primarily relate to the estimated
costs for the filling of wells and the removal of production
equipment after the end of production in the Oil & Gas
­segment. Provisions for restoration obligations decreased by
€340 million as a result of the asset swap with Gazprom and
the reclassification of Wintershall Noordzee B.V., Rijswijk,
Netherlands, to the equity method.
Provisions for environmental protection and remediation costs cover expected costs for rehabilitating conta­
minated sites, recultivating landfills, removal of environmental
contamination at existing production or storage sites and
similar measures. The decrease in provisions was almost
­entirely attributable to the changed accounting for emission
right certificates granted free of charge.
For more information about the measurement of emission right
certificates, see Note 1.2 on page 162

Provisions for employee obligations primarily include obligations for the granting of long-service bonuses and anniversary
payments, variable compensation including associated social
security contributions, as well as provisions for early retirement
programs for employees nearing retirement. The decline was
mainly attributable to lower accruals for variable compensation
components.
For more information on provisions for the long-term incentive program,
see Note 30 from page 218 onward

Obligations from sales and purchase contracts largely
include obligations arising from rebates granted and other
­
price discounts in the Agricultural Solutions segment,
­warranties and product liability, sales commissions, expected
losses on committed purchases and onerous contracts.

The restructuring measures provisions include severance
payments to employees as well as expected costs for site
closures, including the costs for demolition and similar
measures. The increase in provisions resulted from higher
­
­accruals for restructuring measures in North America. On the
balance sheet date, €115 million was attributable to provisions
for severance payments.
Provisions for litigation, damage claims, warranties and
similar commitments contain anticipated expenses from
lawsuits in which BASF is the defendant party, as well as obligations under damage claims against BASF and fines.
Other largely includes noncurrent tax provisions.
The following table shows the development of other
­provisions by category. Other changes include changes in the
scope of consolidation, acquisitions, divestitures, currency
­effects and the reclassification of obligations to liabilities when
the amount and timing of these obligations became known.

the result of the disposal of WINGAS GmbH, Kassel, Germany,
and its purchase obligations from natural gas purchasing
agreements.

26 Risks from litigation and claims

On August 12, 2014, Metrogas S.A., Chile, filed its Statement
of Claim in the arbitration proceedings initiated in May 2013
against Wintershall Energía S.A., Argentina (WIAR), Total Austral S.A., Argentina, and Pan American Energy LLC, Argentina.
The defendants, as sellers, concluded a natural gas supply
contract with Metrogas in 1997. Metrogas claims damages
valued in an amount of €220 million as a result of insufficient
gas deliveries. WIAR’s share of supply in the contract is 37.5%.
The defendants submitted their response to the proof of claim
on December 10, 2014. The first witness and expert hearing is
scheduled for May 2016. The defendants are of the opinion
that Metrogas does not have any claim for damages.
BASF Corporation has potential liability under the
­Comprehensive Response, Compensation and Liability Act of
1980, as amended, and related state laws for investigation
and cleanup at certain sites. The Lower Passaic River Study
Area (LPRSA) is one such site comprising the lower 17 miles of
the Passaic River in New Jersey. BASF Corporation, along
with more than 60 other companies (The Lower Passaic River
Study Area C
­ ooperating Parties Group, CPG), agreed with the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to perform a
remedial investigation and feasibility study of the LPRSA.
Based on the remedy concept proposed by the CPG and
BASF’s estimates of its share of these costs, BASF now considers its portion to be immaterial. It is currently anticipated
that the final decision on the remedy for the lower portion of
the LPRSA will be taken in the course of the year 2016, with a
decision for the upper portion thereafter.

Since November 2014, a putative class action lawsuit in the
United States District Court of the Southern District of New
York has been pending against BASF Metals Limited (BML),
along with other defendants, alleging violations of antitrust and
commodities laws stemming from the price discovery process
for platinum and palladium. BASF Metals Limited, based in the
United Kingdom, and the other three defendants are accused
of ­improper conduct concerning the calculation of the market
prices of platinum and palladium. Four additional lawsuits
were filed between November 2014 and March 2015. All these
matters were consolidated, and a Second Consolidated
Amended Class Action Complaint was eventually filed in July
2015. This C
­ omplaint also names as a defendant, among
others, BASF Corporation. On September 21, 2015, defendants filed a Joint Motion to Dismiss the Second Consolidated
Amended Class Action Complaint, and BML and BASF Corporation filed ­individual motions to dismiss. In addition, a pro
se complaint with similar allegations was filed in the same
court in S
­ eptember 2015, and is currently on a separate
schedule than the consoli­dated action. In spring 2015, the
European Commission conducted investigations into the allegation of anticompetitive practices in precious metal spot
trading within the E.U. and European Economic Area made
toward BASF and various banks. This investigation has not yet
returned results.
Furthermore, BASF SE and its affiliated companies are
defendants in or parties to a variety of judicial, arbitrational or
regulatory proceedings on a recurring basis. To our current
knowledge, none of these proceedings will have a material
effect on the economic situation of BASF.

27.1

Financial risks

Exposure and sensitivity by currency (in million €)

Market risks
Foreign currency risks: Changes in exchange rates could
lead to negative changes in the value of financial instruments
and adverse changes in future cash flows from planned transactions. Foreign currency risks from financial instruments result
from the translation at the closing rate of financial receivables,
loans, securities, cash and financial liabilities into the func­tional
currency of the respective Group company. Foreign currency
contracts in a variety of currencies are used to hedge foreign
exchange risks from primary financial instruments and planned
transactions.
The foreign currency risk exposure corresponds to the net
amount of the nominal volume of the primary and the derivative financial instruments which are exposed to currency risks.
In addition, planned purchase and sales transactions of the
respective following year are included, if they fall under the
currency risk management system. Opposite positions in the
same currency are offset against each other.
The sensitivity analysis is conducted by simulating a 10%
appreciation of the respective functional currency against the
other currencies. The effect on BASF’s income before taxes
and minority interests would have been minus €340 million as
of December 31, 2015, and minus €351 million as of December 31, 2014. The effect from the items designated under
hedge accounting would have increased the equity of the
shareholders of BASF SE before income taxes by €52 million
on December 31, 2015 (2014: increase of €48 million). After
the completion of the asset swap with Gazprom, this only
­refers to transactions in U.S. dollars. The currency exposure
amounted to €2,201 million on December 31, 2015 (December 31, 2014: €2,009 million).

Due to the use of options to hedge currency risks, the sensitivity analysis is not a linear function of the assumed changes
in exchange rates.
Interest rate risks: Interest rate risks result from changes
in prevailing market interest rates, which can cause a change
in the fair value of fixed-rate instruments, and changes in the
interest payments of variable-rate instruments. To hedge these
risks, interest rate swaps and combined interest rate and
­currency derivatives are used. While these risks are relevant to
the financing activities of BASF, they are not of material
­significance for BASF’s operating activities.
The variable interest exposure, which also includes fixed
rate bonds set to mature in the following year, amounted to
minus €2,786 million as of December 31, 2015, compared
with minus €3,343 million as of December 31, 2014. An
­increase in all relevant interest rates by one percentage point
would have raised income before taxes and minority interests
by €7 million as of December 31, 2015, and raised income
before taxes and minority interests by €12 million as of
­December 31, 2014. The effect from the items designated
under hedge accounting would have increased equity before
income taxes by €20 million on December 31, 2015 (2014:
increase of €30 million).

Commodity price risks: Some of BASF’s divisions are
­exposed to strong fluctuations in raw material prices. These
result primarily from raw materials (for example, naphtha, propylene, benzene, lauric oils, titanium dioxide, cyclohexane,
methanol, natural gas, butadiene, LPG condensate and
ammo­nia) as well as from precious metals. BASF takes the
following measures to reduce price risks associated with the
purchase of raw ­materials:
––BASF uses commodity derivatives to hedge the risks from
the volatility of raw material prices. These are primarily
­options and swaps on crude oil, oil products and natural
gas.
––In order to secure margins, the Oil & Gas segment used
commodity derivatives, primarily swaps on oil products, up
to the completion of the asset swap with Gazprom. Risks to
margins arise in volatile markets when purchase and sales
contracts are priced differently.
––The Catalysts division enters into both short-term and longterm purchase contracts with precious metal producers. It
also buys precious metals on spot markets from a variety of
business partners. The price risk from precious metals purchased to be sold on to third parties, or for use in the
­production of catalysts, is hedged using derivative instruments. This is mainly done using forward contracts which
are settled by either entering into offsetting contracts or by
delivering the precious metals.
––In the Crop Protection division, the sales prices of products
are sometimes coupled to the price of certain agricultural
commodities. To hedge the resulting risks, derivatives on
agricultural commodities are concluded.

BASF performs value-at-risk analyses for all commodity
­derivatives and precious metals trading positions. Using the
value-at-risk analysis, we continually quantify market risk and
forecast the maximum possible loss within a given confidence
interval over a defined period. The value-at-risk calculation is
based on a confidence interval of 95% and a holding period of
one day. The value-at-risk calculation for precious metals is
based on a confidence interval of 99%. BASF uses the
­variance-covariance approach.
BASF uses value at risk as a supplement to other risk
management tools. Besides value at risk, BASF sets
­volume-based limits as well as exposure and stop-loss limits.

In addition, BASF holds limited unhedged precious metal and
oil product positions, which can also include derivatives, for
trading on its own account. The value of these positions is
exposed to market price volatility and is subject to constant
monitoring.
In connection with CO2 emissions trading, various types of
CO2 certificates are purchased and sold using forward contracts. The goal of these transactions is to benefit from market
price differences. These deals are settled by physical delivery.
As of December 31, 2015 as well as of December 31, 2014,
there were no deals outstanding. BASF utilizes emission certificate derivatives on a limited scale.
By holding commodity derivatives and precious metal
trading positions, BASF is exposed to price risks. The valuation of commodity derivatives and precious metal trading positions at fair value means that adverse changes in market prices
could negatively affect the earnings and equity of BASF.

in the Management’s Report from page 113 onward

Default and credit risks arise when counterparties do not fulfill
their contractual obligations. BASF regularly analyzes the
creditworthiness of each significant debtor and grants credit
limits on the basis of this analysis. Due to the global activities
and diversified customer structure of the BASF Group, there is
no significant concentration of default risk. The carrying
amount of all receivables, loans and interest-bearing securities
plus the nominal value of other financial obligations subject to
default risk represents the maximum default risk for BASF.
For more information on credit risks, see Note 18 from page 196 onward

Liquidity risks
BASF promptly recognizes any risks from cash flow fluctuations as part of the liquidity planning. BASF has ready access
to sufficient liquid funds from our ongoing commercial paper
program and confirmed lines of credit from banks.

27.2 Maturity analysis
The interest and principal payments as well as other payments
for derivative financial instruments are relevant for the presentation of the maturities of the contractual cash flows from
­financial liabilities. Future cash flows are not discounted here.
Derivatives are included using their net cash flows, pro­
vided they have a negative fair value and therefore represent a
­liability. Derivatives with positive fair values are assets and are
therefore not considered.

Trade accounts payable are generally interest-free and due
within one year. Therefore the carrying amount of trade
­accounts payable equals the sum of future cash flows.

27.3 Classes and categories of financial

instruments
For trade accounts receivable, other receivables and miscellaneous assets, loans, cash and cash equivalents, as well as
trade accounts payable and other liabilities, the carrying
amount approximates the fair value. Shareholdings which are
not traded on an active market and whose fair value could not
be reliably determined are recognized at amortized cost and
are reported under other financial assets.

The fair value of financial indebtedness is determined on the
basis of interbank interest rates. The difference between carrying amounts and fair values results primarily from changes in
market interest rates.

The table “Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities”
shows the extent to which financial assets and financial
­liabilities are offset in the balance sheet, as well as potential
effects from the offsetting of instruments subject to a legally
enforceable global netting agreement or similar agreement.
For positive fair values from combined interest and cross-­
currency swaps, the respective counterparties provided cash
collaterals in the amount of the outstanding fair values.
Deviations from the derivatives with positive and negative
fair values reported in other receivables and other liabilities at
the end of 2015 and 2014 arose mainly from embedded
­derivatives as well as derivatives not subject to any netting
agreements and therefore are not included in the table above.

Net gains and losses from financial instruments comprise the
results of valuations, the amortization of discounts, the recognition and reversal of impairments, results from the translation
of foreign currencies as well as interest, dividends and all other
effects on the earnings resulting from financial instruments.
The line item financial instruments at fair value through profit or
loss contains only those gains and losses from instruments
which are not designated as hedging instruments as defined
by IAS 39. Net gains or net losses from available-for-sale
financial assets contain income and expenses from write­
downs/write-ups, interest, dividends and the reclassification of
valuation effects from equity on the sale of the securities and
shareholdings.

to the results from the translation of foreign currencies. Contrasting this were higher net gains from hedging transactions
as compared with the previous year.

27.4 Derivative instruments and hedge
accounting
The use of derivative instruments
BASF is exposed to foreign-currency, interest-rate and commodity-price risks during the normal course of business.
These risks are hedged through a centrally determined stra­
tegy employing derivative instruments. Hedging is only
­employed for underlying positions from the operating b
­ usiness,
cash investments, and financing as well as for planned sales,
raw material purchases and capital measures. The risks from
the underlying transactions and the derivatives are constantly

Consolidated Financial S
­ tatements
Notes — Notes on balance sheet

monitored. Where derivatives have a positive market value,
BASF is exposed to credit risks from derivative transactions in
the event of nonperformance of the other party. To minimize
the default risk on derivatives with positive market values,
transactions are exclusively conducted with creditworthy
banks and partners and are subject to predefined credit limits.
To ensure effective risk management, risk positions are
centralized at BASF SE and certain Group companies. The
contracting and execution of derivative ﬁnancial instruments
for hedging purposes are conducted according to internal
guidelines, and subject to strict control mechanisms.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments are
­calculated using valuation models which use input parameters
observable on the market. Exceptions to this are some
­commodity derivatives, whose valuation is based directly on
market prices.

Cash flow hedge accounting
Some of the planned purchases of naphtha are hedged using
swaps and options on oil and oil products. Some of these
hedges were shown in the Consolidated Financial Statements
of the BASF Group by means of cash flow hedge accounting,
where gains and losses from hedges were initially recognized
directly in equity. Gains and losses from hedges are included
in cost of sales at the point in time at which the hedged item is
recognized in the consolidated statement of income.
Furthermore, cash flow hedge accounting is used to a
minor extent for natural gas purchases.
Cash flow hedge accounting was applied in the Natural
Gas Trading business sector for crude oil swaps concluded in
order to hedge price risks from purchase and sales contracts
for natural gas to the completion of the asset swap with
­Gazprom. These contracts had variable prices and the price
formula was coupled with the oil price.

The planned transactions and their effect on earnings ­occur in
the year following the balance sheet date. In 2015, effective
changes in the fair value of hedging instruments of €35 million
(2014: minus €322 million) was recognized in the equity of the
shareholders of BASF SE. In 2015, effective changes in the fair
value of hedging instruments of €174 million were derecognized from the equity of shareholders of BASF SE and ­recorded
as an expense in cost of sales. In 2014, there was an e
­ xpense
of €19 million in this regard. The ineffective part in the change
in value of the hedge amounted to minus €2 million in 2015
and minus €4 million in 2014. This amount was reported in the
income statement in cost of sales, in other operating income
and in other operating expenses.

BASF used cash flow hedge accounting for derivatives used
to hedge foreign currency risks from gas purchase and sales
contracts to the completion of the asset swap with Gazprom.
In 2015 up to the completion date, the effective change in
values of the hedges was minus €150 million (2014: minus
€110 million), which was recognized in the equity of the
­shareholders of BASF SE. There were no ineffective parts. The
amounts derecognized from the equity of shareholders of
BASF SE increased cost of sales by €161 million to the
­completion date (2014: €101 million).
BASF also uses cash flow hedge accounting for some
foreign currency derivatives to hedge planned sales
­denominated in U.S. dollars. The impact on earnings from the
underlying transactions will occur in 2016. In 2015, the
­effective change in values of the hedges was minus €23 million
(2014: minus €66 million), which was recognized in the equity
of the shareholders of BASF SE. A total of €29 million (2014:
€37 million) was derecognized from the equity of shareholders
of BASF SE and was booked in expenses from foreign
­currency transactions. The hedge was entirely effective.

The interest rate risk of the floating rate notes issued by
BASF SE in 2014 (€300 million variable-rate bond 2014/2017)
as well as the floating rate notes issued in 2013 were hedged
using interest rate swaps. The bonds and the interest rate
swaps were d
­ esignated in a hedging relationship. In 2015, the
effective change in the fair value of the hedging instruments
was €3 million (2014: minus €22 million) and was recognized
in the e
­ quity of the shareholders of BASF SE. There were no
ineffective parts.
Furthermore, BASF SE’s fixed-rate U.S. private placement
of $1.25 billion, issued in 2013, was converted into euros
­using currency swaps. This hedge was designated as a cash
flow hedge. The hedge was entirely effective. In 2015, the
change in values recognized in the equity of the shareholders
of BASF SE amounted to €157 million (2014: €38 million). In
2015, €119 million was derecognized from other comprehensive income and recorded as income in the financial result
(2014: €110 million income in financial result).

Consolidated Financial S
­ tatements
Notes — Other explanatory notes

In 2015 and in 2014, no additional lease payments exceeding
minimum lease payments due to contractual conditions for
­finance leases were recognized in the income statement. In
2015 and 2014, leasing liabilities were not offset by any
­significant future minimum lease payments from subleases.
In addition, BASF is a lessee under operating lease
­contracts. The lease commitments totaling €1,554 million in
2015 (2014: €1,587 million) are due in the following years:

In 2015, minimum lease payments of €474 million (2014:
€384 million) were included in income from operations. In
2015, conditional lease payments of €1 million were also
­included in income from operations (2014: €1 million). Furthermore, €4 million from sublease payments was included in
­income from operations in 2015 (2014: €4 million).

Commitments from operating lease contracts (in million €)

BASF acts as a lessor for finance leases to a minor extent only.
Receivables on finance leases were €41 million in 2015 (2014:
€43 million).
In 2015, claims arising from operating leases amounted to
€83 million (2014: €100 million).

Cash provided by operating activities also included
€248 million in benefits paid (2014: €47 million), which are
covered by a contractual trust arrangement.
Cash used in investing activities included €215 million in
payments made for acquisitions (2014: €963 million), e
­ specially
for the acquisition of a 66% share in a company into which
TODA KOGYO CORP., Hiroshima, Japan, contributed its business with cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries, p
­ atents
and production capacities in Japan. In the previous year,
payments had been made for such purchases as shares in
producing oil and gas fields as well as exploration licenses
from Statoil Petroleum AS, Stavanger, Norway, and Tullow Oil
Norge AS, Oslo, Norway.

Payments of €651 million were received for divestitures (2014:
€1,336 million) in relation to transactions such as the sale of
portions of the pharmaceutical ingredients and services
­business to Siegfried Holding AG, Zofingen, Switzerland. In
the previous year, payments had been received particularly
from the sale of the 50% share in Styrolution Holding GmbH,
Frankfurt am Main, Germany, to the INEOS Group; this also
gave rise to payments received in 2015.
The payments for property, plant and equipment, and
intangible assets in the amount of €5,812 million included
­
­investments for 2015, to the extent that they already had an
effect on cash.
Cash and cash equivalents were not subject to any
­utilization restrictions, as in the previous year.
For more information on cash flow from acquisitions and divestitures,
see Note 2.4 from page 175 onward

Capital structure management
The aim of capital structure management is to maintain the
­financial flexibility needed to further develop BASF’s business
portfolio and take advantage of strategic opportunities. The
objectives of the Company’s financing policy are to secure
solvency, limit financial risks and optimize the cost of capital.

217

218

Consolidated Financial ­Statements 
Notes — Other explanatory notes

Capital structure management focuses on meeting the
­requirements needed to ensure unrestricted access to capital
markets and a solid A rating. BASF’s capital structure is
managed using selected financial ratios, such as dynamic
­
debt ratios, as part of the company’s financial planning. The
equity of the BASF Group as reported in the balance sheet
amounted to €31,545 million as of December 31, 2015
­(December 31, 2014: €28,195 million); the equity ratio was
44.5% on December 31, 2015 (December 31, 2014: 39.5%).
BASF prefers to access external financing on the capital
markets. A commercial paper program is used for short-term
financing, while corporate bonds are used for financing in the
medium and long term. These are issued in euros and other
currencies with different maturities. The goal is to create a
balanced maturity profile and diverse range of investors, and
to optimize our debt capital financing conditions.
As a part of risk management, activities in countries with
transfer restrictions are continuously monitored. This includes,
for example, regular analysis of the macroeconomic and legal
environment, shareholders’ equity and the business models of
the operating units. The chief aim is the reduction of counterparty, transfer and currency risks for the BASF Group.

Rating agency Moody’s last confirmed their rating of “A1/P-1

adjus­ted the outlook of their “A+/A-1” rating to “negative” on
April 10, 2015. This was mainly due to an increase in pension
provisions as a result of declining capital market interest rates.
BASF continues to strive for at least a solid A rating, which
ensures unrestricted access to financial and capital markets.

Share-price-based compensation program and BASF incentive share program

Share-price-based compensation program
In 2015, BASF continued its share-price-based compensation
program known as the long-term incentive (LTI) program for
senior executives of the BASF Group. This program has been
in place since 1999. Approximately 1,200 senior executives,
including the Board of Executive Directors, are currently
­entitled to participate in this program. This program provides
for the granting of virtual options, which are settled in cash
when exercised.
Participation in the LTI program is voluntary. In order to
take part in the program, a participant must make a personal
investment: A participant must hold BASF shares amounting
to 10% to 30% of his or her individual variable compensation
for a two-year period from the granting of the option (holding
period). The number of shares to be held is determined by the
amount of variable compensation and the volume-weighted
average market price for BASF shares on the first business
day after the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, which was €88.72
on May 4, 2015.
The participant receives four option rights per invested
share. Each option consists of two parts, right A and right B,
which may be exercised if defined thresholds have been met:
The threshold of right A is met if the price of the BASF share
has increased by more than 30% in comparison with the base
price (absolute threshold). The value of right A will be the
­difference between the market price of BASF shares on the
exercise date and the base price; it is limited to 100% of the
base price. Right B may be exercised if the cumulative
percentage performance of BASF shares exceeds (relative
­

threshold) the percentage performance of the MSCI World
Chemicals IndexSM (MSCI Chemicals). The value of right B will
be the base price of the option multiplied by twice the
­percentage outperformance of BASF shares compared with
the MSCI Chemicals Index on the exercise date. It is limited to
the closing price on the date of exercise minus the computed
nominal value of BASF shares. Beginning with the 2013 LTI
program, right B is only valuable if the price of BASF shares at
least corresponds with the base price. The options were
granted on July 1, 2015, and may be exercised following a
two-year vesting period, between July 1, 2017, and June 30,
2023. During the exercise period, there are certain times
(closed periods) during which the options may not be exercised. Each option can only be exercised in full. This means
that one of the performance targets must be surpassed. If the
other performance target is not surpassed and the option is
exercised, the other option right lapses. A participant’s
­maximum gain from exercising an option is limited to five times
the original individual investment starting with the 2013 LTI
program. The maximum gain from exercising an option is
limited to ten times the original individual investment for
­
­programs from previous years. Option rights are nontransferable and are forfeited if the option holders no longer work for
BASF or have sold part of their individual investment before
the expiry of the two-year vesting period. They remain valid in
the case of retirement. For the members of the Board of
­Executive Directors, the long-term orientation of the program
is significantly strengthened compared with the conditions
applying to the other participants. The members of the Board
of Executive Directors are required to participate in the LTI

program with at least 10% of their gross bonus. In view of this
binding personal investment (in the form of BASF shares), an
extended holding period of four years applies. Members of the
Board of Executive Directors may only exercise their options at
least four years after they have been granted (vesting period).
The 2008 to 2014 programs were structured in a similar
way to the LTI program 2015.
The models used in the valuation of the option plans are
based on the arbitrage-free valuation model according to
Black-Scholes. The fair values of the options are determined
using the binomial model.

BASF incentive share program
All employees are entitled to participate in the “plus” incentive
share program, with the exception of those entitled to participate in the LTI program. The “plus” incentive share program
was introduced in 1999 and is currently offered in Germany,
other European countries and Mexico. Each participant must
make an individual investment in BASF shares from his or her
variable compensation. For every ten BASF shares purchased
in the program, a participant receives one BASF share at no
cost after one, three, five, seven and ten years of holding the
BASF shares. As a rule, the first and second block of ten
shares entitles the participant to receive one BASF share at no
extra cost in each of the next ten years.
The right to receive free BASF shares lapses if a participant
sells the individual investment in BASF shares, if the participant
stops working for the Company or one year after retirement.
The number of free shares to be granted has developed as
follows:
Number of free shares to be granted

As of January 1

As of December 31, 2015, the fair values and the valuation
parameters relate to the LTI programs 2015 and 2014. The fair
value calculation was based on the assumption that options
will be exercised in a manner dependent on their potential
gains. For the programs from preceding years, corresponding
fair values were computed and valuation parameters were
used.
Volatility was determined on the basis of the monthly
­closing prices over a historical period corresponding to the
remaining term of the options.
The number of options granted amounted to 1,807,532 in
2015 (2014: 1,870,440).
As a result of a resolution by the Board of Executive
­Directors in 2002 to settle options in cash, options outstanding
from the programs 2008 to 2015 were valued with the fair
value as of the balance sheet date December 31, 2015. A
proportionate provision is recorded for programs in the vesting
period. The LTI provision increased from €207 million as of
December 31, 2014, to €222 million as of December 31,
2015, due to a higher number of outstanding options. The
utilization of provisions amounted to €34 million in 2015 (2014:
€106 million). Expenses arising from additions to the provision
amounted to €49 million in 2015. The previous year had
­included income of €54 million.
The total intrinsic value of exercisable options amounted to
€34 million as of December 31, 2015, and €41 million as of
December 31, 2014.

The free shares to be provided by the Company are measured
at the fair value on the grant date. Fair value is determined on
the basis of the stock price of BASF shares, taking into
­account the present value of dividends, which are not paid
during the term of the program. The weighted-average fair
value on the grant date amounted to €71.55 for the 2015
program, and €64.73 for the 2014 program.
The fair value of the free shares to be granted is recognized
as an expense with a corresponding increase in capital surplus
over the term of the program.
Personnel expenses of €27 million were recorded in 2015
for the BASF incentive share program “plus” (2014: €26 million).

Performance-related compensation for the Board of Executive
Directors is based on the return on assets, as well as the
performance of the entire Board. Return on assets corre­
sponds to earnings before taxes plus borrowing costs as a
percentage of average assets.
The members of the Board of Executive Directors were
granted 173,064 options under the long-term incentive (LTI)
program in 2015.

The market valuation of the options of active and former
­members of the Board resulted in expenses of €6.6 million in
2015. In 2014, the market valuation of the options resulted in
income of €3.7 million.

BASF Report 2015 

Sales and trade accounts receivable from and trade accounts
payable to related parties mainly included business with own
products and merchandise, agency and licensing businesses,
and other operating business.
Other receivables and liabilities primarily arose from
financing activities, outstanding dividend payments, profit­
and-loss transfer agreements and other finance-related and
operating activities and events.
The decline of €1,621 million in sales to associated
­companies in 2015 was mainly due to the fact that transactions with Styrolution Group companies were to be classified
as transactions with associated companies only until the sale
of ­Styrolution in November 2014.
The outstanding balances toward related parties were
generally not secured and settled in cash. As in the previous
year, there were no significant valuation allowances in 2015 for
trade accounts receivable from related parties. ­
Valuation
allow­ances of €17 million were recognized as an expense for
other receivables from nonconsolidated sub­sidiaries. The balance of valuation allowances for other receivables from nonconsolidated subsidiaries therefore rose from €22 million as of
December 31, 2014, to €39 million as of December 31, 2015.
In 2014, there had been no material expenses from valuation
allowances for other receivables from related parties.
There were obligations from guarantees and other financial obligations at BASF in favor of nonconsolidated sub­
sidiaries in the amount of €45 million in 2015 (2014: €8 million)
and in favor of associated companies in the amount of
€37 million in 2015 (2014: €27 million).

Consolidated Financial S

Notes — Other explanatory notes

On December 31, 2015, obligations arising from purchase
contracts with associated companies amounted to €29 million. There were no material obligations arising from purchase
contracts with joint ventures on December 31, 2015. On
Decem­ber 31, 2014, purchase obligations with joint ventures
arising from natural gas purchasing contracts amounted to
€32,561 million. Their discontinuation is attributable to the
disposal of Wintershall Erdgas Handelshaus GmbH & Co. KG,
based in Kassel, Germany, which occurred on September 30,
2015, as part of the asset swap with Gazprom.
Effective December 31, 2015, the present value of the
outstanding minimum rental payments for an office building
including parking area payable by BASF SE to BASF Pen­
sionskasse VVaG for the nonterminable basic rental period to
2029 amounted to €60 million.
There were no reportable related party transactions with
members of the Board of Executive Directors or the S
­ upervisory
Board and their related parties in 2015.

trademarks, as well as the transfer of two production sites in

England and in South Africa. It is subject to consultation with
employee representatives and certain regulatory approvals. At
BASF, the industrial coatings business generated around
€300 million in sales in 2015. BASF and AkzoNobel intend to
complete the transaction by the end of 2016.

Supplementary Information on the Oil & Gas Segment
(Unaudited)
The following provides supplementary information on the
Explo­ration & Production business sector of the Oil & Gas
segment. In the absence of detailed disclosure rules in this
area under IFRS, the Group has elected to disclose the following information in accordance with SFAS 69 (Disclosure of Oil
and Gas Producing Activities) and the Securities and Exchange
Commission. In order to present economically meaningful
repor­
ting on the cooperation with Gazprom in the Yuzhno
Russkoye and Achimgaz projects in Russia, several modifications have been made to SFAS 69. BASF has a total interest of
35% in the economic rewards of the Yuzhno Russkoye field
through Severneftegazprom (SNG), the company which holds
the production license. SNG is accounted for using the equity
method. Marketing of the natural gas is carried out by a separate, fully consolidated company. For the Achimgaz project,
in which BASF has an interest of 50%, full field development
was started after the successful completion of the pilot phase
in 2011.
In the course of the asset swap with Gazprom completed
in 2015, BASF received an economic share of 25.01% in
two ­additional blocks of the Achimov formation of the Urengoy
field in western Siberia. In return, Gazprom received the entire
gas trading and storage business – which was previously
jointly operated – as well as a share of 50% in Wintershall
Noordzee B.V.
In the following overviews, BASF’s stake in both projects is
included under “Russia.” In addition, the values for SNG,
which is accounted for using the equity method, are presented
separately.
As a result of the application of IFRS 10/11, the German
Wintershall subsidiary with production and exploration rights in
the Libyan onshore concessions 96 and 97, in which BASF
has an interest of 51%, and Wintershall Noordzee B.V., are
accounted for using the equity method as per IAS 28. All fully
consolidated subsidiaries are included with 100%.
The following table provides an overview of the most important
differences between the information given for the Exploration &
Production business sector in the Consolidated Financial
Statement of the BASF Group and the supplemental information for the Oil & Gas segment.

Oil and gas reserves
Proven oil and gas reserves are the volumes of crude oil, natural gas and condensate that, according to the geological,
engineering and economic conditions prevailing at the balance
sheet date, can be produced in future years. Accordingly,
­reserve estimates based on this data could be materially different from the volumes that are ultimately recovered. To reduce
uncertainties, Wintershall works together with independent,
internationally recognized reserve auditors to perform recurring reserves audits of its major crude oil and natural gas fields.
The tables on the following pages show the company’s
estimated proven and proven developed reserves as of
Decem­ber 31, 2014, and December 31, 2015, as well as
changes attributable to production or other factors.

Operating income from oil and gas-producing
activities
Operating income represents only those revenues and
expenses directly associated with oil and gas production.
­
These amounts do not include financing costs (such as interest expenses) or corporate overhead costs and therefore do

not correspond with the contributions to the Oil & Gas
segment. The deviations in sales compared with segment
repor­ting are the result of merchandise and service transactions not shown here, as well as the proportional inclusion of
companies accounted for using the equity method in the
IFRS-­
based Financial Statements. Estimated income taxes
were computed using local applicable income tax rates.

Capitalized exploration drilling:
Suspended well costs

Standardized measure of discounted future
net cash flows relating to proven oil and gas
reserves

Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized until the drilling of the
well is complete. If hydrocarbon reserves are found whose
commercial development is likely, the costs continue to be
capitalized as construction in progress, subject to further
apprai­sal activity that may include the drilling of further wells.
All such capitalized costs are subject to technical and commercial review by the management at least once a year to
confirm the continued intent to develop or otherwise extract
value from the discovery. If this is no longer the case, the costs
are written off. If proven reserves of oil or natural gas are
determined and development is sanctioned, the relevant
­
­expenses are transferred within property, plant and equipment
to machinery and technical equipment. Impairments for
unsuc­cessful exploration wells are recognized in exploration
expenses.
The following table indicates the changes to the capitalized
costs of exploration drilling.

The following information was calculated in accordance with
the rules of U.S. GAAP standard SFAS 69 and the Securities
and Exchange Commission. Based on this, a standardized
measure of discounted future net cash flows with the relevant
revenues, costs and income tax rates is to be made. The
proven reserves are v­alued at the average price calculated
from the prices on the first day of the month. The values thus
determined are discounted at a 10% annual discount rate.
The projected values should not be understood as a realistic estimate of future cash flows. Furthermore, the total value
of future net cash flows should not be interpreted as representing the current enterprise value.
In the future, expected proven reserves may differ significantly from current estimates. Development and production of
the reserves may not occur in the period assumed and actual
prices and costs may vary considerably.
BASF’s operating decisions and the implementation of its
investment projects are not based on the information pre­
sented below, but on a wider range of reserve estimates, as
well as on different price and cost ­assumptions.
Beyond the above considerations, the “standardized measure of future net cash flows” is also not directly comparable
with asset balances appearing elsewhere in the Consolidated
Financial Statements because any such comparison would
require a reconciliation adjustment.

BASF Report 2015

Glossary

A
Associated companies
These are companies over whose operating and financial policies
BASF can exercise significant influence, and which are not subsidi­
aries, joint ventures or joint operations. In general, this applies to
companies in which BASF has an interest of 20% to 50%.
Audits
Audits are a strategic tool for monitoring and directing standards.
During a site or plant audit, clearly defined criteria are used to create
a profile on topics such as environment, safety or health.
B
Backup line
A backup line is a confirmed line of credit that can be drawn upon in
connection with the issue of commercial paper if market liquidity is
not sufficient, or for the purpose of general corporate financing. It
is one of the instruments BASF uses to ensure it is able to make
payments at all times.
Barrel of oil equivalent (BOE)
A barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) is an international unit of measurement for comparing the energy content of different fuels. It is equal
to one barrel of crude oil, or 6,000 cubic feet (169 cubic meters) of
natural gas.
Biotechnology
Biotechnology includes all processes and products that make use
of living organisms, such as bacteria and yeasts, or their cellular
constituents.
BDO
BDO stands for 1,4-Butanediol and is a BASF intermediate. BDO
and its derivatives are used for producing plastics, polyurethanes,
solvents, electronic chemicals and elastic fibers.
C
CO2 equivalents
CO2 equivalents are units for measuring the impact of greenhouse
gas emissions on the greenhouse effect. A factor known as the
global warming potential (GWP) shows the impact of the individual
gases compared with CO2 as the reference value.
Commercial paper program
The commercial paper program is a framework agreement between
BASF and banks regarding the issuing of debt obligations on the
­financial market (commercial paper). The commercial paper is i­ssued
under a rolling program for which the terms can be determined individually. This requires a good rating.
Compliance
Compliance is an important element of corporate governance. It
­refers to the company’s behavior in accordance with laws, guidelines and voluntary codices.

Consumer goods sector
The consumer goods sector includes, for example, the textiles and
leather industry, the electrical industry and domestic appliance
manufacturing, as well as the paper industry and the personal care
and cleaners sector.
D
Dodd-Frank Act
The Dodd-Frank Act issued in 2010 comprises accounting and
­disclosure obligations for publicly listed U.S. companies regarding
the use of certain raw materials that come from the Democratic
Republic of Congo or its bordering countries. The companies must
prove whether the materials they use are from conflict mines in these
areas. The definition of conflict minerals as per the Dodd-Frank Act
includes the following materials and their derivatives: Columbitetantalite (coltan), cassiterite, wolframite and gold.
E
EBIT
Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT): At BASF, EBIT c
­ orresponds
to income from operations.
EBIT after cost of capital
EBIT after cost of capital is calculated by deducting the cost of
capital from the EBIT of the operating divisions. The cost of capital
thereby reflects the shareholders’ expectations regarding return (in
the form of dividends or share price increases) and interest payable
to creditors. If the EBIT after cost of capital has a positive value, we
have earned a premium on our cost of capital.
EBITDA
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA): At BASF, EBITDA corresponds to income from operations
­before depreciation and amortization (impairments and write-ups).
EBITDA margin
The EBITDA margin is the margin that we earn on sales from our
operating activities before depreciation and amortization. It is
calculated as income from operations before depreciation and
­
amortization as a percentage of sales.
Eco-Efficiency Analysis
The Eco-Efficiency Analysis is a method developed by BASF for
­assessing the economic and environmental aspects of products and
processes. The aim is to compare products with regard to ­profitability
and environmental compatibility.
Ecosystem services
Companies simultaneously rely on, and have an impact on, ecosystem services, such as the conservation of air, water and soil quality.
Biodiversity – or the variety of life forms on our planet – serves as a
basis of and indicator for the integrity of ecological systems.

BASF Report 2015 

Enhanced oil recovery (EOR)
Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods, also called tertiary recovery
or tertiary production methods, are used to increase the recovery
factor from oil reservoirs. Different technologies are employed
­depending on reservoir conditions; a distinction is generally made
between thermal and chemical EOR and miscible gas flooding,
which makes use of gases such as carbon dioxide.

Glossary﻿

Global Product Strategy (GPS)
The Global Product Strategy aims to establish global product
­stewardship standards and practices for companies. The program,
initiated by the International Council of Chemical Associations,
strives to ensure the safe handling of chemicals by reducing existing
differences in risk assessment.

Equity method
The equity method is used to account for shareholdings in joint
ventures and associated companies. Based on the acquisition costs
of the shareholding as of the acquisition date, the carrying amount is
continuously adjusted to the changes in equity of the company in
which the share is held.

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)
The Global Reporting Initiative is a multistakeholder organization.
It was established in 1997 with the aim of developing a guideline
for companies’ and organizations’ voluntary reporting on their
­economic, environmental and social activities. Since 2003, BASF
has followed this globally recognized standard in sustainability
repor­ting and is involved in the standard’s further development.

European Water Stewardship (EWS) Standard
The European Water Stewardship (EWS) Standard enables businesses and agriculture to assess the sustainability of their water
management practices. The criteria are water abstraction volumes,
water quality, conservation of biodiversity and water governance.
The Europe-wide standard came into force at the end of 2011 and
was developed by nongovernmental organizations, governments
and businesses under the direction of the independent organization
European Water Partnership (EWP).

Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol)
The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, used by companies in different sectors as well as nongovernmental organizations and governments, is
a globally recognized standard to quantify and manage greenhouse
gas emissions. The reporting standards and recommendations for
implementing projects to reduce emissions are jointly developed by
companies, nongovernmental organizations and governments
­under the guidance of the World Resources Institute and the World
Business Council for Sustainable Development.

Exploration
Exploration refers to the search for mineral resources, such as crude
oil or natural gas, in the Earth’s crust. The exploration process
­involves using suitable geophysical methods to find structures that
may contain oil and gas, then proving a possible discovery by means
of exploratory drilling.
F
Field development
Field development is the term for the installation of production
facilities and the drilling of production wells for the commercial
­
­exploitation of oil and natural gas deposits.
Formulation
Formulation describes the combination of one or more active
substances with excipients like emulsifiers, stabilizers and other
­
­inactive components in order to improve the applicability and effectiveness of various products, such as cosmetics, pharmaceuticals,
agricultural chemicals, paints and coatings.
Free cash flow
Free cash flow is cash provided by operating activities less payments related to property, plant and equipment and intangible
­assets.
G
Global Compact
In the United Nations Global Compact network, nongovernmental
organizations, companies, international business and employee
representatives, scientists and politicians work on aligning global
business with the principles of sustainable development. As a
founding member of Global Compact, BASF is committed to
­upholding the ten principles in the categories human rights, labor
relations, environmental protection and corruption. We regularly
­report on our implementation of the principles.

H
Health Performance Index (HPI)
The Health Performance Index is an indicator developed by BASF to
provide more detailed insight into our approach to health management. It comprises five components: confirmed occupational
­diseases, medical emergency drills, first aid, preventive medicine
and health promotion.
I
IAS
IAS stands for International Accounting Standards (see also IFRS).
IFRS
The International Financial Reporting Standards (until 2001: International Accounting Standards, IAS) are developed and published
by the International Accounting Standards Board, headquartered
in London, England. The “IAS Regulation” made the application of
IFRSs mandatory for listed companies headquartered in the
­
­European Union starting in 2005.
ILO Core Labor Standards
The ILO Core Labor Standards are set out in a declaration of the
International Labor Organization (ILO), comprising eight conventions
that set minimum requirements for decent working conditions. BASF
has a Group-wide system to monitor employees’ and suppliers’
adherence to these labor standards.
ISO 14001
ISO 14001 is an international standard developed by the I­ nternational
Organization for Standardization (ISO) that determines the general
requirements for an environmental management system for voluntary certification.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is an international nongovernmental organization that aims to raise awareness
for the protection of species and to contribute to the sustainable use
and conservation of resources. IUCN classifies the world’s protected
areas. Categories I, II and III refer to “Strict Nature Reserve and
­Wilderness Area,” “National Park” and “Natural Monuments or Features,” respectively.

BASF Report 2015

M
Materiality analysis/material aspects
BASF uses the materiality analysis to gain information from internal
and external stakeholders about the significance of sustainability
topics. The results, which are grouped into eight material aspects of
sustainability, help BASF identify present and future opportunities
and risks for its business and develop strategies to address these at
an early stage.
MDI
MDI stands for diphenylmethane diisocyanate and is one of the
most important raw materials for the production of the plastic polyurethane. This plastic is used for applications ranging from the soles
of high-tech running shoes and shock absorbers for vehicle engines
to insulation for refrigerators and buildings.

J

Million British thermal unit (mmBtu)
The British thermal unit (Btu) is a unit of energy observed in the
­Anglo-American measuring system. It is used for indicating values
such as the energy content gas. One mmBtu (million British thermal
units) is equal to approximately 1,003 cubic feet of gas or 28 cubic
meters of gas.

Joint arrangement
A joint arrangement refers to joint ventures and joint operations, and
describes a jointly controlled arrangement of two or more parties.
This arrangement exists if decisions about relevant activities require
the unanimous consent of all parties sharing control.

Monitoring system
Monitoring systems and tools serve to measure and ensure the
­adherence to standards. One area that is monitored is our voluntary
commitments, such as the adherence to human rights and internationally recognized labor standards.

Joint operation
A joint operation is a joint arrangement in which the parties that
share control have direct rights to the assets and liabilities relating to
the arrangement. For joint operations, the proportional share of
­assets, liabilities, income and expenses are reported in the BASF
Group Consolidated Financial Statements.

MSCI World Chemicals Index
The MSCI World Chemicals Index is a stock index that includes the
world’s biggest chemical companies. It measures the performance of
the companies in the index in their respective national currencies,
thus considerably reducing currency effects.

Joint venture
A joint venture is a joint arrangement in which the parties that
have joint control of a legally independent entity have rights to the
net assets of that arrangement. Joint ventures are accounted for
using the equity method in the BASF Group Consolidated Financial
­Statements.

N

L
Long-term incentive program (LTI)
The long-term incentive program is a share-price-based compensation program for senior executives of the BASF Group and members
of the Board of Executive Directors. The program aims to tie a portion of the participants’ compensation to the long-term, absolute
and relative performance of BASF shares.

Nanomaterials
The International Organization for Standardization defines nanomaterials as materials with one or more external dimensions on a
n­
­
anoscale or with internal structure or surface structure on a
­nanoscale. For regulatory purposes, there are additional definitions
for nanomaterials worldwide.
Naphtha
Naphtha is petroleum that is produced during oil refining. Heavy
naphtha is the starting point for gasoline production. Light naphtha
is the most important feedstock for steam crackers.
NMVOC (Nonmethane Volatile Organic Compounds)
VOCs (volatile organic compounds) are organic substances that are
present in the air as gas at low temperatures. These include some
hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes and organic acids. NMVOCs are
VOCs from which methane is excluded.

O
OHSAS 18001
The Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series (OHSAS)
includes the standard OHSAS 18001, which contains a management system for occupational safety. This system can be integrated
into an existing quality and environmental protection management
system and certified accordingly.
P
Patent Asset Index
The Patent Asset Index measures the strength of a company’s
­patent portfolio. It is made up of two factors: (1) portfolio size (the
number of worldwide active patent families) and (2) competitive
impact, which is the combination of technology relevance and
­
­market coverage (weighted by market size).
Peak sales potential
The peak sales potential of the crop protection pipeline describes the
total peak sales generated and expected for individual products in
the pipeline. It comprises innovative active ingredients and system
solutions that have been on the market since 2015 or will be launched
on the market by 2025. The peak sales potential of individual products corresponds to the highest sales value to be expected from one
year of the observation period.
Propylene oxide (PO)
Propylene oxide (PO), a very reactive compound, is generated by
the oxidation of propylene and is used as basic chemical for further
processing in the chemical industry.
R
Ramsar Site
Ramsar Sites were defined in the Ramsar Convention of 1971.
These are protected Wetlands of International Importance, such as
lagoons, moors, lakes, rivers and marshlands.
REACH
REACH is a European Union regulatory framework for the registration, evaluation and authorization of chemicals, and will be implemented gradually until 2018. Companies are obligated to collect
data on the properties and uses of produced and imported
substances and to assess any risks. The European Chemicals
­
Agency reviews the submitted dossiers and, if applicable, requests
additional information.
Renewable resources
The term renewable resources refers to components from biomass
that originate from different sources (plants and microorganisms,
for example), and are used for industrial purposes. Renewable
­resources are used for manufacturing numerous products and for
generating electricity and other forms of energy.
Responsible Care
Responsible Care refers to a worldwide initiative by the chemical
industry to continuously improve its performance in the areas of
environmental protection, health and safety.

Glossary﻿

Retention
Profits generated can be used in two ways: distributed to shareholders or kept within the company. The latter is referred to as retention.
Return on assets
Return on assets describes the return we make on the average
­assets employed during the year. It is calculated as income before
taxes and minority interests plus interest expenses as a percentage
of average assets.
S
Special items
Special items describe one-time charges or one-time income that
significantly affect the earnings of a segment or the BASF Group.
Special items include, for example, charges arising from restructuring measures or earnings from divestitures.
Spot market (cash market)
A spot market is a market where an agreed-upon deal, including
delivery, acceptance and payment, occurs immediately, as opposed
to forward contracts, where the delivery, acceptance and payment
occurs at a point in time after the conclusion of the deal.
Steam cracker
A steam cracker is a plant in which steam is used to “crack” naphtha
(petroleum) or natural gas. The resulting petrochemicals are the raw
materials used to produce most of BASF’s products.
Sustainable Solution Steering®
We use Sustainable Solution Steering® to review and guide our
portfolio in terms of sustainability. The four categories – ­Accelerators,
Performers, Transitioners and Challenged – indicate how our products and solutions already comply with sustainability requirements
and how we can increase their contribution.
T
TDI
TDI stands for toluene diisocyanate and is a raw material for the
production of polyurethane. It is used primarily in the automotive
­industry (for example, in seat cushions and interiors) and the furniture industry (for example, for flexible foams for mattresses or
cushioning, or in wood coating).
TUIS
TUIS is a German transport accident information and emergency
response system jointly operated by around 130 chemical companies. The member companies can be reached by the public authorities at any time and provide assistance over the telephone, expert
on-site advice or special technical equipment.
U
UNESCO protected area
UNESCO protected areas, or World Heritage Sites, are natural sites
of exceptional value. These important habitats can be home to
­endangered plant and animal species.

V
Value chain
A value chain describes the successive steps in a production process: from raw materials through various intermediate steps, such
as transportation and production, to the finished product.
Verbund
In the BASF Verbund (pronounced “fair-boond”), production facilities, energy flow, logistics and infrastructure are intelligently networked with each other in order to increase production yields, save
resources and energy, and reduce logistics costs. We also make
use of the Verbund principle for more than production, applying it
for technologies, knowledge, employees, customers, and partners,
as well.
W
Water stress areas
Water stress areas are areas in which water represents a scarce
­resource, and where people abstract more than 60% of the water
available. The most important factors leading to water scarcity are:
low precipitation, high temperatures, low air humidity, unfavorable
soil properties and high water abstraction rates.
White biotechnology
White biotechnology is an area of biotechnology, also called industrial biotechnology, which uses microorganisms and/or enzymes to
produce chemical products that are utilized in many levels of the
value chain in the chemical industry.
