covered by this report - Merck used a reporting structure

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

consisting of four divisions: Merck Serono, Consumer
Health, Performance Materials, and Merck Millipore. The
following profile likewise reflects this structure.
In line with our strategic direction effective January 1,
2015, Merck has now been organized into three business
sectors: Healthcare, Performance Materials and Life
Science, which comprise the Group’s six businesses. This
structure will be used in the Merck Group's reports as of
January 1, 2015.
Merck Serono discovers, develops, manufactures, and
markets innovative pharmaceutical and biological
prescription drugs to treat cancer, multiple sclerosis (MS),
infertility, and growth disorders, as well as certain
cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Headquartered in
Darmstadt, Germany, Merck Serono offers leading brands

Corporate governance

Group strategy

Merck is operated in the legal form of a
Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien (KGaA, corporation
with general partners) and is headquartered in Darmstadt,
Germany. The general partner E. Merck KG holds around
70% of the total capital of Merck KGaA (equity interest);
the shareholders hold the remainder, which is divided into
shares (share capital). Merck shares have been included in
the DAX® 30, the blue chip index of the Deutsche Börse,
since 2007. In September 2008, Merck was added to the
FTSE4Good Index, a sustainability index that evaluates the
social, ecological and ethical conduct of companies.

Merck focuses on innovative and top-quality high-tech
products in the healthcare, life science and performance
materials sectors. Our goal is sustainable, profitable
growth, which we intend to achieve by growing
organically and cultivating our existing competencies, as
well as by making targeted acquisitions that complement
and expand existing strengths. Building on leading
products in all its businesses, Merck aims to generate
income that is largely independent of the prevailing
economic cycles. Moreover, we are striving to further
expand our strong market position in emerging markets in
the medium to long term. In 2014, the Emerging Markets
region accounted for 38% of Group sales.
More information about our Group strategy can be found
in our Annual Report 2014.

Fighting schistosomiasis



THE CHALLENGE

An estimated 249 million people worldwide suffer from the worm disease
schistosomiasis, with more than 90% of those affected living in sub-Saharan Africa.
This chronic parasitic condition is one of the most devastating neglected tropical
diseases in terms of public health burden and economic impact.



249 million
people affected

HOW WE'RE HELPING

Since 2007, Merck has been partnering with the World Health Organization (WHO) in
the fight against schistosomiasis in Africa. We have been donating praziquantel tablets
to WHO with the common aim of eliminating the disease in Africa. To date, Merck has
donated more than 200 million tablets to WHO, and more than 54 million patients
have been treated, primarily including children. Merck has pledged to increase the
number of tablets donated to up to 250 million per year starting in 2016. This
donation, worth around USD 23 million per annum, will enable 100 million children to
be treated annually. At the end of 2014, Merck called for various NTD constituencies to
form the Global Schistosomiasis Alliance in order to help eliminate this disease
worldwide.

54 million
children treated

Praziquantel is the only active ingredient with which all forms of schistosomiasis can
be treated. In addition to this, praziquantel is also well-tolerated, which is why WHO
has included it on its list of essential drugs. Merck developed praziquantel in the 1970s
as part of a joint research collaboration.

Rural Pharmacy



THE CHALLENGE

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one-third of the world’s
population does not have regular access to health care. The majority of those affected
live in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa.



HOW WE'RE HELPING

As part of its commitment to improving access to health care for these underserved
populations, Merck has developed the Rural Pharmacy. This is a 40-foot shipping
container that can be transported to rural communities by truck and set up on site
with a minimum of effort.
The first of these rural pharmacies has been opened in Ghana and consists of a
dispensary, a multipurpose room for vaccinations or medical counseling, and a
medicine storeroom with a refrigerator. Solar cells on the roof ensure the constant
power supply necessary to continuously refrigerate the medicines. It is also equipped
with an atmospheric water generator to produce potable water from the humidity in
the air.

Diabetes prevention



THE CHALLENGE

According to estimates, around 382 million people suffer from diabetes across the
globe, with low- and middle-income countries accounting for a particularly large
percentage of patients. In Africa, for instance, approximately 20 million people have
diabetes, around one-third of whom remain unaware of their condition. On top of
that, very few patients have adequate access to insulin, syringes, or the medical
equipment needed to monitor their blood pressure. They often have a life expectancy
of less than a year after being diagnosed.



382 million
people affected

HOW WE'RE HELPING

Merck is committed to improving the quality of diabetes treatment as well as raising
awareness of this disease, especially in low- and middle-income countries. To help
achieve this, we established the Capacity Advancement Program (CAP) across Africa,
India and Indonesia, doing so in collaboration with ministries of health and academic
institutions.

25,000 patients
screened
• cancel on p. 0

Since launching this program in 2012, we have conducted more than 250 events to
boost the profile of diabetes. On top of that, we have provided free diabetes screening
and medical check-ups to more than 25,000 people in Kenya, Ghana, Uganda, and
India. Additionally, more than 100,000 patient leaflets about diabetes have been
distributed at training camps and supermarket chains in Kenya and Uganda. In 2014,
around 2,000 pharmacy and medical students in Africa took part in a clinical diabetes
management training program that is accredited in Europe. Through the Capacity
Advancement Program, we are aiming to reach 15,000 pharmacy undergraduates and
medical students in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America by 2018.

Improving health care in rural India



THE CHALLENGE

Around 70% of the one billion inhabitants of India reside in rural areas and have no
access to effective, affordable health care. Medical facilities are concentrated in India's
megacities, which account for 80% of India's healthcare professionals as well as 70%
of the country's hospital beds.



1,675 villages

HOW WE'RE HELPING

Through the Suswastha Project, a socially responsible business model, Merck is seeking
to improve health care for rural populations of India. At community-level weekly
meetings, healthcare professionals educate patients about everyday health issues such
as coughs and childhood ailments, teaching them ways to prevent these conditions. In
addition to this, the program also provides patients with free check-ups and offers
continuing education to help local physicians advance their medical capacities.
Furthermore, Merck is partnering with the non-governmental organization FHI 360 as
well as the Clinton Foundation, supporting amongst others their fight against
diarrheal diseases.
Since the program's start in January 2013, more than 1,675 rural villages in India have
benefited from the project, which has now reached half a million patients in total.

Energy efficient displays



THE CHALLENGE

The danger of serious climate damage has increased in recent years, and many natural
resources are growing scarcer. As a result, people are becoming increasingly
environmentally conscious, and more and more consumers are taking a product's
power rating into account when deciding what to buy.



Displays consume
20% less energy
thanks to liquid crystals for
PS-VA technology

HOW WE'RE HELPING

Merck develops and markets products that help our customers save energy. Our liquid
crystals for PS-VA technology (polymer-stabilized vertical alignment) provide
television screens with high contrast while also consuming little energy. They also
increase light transmittance, which helps to significantly reduce the amount of
backlighting needed - the largest power consumer in a display. In comparison to VA
technology, screens with Merck's PS-VA materials consume up to 20% less energy.
Furthermore, liquid crystals for PS-VA technology considerably improve image quality.
In general, the faster the switching time, the better the image. The polymer-stabilized
vertical alignment orients the liquid crystal molecules in a particular direction. The
crystals can then tilt faster when they switch directions.
The new UB-FFS technology (ultra-brightness fringe field switching) provides displays
with up to 15% more light transmittance than its forerunner, FFS. In combination with
other technological developments, UB-FFS lowers end device power consumption by
as much as 30%. Furthermore, this new technology also provides superior image
resolution and reduces battery size, thereby opening up new design possibilities for
product designers.

Smart windows



THE CHALLENGE

Climate change and its consequences are already impacting life on Earth today. In the
West, 40% of total energy consumption is attributable to buildings, a large portion of
which goes to lighting (20%) and air conditioning (15%). With resources becoming
ever scarcer and energy prices rising ever higher, companies and private individuals are
seeking to boost the energy efficiency of both new as well as existing buildings.



HOW WE'RE HELPING

Under the licrivisionTM brand, Merck is developing liquid crystal mixtures for new
applications. For instance, we are working with architects, glass makers and facade
manufacturers to create the windows of tomorrow. Our ambitious goal is to use smart
windows to make buildings more energy-efficient, thus conserving resources and
cutting costs. To this end, we have developed Merck Liquid Crystal Window
Technology. How does this work? At the push of a button, these windows can be
darkened within seconds - tinted in whatever color desired. Smart windows thus help
regulate the temperature indoors while also setting interior design accents. This
technology is made possible thanks to the special properties of our liquid crystals (LCs),
which in this case are combined with customized dyes. When a low voltage is applied
to the windows, the LCs allow electromagnetic waves, i.e. light, to either pass through,
thus making the window transparent, or to be absorbed and blocked, thus darkening
the window. In this way, smart windows help regulate the temperature indoors while
also setting interior design accents and lowering HVAC costs.

Liquid crystals

In the Netherlands, we are currently operating a pilot plant for the manufacture of
such smart windows, some of which are to be installed in the new Innovation Center
under construction in Darmstadt, Germany.

Recycling and waste reduction



THE CHALLENGE

Biopharmaceutical production requires many single-use products such as filter
cartridges and tubing. However, a lack of disposal options - along with the material
properties of the product itself and stringent regulatory requirements - often make it
difficult to recycle these items.



54,000 kg of
plastic recycled

HOW WE'RE HELPING

Through environmentally sound recycling programs, including disposal of used
products and packaging, Merck Millipore is working together with its customers to
help reduce the environmental impacts of its products and services.
In 2012, Merck Millipore partnered with a waste disposal company and five customers
in the United States to jointly pilot a recycling program for biopharmaceutical singleuse products. During the ten-month pilot phase, we recycled more than 54,000
kilograms of plastic, which was reprocessed and repurposed into items such as paint
buckets and plastic pallets. Non-recyclable components were sent to a cement kiln and
used as an alternative fuel source. In 2013, we expanded this program to include two
additional customers. Overall, we diverted 189 metric tons of product waste in 2013
and 2014, 91 metric tons of which was plastic that was recycled.

Reducing our customers’ impacts



THE CHALLENGE

Just like us, our customers are also striving to conserve resources and protect the
environment, which means they expect products from Merck that help them minimize
their own environmental impacts.



91% reduction
in autoclave-associated
carbon emissions

HOW WE'RE HELPING

Merck Millipore has developed the Design for Sustainability (DfS) program, which aims
to reduce the environmental impacts of our products across their entire life cycle,
from manufacture to end of life. We furthermore work to maximize product
performance and ease of use for our customers. Beginning with the concept definition
phase, we identify potential environmental impacts, along with opportunities to make
improvements.

47% less raw
material needed

For instance, Merck Millipore employed DfS principles in the design of its new EZ-Fit™
Manifold, which is used for microbiological water testing in the food and beverage
industry. In comparison to the previous model, the EZ-Fit™ Manifold is easier to clean,
which significantly reduces our customers’ environmental impacts. This device uses
47% less raw material and its packaging consists of 100% recyclable corrugated
board. In addition, the filtration heads can be easily removed and autoclaved on their
own, unlike the previous model, which had to be completely sterilized. This feature
results in an estimated 91% reduction in autoclave-associated carbon emissions.

THE CHALLENGE

For children and adolescents, playing music together teaches them teamwork and
builds their self-confidence. Yet many of them first come into contact with classical
music only later in life – or never at all.

HOW WE'RE HELPING

Our musical ambassador, the Deutsche Philharmonie Merck, seeks to get children and
adolescents excited about classical music and to nurture young talent. With this in
mind, the Philharmonie thus held its first ever orchestra workshop in 2010. At this
music camp, young musicians practice together with the Philharmonie members,
gaining initial experience in a professional orchestra. The event concludes with a joint
concert. In both 2013 and 2014, around 50 children and adolescents participated in
our annual orchestra workshop. In addition to this, the Deutsche Philharmonie Merck
has also given four "cushion concerts" over the past two years, thereby reaching
around 800 children.

THE CHALLENGE

In certain parts of society, we as a research-based, high-tech company often
encounter a growing sense of skepticism toward innovation and science, particularly
in industrialized countries.



4 literary prizes
worldwide

HOW WE'RE HELPING

Literature can inspire creativity, raise critical questions, and lead to innovation.
Literature can also address scientific issues, thus furthering a deeper understanding of
science and research. Merck therefore grants and promotes four literary prizes
worldwide.
For 12 years, Merck has been sponsoring the Premio Letterario Merck in Italy, which
recognizes authors who build bridges between literature and science, thereby making
them accessible to a wide audience. Building bridges between cultures is the focus of
two literary awards that we grant in partnership with the Goethe Institut: the
Kakehashi Prize in Japan and the Merck Tagore Award in India. Since 1964, we have
also been sponsoring the renowned Johann Heinrich Merck Award for Literary Critique
and Essay, which is presented by the German Academy for Language and Poetry.
Through this prize, we are helping build bridges between literature and literary
criticism.

THE CHALLENGE

Germany is experiencing a shortage of skilled, trained personnel - especially in the
areas of mathematics, IT, science, and technology. This is partially due to the fact that
too few children and adolescents are taking an interest in science.



3,500 students

the Merck Junior Lab

HOW WE'RE HELPING

With the aim of promoting young scientists, for more than 30 years Merck has been a
partner in "Jugend forscht", the largest and most successful young scientist
competition in Germany. Merck has been hosting this competition in the German
Federal State of Hesse since 1996. In addition to "Jugend forscht", for many years we
have also been supporting more than 60 schools in the region surrounding Darmstadt
and Gernsheim in order to spark students' interest in science. For instance, our
company not only provides materials for science classes - we also hold continuing
education courses for teachers and offer classes field trips to Merck. We are
furthermore partnering with select schools to give teachers extensive support for
science classes.

For more than
30 years,
Merck has been a partner in
“Jugend forscht”

On top of this, since 2008 Merck has also been running the Junior Laboratory in
collaboration with the Technical University of Darmstadt. In more than 200 square
meters of space, elementary and high school pupils of all ages can work on their own
experiments and discover the world of chemistry, receiving guidance from university
staff as well as university chemistry students. In 2014, around 3,500 pupils took
advantage of the lab.

Since the very beginning, corporate responsibility has
been an integral part of our corporate culture. This is
reflected in both our mission statement as well our
Values. Our corporate responsibility strategy allows us to
address the key issues impacting our business and

STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT | Letter from Karl-Ludwig Kley

Letter from Karl-Ludwig Kley

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends of Merck,
The world is changing rapidly, presenting mankind with ever new challenges, among them climate change, an aging
population, broad access to health, and the digitization of society. Solutions must be found for all these issues.
It has long been clear that no one single player can solve all the challenges of our times. The issues are too complex
to be handled by any one group on their own, whether that be policy makers, industry, civil society, or international
organizations. The only answer is for us to join forces.
We at Merck view ourselves as a partner in shaping a better future. We take responsibility. Through our technologies and
products, we are making a significant contribution to solving many global issues. As a company, we strive for sustainable
success, not merely to maximize short-term profit. And we know that success can only be sustainable if it is achieved
responsibly.
Responsible governance is thus the compass that guides our day-to-day actions and constitutes an integral part of our
Group strategy. Since 2005, we have been supporting the United Nations Global Compact and its principles, which cover
human rights, labor standards, environmental protection, and anti-corruption. In 2014, we underscored our dedication
to sustainable supply chains in the chemical industry by joining the Together for Sustainability initiative.

STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT | Letter from Karl-Ludwig Kley

22

In order to make our corporate responsibility activities more effective, we defined three strategic spheres of activity in
2014, those being environment, health and culture.
1. We are dedicated to improving access to health and are committed to providing underserved populations with
access to effective, affordable health solutions, health prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.
For instance, we have taken up the fight against the tropical disease schistosomiasis. Thanks to the praziquantel
tablets we donate to the World Health Organization, 54 million children have already been treated thus far. We'll
be increasing our contribution to up to 250 million tablets per year and will continue the donation until
schistosomiasis has been eliminated in Africa.
In the 2014 Access to Medicine Index, we once more increased our standing, moving up to sixth place. This shows
that we are on the right path, one that we will continue to follow.
2. In everything we do, we strive to minimize our negative impacts on the environment. Many of the products in our
portfolio actively contribute to environmental protection and help our customers use less water, power and raw
materials.
For instance, we are continually developing new formulations of liquid crystals that require less display
backlighting, which significantly reduces the power consumed by electronic devices.
3. Being an innovative, high-tech company, we know that science and culture inspire one another, that they both
form part of a healthy society. We promote cultural projects and education around the world in order to foster a
passion for music, literature and science.
Take for example the Premio Letterario Merck, a literary award that we present once a year in Italy to writers who
in particular have built bridges between science and literature. We also sponsor the Johann Heinrich Merck Award
for Literary Critique and Essay, which is presented by the German Academy for Language and Poetry to authors
who build bridges between literature and empathetic understanding. Building bridges between cultures is the
focus of two literary awards that we grant in partnership with the Goethe Institut: the Kakehashi Prize in Japan
and the Merck Tagore Award in India.
We will only be able to overcome the challenges of the next several decades if we - meaning policy makers, industry and
society - join forces. This is the reason we're contributing the experience and expertise we have at solving global issues.
Merck has been taking responsibility for nearly 350 years and will continue to do so – now and in the future.
Sincerely Yours,

Karl-Ludwig Kley
Chairman of the Merck Executive Board

Values and external initiatives
Merck's corporate culture is characterized by responsible
conduct – whether with respect to our products, our
employees, the environment, or society. Responsibility has
been an integral part of our approach for nearly 350 years
and is one of our six Values.
These Values - courage, achievement, responsibility,
respect, integrity, and transparency - form the foundation
that underlies our actions. They guide us in our daily
work, defining how we interact with our customers and
business partners. We view open, honest communication
internally and externally as an essential trust-building
element. As a global company, we strive to create added
value for consumers, our market partners and the
community while also helping them lead better lives.
Our Group Mission Statement, our Values and the external
initiatives we support give rise to requirements for
responsible corporate governance that are integrated with
both our Corporate Responsibility strategy as well as our
Group-wide regulations. These guidelines include the
Merck Human Rights Charter and our Code of Conduct,
as well as other specific corporate principles, policies and
standards. This framework guides our employees in
applying these requirements in the course of their dayto-day work, thus helping them live the company's
commitment to corporate responsibility.
We support the following initiatives on responsible
corporate governance:

Human rights
Merck is committed to upholding human rights within its
sphere of influence and welcomes the "Guiding Principles
for Business and Human Rights" adopted by the UN
Human Rights Council in 2011. This set of principles
creates a global framework for countries to fulfill their
duty to protect human rights, as well as for businesses to
respect them, illustrating how to do so.
Countries are obliged to establish a regulatory framework
for the protection of human rights. For global companies,
it is important that this be implemented across all
countries in order to create uniform competitive
conditions for all companies.
The duty of companies is to uphold and respect human
rights; they absolutely must not violate any human rights
in the course of their activities. Furthermore, companies
must also act with the necessary due diligence, which
includes identifying and managing risks.
In 2012, we conducted an extensive human rights risk
assessment, which aimed to identify the human rights
risks that arise from our activities as an international
company. Based on the results of this assessment, Merck
adopted a Group-wide Human Rights Charter at the end
of 2013, which underscores our commitment to
respecting and protecting human rights. This charter
brings together and complements existing human rights
regulations and guidelines, such as our Code of Conduct,
our "Environment, Health and Safety Policy", and our
"Charter on Access to Health in Developing Countries".
The Human Rights Charter defines our company's
expectations while increasing awareness of human rights
within the company. It also allows us to more accurately
assess Group-specific risks and to align our business
operations with our Values.
In the course of drafting our Human Rights Charter, we
asked external stakeholders for their opinion on our
approach to human rights and then considered the
situation from this external perspective. Among these
stakeholders were business and human rights experts
from various countries, trade unions, associations, and
specialists in individual topics addressed in the charter.

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

We have informed our employees about the Merck
Human Rights Charter, but have not yet provided training
on this charter.
The UN "Guiding Principles for Business and Human
Rights" also require companies to perform human rights
impact assessments (HRIA) to promptly identify any
human rights problem areas. At the end of 2014, Merck
conducted an HRIA in an emerging country. While we
wish to further expand our strong market position in
emerging economies, we are aware that these countries
pose a higher risk of human rights violations. Through
the HRIA, we aim to gain a better understanding of how
our business operations and business relationships impact
human rights, to ascertain whether the requirements of
our Human Rights Charter are being fulfilled, and predict
the risk of human rights violations. We furthermore wish
to identify ways to prevent human rights violations.
After completing the HRIA and evaluating the results, we
will check whether the findings from the assessment can
be applied to other subsidiaries.
Merck is a member of the German Global Compact
Network within the Business & Human Rights Peer
Learning Group, which aims to promote best practice
sharing with regard to business and human rights.

Responsible Care®
The Responsible Care® Global Charter was adopted by the
International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA) in
2006 and is the basis for the guidelines of the German
Responsible Care® Program. These two initiatives both aim
to continually improve the chemical industry's track
record in terms of product safety, environmental
protection, health, plant safety, and security. Responsible
Care® aims to achieve a level of voluntary cooperation
with government bodies and other stakeholders that goes
far beyond complying with statutory regulations. In 2014,
Merck was among the first companies to sign the revised
version of the Responsible Care® Global Charter, which is
currently being rolled out at an international level.
Merck’s Responsible Care® activities are founded on
internal guidelines such as our “Corporate EHS Policy”
and the "Merck Group EHS, Security and Quality Manual”.

STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT | CR strategy and organization

In implementing the Responsible Care® Global Charter,
we are currently focusing in particular on product safety,
environmental protection and occupational safety.

products for the health care, life science and performance
materials sectors, as well as through responsible
governance.

Our product safety activities cover a range of measures.
These include the implementation of regulatory
requirements such as REACH in the EU, AREC in South
Korea, TSCA in the U.S., and the worldwide GHS. We also
engage in voluntary initiatives such as our Global Product
Strategy and pursue sustainable product development.
One example of this engagement is Merck Millipore's
Design for Sustainability program, which integrates
sustainability across the product development process.

Today's global megatrends present us with both risks as
well as opportunities. Average life expectancy continues
to increase worldwide while birth rates continue to fall,
a situation that is reflected in our portfolio of health
solutions such as fertility treatments and cancer research.
An estimated 1.3 billion people have no access to effective
and affordable health care. Through our Group-wide
Access to Health strategy, Merck takes a comprehensive
approach toward addressing access barriers in low- and
middle-income countries. As a market and technology
leader in the global liquid crystals business, Merck is
driving the development of state-of-the-art displays,
thereby benefiting from the digitization megatrend. In
addition, we are also developing products for energysaving lighting and photovoltaics that can help mitigate
climate change and resource scarcity.

When it comes to environmental protection, we are
currently focusing on climate change mitigation. We aim
to cut our greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020,
relative to the 2006 baseline. Other key focus areas
include water, wastewater and waste reduction. Process
safety traditionally has high priority at Merck as well.
Integrated occupational safety encompasses the
prevention of workplace accidents, workplace-related
illnesses and workplace-related health hazards. Our goal
is to reduce the lost time injury rate to 2.5 by 2015.
Our subsidiaries are regularly audited to verify their
compliance with statutory and Group-wide requirements,
as well as to identify areas of improvement.

CR strategy and organization
Humanity is confronted with major global social issues
such as climate change, aging populations, resource
scarcity, and insufficient access to health in low- and
middle-income countries.
We are aware that, as a global player, our business
operations impact our environment as well as the people
around us. But we believe that we can help address global
challenges through our innovative, high-caliber high-tech

We are furthermore constantly working to minimize ethical,
financial and legal risks. In our interactions with vendors and
other business partners worldwide, we are dedicated to
complying with statutory and ethical standards and have
implemented the necessary structures and systems to do so.
Our environmental management processes aim to minimize
our environmental impacts, in particular at our production sites.
On top of this, we offer fair and attractive working conditions
for our approximately 39,000 employees.
Our Group strategy is targeted to success, but equally respects
the interests of employees, customers, investors, and society.
It serves as the basis for our Corporate Responsibility (CR)
strategy, which we reviewed and revised in 2014. Our entire
range of CR activities can be summed up under the term
"responsible governance", a concept that informs Merck's dayto-day actions. At the end of 2014 we also examined our Group
strategy and selected three strategic spheres of activity in which
we particularly wish to engage. Our aim is to hone Merck's
competitive edge while helping to sustainably secure our
future.

Corporate Responsibility at Merck

Health

Culture

Through our Access to Health approach, which spans
all our businesses, we aim to help improve sustainable
access to high-quality health solutions for
underserved populations and communities in lowand middle-income countries.

Culture inspires people and opens up their minds to new
possibilities. As a high-tech, research-based company, we
therefore promote cultural initiatives worldwide and are
engaged in educational projects - especially since
education is key to making culture accessible.

Stefan Oschmann, Vice Chairman of the Executive Board,
has thus dedicated his two-year presidency of the
International
Federation
of
Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA) to accelerating
access to high-quality health solutions for people in lowto middle-income countries.

Cultural promotion is a core element of our engagement in
society. After all, culture nurtures characteristics that are
essential to our business activities as a high-tech company:
creativity, enthusiasm for new discoveries, and the courage to
transcend boundaries. Our cultural engagement focuses on
music, literature and education.

Environment

Responsible governance is the foundation of our operating
business. We work to minimize ethical, financial and legal risks,
thereby ensuring Merck's acceptance within society. We take
responsibility for our products, the environment, and people,
especially for our employees and the communities in which we
operate.

A number of our innovative chemical and life science
products contribute to environmental protection. We
strive to continuously enhance the sustainability
footprint of our products while helping our customers
achieve their own sustainability goals.

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

Our products serve people's current and future needs. To us,
safety and ethics matter just as much as business success.
In the manufacture of our products, we seek to impact the
environment as little as possible. Safety, environmental

27

protection and quality management are absolutely essential to
this aim. We bolster our company’s ability to act by recruiting,
developing and motivating talented employees. We strive to
help society function better and aim to set the example for
ethical conduct.
Our CR strategy is defined by the Executive Board, which also
decides on CR objectives and CR reporting.
The Group-wide CR Committee steers the implementation of
our corporate responsibility strategy and consists of
representatives from the businesses as well as from relevant
Group functions such as EQ, HR, Compliance, and Procurement.
In 2013, Karl-Ludwig Kley, Executive Board Chairman, became
Chairman of the CR Committee. Since January 2015, the Group
function Public Affairs and Corporate Responsibility has been
reporting to Executive Board Vice Chairman Stefan Oschmann.
Since this time, Oschmann has also headed the CR Committee.
The CR Committee reviews the CR strategy to ensure that it
covers the topics relevant to Merck and that it addresses
potential areas where action is needed. We strive to identify
challenges promptly in order to minimize risks, but also to seize
the business opportunities that arise from societal change.
During the preparation of our CR reports, we engage our
stakeholders and conduct materiality analyses to ensure that
all the relevant topics are addressed. The committee’s tasks
also include defining as well as regularly reviewing goals and
measures that reflect our CR strategy. The committee ensures
that initiatives of the businesses, Group functions, and
subsidiaries are in line with our Group-wide CR strategy.
Measures adopted by the committee are incorporated into our
operations by line managers as well as by interdisciplinary
project teams.
The CR Committee meets three times per year. In 2013 and
2014, the meetings primarily focused on CR strategy, access to
health and human rights, as well as environmental and social
standards along the supply chain, and the Design for
Sustainability Program.

Materiality analysis
In order to identify the material non-financial topics relevant to
our stakeholders as well as to our long-term business success,
we once more conducted a materiality analysis as defined in
the G4 Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). This

STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT | Materiality analysis

process involved identifying the important issues, prioritizing
them, and validating them with our Corporate Responsibility
(CR) Committee.
In the first step, we identified more than 70 current CR topics
for the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. For this, we
used various information sources, including our experience
from previous materiality analyses and CR reports, the health
care sector standards of the Sustainability Accounting
Standards Board (SASB), analyses of capital market
requirements, and the dialogues with various stakeholders.
We discussed the options internally and narrowed it down to
46 issues, which became the focus of an online international
survey conducted on some of our stakeholders. We asked
participants to rank how relevant the 46 topics are to Merck,
as well as to rate Merck's performance with regard to them.
Around 120 people from across 30 countries took part in the
survey; two-thirds were internal stakeholders and one-third
were external stakeholders. Among them were rating agencies,
suppliers, scientists, researchers, and employees involved in
corporate responsibility, as well as representatives from the
political arena, non-governmental organizations, and
federations. In assessing the results, we gave equal
consideration to the responses of all stakeholders.
In particular, participants rated product responsibility as being
especially important, and they overwhelmingly rated Merck's
performance in this area as good to very good. Combined with
other analysis results, the stakeholders' responses showed us
what they think of Merck's CR performance, as well as which
aspects they consider relevant to Merck. The stakeholders'
responses were also utilized in our 2014 Materiality Analysis.
During a materiality workshop, representatives from the CR
Committee validated the top-ranked issues, discussed the
strengths and weaknesses of the management system Merck
uses to steer topics, and identified areas that Merck needs to
address. This resulted in 27 issues that are material to Merck,
which are also the focus of this CR Report. These coincide
for the most part with topics that we identified in previous
materiality analyses. This report describes our management
approach to these 27 issues of particular importance to our
stakeholders and company, and provides details on measures,
achievements, challenges, and goals for some of them.
The results of the materiality analysis are presented in the 2014
materiality matrix.

Because our stakeholders expect transparent reporting on
more than just these 27 topics, our report includes other
topics as well, which will be re-assessed in future materiality
analyses.

The following table shows where topics identified as material
are relevant along the value chain: upstream in our supply
chain, in the course of our activities, or downstream, i.e.
customers and patients.

STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT | Guidelines and management systems

Guidelines and management
systems
We have specified our requirements for the responsible
conduct of all employees in numerous guidelines in order
to ensure that they all know the relevant rules and apply
them in the workplace.
Our Group-wide guideline system contains all company
policies and explains which ones apply to which parts of
the company. They range from the charters and principles
in effect for the entire company, to specific standards and
procedures that apply to either our sectors and businesses
or our individual sites.
Such documents include the Merck Code of Conduct, the
"Merck Human Rights Charter" and the "Merck Charter on
Access to Health in Developing Countries".
Examples of internal policies include: the Group-wide
"Corporate EHS Policy", which establishes the framework
for principles, strategies and organizational structures for
environment, health and safety at Merck; our "Animal
Welfare Policy", which describes the treatment of

Group-wide guideline system

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

32

laboratory animals throughout the company; and our
"Corporate Security Policy", which stipulates procedures
to protect Merck's intellectual and material assets.
In addition, we also have numerous business-specific
policies, such as Merck Serono's "Interactions with
Patients and Patient Organizations", as well as our "Safety
Policy" for chemical products. Through this safety policy,
we have established global processes for defining, driving
and implementing product safety and have created the
necessary management structures to do so.
Our standards take the provisions from charters,
principles and policies and translate them into concrete
terms for employees in charge of operational processes.
The guidelines are kept up-to-date by the relevant
departments and are available on the intranet. Managers
are responsible for implementing them in their respective
areas of responsibility. We educate and train our
employees on the guidelines that pertain to them. In this
way, we ensure that they are familiar with both the
overarching rules from the charters and principles, as well
as the concrete specifications that affect their individual
range of activities.

33

The guideline system is an integral part of our
management systems, which are used to define and steer
goals, actions and responsibilities in key action areas. Our
management systems are based on standards such as
the internationally recognized ISO 9001 for quality
management, GxP guidelines for good working practices
in the pharmaceutical industry, and ISO 14001 for
environmental management. Our ISO 14001
environmental management system and ISO 9001 quality
management systems are certified at regular intervals by
an independent auditing firm. Merck holds group
certificates for its quality and environmental
management systems.

Compliance
Responsible entrepreneurship means first and foremost
legally compliant conduct. All of Merck's activities have
to comply with statutory rules and regulations worldwide.
Violations might not only entail legal prosecution, but
could also seriously harm Merck’s corporate reputation,
meaning its standing as a business partner or employer.
Therefore, compliance with statutory rules and
regulations has top priority for Merck. Compliance for
our company also means acting in accordance with the
ethical principles defined in the Merck Values. We strive
to do “good” business, which means operating profitably
while still meeting high ethical standards.

Globally mandatory guidelines
The Merck Code of Conduct is a compulsory set of rules
for the company’s entire workforce. Our employees have
been provided with a copy of the Code of Conduct, and
new employees are handed a copy with their letter of
offer.
The Code of Conduct explains the principles for dealings
with business associates, general partners, co-workers,
and employees, as well as the communities in which we
operate. Thus, it supports all employees in acting ethically
– not only in their interactions with one another, but
also outside the company. The Merck Human Rights
Charter supplements the Code of Conduct with global
human rights principles, such as the core labor standards
of the International Labour Organization (ILO). In July
2014, we furthermore adopted a new anti-corruption
guideline for the Merck Group.

STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT | Compliance

We expect our business partners worldwide to adhere
to our guidelines and principles as well. While Supplier
Management ensures that suppliers conduct their
business according to the rules and regulations, Global
Business Partner Risk Management handles the
relationships with distribution-related associates such as
distributors and wholesalers.
Group Compliance oversaw the integration of AZ
Electronic Materials (AZ), which was acquired in 2014, and
trained AZ employees on compliance as well as on our
compliance guidelines. Since January 2015, AZ employees
have been fully integrated into Merck's compliance
measures.

Merck's Compliance organization
Through our compliance organization, we ensure
adherence to statutory regulations as well as to Merck's
own internal rules and regulations. The Compliance Group
function, which features a Group Compliance Officer and
other specialists, is responsible for maintaining and
enhancing the compliance program. At our subsidiaries,
local and regional compliance officers are responsible for
implementing the compliance measures. Besides
expanding the global Compliance organization, we have
also appointed a Compliance Officer for Merck Millipore
and one for our Healthcare business sector. This will
augment the compliance expertise available when
entering new business fields and ensure that our
businesses comply with statutes and regulations. The
approximately 60 Compliance Officers worldwide fall
under the Group Compliance Officer. Group Compliance
provides them with guidance as well as training
documents, along with other support. They report
regularly to the Group Compliance Officer, who in turn
reports to the Executive Board at least once a year,
updating the Board on compliance activities, compliance
risks and serious compliance violations. The Executive
Board updates Merck's supervisory bodies at least once a
year on the key compliance issues.

Selecting business partners
Merck applies a risk-oriented approach to the selection
of sales-related business partners such as distributors,
agents, and wholesalers. In essence, the greater we
estimate the risk to be with regard to a certain country,
region, type of service, etc., the closer and more carefully

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT | Compliance

we examine the company before doing business with
them. For risk assessments, we use tools such as the
Corruption Perception Index (CPI) maintained by
Transparency International, as well as background
information from various databases. We also take into
account whether the business partner in question has a
compliance program.
Our "Global Business Partner Risk Management Guideline"
governs the selection process for business partners as
well as the system-based documentation of relevant
information and the evaluation thereof. Through this
comprehensive process, we are both minimizing our risk
as well as taking into account the modified requirements
resulting from new anti-corruption legislation such as the
UK Bribery Act.
This Group-wide mandatory guideline stipulates eight
principles that must be taken into account when selecting
new business partners and that also apply to existing
business relationships. For instance, the policy stipulates
that Merck shall only do business with partners who
comply with all applicable laws, who do not engage in
bribery, who adhere to environmental, health and safety
guidelines, and who refuse to tolerate discrimination.
Furthermore, we require them to demonstrate a
commitment to internationally recognized human rights
and labor standards, as well as to the compliance
standards defined in our Code of Conduct.
Business partners must accept and adhere to these
principles if they wish to enter into a business relationship
with Merck. We also conduct such audits on existing
business partners, usually when it's time to renew a
contract.
If the audits come up with red flags, we may reject
potential business partners or terminate the relationship.
However, our business associates are frequently willing
to modify their structures and processes to meet our
stringent compliance requirements. Since implementing
the process in 2013, more than 1,000 business partners
have already undergone this audit.

34

Compliance audits
The Internal Auditing Group function regularly reviews
compliance-relevant matters at our facilities. Their audits
focus on the existence and quality of compliance
guidelines, processes and structures. In addition, Internal
Auditing also checks our sites for violations of our Code
of Conduct and reviews workplace aspects of the Human
Rights Charter. The topic of corruption is also part of
our standard audit program. Altogether, 30 audits were
conducted in 2013 to check for corruption, with 36 in
2014.
On top of this, 27 sites across 22 countries were audited
on workplace aspects of the Human Rights Charter in
2013, and 32 sites across 28 countries were audited in
2014. The audits found no violations.

Compliance training
We place a high priority on regular compliance training,
which is provided as classroom and online courses.
Employees of all levels, as well as independent contractors
and supervised workers such as temps, are trained on
topics related to the Code of Conduct such as corruption,
competition law and conflicts of interest.
In 2013 and 2014, we used our e-learning system to
train 29,360 people on our Code of Conduct, educating
them on the consequences of compliance violations. This
training also taught ways to avoid compliance violations.
In 2013 and 2014, a total of 40,188 people took 117,509
online courses on a variety of compliance topics. A large
portion of these classes focused on corruption. In 2013
and 2014, we trained 31,687 people on how to prevent
corruption.
Several courses on special topics are offered specifically
for employees above a certain Global Grade, such as the
course on competition law that was rolled out in 2014. In
addition to online courses, numerous classroom courses
on compliance are held worldwide in order to provide
employees with effective training on local issues in
particular.
We review and revise training plans regularly, adapting
them to new developments. For instance, in 2014 we
developed online courses to accompany the

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT | Compliance

35

implementation of our new anti-corruption guidelines.
Since 2013, we have been training employees, especially
those in distribution, on our expanded business partner
selection process as well as our "Global Business Partner
Risk Management Guideline". Due to the significance and
complexity of the subject, this training is generally offered
as a classroom course.

SpeakUp Line
All employees are called upon to report compliance
violations to their supervisor, Legal, HR, or other relevant
departments. Employees can also report violations via the
SpeakUp Line central reporting system, doing so in their
respective national language. Available as a telephone
hotline or a web-based application, they can report the
incident free of charge and anonymously from anywhere
in the world. In addition to our employees, business
partners who have undergone the Business Partner Risk
Management Process can also report misconduct via the
SpeakUp Line.
The reports received are reviewed by the Group
Compliance Officer and submitted to the Compliance
Committee, who will then coordinate the necessary
investigation into the matter. This committee consists of
senior representatives from Internal Auditing,
Compliance, Group Security, Data Security, and Human
Resources. They monitor the handling of reported cases
and initiate appropriate corrective measures as needed.
Disciplinary actions are also taken, when necessary,
against employees who have violated a compliance rule.
These actions may range from a simple warning up to
dismissal of the employee, depending on the severity of
the violation.

and eleven in 2014. The majority of these violations
resulted from the misconduct of individual employees and
represented minor, isolated incidents that led to
commensurate disciplinary action. During the 2013-2014
period, six cases total entailed managerial employees who
were involved in improper business practices, or had
knowledge thereof. These cases mostly dealt with
improper distribution and marketing methods to boost
sales, as well as inappropriate interactions with medical
professionals. In all cases, disciplinary action was taken
against the managers responsible for the infractions.

Outlook
The importance of compliance in business processes will
continue to grow, especially in the pharmaceutical
industry. For Europe, the transparency initiative of the
European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and
Associations (EFPIA) stipulates that, effective 2016,
companies will have to publish all donations made to
physicians that are not connected to research. Our
Compliance organization has worked with the relevant
businesses to implement measures that satisfy this
disclosure obligation. This includes the creation of an
internal guideline that stipulates the approval process and
documentation requirements for donations made to
physicians.

On top of the SpeakUp Line, we have also set up a central
advice hotline within the Group Compliance Office. Our
employees can call this number to get advice on ethical
and compliant conduct.
The number of compliance-relevant reports as well as the
number of actual compliance violations have remained
for the most part unchanged over the last several years.
Via the SpeakUp Line and other channels, we received
a total of 22 compliance-related reports in 2013 that
resulted in an investigation, with 26 such reports in 2014.
We confirmed nine cases of compliance violations in 2013

STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT | Stakeholder dialogue

Stakeholder dialogue
Our business operations intersect the interests of many
people, which makes continuous engagement with our
stakeholders absolutely essential. We particularly engage
with those people and groups who are impacted by our
decisions and activities - or who help determine them.
Our stakeholders include employees, customers, business
partners, the Merck family, investors, regulatory agencies,
associations, neighbors in the vicinity of our sites, and
non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Our stakeholder

engagement takes many forms, such as stakeholder
surveys, issue-specific dialogues, informational forums,
round table discussions, industry coalitions, and advocacy
work. This exchange enables us to demonstrate how we
live the Merck Values, as well as to illustrate the corporate
responsibility (CR) strategy we pursue. It also provides
us an opportunity to express our appreciation for our
stakeholders. We strive to sustain and build trust and –
wherever possible – harmonize divergent interests. Our
top priority is to ensure Merck's acceptance within society.

37

Stakeholder surveys
We regularly survey our employees, customers, business
partners, and other relevant stakeholder groups about the
CR issues they consider to be important to Merck now and
in the future, asking them to assess our performance on
these priority issues. We also wish to know the questions
our stakeholders have regarding corporate responsibility
at Merck so that we can address them in our CR Report.
Most recently, we conducted such a survey on our
stakeholders in 2014 in conjunction with the materiality
analysis for our 2014 CR Report, involving around 120
stakeholders from across 30 countries.

Issue-specific dialogues
In the course of our business activities, we deal with a
wide range of issues and interface with various
communities. In the process, our departments usually
interact directly with stakeholders. Depending on the
subject and whether the issue is of local, national or
international relevance, this may take the form of
workshops and seminars, or even roundtables held at
major conventions. Beyond this, Merck is also involved
in industry networks and participates in professional
conferences.
For instance, in September 2014, Merck partnered with
the German Chemical Industry Association (VCI), the
German Mining, Chemical and Energy Industrial Union
(IG BCE) and the German Employers’ Federation of the
Chemical Industry (BAVC) to host a conference in
Darmstadt (Germany) entitled “Deutschland braucht
Chemie. Nachhaltigkeit – Voraussetzung für Wachstum
und Wohlstand?” (Germany needs chemistry.
Sustainability - a prerequisite for growth and prosperity?).
Attended by more than 700 people, this sustainability
conference was held as part of the "DA stimmt die
Chemie" event series, a collaboration between Merck and
the Technical University of Darmstadt that is taking place
from September 2014 to June 2015. In July 2014, Merck
organized an expert workshop with representatives from
the worlds of politics, business and society to prepare for
the conference, which focused on the chemical sector's
contribution to sustainable development. In addition to
this, participants also discussed the definition of a

STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT | Stakeholder dialogue

company’s responsibility for its products, as well as the
balance between ecology, economy and social
responsibility.
Furthermore in the 2013-2014 period, we also hosted
Access Dialogues to engage industry representatives,
international organizations, and other stakeholders on the
topic of access to health. These dialogues focused on
access to health innovations, the protection of intellectual
property, and challenges posed by the supply chain in
developing countries. Within the Merck Capacity
Advancement Program, more than 200 dialogue events
have been held since 2012, which seeks to raise the profile
of diabetes in Africa and Asia through education and
support for the health systems there.
In October 2014, more than 100 health experts from
Africa attended the Merck Africa Luminary in Darmstadt.
This conference focused on advancing medical capacities
in the fields of diabetes, oncology and infertility, as well
as optimizing supply chain integrity, pharmacovigilance,
and the fight against counterfeit medicines. During 2013
and 2014, we also participated in various conferences
on schistosomiasis and malaria, part of our commitment
to fight neglected tropical diseases. Among these were
the Harvard Symposium on Malaria and Tuberculosis in
November 2014 as well as the eleventh Malaria Meeting
in November 2013 in Aachen (Germany), which gave rise
to a new partnership with Saint George’s University in the
United Kingdom.
Merck Millipore discusses sustainable business strategies
within the Sustainability Stakeholder Advisory Group
(SSAG). In 2014, Merck Millipore conducted a global
customer service and usage survey; it held a stakeholder
meeting with suppliers, distributors, customers, nongovernmental organizations, and scientists in order to get
their feedback on the Merck’s sustainability strategy, as
well as on the sustainability criteria that govern Millipore
products. We took this feedback and used it to define
new criteria for our Design for Sustainability Program,
integrating these criteria with our product development
process. The new criteria included product recyclability
and the availability of a recycling program.

Discussion and information forums

• The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries
and Associations (EFPIA )

At our major sites, we have set up discussion and
information forums for local residents. Through the public
planning forum held annually at our headquarters in
Darmstadt since 1994, we aim to provide residents with
the opportunity to obtain information and discuss our
development at the site. During the 2013-2014 period,
we provided information particularly on our "Fit for 2018"
transformation and growth program, as well as new
developments resulting from our ONE Global
Headquarters initiative in Darmstadt. We also discussed
landfill remediation, groundwater issues, the Merck
daycare center, and visitor parking area remodeling, along
with energy, communication and crisis management.

• The International Federation of Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA )

In expanding our biotech production facilities in Corsiersur-Vevey, Switzerland, we initiated a dialogue with NGOs
and local authorities to ensure the greatest possible
transparency during the entire project life cycle, from
planning to completion. For the project, Merck committed
to applying high environmental and safety standards that
exceed statutory requirements. Even after completing
construction, we will continue to hold this annual
meeting, which enables us to engage stakeholders in
regular discussions as well as to verify that the stipulated
measures are being properly implemented. In 2014, the
meeting focused on the status of landscaping activities
and updates to the mobility plan, as well as our water
balance and water release performance.

Within the Chemie3 and Responsible Care® initiatives,
Merck is also working in particular to develop and
implement sustainability standards in the pharmaceutical
and chemical industries. On top of this, Merck is active
in numerous socially engaged organizations, such as the
Goethe Institute, the Remembrance, Responsibility and
Future Foundation, and the World Environment Center
(WEC). We also participate in initiatives and projects
whose other participants share our standards of
entrepreneurial conduct. For instance, we support the
“Code of Responsible Conduct for Business”.
Merck does not make financial contributions to holders of
or candidates for political office, political parties or related
organizations. This is stipulated in our Code of Conduct.
In the United States, EMD Political Action Committees
(PACs) have been set up as a conduit for our employees
to make donations in support of political candidates and
organizations. These are not donations from the company,
but rather from individual employees. The contributions
donated are reported to the U.S. Federal Election
Commission and are fully disclosed.

PRODUCTS

Products
Our success and our future are founded on innovative
products that benefit people and help them live a better
life. Merck products are highly trusted worldwide –
whether our innovative medicines of chemical or
biological origin, our over-the-counter products, our
liquid crystals for LC displays, Merck pigments for the
coatings, plastics and printing industries, products for the
cosmetics industry, or biopharmaceuticals and lab
solutions for the life science industry. Responsibility for
our products will always be at the core of our corporate
responsibility. Here, we are driven by our ethical standards
as well as our high expectations for safety and
environmental compatibility.

Product safety
Our products must be safe and should not pose a danger
to patients, customers or the environment. We therefore
examine product safety across the entire life cycle,
continuously taking steps to make improvements.
Patients and customers receive extensive informational
material with our products so that they understand them
as fully as possible and can use them safely.
Read more about the safety of our drugs on p. 41
Read more about the safety of our chemical products
on p. 43

Safety of our drugs
Patient safety is our number one priority. Proactive safety
strategies thus drive our decision-making and we strive to
mitigate risks for all our medicinal products.
Before an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is used in
humans, we conduct extensive pre-clinical trials that test
for aspects such as efficacy and toxicity. After this, the
API is tested in humans within the scope of clinical trials
that investigate the API's efficacy and adverse effects. The
trial results are then used to assess the drug's benefit-risk
ratio, weighing the benefits of the treatment against its
risks. We create benefit-risk profiles for all our medicinal
products to ensure that a positive benefit-risk balance is
in place for all medicinal products marketed by Merck.
In 2014, we updated our benefit-risk analysis practice by
implementing an improved systematic process.
Information from clinical trials provides an important
basis for a drug to be approved by the regulatory
authorities. After receiving marketing approval, we
continue to conduct benefit-risk evaluations on the drug
since the number of patients using it increases
exponentially – to thousands or millions worldwide. We
thus gain a deeper understanding of the safety profile of
our drugs.
At Merck Serono, the Global Drug Safety unit is
responsible for continuously monitoring the safety
profiles of our drugs (pharmacovigilance). Global Drug
Safety processes safety information from various sources

PRODUCTS | Product safety

such as clinical trials, adverse reaction reports and
scientific literature in order to ensure up-to-date safety
information for patients and their healthcare providers
during the entire life cycle of our drugs, from
development to the end of marketing authorization.
Pharmacovigilance information is compiled from doctors
and patients in all countries in which our medicinal
products are marketed. Medical specialists and
pharmacovigilance teams ensure that information on
adverse effects is correctly compiled, tracked, and
communicated. The data for all of our drugs is medically
evaluated by the Global Drug Safety functions, who
adapts the benefit-risk evaluations as necessary. In line
with regulatory requirements, changes to the benefit-risk
evaluation and potential safety risks are reported to the
responsible authorities, as well as to doctors and patients.
Global Drug Safety at Merck’s headquarters and the drug
safety units within Merck's subsidiaries continuously
review changes in the pharmacovigilance regulations
worldwide – for products in both the development as well
as the marketing phase. New regulations are continuously
integrated into Merck's group-wide processes, thus
allowing us to ensure that regulatory requirements and
statutory regulations are adhered to. Since the European
Medicines Agency (EMA) released its “Guidelines on good
pharmacovigilance practices” (GVP) in 2012, Merck has
reviewed any new or updated GVP Modules and
implemented them in our internal pharmacovigilance
processes. In 2014, the European Medicines Agency
published the new GVP Module on risk mitigation, as well
as the revised GVP Modules on Individual Case Report
Management and on Periodic Safety Update Report
Management. We have integrated the new and revised
requirements from these GVP Modules into our processes.
Health authorities regularly conduct pharmacovigilance
inspections to review our adherence to regulatory
requirements as well as to our own internal drug safety
standards. The German Federal Institute for Drugs and
Medical Devices (BfArM) and the Paul Ehrlich Institute
(the Federal Institute for Vaccines and Biomedicines) Germany's two pharmaceutical regulatory agencies conducted a pharmacovigilance inspection on Merck
Serono Global Drug Safety in February 2015. Conducted
on behalf of the European Medicines Agency, this

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

PRODUCTS | Product safety

inspection did not yield any critical observations. We are
analyzing the non-critical observations that were
identified and implementing both corrective as well as
preventive measures. In addition to this, Merck has
implemented a worldwide audit program based on the
GVP audit module that includes our global activities, as
well as affiliates, vendors, and license partners engaged in
our pharmacovigilance activities.
The Medical Safety and Ethics Board (MSEB) bears
responsibility for drug and medical safety at Merck Serono
– across the entire life cycle of our drugs, from
development to the end of marketing authorization. The
Chairman of the MSEB is the Chief Medical Officer (CMO),
who also makes the final call on decisions. The board
convenes once a month, or on an ad hoc basis as required.
In addition to the chairperson, the MSEB consists of
experienced
physicians,
scientists
and
legal
representatives from Merck Serono. Its tasks include
assessing benefit-risk evaluations, reviewing risk
management, and dealing with safety-related
communication. Furthermore, it reviews proposals for
first-in-man (FIM) clinical studies as well as for updates
to the safety warnings on package inserts and labeling.
During the life cycle of a medicinal product or medical
device, medical, ethical or safety issues that need
guidance or a decision from the CMO can be escalated to
the MSEB.
In collaboration with other companies as well as
organizations from the public sector (e.g. health
authorities, academia), Merck is involved in PROTECT
(Pharmacoepidemiological research on outcomes of
therapeutics by a European consortium), a global research
project of the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI)
launched in 2009. This project aims to further develop
and optimize instruments and methods for the benefitrisk evaluation of drugs. The project team established a
framework for benefit-risk profiles, which is described in a
benefit-risk guide.
Our Quality Training Management standard applies to all
employees whose work is related to the quality and safety
of a drug or clinical trial. This standard describes how
to conduct training workshops and seminars at both the

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

42

Group level as well as locally within the subsidiaries.
Compliance with these requirements is regularly reviewed
during the audits of the quality system.
All employees that work in drug development are
regularly trained on their drug development expertise and
topics related to compliance with ICH, GCP, the respective
standard operating procedures, etc. Employee training is
provided via a validated learning management system.
Depending on their role, a certain training module may be
mandatory or optional for the employee. Line managers
are responsible for checking whether employees have
received all training required by their role.

Good manufacturing practice
In producing pharmaceuticals, quality assurance is a key
aspect because deviations can impact patient health and
safety. In order to ensure that pharmaceuticals meet the
standards set for identity, purity, potency and safety, they
must be manufactured according to current Good
Manufacturing Practice (cGMP). Consequently, as a
manufacturer we must have appropriately trained
employees as well as suitable facilities, processes and
procedures. Compliance with cGMP guidelines is
mandatory and monitored by the health authorities.

Product approval and distribution
Merck continuously works to guarantee product
availability for its customers. Our requirements for the
quality and effectiveness of the distribution process are
uniform worldwide. We perform rigorous and frequent
checks on our distribution network; these aim to ensure
that our partners are adhering to our quality and safety
requirements as well as ensure their full compliance with
global Good Distribution Practices (GDPs).

Product labeling
The package insert informs patients how to correctly use a
product. The package inserts furthermore inform patients
about the risks and adverse effects associated with taking
the drug. The inserts are regularly reviewed and updated
to ensure that they are up to date with the latest
information, particularly in terms of safety-relevant

43

information. If the benefit-risk ratio of a product has
changed, the MSEB endorses risk mitigation measures. If
the risk mitigation measures mean changing the label, this
change is then submitted to the labeling decision board.
The labeling decision board endorses new labels or label
updates in the reference product information (Company
Core Data Sheet). The core safety information contained
in these reference documents is then implemented in
national labeling documents.
In accordance with external requirements, we provide all
our drugs with information on safe use and, if applicable,
on content - particularly with regard to substances that
might produce an environmental or social impact - as well
as disposal.

Safety of our chemical products
Many chemical products of the Merck product portfolio
are classified as hazardous and their proper use is a
prerequisite for the safety of humans and the
environment. Therefore, we provide our customers with
extensive, up-to-date information on safely using our
products.
Numerous regulatory requirements exist to ensure that
chemical products not pose any danger to humans or the
environment. When it comes to the import or production,
marketing, handling, recycling and disposal of our
chemical products, it is crucial that we comply with these
regulations. In order to satisfy both national and
international safety product requirements, Merck has set
up corporate, business-specific and local guidelines and
signed broader industry self-commitments like the
Responsible Care® Global Charter.
Corporate Regulatory Affairs, a unit within Merck’s
Environment, Health, Safety, Security, Quality (EQ) Group
function, and local regulatory affairs units are
accountable for compliance with relevant product safety
regulatory requirements. Corporate Regulatory Affairs is
responsible for all operational regulatory activities within
the Merck Group, such as hazard exposure and risk
assessment, hazard communication via safety data sheets
(SDS), and chemical product registration. Its goal is to
ensure global consistency and harmonization of hazard
communication to our customers.

PRODUCTS | Product safety

With our group-wide "Product Safety Chemicals" policy,
we have established global processes for steering and
implementing product safety, as well as the
corresponding management structures. This policy covers
all relevant national and international regulations for the
chemical industry, including: the Globally Harmonized
System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS)
and its implementation in regional and national
legislation (such as the CLP Regulation in the EU and
HazCom 2012 in the United States), the EU chemicals
Regulation REACH, the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act
(TSCA), and the German Federal Law on protection from
hazardous substances (ChemG). This policy also
incorporates statutory standards that relate to the
transport of, for instance, hazardous chemicals, biocides,
cosmetics, chemicals used in food, and animal feed. It is
regularly updated to reflect new regulatory requirements.
To continuously monitor changing regulatory
requirements around the globe, as well as initiate and
steer necessary implementation projects (such as GHS and
REACH), we have put in place the Group Product Safety
Committee (GPSC). It reports directly to the Executive
Board Member Bernd Reckmann, who is responsible for
chemicals product safety. Besides managing regulatory
affairs, members of the GPSC represent Merck’s individual
businesses, each having specific responsibilities for
matters such as legal questions, production and quality
management, and marketing. The GPSC also supervises
SAP EHSM (our product safety database and expert
system), as well as internal and external communication
processes.
To ensure independent detection of critical compliance
gaps, in 2013 and 2014 Merck set up a corporate
governance function that reports directly to the head of
Corporate Regulatory Affairs. The operational units within
Corporate Regulatory Affairs are then responsible for
appropriate mitigation measures after discussion with all
stakeholders relevant for us. One example is the U.S. GHS
Compliance Program. Because Merck had acquired
product portfolios in the USA that lacked some safety
information, we initiated a multinational program in 2012
to push regulatory coverage and bring the portfolios up
to Merck’s renowned standards. Our target is not only
to close existing compliance gaps, but to also be the
frontrunner in implementing the new GHS requirements

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

PRODUCTS | Product safety

under HazCom 2012 in the USA, which will take effect in
June 2015. Merck is already well prepared for chemical
products imported into and produced in the United
States. By the end of 2014, our major production sites
there had started delivering GHS-labeled chemical
products.

Safety analyses during product development
In the Merck Group, we utilize various instruments to
ensure that the development process yields products that
are safe to use. This includes different hazard, exposure
and risk assessments. We subject all product innovations
to a formal Environment, Health and Safety analysis that
investigates aspects such as human health and
environmental impacts. The Corporate Regulatory Affairs
unit provides support and advises our employees on
safety assessments during the product development
phase.

Transparent information to boost
product safety
Proper hazard communication for chemical products via
safety data sheets or labels is a prerequisite for the safety
of humans and the environment. For all of our products,
we provide extensive information on safe use. We deliver
our hazardous chemicals with safety data sheets that
comply with current local regulatory requirements,
available in 35 languages. Although not required by law,
we provide safety data sheets for non-hazardous
substances as well as ensure that our customers have
all currently available information. Non-hazardous
substances only used in small volumes in lab applications
are provided with a safety data sheet replacement letter.
Merck keeps multiple hundreds of thousands of safety
data sheets updated and continuously launches
numerous new products, which means we have achieved
a very high level of automation in the hazard
communication process. Within the Merck Group, six
regulatory affairs hubs around the globe share dedicated
responsibilities in hazard communication processes. These
hubs report to Corporate Regulatory Affairs, which drives
the work processes throughout the Merck Group. Thanks

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

44

to our regulatory expertise and stable processes, we
receive around one complaint per week on incorrect
hazard communication.
All information related to the safe use of our products
is also accessible on our website, which furthermore
features an application called ScIDeEx®. This tool enables
customers to check whether a chemical can be safely used
under the conditions in which they plan to utilize it. The
current version, ScIDeEx® 3, is based on the latest model
of ECETOC TRA version 3.1, a program that is recognized
by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA).
In our 2014 stakeholder survey, labeling of chemicals was
identified as a material issue for Merck. With regard to
chemical product labeling, Merck’s regulatory goals
include establishing, optimizing, and harmonizing global
hazard communication processes, which will allow us to
efficiently support businesses and customers with
globally harmonized labels and GHS-compliant safety
data sheets. We implemented a dedicated function within
Corporate Regulatory Affairs that is accountable for
global label management, thus reflecting the importance
of this topic for Merck.
We are committed to product safety that goes beyond the
legal requirements and support the goals of the Global
Product Strategy, an international initiative of the
chemical industry. In this vein, we provide product safety
summaries that are available on the website of the
International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA).

REACH registration
Merck completed the second phase of the REACH
implementation process in June 2013 and had registered
all substances we produce or import in quantities ranging
from 100 to 1,000 metric tons per year – around 70
substances – with the European Chemicals Agency
(ECHA). The next step, part of the third phase, is for us to
register all substances produced or imported in quantities
ranging from one to 100 metric tons by the beginning of
June 2018. We have already started this process and are
on schedule with our activities.

PRODUCTS | Product safety

45

Due to the Strategic Approach of International Chemicals
Management (SAICM), REACH-like requirements will take
effect in South Korea (Act on the Registration and
Evaluation of Chemicals, abbreviated AREC). Based on our
expertise with the EU REACH implementation, Merck will
be well equipped to handle these requirements as well.

Nanotechnology
Nanotechnology is a highly innovative field of
development that researches and uses structures that are
50,000 times thinner than a human hair. This technology
makes it possible to produce materials with completely
new properties, benefits and functions for a wide variety
of applications.
Nanotechnology offers many opportunities for Merck. In
our Life Science and Performance Materials business
sectors, we can use nanoscale materials to develop
products with new functions and properties – thus, for
instance, making resource and energy use more efficient.
In our Healthcare business sector, we partner with
external companies to explore the use of nanomaterials
to improve therapeutic options. Within the scope of joint
European research projects, we are also investigating the
suitability of nanoparticles as vehicles for active
pharmaceutical ingredients.
However, the special structure of nanoparticles can also
entail risks. We assess these risks and utilize the new
technology only with the greatest care. We take into
account Group-wide requirements for safety as well as
environmental and health protection, employing our
existing processes and systems for product safety. We
follow the precautionary principle and take nanomaterial
safety issues seriously. In 2014, we updated our Groupwide "Use and Handling of Nanomaterials" policy; this
document governs the handling of nanomaterials,
whether used in pharmaceutical and chemical
laboratories, production plants, filling plants, or
warehouses.

In manufacturing and processing products, we strictly
adhere to compliance with all statutory regulations and
other applicable standards, such as the guidelines of the
German Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health (Bundesanstalt für Arbeitsschutz und
Arbeitsmedizin – BAuA) as well as the German Chemical
Industry Association (Verband der Chemischen Industrie –
VCI). We also provide our customers with information on
the proper handling of nanomaterials, for example during
transport, processing, storage, and disposal.
Both internally and externally, we are constantly engaged
in an exchange regarding the opportunities and risks of
nanotechnology. Our internal nano-coordination group
consists of analysts, researchers, toxicologists, safety
experts, and experts from other relevant areas of the
company. We also maintain a continuous dialogue with
other companies, associations and regulatory agencies,
through channels such as the nano-coordination group
of the VCI’s Technology and Environment (Technik und
Umwelt) committee, and the Responsible Production and
Use of Nanomaterials group, a joint technology working
group of DECHEMA (Society for Chemical Engineering and
Biotechnology) and the VCI.

Training seminars
In 2013 and 2014, we conducted product safety seminars
in various countries around the world. Here, we focused
not only on our core markets but also offered training
in developing countries. We aim to increase awareness
as well as provide best practice advice and information
on using hazardous chemical products safely and easily.
This includes lab safety rules such as the handling of
flammable solvents and storage of various chemicals in
warehouses or safety cabinets. We are planning to hold
such seminars in the future as well.

Product-related crime
Across the globe, the pharmaceutical and chemical
industry is confronted with product-related crime.
Counterfeit medicines in particular pose a major
challenge, while also representing a serious threat to
public health. According to the World Health Organization
(WHO), a considerable proportion of the medicines for sale
in developing health care systems are illegal, counterfeit
or substandard. Interpol estimates this at up to 30%. This
issue is aggravated by a lack of adequate quality control
in the protection, security and drug approval systems.
Due to the sale of products through unlicensed internet
pharmacies and online underground business-2-business

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

platforms, the percentage of substandard and/or
counterfeit medicines is growing rapidly in industrialized
nations as well.
Because criminal organizations are becoming increasingly
professionalized, pharmaceutical manufacturers are
facing ever-growing requirements to track and monitor
their products. Effective protection systems and market
monitoring are becoming increasingly important for both
the products themselves as well as the distribution
channels.
Merck develops and manufactures products of the
highest quality. We take action against product-related
crime to prevent harm from coming to customers and
patients, as well as to protect our reputation as a

Supply Chain, and Quality Assurance. Its tasks include
coordinating preventive measures, sharing information,
securing evidence, conducting investigations and
developing and implementing security systems. Where
appropriate, the network collaborates with the relevant
regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies.

Group-wide network

MACON reviews and handles approximately 70 cases of
product-related crime per year, including inquiries from
authorities that arise during backtracking investigations.
In 2013 and 2014, we focused our activities on the
internal coordination and support of two major criminal
investigations conducted by law enforcement against
major organized crime groups.

The Group function Corporate Security is the internal and
external point of contact for all anti-counterfeiting
activities of the Merck Group and is also in charge of
steering and coordinating these activities. Corporate
Security follows Merck’s internal “Crime relating to
products of the Merck Group” guideline, which describes
the goals and strategy for handling product-related crime.
All activities to fight product-related crime take place
under the supervision of the Chief Security Officer and
the Head of Environment, Health, Safety, Security and
Quality. Furthermore, at all Merck Serono sites we have
deployed local anti-counterfeiting correspondents; these
employees act as the interface between local regulatory
and law enforcement authorities, domestic associations,
Merck Group functions, and Merck's businesses. We
gauge our measures according to the number of incidents
reported, the severity of the incidents, and the rollout of
product security features.
The Merck Anti-Counterfeiting Operational Network
(MACON) is headed by Corporate Security and is
responsible for monitoring and implementing all global
anti-counterfeiting measures for our products. The
network consists of experts from various units such as
Legal/Trademarks, Product Security, Export Control,

Educating our employees and business
partners
The fight against product-related crime and counterfeit
products is an integral part of our risk management
system. In order to minimize risks, we provide training
to employees of our subsidiaries, as well as to business
partners in the countries in which we lack our own legal
entity. In 2013, we held multi-day workshops and training
seminars in China and Germany. During a global
workshop, Merck security personnel from the United
States, Mexico, Latin America, and eastern Asia were
brought together to develop ideas to continuously
improve our internal control measures. Product-related
crime also featured as a topic during the Merck Africa
Conference 2014. During 2013 and 2014, we conducted
security audits at partner companies in Brazil, Mexico,
India, Russia, Italy, and Germany.

Four different categories of product-related crime
Product counterfeiting: Merck defines a counterfeit product according to WHO standards as “A product that is deliberately and fraudulently
produced and/or mislabeled with respect to its identity and/or source to make it appear to be a genuine product”.
This includes products:
• with incorrect concentrations of active ingredients
• with incorrect active ingredients
• without any active ingredients
• with dangerous impurities
• with modified/altered packaging and/or wrong brand names
• with an authentic active agent, but not produced under GXP conditions
• that have expired
Illegal diversion of products: This term refers to the diversion of either chemical or pharmaceutical products from within the legitimate supply
chain for illegal export, for use in the production of illegal drugs, weapons or explosives, or for any other illegitimate purpose.
Black market crimes: This refers to the sale of counterfeit and/or diverted products via illegal channels (e.g. the Internet), or for illegal purposes
Misappropriation of products: This includes theft from production sites and warehouses, or while in transit.

Authenticity and tracking
Besides implementing internal quality control systems
and strictly adhering to all export and trade guidelines,
we also combat counterfeit products through innovative
solutions tailored to specific markets and target groups.
These measures aim to help our customers and patients
determine for themselves the identity or authenticity of
a pharmaceutical product. Here, we are applying multiple
approaches in parallel.
• We use security markings with protected color travel
pigments of our own manufacture on Merck product
packaging and labels. Called Security-M, this enables
users to easily verify the authenticity of our products.
These security features are considerably harder to
counterfeit than the holograms that are frequently
used. In 2013, the Merck Group Quality Council
decided to further roll out Security-M on Merck
products.
• We employ identification and shipment tracking
systems such as Track and Trace, which has already
been fully implemented in the United States and is
currently being expanded to other markets.
• Since December 2014, Merck Serono has been
serializing all of its major brands in the United States,

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

which thus allows physicians, pharmacists and
patients to verify their medicines. Furthermore, Merck
Serono has launched Check My Meds. By using this
free smartphone app, patients in the United States
can verify the serial number of their medicines.
• In the Mobile Anticounterfeiting System (MAS) project
in Nigeria, Merck is partnering with a supplier to
detect counterfeit medicines through a mobile phone/
text message-based identification system. Patients
scratch off a barcode that is affixed to the product
packaging and send it to the MAS via text message;
they then immediately receive a message telling them
whether the number on the product is authentic or
not. These projects have fostered public and patient
awareness on the issue of counterfeit medicines and
further increased the trust in our products.
We have made strong progress in systematically
implementing the requirements of the EU Falsified
Medicines Directive, such as the application of a unique
serial number to our pharmaceutical packaging.
Furthermore, we are participating in corresponding pilot
initiatives of the German and European pharmaceutical
industries. Similar efforts are underway in the U.S., where
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires drug
companies to include a unique serial number on each
package of drugs dispensed by 2017.

49

In addition to this, a comprehensive auditing system for
distributors and contract manufacturers ensures that
Good Manufacturing and Good Distribution Practices
(GMP/GDP) are adhered to. This system is based on the
EMA ICH Q10 pharmaceutical quality assurance standard.
For our customers in the pharmaceutical industry, we
offer Candurin® pearl effect pigments, which feature
unique color properties that make tablets and capsules
more difficult to counterfeit.
We have established an internal control system to
monitor and track chemicals that can be misused to
produce illegal weaponry, explosives, and narcotic drugs,
collaborating closely with regulatory and law
enforcement authorities. Our system flags suspicious
orders and/or orders of suspicious products. We will only
release products once we have verified the existence of
an end-user declaration. Furthermore, we also proactively
report suspicious orders to the relevant authorities. In
doing so, we are adhering to a commitment made by
the German Chemical Industry Association (VCI) and to
the “Guideline for Operators” published by the EU
Commission. We also participate in export control
proceedings and, in certain cases, provide reports to law
enforcement agencies.

compounds. With the Minilab, counterfeit medicines can
be detected quickly, easily and cheaply, even in developing
health care systems. Further information can be found
under Society on p. 121.

Multifaceted engagement and
stakeholder dialogue
We are fighting product piracy in partnership with
organizations such as EFPIA, IFPMA, and VFA. We also
support industry-wide initiatives and collaborate closely
with regulatory authorities and law enforcement at a
national, regional, and international level.
A particular area of emphasis is our work with the
Pharmaceutical Security Institute (PSI); this organization
is dedicated to protecting public health by sharing
information on counterfeit pharmaceuticals as well as
initiating enforcement actions through the appropriate
authorities. When product-related crimes are committed,
we collaborate with the law enforcement agencies and
customs authorities in the respective countries, with
Interpol, with the World Customs Organization, with
health authorities, and with our peer industry. Merck is
also a member of Rx-360, a consortium of global
pharmaceutical manufacturers and suppliers that aims to
prevent counterfeit products through the introduction of
global quality control systems.

Merck funds the non-profit Global Pharma Health Fund
(GPHF), which supplies a portable analysis kit (the GPHFMinilabTM) to check the quality of medicines on 75 drug

Sustainable products
Responsibility for our products is at the core of our
corporate responsibility. We therefore strive to minimize
the impact that our products have on people and the
environment during their development, manufacture, and
distribution, as well as during and after their use. This
includes providing comprehensive information on
responsible, safe and proper use of these products. It is,
however, also crucial to conserve resources and minimize
emissions and waste in our manufacturing processes, as
well as to help our customers to do so.
Through our products, we are helping to overcome global
challenges such as climate change and energy scarcity.
Our Performance Materials portfolio contains numerous
examples of such products. Among others, we are
developing innovative solutions for energy-saving
displays and lighting, as well as materials for the
photovoltaics industry.
• Liquid crystals (LCs) provide computer monitors and
televisions with high picture quality while also
consuming little energy. Our materials for PS-VA
(polymer-stabilized vertical alignment) technology
help to significantly reduce the amount of
backlighting needed, which is the largest power
consumer in these devices. With the PS-VA

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

technology, displays use 20% less energy than the
precursor technology.
• Under the licristal® brand Merck has developed energy
saving Ultra-Brightness FFS (UB-FFS) technology,
which ensures a 15% increase in light transmission
in displays. The benefits include less energy
consumption and greater design flexibility for product
developers (e.g. longer battery life and higher picture
resolution).
• LCs are utilized in smart windows: They allow more
solar heat to enter during the winter and less in the
summer, thereby improving the energy efficiency of
buildings.
• Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) make it possible
to produce energy-efficient displays with brilliant
colors and sharp picture quality. Merck has a
partnership with Epson, a Japanese printer
manufacturer. Our common goal is the mass
production of large-area OLED displays using ink-jet
printing. During the 2013-2014 period, this
partnership made excellent progress. In Japan, Merck
has installed the world’s first pilot production plant
for OLED inks. Several display companies are setting
up ink-jet pilot printers to proof mass production
concepts for large scale OLED displays.

PRODUCTS | Sustainable products

51

• Modern light sources such as light-emitting diodes
(LEDs) and organic light-emitting diodes are key
technologies that will make it possible to decrease the
energy consumption of lighting.
• Our printable structuring materials are enabling the
photovoltaics industry to manufacture solar cells in
a more environmentally sound way while improving
their efficiency. In addition, we are further developing
new materials and technologies for new types of solar
cells. This includes innovative process materials for
upcoming high efficiency silicon-based solar cells and
new materials for next generation photovoltaics, such
as organic solar cells and dye-sensitized solar cells.
These materials will enable flexible, semi-transparent
and lightweight solutions significantly broadening the
application range of photovoltaics.
• AZ Electronic Materials has developed products such
as PFOS-free antireflective coatings and photoresists
that contain not a trace of hazardous chemicals.
The "Displaying Futures" initiative, launched in 2011,
creates space for interaction, interdisciplinary exchange
and mutual inspiration for display and material producers,

designers, architects, artists, scientists and experts from
other fields. The aim is to develop scenarios beyond pure
technical approaches that show how human needs for
communication and mobility are constantly changing,
thereby impacting the properties of displays. At the
Displaying Futures Symposium in Shanghai, experts
answered questions on how display systems impact
architecture as well as people’s lives.
In dialogue with our customers from the cosmetics
industry, we develop proposals for cosmetic formulations
that meet strict sustainability criteria and are in line with
the current trend towards more natural cosmetics. Several
of our products have been certified by ECOCERT, an
independent organization that represents high
international standards for environmentally sustainable
products, and certifies that raw materials used in
cosmetics and food applications are produced in an
ecological way. In 2013 and 2014, approximately 40 of
our products received this certification, which accounts
for about 20% of our pigments and cosmetics portfolio.

Examples
The Merck Millipore portfolio consists of thousands of products with different characteristics and varying challenges with regard to
sustainability. The following examples illustrate how we minimize our products’ impact on people and the environment, and help our customers
achieve their own sustainability goals:
• Our greener solvents show improvements of certain characteristics over the alternatives commonly used for a given application. These
products may be safer, with reduced hazard or lower volatility, or may have reduced environmental impacts, increased biodegradability or
be easier to recycle.
• Our bioethanol offers a non-synthetic alternative to synthetically produced chemicals. Bioethanol was the first greener solvent we made
available to customers, and we continue to work to provide additional renewable material-based solvents as well as products with lower
toxicity. Production of bioethanol is a less toxic process than typical ethanol manufacturing. Our EMPLURA® product line of solvents is also
being expanded to include products derived from renewable resources such as corn cobs and sugar cane bagasse.
• The new Extran® AP 33 antifoam agent has the same effectiveness as its predecessor, but we eliminated formaldehyde and nitrilotriacetic
acid. Further updated Extran® products (MA05, AP16 and AP17) do not contain nitrilotriacetic acid either.
• The products we sell are also raw materials that our pharmaceutical customers use in their processes. We recognize that pharmaceuticals
in the environment are a concern for our customers, and to help address this, we are focused on improving the bioavailability of drugs.
To further collaborate with our customers and expand our capabilities in bioavailability enhancement, we opened a new R&D Center for
Formulation in Darmstadt, Germany. There, we are partnering with the pharmaceutical industry to develop new and innovative materials
and delivery systems that better enable them to develop drugs that can be more readily absorbed and thus less excreted.
• We are also actively working to develop technologies that address global challenges like climate change and energy scarcity. For example,
our bench-top Guava HT series flow cytometer is helping to drive biofuel research and development. Our customers use Guava instruments
to determine which species will achieve maximum diesel production. Guava instruments are also being used in the production of ethanol
from sugar, where they test the viability of bacteria that are used to digest sugars and produce gases that are refined into ethanol.

Sustainability starts at the product
development stage
The cornerstone of our products' sustainability lies in the
development phase. We have implemented various
guidelines such as our Group-wide "Product Safety
Chemicals Policy” in order to reduce potentially negative
effects. In our Performance Materials business sector, we
adhere to the "Halogen-free Policy" of our customers and
have implemented the "Green Product Policy". Among
other things, this forbids the use of acutely toxic,
mutagenic, or otherwise severely hazardous substances
that remain present in the end product. We furthermore
ensure that our products adhere to national and
international regulations such as REACH and RoHS, as
well as fulfill other industry- and customer-specific
requirements.
In addition, we have developed systems within the Merck
Group that incorporate sustainability criteria into the
product development process. In our chemicals business,
the Accolade project management system provides
researchers with a "tool box" for the entire product life
cycle.

52

Accolade addresses issues relating to technology, quality,
regulatory requirements, and patents, enabling
researchers and product developers to compare and make
decisions on uniform criteria to improve the sustainability
of products.
At Merck Millipore, our Design for Sustainability (DfS)
program is integrated within the product development
process. DfS aims to reduce the environmental and health
impacts of our products across their entire life cycle, from
manufacture to use through to disposal. We strive to
maximize performance and ease of use for our customers.
Our design teams incorporate
sustainability
considerations early in the design process. They use a
scorecard to assess a product’s main environmental
hotspots throughout its entire life cycle, driving
improvement across six main focus areas: materials,
energy & emissions, waste, water, packaging, and usability
& innovation. Merck Millipore uses the DfS criteria to
measure progress towards our 2015 product
sustainability goal of driving product sustainability
improvement in 10% of the product families we offer.

Design for Sustainability
Merck Millipore has already employed DfS principles in the design of several products. Real life examples show how Design for Sustainability
has been put into practice.
• Clarisolve® Depth Filters, used in cell culture processing, were launched in 2013. With reduced pre-flushing requirements of the product
as an important goal of the design, we completed a life cycle assessment to quantify this reduction and other environment-related
improvements. The results show that significant progress has been achieved, especially for the use phase of the product. Compared to the
alternative product (Millistak+® Pod Depth Filter) used by customers to produce one batch, Clarisolve® is characterized by 63% reduction
in use-phase energy consumption, by a 46% reduction in use-phase water consumption (1,800L per batch), and by a 24% reduction in
solid waste mass at the user facility.
• In 2013, the EZ-Fit™ Manifold for laboratory filtration was launched. During the design process, the DfS approach was followed, which
improved handling and reduced the environmental impacts compared to its predecessor, the Hydrosol Manifold. The EZ-Fit™ Manifold
uses 47% less raw material and its packaging consists of 100% recyclable corrugated board. Because the filtration heads can be easily
removed for cleaning, very little space is needed in the autoclave to clean the heads relative to the space needed to clean the whole device.
This results in a 91% reduction in autoclave-associated carbon emissions. After the product’s 10 year validated lifetime, it can be easily
disassembled, and over 95% of its parts are recyclable.
• The design of the Snap i.d. 2.0 Protein Detection System reduces waste for the end user and cuts emissions from shipping. We managed
to reduce consumable materials by 91%, GHG emissions for distribution in the United States by 99%, weight of packaging per weight of
product by 93%, and solid waste mass at user facilities by 99%.

Analysis as a prerequisite for improvement
In order to reduce the unwanted effects of our products,
we must understand our products across their life cycle,
which is why we perform corresponding analyses. In some
cases, we investigate the complete life cycle ("cradle to
grave"); in other cases, we focus on parts of the cycle
through the "cradle-to-gate" approach, meaning that we
analyze the R&D phase of a product up to the point
of delivery to the customer. Sometimes we concentrate
on particular aspects, such as greenhouse gas emissions,
water consumption, or packaging. The results of the
analyses show us where we have potential for
improvement. Our experts from R&D, Product
Management, Quality, Procurement, and other units can
use these data as a basis to develop specific measures
and initiatives across the entire product life cycle; they
furthermore engage in an exchange of relevant best
practices and ideas. We share the results of our analyses
with our customers as well.
We have also calculated the product carbon footprint for
pearl-luster pigments and liquid crystal mixtures as well
as the product water footprint for liquid crystal mixtures
using the “cradle-to-gate” approach. Our customers
utilize these data to calculate footprints for their products.
Since our performance materials are only present in the
end product in minute amounts, our contribution to the
end product's footprint is generally very minor.
Merck Millipore conducts several analyses to identify
product impacts and to improve the sustainability of its
products. For example, a life cycle assessment (LCA) was
conducted for the Clarisolve® Depth Filter. Another
example is the LCA comparing the Titripac® product
delivery system with the 1L polyethylene bottle product
delivery system. We calculated the life cycle energy and
carbon footprint for both product delivery systems, and
the results showed that the Titripac® had substantial
benefits over the polyethylene bottles: a 61% reduction
in GHG emissions, a 33% reduction in GHG emissions for

shipping to U.S. customers, a 42% reduction in packaging
material mass, a 91% increase in renewable materials, and
a 73% reduction in solid waste.
We also conducted an LCA comparing the 200L ReCycler®
product delivery system and the 4L glass bottle product
delivery system. The study showed that the ReCycler®
product delivery system has significant benefits over the
glass bottles: a 69% reduction in life cycle GHG emissions,
a 77% reduction in life cycle energy demand, a 53%
reduction in packaging-to-product weight ratio, 46%
increase in cube utilization, and a 99% reduction in mass
of packaging solid waste.

Awards
In 2013 and 2014, Merck received awards for its
innovative products. In 2013, Merck received the Inter
Solar Award in San Francisco (CA, USA) for the isishape
Selective Emitter Process and in Paris (France) for the
isishape SolarEtch product line, both efficiency-gaining
and environmentally sustainable concepts. In 2014, Merck
also received the Meyer-Galow Prize for business
chemistry for the "Energy-efficient liquid crystals for
smartphones and tablets" project, for its contribution to
advancements in smartphone and tablet PC displays.
Additionally, Merck Millipore received two R&D Magazine
100 Awards for innovative products released to market in
2013. The 52nd Annual R&D Awards recognize the 100
most technologically significant products introduced into
the marketplace over the past year. The Merck Millipore
products that were recognized are the SmartFlare™
detection reagent and the Clarisolve® Depth Filters.
Merck Millipore was also awarded the “Greenest Life
Science Company” in November 2014 at the bi-annual
Life Science Industry Awards® (LSIA). The LSIA recognizes
the best-in-class life science suppliers across 28 product,
communications and support categories. Over 5,000
individual scientists from 76 countries selected Merck
Millipore as the “Greenest Life Science Company”.

Packaging
Packaging plays an important role for our products in
two ways: Firstly, it protects our products from external
influences and ensures that they reach the customer
undamaged. Secondly, packaging guarantees that the
environment will not be negatively impacted by
substances leaking out. The packaging must therefore
remain safe throughout the product's entire life cycle –
during transport, storage, usage, and disposal.
In addition to safety, efficient resource use also plays a
crucial role. We identify potential areas for optimizing our
resources in order to, for example, reduce material usage
during packaging manufacture without compromising
quality and safety. We also strive to increase the
percentage of materials that minimally impact the
environment.
The majority of corrugated boxes we use globally are
environmentally certified, e.g. according to the standards
of the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI), Forest
Stewardship Council (FSC) and/or the Programs for the
Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes (PEFC).

Packaging for Merck Millipore products
Merck Millipore is currently developing a sustainable
packaging strategy. One important aspect of the strategy
is that we want to continue to deliver our products in
packaging that is safe and easy for our customers to

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

use, while helping them reduce their own impact on the
environment. We are therefore working on several
initiatives, including ones to develop reusable packaging
systems and to reduce the use of foam components. Here
are a few examples:
• Glass bottles are still the most preferred packaging
for reagents. Although glass is an inert material, it
is highly fragile. In order to increase product safety,
we therefore developed the Safebreak bottle, which is
coated in plastic (PE) to prevent acids from leaking out
if the glass breaks. Should the bottle fall and break, the
acid and glass splinters are securely contained within
the PE coating. The Safebreak bottles can be recycled
or disposed of with conventional glass bottles since
the PE coating does not interfere with the glass
recycling process.
• Glass reagent bottles have traditionally been secured
with EPS (expanded polystyrene) molded foam to
prevent them from bumping into each other or falling
during transportation and breaking. While EPS is an
effective cushioning material, it is produced from
non-renewable petrochemicals and hard to recycle.
Also EPS packaging is bulky and difficult to store. In
recent years, Merck Millipore has thus been replacing
EPS foam with molded fiber components (molded
pulp), consisting of cellulose and recycled paper, as
part of a replacement program. The use of molded
pulp reduces the amount of packaging waste for our
customers, because it is easily recycled with other
paper materials and can be compacted for storage

PRODUCTS | Sustainable products

55

and transportation. In Germany, we replaced 600,000
EPS molded foam components by the end of 2013.
During 2014, we extended the EPS foam replacement
program and are now replacing more than 1 million
packaging components per year in Germany. In
France, we are replacing 12,000 packaging
components per year. In India, we initially conducted
additional investigations because of the climate
conditions found there. In 2015 we will start
exporting solvents from our EMPARTA® and
EMPLURA® product lines in molded pulp parts.
Currently we are using a honeycomb corrugate
material to replace EPS foam in the United States,
but we are also investigating the use of molded pulp
there.
• In Europe, solvents for large-scale application in
preparative chromatography are supplied in
returnable stainless steel containers, and in the United
States, returnable stainless steel containers are
utilized in the ReCycler® Program. By using these
containers, we are significantly reducing the
consumption of primary packaging materials. Since
the stainless steel containers can be shipped without
any secondary packaging material, we are also
reducing packaging by eliminating the cardboard
boxes and molded pulp inserts used when shipping
glass bottles.
• For our Milli-Q® Integral Water Purification Systems
utilized for lab water purification, molded pulp
cushioning is used for the product accessories. The
Q-Pod® and E-Pod® used to be packaged with
polyethylene, but now they utilize a custom molded
pulp cushioning material that is made from 100%
recycled fiber and is fully recyclable. We have thus
also reduced the number of pallets required to store
the material by 90%.
• We have developed a custom reusable totes program
for two of our U.S.-based customers for the bulk
delivery of our Millistak+® Pod Disposable Depth
Filters. This program offers these customers a cleanroom ready solution that can be reused up to 90
times. In 2013, we conducted a life cycle assessment
to compare the environmental benefits of reusable
totes versus corrugated packaging. Each tote can
transport up to 900 units before being recycled,
resulting in a 95% reduction in packaging materials

consumed. We are also pursuing opportunities to
reduce the carbon footprint of distribution by working
on direct ship to customers and other logistics
efficiencies.
• Our Titripac® packaging system for volumetric
solutions was designed to make titration more reliable
and less wasteful. Constructed from a recyclable
corrugated outer box and durable inner bag, the
packaging features a unique built-in contaminationproof dispenser tap and is less than half the weight of
conventional plastic bottles. Recyclability is improved
since the outer box can be fully recycled. We
conducted a product carbon footprint analysis
comparing the Titripac® and plastic bottle packaging
systems, and found that the reduced material weight
and high recyclability of Titripac® result in an overall
reduction of 61% in life cycle greenhouse gas
emissions. Because this packaging design keeps the
product safe from contamination, the chemical
product can be used effectively to the last drop,
thereby wasting less.
• In 2013 Merck Millipore developed new user guide
booklets from our Millex® Syringe Filter devices
manufactured in Cork, Ireland. The new user guide
design used less material and was more compact,
reducing the weight of the booklet by approximately
50%, saving Merck Millipore 4,700 kg of paper in
2013 and 6,200 kg of paper in 2014. This also reduced
greenhouse gas emissions from paper production and
product distribution by 38 metric tons CO2e in 2013
and 51 metric tons CO2e in 2014.

Packaging for Performance Materials products
In South Korea, the Performance Materials business
utilizes a patented system of stainless steel canisters that
are filled with liquid crystal mixtures at the Poseung site
and delivered to South Korean display manufacturers. The
Merck Standard Canisters (MSCs) can be utilized directly
on the production lines without decanting. The empty
canisters are then sent back to Merck where they are
cleaned under validated conditions. The MSCs are reused
within a closed system over multiple years. A reusable
polypropylene box serves as outer packaging. Similar
systems are in use at other liquid crystal mixture
production sites in Asia.

Reuse and recycling
Through take-back programs, as well as environmentally
sustainable recycling and disposal of used chemicals and
packaging, Merck works with its customers to help reduce
the environmental impacts of its products and services.
We strive to communicate and collaborate with our
customers, suppliers and other partners to identify ways
to develop innovative, safe product packaging, recycling
and end-of-life programs that help our customers reduce
their own disposal impacts.
Merck Millipore’s Design for Sustainability program
encourages our Research & Development teams to design
products with reduced life cycle impacts. This includes
reusable or recyclable materials that are easy to recover or
disassemble. We furthermore strive to eliminate materials
that are costly to manage, such as toxic substances. This
allows Merck Millipore to continually improve the
recycling potential of new products through measures
such as simplified disassembly, or by increasing the
percentage of recyclable materials in its products.
The following examples show how we are implementing
product packaging, recycling and end-of-life programs:
• Biopharma product recycling program: Single-use
products play an increasingly important role in the
biopharmaceutical industry. In 2012, Merck Millipore
and five customers jointly launched a pilot Biopharma
Product Recycling Program in the United States. In
2013, we expanded this pilot program to include two
more customers in the United States. The total
product waste diverted from traditional disposal
during 2013 was 72 metric tons. In 2014 we increased
the amount of product waste diverted to 117 metric
tons. Out of the 189 metric tons of product waste
diverted in 2013 and 2014, we were able to recycle
91 metric tons of plastic. For its Biopharma Product
Recycling Program, Merck Millipore received a
Sustainability award from its customer Biogen Idec –
the first award to be given out to a supplier. This was
the first customer recognition for Merck Millipore’s
Biopharma Product Recycling Program.

• Ech2o™: Recycling program for lab water
purification cartridges: The Lab Water business field
of Merck Millipore launched the Ech2o™ program for
water purification cartridges in 2012. The program
enables our customers in the U.S. to send back their
cartridges for recycling, thus avoiding the need for
traditional disposal methods such as landfill or
incineration. A life cycle assessment has revealed that
this can reduce the environmental impact of the
cartridges by 10%-15%. During the last two years
more than 300 customers have returned over 2,000
used cartridges. This represents approximately 5
metric tons of product waste that has been diverted
from landfill or incineration. We are continuing to
work with our customers and our partners to increase
awareness of the program and training in the hopes
of driving up customer return rates.
We are currently applying our lessons learned and
investigating how we can expand both of these programs
beyond the United States, to markets in Europe and Asia.
Our longer-term goal is to expand our product recycling
and reuse initiatives beyond biopharma and lab water
purification cartridges, as well as capturing additional
plastic products in labs.

Environmentally sustainable, safe disposal
Initially set up in Germany over 20 years ago, the objective
of the Retrologistik® program is to provide a system for
safe and environmentally sound management of chemical
waste and used packaging. In addition to agreements on
environmentally sustainable disposal, this program offers
chemical users and local waste disposal firms access to
information, training and services to implement sound
chemical and package waste management. We expanded
the program and established the concept in Indonesia, the
Philippines and Thailand through a three-year strategic
alliance (2010-2013) with the German Association for
International Cooperation (GIZ) called “Environmentally
Sound Management of Chemical Waste in South East
Asia”.

Strategic alliance with GIZ
The strategic alliance with GIZ aimed to establish the Retrologistik® concept in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand in order to increase
environmental awareness there as well as change how people handle hazardous materials. The project has improved training, auditing and
implementation capacity in the respective countries, with the transfer of Merck technology and knowledge playing a crucial role. Informational
and training materials were developed and made available in the national languages of each country and approximately 9,000 people received
training. Furthermore, approximately 230 metric tons of chemical waste was properly managed in the participating countries between March
2010 and May 2013.
At three universities in Thailand, 20 “model labs” were established to demonstrate responsible, environmentally sustainable chemical
management. As a result of these pilot programs, it is estimated that 300 chemical users adopted the Environmentally Sound Management of
Chemical Waste system or an equivalent system for their laboratories. Additionally, Merck and training partner organizations in Thailand will
continue to offer training on Environmentally Sound Management of Chemical Waste to interested chemical users.
In Indonesia, we built a bottle washing plant that operates according to European standards, the first of its kind. This plant has the capacity to
treat 9,000 chemical bottles per month. After we installed the cleaning facility, the Jababeka Industrial Estate assumed ownership of the project
and Merck continues to promote the project and spread awareness to their customers within the region. While the three-year strategic alliance
ended in 2013, Merck is continuing to support the project and spread awareness in the region through sales and marketing activities.
In the Philippines we implemented the Environmentally Sound Management of Chemical Waste concept, with a focus on photometric cuvette
tests. In the region of Luzon, for instance, 25 companies participate in the program and approximately 500 test sets are safely disposed of per
year.
In the Philippines, training programs helped chemical users become more aware of the significance of the Globally Harmonized System (GHS)
and of the information on chemical safety, storage and disposal available on the internet, especially on the Merck website. The academic sector
in particular became more aware of the importance of the information readily available in the safety data sheet (SDS). We reached at least
50 academic institutions. Following the training, we observed improvements in the safety signs in the respective facilities, proper chemical
separation and segregation, as well as support for company management and heads of schools regarding chemical safety programs.
At least 400 participants from more than 150 companies came to the 7th Safety Summit held in Manila in June 2014. For the first time this
program was also conducted in two other provinces to reach more laboratory practitioners. In all, Merck's subsidiary in the Philippines has
reached more than 5,000 people through the various seminars and summits that we have conducted.

In Europe, solvents for large-scale application in
preparative chromatography are supplied in reusable
stainless steel barrels or containers. Customers send back
the empty containers to Merck in Darmstadt, Germany
for professional cleaning and reuse. Approximately 20,000
stainless steel barrels and 20,000 stainless steel drums are
circulated in Europe. The rate of return is 90% for the
barrels; for the drums it is around 50%.

ReCycler®
Like the Retrologistik® program in Europe, our EMD
ReCycler® Bulk Product Delivery System has been
designed to increase safe handling and decrease
packaging of our solvents for our U.S.-based customers.
The system allows our customers to reuse a dedicated
fleet of stainless steel containers for delivery of solvents.
When the customer requests it, we send another full
container to replace the empty one, which can then be
sent back to be refilled.

During 2014 we conducted a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
on this system. We compared the 200L ReCycler® product
delivery system to our equivalent 4L glass bottle product
delivery system. The total volume delivered was based on
1000L of product being used by a customer. We modeled
the distances based on the three different locations within
the U.S. The study showed that the ReCycler® product
delivery system led to an average 69% reduction in life
cycle GHG emissions, a 77% reduction in life cycle energy
demand, a 53% reduction in packaging-to-product
weight ratio, a 46% increase in cube utilization, and a
99% reduction in mass of waste due to packaging.

Access to health

Strategic approach

An estimated 1.3 billion people have no access to effective
and affordable healthcare. According to the World Health
Organization (WHO), developing countries bear 93% of
the world’s disease burden, yet account for only 18%
of world income and 11% of global health spending.
Providing access to health in these countries is a complex
challenge. Improving access involves researching,
developing and refining health solutions, creating
efficient health systems and distribution channels,
offering products at affordable prices and empowering
health workers and patients.

Access to Health (A2H) is a strategic priority for Merck.
Through our holistic A2H approach we aim to help
improve sustainable access to high-quality health
solutions for underserved populations and communities
in low- and middle-income countries. Recognizing that
access is a complex challenge, our programs and
initiatives are tailored to global, regional and local needs.
Furthermore, we realize that we cannot work alone to
address all the access gaps and that partnerships,
collaboration and dialogue are key to delivering
sustainable access solutions.

Clinical trials

Our A2H strategy leverages our interdisciplinary expertise
and skills and is sponsored by Stefan Oschmann, Vice
Chairman of the Executive Board. At the end of 2014,
he became President of the International Federation of
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA),
and has dedicated his two-year term to accelerating
access to high-quality health solutions for people in lowto middle-income countries.

As regards clinical trials, we adhere to all applicable
statutory regulations and industry standards, such as
Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki. Our clinical trials are performed
according to the same high ethical and scientific
standards in all countries worldwide.
Read more under Clinical trials. on p. 70

Responsible Marketing
In order to ensure professional and transparent conduct
in our pharmaceutical marketing activities, we comply not
only with numerous statutory regulations, but have also
defined our own code of practice.
Read more under Responsible marketing on p. 77

Counterfeit medicines
Counterfeit medicines pose a major global threat to public
health. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates
that a number of pharmaceuticals available on the market
in developing countries are illegal, counterfeit or
substandard. We fight product-related crime in order to
protect patients, our customers, and our company’s
reputation.
Read more under Product-related crime on p. 46

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

In 2013, Merck established an Access to Health Unit at
Group level, which has identified access gaps and
opportunities to better meet the needs of underserved
patients and has become an integral part of how Merck
conducts business.
In 2014, we revised our strategy and the Merck Charter
on Access to Health in Developing Countries. The Charter
is composed of 6 position papers that include “Our
Approach”, which defines our A2H strategy as well as
covers the following priority thematic access issues:
pharmaceutical donations and philanthropy, research and
development for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs),
pharmaceutical product pricing, intellectual property, and
counterfeit medicines.
We leverage our core competencies and expertise across
the health value chain in order to address access barriers
through our A2H strategy, which focuses on the “Four
As of Access”: Availability, Affordability, Awareness and
Accessibility:
• Availability: Entails the research, development and
refinement of health solutions that address unmet

PRODUCTS | Access to health

59

needs and are tailored to local environments.
Examples include our engagement in the Pediatric
Praziquantel Consortium, our partnership with
Medicines for Malaria Venture, and the Merck
Millipore Muse Auto CD4/CD4% system.
• Accessibility: Merck promotes initiatives to
strengthen supply chains and to develop localized
health solutions in order to deliver and reach out
efficiently at the point of care. In India for instance,
we support the River Ambulance Project, and in
Ghana we have launched a pilot of our Rural
Pharmacy, which aims to serve remote areas of Africa.
• Affordability: We seek to provide assistance to those
who are unable to pay for the health solutions they
need. Examples include our Merck Praziquantel
Donation Program (MPDP), a partnership with WHO
to fight the tropical worm disease schistosomiasis,
and our membership in WIPO Re:Search.
• Awareness: Merck contributes to raising awareness
by empowering health workers, communities and
patients so that they can make informed decisions.
Take for example our Capacity Advancement Program
(CAP), a diabetes awareness campaign in Africa, the
Suswastha project in India and the Ghana WASH
project.
We believe that it is important to monitor and evaluate
our access to health programs in order to better
understand how we are meeting patients’ needs. To help
us assess our strengths and areas where we can further
strengthen our efforts, we are working to develop
quantitative and qualitative indicators across all Four As
of Access, which will be evaluated regularly by the A2H
steering committee that is currently being formed.
Our approach to delivering initiatives along our Four As of
Access involves a four-step process:
1. Diagnose: We identify unmet needs of underserved
populations and communities in low- and middleincome countries.
2. Design: We develop business-integrated
approaches to provide support, utilizing our
expertise and core competencies as well as our
partners’ experience.

3. Implement: We implement innovative solutions in
collaboration with our partners to meet needs in a
sustainable way.
4. Evaluate: We regularly monitor and evaluate our
programs to ensure that we achieve the outcomes
desired, and where necessary, we reorient our
program to optimize results. We report on results
through our A2H website, Annual Report and
Corporate Responsibility Report.

Access to Medicine Index
Every two years, the Access to Medicine Foundation
releases the Access to Medicine Index, which
ranks pharmaceutical companies in terms of their
contributions to improving access to medicines in
developing countries. Funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation as well as the UK and Dutch governments,
the Index has been published every two years since 2008.
Merck ranked sixth in the 2014 Access to Medicines Index,
two places higher than in 2012. In the 2014 Access to
Medicine Index report, Merck was recognized for its
progression from a philanthropy-driven access strategy to
a strategic pro-business access approach, as well as for
leading examples such as:
• Pro-access approach to Intellectual Property (IP)
management and policies, including its commitment
to not filing patents in a broad range of Index
countries;
• Piloting a pro-access business model in India through
the Suswastha project;
• Alignment of R&D strategy with developing countries’
needs with regard to communicable and noncommunicable diseases;
• Forward integration of Merck’s Global Manufacturing
and Supply;
• Active approach to dialogue and knowledge sharing
through the Merck Access Dialogue Series, a
multistakeholder platform for sharing information
and best practices as well as discussing collaborative
action to overcome access barriers;
• Adoption of a multi-dimensional approach to
contribute to the elimination of schistosomiasis;

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

PRODUCTS | Access to health

• Improved transparency through efforts such as the
revised and broadened Merck Charter on Access to
Health in Developing Countries.

Stakeholder dialogue
We believe that partnerships, collaboration and dialogue
are key to delivering sustainable access results. Our
partners include multilateral organizations, governments,
non-governmental organizations, patient organizations,
academia, healthcare professional associations, think
tanks and private sector partners. We are committed to
the Millennium Development Goals, and we will
collaborate with partners on defining priorities and
delivering on commitments and goals for the post-2015
sustainable development agenda.
Merck has launched the Access Dialogue Series, which
provides a platform for information exchange and best
practice sharing among public and private sector
stakeholders. These dialogues enable us to collaboratively

60

address the access challenges for underserved
populations and to inform our dedicated strategy and
initiatives. In 2014, the Access Dialogue Series was
recognized as a best practice in the first-ever “Guiding
Principles on Access to Healthcare Report” released by
Business for Social Responsibility.
During 2013 and 2014, we sponsored a series of access
seminars with the European Commission and Parliament
hosted by the European Federation of Pharmaceutical
Industries and Associations (EFPIA). The seminars focused
on important access issues in developing countries,
including R&D for neglected diseases, clinical trials,
technology transfer, and affordability. The debates
demonstrated that, in order to sustainably tackle global
health challenges, it is highly important for stakeholders
from both developed and developing countries to
proactively collaborate. Merck also supports a European
Commission initiative on access to medicines in
developing countries, with a focus on Africa.

Discussions at the global level
In 2013 and 2014, we engaged in numerous discussions at the global level:
• In November 2014, at a reception celebrating the 3rd anniversary of WIPO Re:Search, Stefan Oschmann, Vice Chairman of the Executive
Board, formally announced that Merck was joining this initiative.
• In October 2014, more than 100 healthcare professionals from different African countries attended the Merck Africa Luminary in
Darmstadt. There, they benefited from medical education on disease management in the areas of diabetes, fertility and oncology, as well
as sessions on improving supply chain integrity, pharmacovigilance, and fighting counterfeits.
• In May 2014, at the 67th World Health Assembly (WHA), Stefan Oschmann and the Permanent Representative of Germany to the UN in
Geneva hosted a meeting on the topic of “Addressing Accessibility Challenges in Developing Countries”. Merck also organized a reception
with Stefan Oschmann, the then prime minister of Madagascar Roger Kolo, and Dr. Hiroki Nakatani, Assistant Director-General Neglected
Tropical Diseases of WHO.
• In April 2014, Stefan Oschmann attended a meeting with other pharmaceutical industry heads to celebrate the second anniversary of the
London Declaration as well as to further discuss and accelerate the industry’s commitment to fight neglected tropical diseases (NTDs).
• In September 2013, Merck participated in the EFPIA Global Health Initiative Debate at the EU Parliament on "Access to Medicines: Supply
Chain & Delivery Systems - The Last Mile Challenge".
• In August 2013, Merck participated in the “Global Post-2015 Development Agenda: Challenges and Opportunities for the German
Business”, organized by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development in cooperation with the German Global
Compact Network.
• During the 66th World Health Assembly held in Geneva, Switzerland in May 2013, Karl-Ludwig Kley, Chairman of the Executive Board, met
with Muhammad Ali Pate, at that time the Nigerian Minister of Health, and Dr. Hiroki Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General, to discuss
the next steps in the fight against schistosomiasis.

Discussions at the local level
We also participated in numerous discussions in 2013 and 2014 at the local level as well. Below are several examples:
• In September 2014, Merck participated in the European Head and Neck Cancer Awareness Week in Russia as part of the Make Sense
Campaign. This is an international effort led by the European Head and Neck Society to raise awareness on head and neck cancer symptoms
among the general population and healthcare workers. As part of an information campaign, various media were used, including TV,
internet, social media, radio, and printed material. In 2014, the campaign covered 32 clinics in 17 cities, and over 6,000 patients were
examined. 609 patients were diagnosed with cancer or a pre-cancer state.
• In December 2013, Merck North & West Africa organized a symposium during the first African Pharmacovigilance Congress, held in Rabat,
Morocco. The symposium was entitled "La Pharmacovigilance, un enjeu africain" and focused on European pharmacovigilance guidelines.
• In August 2013, Merck Serono India co-organized a round table on "Access to Rural Health" in collaboration with the Rural Marketing
Association in India and the Organization of Pharmaceutical Producers of India.
• In Venezuela, Merck, a member of the over-the-counter chamber there, regularly engages with the national government as part of its
efforts to ensure the country’s supply of life-saving medicines.

Medicines to combat neglected diseases
The most effective way to achieve progress and develop
new approaches to fighting neglected diseases, is to work
through robust public-private partnerships, innovative
alliances and interdisciplinary approaches to health and
development.
In January 2014, Merck Serono launched the Global
Health Innovation Platform to address unmet medical
needs for neglected diseases in children from developing
countries. Under its One Merck for Children social
business concept, the Global Health Innovation Platform
has the goal of developing innovative, affordable, and
integrated health solutions leveraging from Merck’s
cross-business competencies. This R&D platform is based
on public-private partnerships (PPP) and collaborations
with leading Global Health institutions and organizations
in both developed and developing countries. The R&D
activities for the Global Health Innovation Platform focus
on schistosomiasis and related helminth diseases, as well
as malaria. The Global Health Innovation Platform
operating model functions through a series of
partnerships and collaborations. Our partners include
Medicines for Malaria Venture (and its extended network
across the globe), the Swiss Tropical and Public Health
Institute, the African Institute of Biomedical Science &
Technology (AiBST) in Zimbabwe, the Liverpool School of
Tropical Medicine, the London Center for NTD Research,
and Saint George’s University in the United Kingdom. We
have furthermore signed a Memorandum of
Understanding with both the Kenya Medical Research
Institute (KEMRI) as well as the University of Makerere in
Uganda. We are also a leading partner of the Pediatric
Praziquantel Consortium.
Through the Global Health Innovation Platform, Merck
Serono promotes and sponsors educational programs.
Some examples of this include grants for post-doctoral
fellowships at the AiBST in Zimbabwe and grants for
healthcare worker disease awareness at the University of
Namibia. Through these efforts, we are striving to help
build capacities in endemic countries. Additionally, Merck
Serono participates in international fellowship programs
that host post-docs from developing countries. The postdocs are trained on clinical operations practices and
clinical trial execution across all Phases (I-IV). More

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

specifically, the fellowship places successful candidates
with leading product development organizations,
including pharmaceutical companies and product
development partnerships, for a period of up to 24
months. On returning to their academic institutes, the
fellows are expected to become an important resource
for institutional capacity development and to undertake
as well as manage clinical research in accordance with
international regulatory requirements and standards.
Through this Innovation Platform, Merck is currently
focusing on two priority issues in its research and
development (R&D) activities: the pediatric praziquantel
formulation for the treatment of pre-school age children
suffering from schistosomiasis, and an anti-malaria drug.
Initiatives are ongoing to assess new opportunities for
additional projects to build up our portfolio in both areas.
In addition, interdisciplinary approaches in health and
development are being fostered through internal R&D
cross-business collaboration, such as the diagnostics
being co-developed by Merck Serono and Merck Millipore.
They are currently exploring the development of a malaria
diagnostic kit from the existing Muse, a diagnostic point
of care (IVC) used for the detection of HIV/AIDS. This
initiative aims to allow co-diagnosis of HIV and malaria in
countries where the co-infection rate is high.

Praziquantel pediatric formulation
Since July 2012, the Pediatric Praziquantel (PZQ)
Consortium, an international, non-profit public-private
partnership, has been operating with the aim to develop,
register, manufacture and launch a pediatric formulation
of praziquantel, the gold standard treatment for
schistosomiasis. To date, the oral praziquantel tablets have
only been available for adults and children over the age
of 6. However, the high-risk age group of pre-school age
children (from 3 months to 6 years old) accounts for
about 10% of the estimated 249 million people already
infected with schistosomiasis worldwide. The pediatric
formulation will bridge the current treatment gap.
Initiated and led by Merck, consortium partners include:
Astellas Pharma GmbH (Japan), the Dutch pharmaceutical
research enabler TI Pharma, the Swiss Tropical and Public
Health Institute, Farmanguinhos (Brazil) and Simcyp (UK).

PRODUCTS | Access to health

63

Significant progress has been achieved within the
Pediatric PZQ formulation program: upon successful
completion of the pre-clinical phase, a clinical
development strategy was defined, and the first Phase I
clinical trial in healthy volunteers was completed in South
Africa. Work is ongoing to implement the second Phase I
trial in South Africa as well as a taste study in Tanzania,
and to plan for a clinical Phase II/III trial in African
countries. In 2014, the Merck Bioethics Advisory Panel
(MBAP) discussed how to specifically guarantee that the
children's parents and guardians be informed of the risks
of trial participation in an ethically responsible manner
and give their consent. In particular, the MBAP expert
discussion provided guidance to shape the clinical
development plan with regard to aspects such as ancillary
care, and drew attention to key aspects such as
reimbursement.

Anti-malaria drug
Malaria remains a long-standing public health problem
and has a major impact on vulnerable populations in over
100 countries: more than 3 billion people are at risk of
infection and more than 200 million cases are recorded
per year. An estimated 627,000 deaths are caused by
malaria every year, primarily in African children under 5
years of age. Thus, despite an existing product portfolio
and pipeline, there is an urgent need for new products
to overcome the problem of increasing resistance and to
achieve the overall goal of eradicating the disease.
In 2014, Merck Serono and Medicine for Malaria Venture
(MMV), an internationally recognized, Swiss-based notfor-profit organization, renewed the contract of their
partnership on the anti-malarial long-acting compound
program, which was originally signed in April 2013. The
partnership allows them to reach out to a large key expert
network including the Tres Cantos Open Lab Foundation
in Spain, Monash University in Australia, and the Imperial
College of London. Merck and the MMV aim to develop
urgently needed anti-malarial compounds through their
lead optimization program, which comprises chemical
series that have shown significant anti-malarial potential.
The main component of this collaboration between Merck
and MMV is a new chemical series that entered the
exploratory development phase in 2014. Under Merck

Serono’s leadership, this alliance is aiming to have at least
one pre-candidate drug move into the non-clinical phase
by the end of 2015.

Stakeholder dialogue
Over the last two years, we have been participating in
a series of conferences focused on schistosomiasis and
malaria. These conferences have fostered the dialogue
and interactions with key stakeholders and scientific
experts in these two fields, from both public as well as
private sectors. In particular:
• The 13th International Symposium on Schistosomiasis
(Belo Horizonte, Brazil, 2012) opened an important
dialogue with governmental representatives; it led to
one new partner (Farmanguinhos, the federal
governmental pharmaceutical laboratory of the
Fiocruz Foundation in Brazil) joining the Pediatric
Praziquantel program, thereby bringing its unique
expertise for the production and distribution of the
new pediatric formulation in endemic countries;
• The 11th Malaria Meeting at the end of 2013 (Aachen,
Germany), which fostered a new dialogue and
partnership with Saint George’s University (UK);
• The 7th EDCTP (European and Developing Countries
Clinical Trials Partnership) Forum in mid-2014 (Berlin,
Germany);
• The Harvard University Symposium on Malaria and
Tuberculosis at the end of 2014 in Boston, MA (USA),
during which Merck Serono presented their
innovative business model and fostered a number of
future collaboration opportunities.

Pricing
Merck’s pharmaceutical pricing approach helps to ensure
a sustainable supply of products for future generations
of patients. This allows us to recover the costs we incur,
including, among others, costs from research,
development, manufacturing, regulation and distribution.
We can furthermore continue investing in the discovery
and development of new medicines.

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

PRODUCTS | Access to health

The affordability of our health solutions is part of our
wider patient value proposition, which includes
accessibility, availability and awareness. We are aware of
the importance of affordable access to medicines in
developing countries. As a result, we commit to pricing
our products responsibly and to engaging in innovative
equitable pricing schemes in partnership with
governments and other key stakeholders.
We recognize that individual countries have varying
abilities to pay for our health solutions. We conduct yearly
reviews of our pricing strategies to identify ways to
expand access to health by aligning prices with
affordability. We are committed to implementing intercountry equitable pricing schemes. Via low-priced
tenders, we offer intra-country differential prices to
health ministries and to social health insurance systems.
These institutions play a critical role in financing the
healthcare of patients who would not otherwise be able
to afford treatment.
There are three ways in which Merck makes its products
affordable to different patient segments within individual
countries:
1. Participation in government tenders for products
used in public hospitals serving low-income
patients.
• Merck supplies products to governments at
reduced rates in Africa, Latin America, the
Middle East and Southeast Asia.
2. Establishing second "low-price" brands of existing
brands to address patients with out-of-pocket
expenses:
• In South Africa, Concor and Ziak
(antihypertensive agents) second brands are
available at discounted prices.
3. Patient Access Programs (PAPs) that can offer
products at reduced costs:
• Through the Erbitux® China Patients Aid
Program (ECPAP), the Beijing Red Cross
Foundation and Merck Serono in China are
working collaboratively to help expand access
to Erbitux® for metastatic colorectal cancer. This
program, launched in 2011, aims to identify

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

64

patients who cannot afford the treatment but
who could benefit from Erbitux®. Merck Serono
set up registration centers at around 100
selected hospitals in 60 cities, through which
patients can apply. So far, more than 3,100
patients have benefited from this program.
We also have PAPs in other countries such as the
Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand, where we offer
Erbitux® for colorectal cancer at reduced prices to patients
who do not have health insurance and who would
otherwise have to pay the full price for this treatment.

Local manufacturing, distribution and supply
chain
To address the varying abilities of countries to pay for our
health solutions, we implement innovative mechanisms,
such as supporting local manufacturing in these
countries. Merck produces a range of essential medicines
for patients with diabetes, heart disease and low
respiratory conditions in its own manufacturing plants
located in developing countries, such as Pakistan. Local
manufacturing allows us to supply affordable medicines
to local markets and neighboring countries (in this case
Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Myanmar) at considerably
lower prices than in Europe.
Of the approximately 350 medicines on the WHO Essential
Medicines List, Merck provides 65 medicines to developing
countries. These medicines are currently distributed in 74
developing countries, including 35 countries in Africa, 18
in Asia and 12 in Latin America. Our products are available
in nearly two thirds of Least developed countries (LDCs),
including nations such as Afghanistan, Benin, Burkina
Faso, Ethiopia, Haiti, Mali, Myanmar, Nepal, Senegal, and
Sudan.
Safe and secure supply chains help ensure patient access
to quality health solutions. In delivering our health
solutions to patients, our policies and procedures help
ensure that appropriate quantities of our products are
delivered in the right condition, at the right place and
on time. We improve efficiencies and speed up product
delivery by bringing all actors together as well as by
integrating the steps along the supply chain.

PRODUCTS | Access to health

We are dedicated to maintaining quality and safety at
every step of production and delivery. We do this by
following internal quality management guidelines,
complying fully with global Good Manufacturing
Practices (GMP) and Good Distribution Practices (GDP)
and working with associations and partners. For instance,
we are a part of Rx-360, a consortium responsible for
protecting patients’ safety by sharing information and
developing an end-to-end safe supply chain. We use a
variety of approaches to ensure the authenticity of the
products manufactured and sold under the Merck brand.
As supply chain barriers cannot be solved by one actor
alone, we are an active partner of the Neglected Tropical
Diseases Supply Chain Forum. We have also launched a
multi-stakeholder dialogue on accessibility challenges to
discuss how we can partner to strengthen developing
country supply chains.
In order to strengthen local supply chains we support
various initiatives that were recognized in the 2014 ATM
Index as best practices:
• Merck is developing a platform to ensure local quality
manufacturing standards known as the Virtual Plant
Team. This will provide support, expertise and training
to local managers in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
• Through Merck’s Temptation Project, Merck uses heat
and humidity sensors to monitor the transportation
conditions of all its products shipped from Europe to
the rest of the world. We use the data collected in
a centralized system to ensure product quality and
improve transport centers.
We are also seeking ways to address the forward
integration of supply chains through a software tool that
can improve stock management, which has been tested
in Sudan and Ethiopia. This tool has been integrated with
Merck’s order management system and improves price
transparency while reducing lead time and
miscommunication.
In May 2014, IMS Health, a global information and
technology services company, issued a report entitled
“Supply Chain Optimization in Africa’s Private Sector:
Reducing the Price to Patient”. In this report, Merck was
recognized as a best practice company for our efforts to

make six prescription and OTC products in Kenya more
affordable for patients at the point of delivery. Thanks to
innovations in our distribution strategy, we lowered prices
by as much as 44%-55%, which was made possible by
streamlining our processes in Kenya. For instance, we are
now using fewer middle men in-country to distribute our
products. This demonstrates how lower prices can be an
indirect outcome of more efficient distribution systems.

Intellectual property
Intellectual property protection is important for Merck to
make investments in research and development needed
to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of our existing health
solutions and to create new therapies for future
generations. We recognize that responsible handling of
intellectual property is essential for improving access to
health in developing countries, where governments and
patients face significant resource constraints and access
barriers.
In 2014, Merck joined WIPO Re:Search, an open
innovation platform sponsored by the World Intellectual
Property Organization. With over 90 members worldwide,
the platform accelerates early discovery for infectious
diseases through intellectual property and knowledge
sharing.
Merck has adopted a policy of not filing or enforcing
patent applications in the vast majority of developing
countries. In markets where we file patent applications,
we are committed to enhancing data sharing with
researchers and improving public access to clinical trial
information. The patent status of our products is made
publically available.
Merck supports voluntary licensing agreements of all
kinds, including non-exclusive voluntary licenses and
legally binding non-assert declarations or clauses that are
focused on improving access. We focus these agreements
on medicines to treat non-communicable diseases such
as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, and chronic
pulmonary diseases, which represent a growing health
burden in developing countries. Merck welcomes requests
for such licenses from manufacturers that can meet our

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

quality and performance standards. When we grant a
license, we commit to supporting technology transfer that
ensures the manufacture of high-quality products.

immune system and act as markers for T cell lymphocytes.
Patients with a low count of these cells in their blood are
at increased risk of opportunistic infections.

Merck supports the World Trade Organization’s (WTO)
standards for intellectual property rights, including the
WTO’s Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual
Property Rights (TRIPS) and subsequent amendments
such as the Special Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement
and Public Health at the Doha Ministerial Conference in
November 2001 (Doha Declaration). The Doha Declaration
exempted Least developed countries (LDCs) from
complying with TRIPS provisions until January 1, 2016.
We support this exemption of LDCs and an extension of
the exemption beyond 2016.

Merck Millipore is currently developing the Muse Auto
CD4/CD4% system, another diagnostic kit for monitoring
T cells. The Muse Auto CD4/CD4% system will replace
our Guava Auto CD4/CD4% system. Overall, 600 Guava
instruments have been sold and around three million
patients have been tested and informed of their status.
In addition to addressing the needs of adults, the Muse
system will also monitor T cells in children and offer a
more competitive instrument at a modest price that is
intended for use in developing countries. In the
development phase of the new Muse system, Merck
Millipore partnered with the University of California and
in February and April 2014, clinical trials were carried
out at the University of Yaounde in Cameroon. A second
research study started in November 2014. A final clinical
trial is planned for 2015.

Patents ensure temporary exclusive rights for marketing
an innovative product. However, we respect the right of
developing countries to enact compulsory patent
licensing in specific situations, as embodied in TRIPS
Article 31 and as modified by the Doha Declaration.
However, we believe that in some cases, approaches other
than compulsory licensing may be more appropriate and
would avoid undermining innovation in the
pharmaceutical industry. For example, differential pricing
and voluntary licensing can achieve improved health
outcomes in developing countries.
We also promote responsible regulatory data protection
policies. Such policies encourage innovator companies to
conduct clinical trials and to invest in additional research
and development.
We support the concept of patent pools. However, we
believe patent pools should be structured to improve
access to medicines and should therefore avoid anticompetitive effects and geographic limitations. We
consider joining patent pools if they are relevant to our
portfolio and if they meet efficacy, quality and safety
requirements.

HIV diagnostics
More than 35 million people are infected with HIV
worldwide. However, in 2014 UNAIDS reported that only
19 million of them are aware of their status. In the course
of an HIV infection, CD4 cells indicate the state of the

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

Merck is committed to making health workers aware of
the new Muse Auto CD4/CD4% system as well. For many
years, Merck has been participating in meetings held by
the International AIDS Society, the Global Fund to fight
AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM), the World Health
Organization (WHO), UNICEF, the African Society of
Laboratory Medicine, and the American Association for
Clinical Chemistry. Merck has also developed strong
working relationships with NGOs including the Clinton
Health Access Initiative, Catholic Relief Services, and the
Elisabeth Glazier Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF),
among others. In addition, Merck Millipore works directly
with government organizations including PEPFAR/SCMS
as well as numerous health ministries.

Philanthropy and product donations
Product donations and philanthropic activities are not
stand-alone initiatives. To us, they are part of a broader
approach. We support awareness and education
programs as well as capacity and infrastructure building
in developing countries.

67

Medicine donations by Merck
In general, we conduct our medicine donation activities
within developing healthcare systems and prioritize them
based on expressed need and expected impact. Medicines
may also be donated in response to emergencies or
specific one-time requests. In 2013 for example, in
Colombia, Merck supported a medical and surgical brigade
that brought medical care to a population in extreme
poverty, in which 812 people benefited from the threeday-project. The Merck Praziquantel Donation Program is
Merck's largest philanthropic initiative.
All medicine donations by Merck are in alignment with the
WHO Guidelines for Medicine Donations, our company’s
Policy and Procedure for Approval and Notifications of
Donations and Support, as well as our Code of Conduct
and relevant local regulations. The position paper on
pharmaceutical product donations in the Merck Charter
on Access to Health in Developing countries provides
further information on Merck product donations.

Improving health infrastructure and awareness
We support several projects to educate healthcare
providers and patients on disease prevention. As part of
the Merck Praziquantel Donation Program, educational
material is produced and distributed in order to further
promote the prevention of schistosomiasis. In the
Jharkhand region in northeastern India for example, we
are working to improve the education as well as health
care available in the areas where mica, a raw material for
our pigments, is mined. The Suswastha project in India
aims to directly reach underserved rural patients and

PRODUCTS | Access to health

provide them with access to health solutions that meet
their needs. In India, we also support the River Ambulance
that helps expand access to health services and solutions
to underserved local populations along the Narmada
River. In Ghana, Merck supports the Ghana WASH project
to improve water, sanitation facilities and hygiene (WASH)
among children, and will be providing training on water
quality testing in the future. Furthermore, Merck has
created the "rural pharmacy" – an innovative pharmacy
specifically designed for rural parts of Africa that is being
piloted in Ghana.
In addition to these projects, since mid-2014 we have
also been partnering with the German Association for
International Cooperation (GIZ), the Kilimanjaro School of
Pharmacy (founded by the Evangelical Lutheran Church
in Tanzania), Boehringer Ingelheim, and Bayer Health Care
to support the expansion of four education centers in
Tanzania for pharmaceutical assistants. The three-year
project aims to improve access to high-quality medicines
in rural Tanzania as well as to offer people better health
consultation options.

Helping people help themselves
According to estimates, around 382 million people suffer
from diabetes across the globe, with low- and middleincome countries accounting for a particularly large
percentage of patients. Very few of these patients have
adequate access to insulin, syringes, and the medical
equipment needed to monitor their blood pressure. Merck
is therefore committed to improving access to quality
diabetes treatment.

Capacity Advancement Program (CAP)
Merck is committed to improving the accessibility and quality of diabetes treatment. The Merck Capacity Advancement Program (CAP) is a fiveyear program that aims to expand professional capacity in Africa and Asia in the areas of R&D, clinical research, supply-chain integrity and
efficiency, pharmacovigilance, medical education, and community awareness, with special focus on diabetes and non-communicable diseases.
The program was established in 2012 and has been implemented across Africa, India and Indonesia in collaboration with ministries of health,
health science universities and local patients’ diabetes associations. The goal is to raise awareness of diabetes by educating the current and
future healthcare providers as well as supporting the healthcare system with ways to prevent, diagnose and manage diabetes effectively.
To spread awareness of the Merck Capacity Advancement Program, we have conducted more than 250 events across Kenya, Uganda, Mauritius,
Namibia, Mozambique, Ghana, India, Indonesia, and Germany. Furthermore, the "Get informed Get Active Get Healthier" campaign has reached
more than 25,000 people in Kenya, Ghana, Uganda and India, providing patients with free screening and medical check-ups. Additionally, more
than 100,000 patient leaflets about diabetes have been distributed in camps and in the largest supermarket chains in Kenya and Uganda for
better coverage and reach to community members.
As part of CAP, in 2014 around 2,000 medical and pharmacy students from health sciences universities in Africa furthermore participated in
clinical diabetes management training. This medical education program was developed by EXCEMED, an independent organization providing
medical education programs in partnership with the Oxford Centre of Diabetes, Churchill Hospital, Oxford, UK, and was accredited by the
European Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education. In 2015, Merck will provide the same course to medical and pharmacy
students at the University of Indonesia and to medical undergraduates in 18 medical colleges of the Maharashtra University in India. CAP aims
to reach 15,000 medical and pharmacy undergraduates in Africa and Asia by 2018.

Bioethics and biotechnology
Bioethics
Bioethics is concerned with fundamental questions that
arise from how humans treat other creatures, both
human and animal. These issues are the subject of often
heated debate, not least because people's ethical positions
are the reflection of their differing cultural, social, and
religious backgrounds.
For Merck, bioethical issues arise in many areas; these
include the use of stem cells, the use of genetically
modified microorganisms, the research and application of
infertility drugs, and the wide array of clinical research
that we conduct. Beyond compliance with regulations
and laws, we have a strong commitment to conducting
research in an ethical manner, to ensure patients’
wellbeing and to evaluate different positions on
controversial topics (e.g. stem cell research) in order to
make informed decisions.

Merck Bioethics Advisory Panel
Bioethical issues are debated in a diverse social
environment. Many of these questions are perceived very
differently from country to country, and how people view
them is furthermore subject to changes in society. As

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

a global company, Merck must address developments
concerning bioethical issues at an international level; we
must identify the changes and incorporate them into our
position on bioethics. To this end, we have established the
Merck Bioethics Advisory Panel (MBAP), which convenes
at least once a year to advise Merck. It is headed by
our Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and consists of globally
renowned bioethics experts from a range of pertinent
disciplines such as law, theology and medical ethics. The
MBAP provides clear recommendations on the issues
discussed, which we then integrate into our guidelines
and internalize in our conduct. In order to educate our
employees on bioethical considerations, we publish highlevel summaries from the MBAP meetings on Merck’s
intranet.
In 2013, the MBAP met to discuss clinical trial data
transparency and principles on data sharing. At the end
of 2013, Merck introduced its policy on clinical trial data
sharing and published a summary of our responsible data
sharing principles on our data request website. They are
in line with the respective principles of the European
Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations
(EFPIA), as well as the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).

Other discussion topics included biobanking and genetic
testing, as well as pharmacogenomics and targeted
therapies in pharmaceutical development. A biobank is a
repository that stores tissue samples, along with coded
patient data and sample data. Biobanks have great
potential for future research in areas such as oncology.
They require, however, adherence to high ethical
standards both in terms of collecting specimens and
genetic data, as well as how the databases are operated.
These aspects are described in the Informed Consent form,
a document in which study participants must confirm
that they have been informed, that they understand, and
that they authorize the use of their specimens. This
includes consent to anonymize samples, store them and
eventually destroy them. The MBAP emphasized that
biobanking can only be considered viable if the intended
uses of the biobank are made transparently clear, and
if bioethical standards are conscientiously applied. With
regard to pharmacogenomics and targeted therapies,
Merck is taking various approaches into consideration,
including the use of tumor characteristics such as certain
mutations. These approaches are important for the design
of future clinical trials.
In 2014, the MBAP discussed several topics, including
post-clinical trial access to study drugs and issues arising
from the development of praziquantel for small children,
as well as the opportunities and bioethical implications of
biosimilars.
Access to study drugs post trial is a commitment laid
out in several ethical guidance documents, such as the
Declaration of Helsinki. These state that if a study drug
has shown itself to be beneficial, safe and in line with
local requirements, it should continue to be available to
trial participants after the clinical trial, which is what the
MBAP has recommended. If the drug is commercially
available, the patient will be switched to the marketed
drug. If the drug is not yet approved, a single/named
patient, compassionate use or early access program may
be considered in order to continue treatment.
Within the scope of the Merck Praziquantel Donation
Program, we are researching a formulation of
praziquantel for small children. This project requires
clinical trials involving children in low-resource areas such
as Africa. The children's parents and guardians must be

informed of the risks of trial participation in an ethically
responsible manner and then be asked to give their
consent. The MBAP discussed the proposal for Phase I
testing of the pediatric praziquantel formulation and
concluded that the overall aim of the pediatric
praziquantel clinical development program is ethically
appropriate.
In addition to this, the MBAP discussed ethical
considerations regarding biosimilars. To promote
worldwide access to high-quality biologics, Merck
established a biosimilars unit in 2012. We strongly
advocate that the same standards of high quality, safety,
efficacy, and scientific need be consistently applied to
all medicines and across all geographies, regardless of
whether the drug in question is patented or a biosimilar.

Clinical trials
We aim to alleviate human suffering by researching and
developing innovative medicines. To achieve this, we
adhere to all relevant statutory and regulatory
requirements, as well as industry standards. For clinical
studies, these standards include the Declaration of
Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines
of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH).
More details can be found under Clinical Trials on p. 70.

Stem cell research
When clear statutory and regulatory requirements are
lacking, Merck collaborates closely with experts to develop
appropriate guidelines. The requirements described in the
"Stem Cells and Human Cloning Principle" enable Merck
to conduct stem cell research within a strictly defined
legal framework. They prevent us from violating
applicable laws and regulations while enabling us to work
within the framework of established ethical principles. Our
Stem Cell Research Oversight Committee reviews internal
stem cell research proposals and commercial strategies
for compliance with our ethical and legal guidelines.
Merck is not involved in clinical programs utilizing stem
cells or human cloning for therapeutic purposes and does
not pursue such approaches.

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

PRODUCTS | Clinical trials

Infertility treatment research
In developing treatments for infertility, Merck avoids all
invasive types of prenatal diagnostics. Within the
framework of our "Fertility Research Policy", however, we
are focusing on improving the success rate for in vitro
fertilization.
Our Embryo Viability Assessment Test (Eeva) is designed to
improve in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes by providing
clinicians and embryologists with objective information
that will enable them to predict embryo viability with
a new level of accuracy. Eeva uses intelligent computer
vision software to measure key scientifically and clinically
validated cell division parameters from video image.

Biotechnology and genetic engineering
Merck utilizes genetically modified organisms in research
and development and has been manufacturing biotech
products that are produced using genetically modified
organisms (GMOs) since the 1980s. Without this
technology, the major medical advances of the last several
years would not have been possible.
Merck's major research centers for medical biotechnology
are located in Darmstadt (Germany), Boston (United
States), Beijing (China), and Tokyo (Japan). Important
production sites for this are Aubonne and Corsier-surVevey in Switzerland.
The biotech facility in Corsier-sur-Vevey remains one of
the largest biotech production facilities in Europe. Merck
is a leader in this field. We produce our highly valuable
biotech products utilizing the highest standards. All
biotechnological activities at Merck are subject to strict
legal regulations worldwide; compliance with these
regulations is monitored by biological safety officers.
Merck continually tracks regulatory changes pertaining
to biotech products and adapts its processes accordingly,
thus ensuring compliance with all statutory requirements.

Clinical trials
In our quest to thoroughly understand our
pharmaceutical products throughout their entire life
cycle, we ensure that patient needs are foremost at all
times. We conduct top-quality clinical research in

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

70

compliance with the applicable laws and regulations.
When conducting multinational, multi-site trials in both
the industrialized as well as developing countries, we
follow the highest legal, ethical and scientific standards.
Merck only conducts clinical trials if a sound, established
scientific methodology is available to investigate a
scientific or medical question of relevance to patients,
medical professionals and society as a whole. We only
enroll the number of participants required to answer the
scientific questions being investigated.
The "Merck Pharma Compliance Policy Clinical Research",
released in October 2013, serves as a basis for the conduct
of clinical trials.

Adhering to the highest standards
In all its research and development activities, Merck
adheres to the most stringent international legal, ethical,
scientific and quality standards. These include:
• The Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines of the
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH)
• The Declaration of Helsinki from the World Medical
Association
• The Belmont Report
• Good Pharmacovigilance/Laboratory/Manufacturing/
Distribution Practice (GVP/GLP/GMP/GDP)
• The "International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical
Research Involving Human Subjects” of the Council
for International Organizations of Medical Sciences
(CIOMS)
• The “Joint Position on the Disclosure of Clinical Trial
Information via Clinical Trial Registries and Databases”
and the “Joint Position on the Publication of Clinical
Trial Results in the Scientific Literature”, both issued
by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA), the European
Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and
Associations (EFPIA), the Japanese Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Association (JPMA), and the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America (PhRMA)
• The EFPIA & PhRMA “Principles for Responsible
Clinical Trial Data Sharing”

PRODUCTS | Clinical trials

71

To provide a broad, in-depth basis for the development of
new medicines, Merck frequently works in collaboration
with external partners in academia and industry, as well as
with medical-scientific advisory boards, service providers
and vendors. We expect and verify that all our partners
– especially contract research organizations (CROs),
licensing partners and suppliers – abide by the same set of
high standards when conducting clinical trials.
In 2013, Merck Serono entered into a partnership with a
CRO for the exclusive conduct of all Merck Serono’s global
trials, known as the Merck Serono-Quintiles Strategic
Partnership. Within this partnership, the Articles of
Association as well as a comprehensive manual clearly
define our expectations and escalation paths. Our aim
is to promote the highest quality and compliance when
conducting clinical trials. Merck Serono retains ultimate
accountability for any issues that pertain to the quality or
procedural compliance of the trials.
In 2014, we entered into a strategic alliance with Pfizer on
the joint clinical development of an anti-PD-L1 antibody,
which is currently being developed by Merck as a potential
treatment for multiple tumor types. Up to 20 high-priority
immuno-oncology clinical development programs are
expected to commence in 2015, including pivotal
registration studies. In this alliance, just as in all of our
partnerships, we adhere to our high standards for the
conduct of clinical trials.

Responsible clinical trial data sharing
Information sharing related to company-sponsored
clinical trials is central to Merck’s mission and enables the
medical and scientific community to further develop their
medical and scientific knowledge base. We are committed
to enhancing public health by responsibly sharing clinical
trial data in a manner that is consistent with: (a)
safeguarding the privacy of patients, (b) respecting the
integrity of national regulatory systems, and (c)
maintaining incentives for investment in biomedical
research.
We are increasing our commitment to responsible clinical
trials data sharing in alignment with the European
Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations
and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America. Since 2014, Merck has been fulfilling its EFPIA

and PhRMA commitment to share study protocols,
anonymized patient-level data, study-level data, and
redacted clinical study reports from clinical trials with
qualified scientific and medical researchers; this applies
to all Merck drugs approved in the EU and United States
from January 1, 2014 onwards.

Publication of clinical trials
Merck is committed to the transparency of clinical trial
information and to publicly communicating clinical trial
results in an accurate, objective and complete manner.
Merck furthermore ensures that publications arising out
of its clinical trials are produced in a responsible, ethical
fashion in accordance with applicable laws and industry
codes, and published in a timely manner.
We publish clinical trial information and results in the
Global Clinical Trials registry and results database run by
the U.S. National Institutes of Health, which can also be
accessed via the World Health Organization Clinical Trials
Registry Platform. Since 2014, we have also been
registering clinical trials and publishing results in the
EudraCT (European Union Drug Regulating Authorities
Clinical Trials) database in accordance with EU
regulations.

Clinical trial governance
The Head of Global Research and Development, supported
by the corresponding operating committees, has overall
responsibility for product development and the related
governance process.
Merck has two dedicated clinical trial governance
committees, those being the Integrated Clinical Study
Committee responsible for development studies and the
Global Medical Affairs Decision Board responsible for
studies with marketed products. Chairs and members of
both committees are senior medical/scientific experts and
executives with long-standing experience in clinical
research. Each meet on a regular basis to conduct a
comprehensive review of the proposed clinical trial
designs in order to verify that our trials are scientifically
sound, have a legitimate scientific purpose and are
undertaken according to the latest standards and best
practices.

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

PRODUCTS | Clinical trials

Furthermore, independent quality assurance audits are
conducted regularly, thus ensuring that our
investigational sites and contract research organizations
(CROs) continuously adhere to Good Clinical Practice
(GCP) standards. In 2013 and 2014, there were no findings
giving rise to concerns that trials were not being
conducted in line with ICH-GCP standards and the
Declaration of Helsinki.
Our Medical Safety and Ethics Board (MSEB) investigates
safety issues and benefit-risk profiles of our marketed and
investigational products in order to ensure their safe and
appropriate use by patients. The MSEB is chaired by the
Chief Medical Officer and consists of senior physicians
and scientists with long-standing experience in drug
safety and clinical research.

Conducting clinical trials responsibly
Protecting the rights, safety, dignity and wellbeing of
volunteers and patients participating in our clinical trials
is of utmost importance to us. Individuals enrolled in our
clinical trials will not be intentionally exposed to undue
risk or irreversible harm. Privacy of all personal
information is respected and confidentiality is ensured in
compliance with statutory regulations.
Prior to enrolling participants in an interventional clinical
trial, a qualified independent ethics committee/
institutional review board (EC/IRB) must review and
approve each and every trial. All local regulatory or
governmental authorizations required in the respective
country must furthermore be obtained. In accordance
with Good Clinical Practice guidelines (ICH-GCP), every
participant must give their informed consent before
enrollment in a clinical trial. Participants are fully
informed about all aspects of the clinical trial in a
language that they understand; this includes the potential
risks and benefits from participating in the trial. They
also are given ample time and opportunity to inquire
about details of the trial before deciding whether or not to
participate. All questions posed by potential participants
are answered by the clinical investigator or another
qualified health care professional familiar with the study.
Once a trial has started, precisely defined procedures are
followed to ensure that the study is conducted to the
utmost standards in accordance with Good Clinical

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

72

Practice and that the data are accurately generated,
documented and reported in line with all applicable
requirements. In the 2013-2014 period, we received no
significant complaints regarding this clinical trial
procedure from third parties or regulatory agencies.
We continuously collect and communicate safety data
for our products, promptly providing clinical investigators
with important new findings relevant to the patients. This
aims to ensure the safe use of our pharmaceutical
products. Potential safety issues and risks are taken into
consideration in order to evaluate the benefit/risk of our
products and manage risk. Product information, including
the Investigator’s Brochure and Subject Information, is
updated accordingly.
We engage patient advocacy groups in a discourse on
our clinical trials. For example, EMD Serono, one of our
subsidiaries in the U.S., is the National Sponsor of AWARE
for All, an educational outreach model by the non-profit
Center for Information and Study on Clinical Research
Participation (CISCRP). AWARE for All educates the public
about the importance of clinical research; it is driven by
the premise that awareness, realizing the value of
participation, and ongoing engagement are the keys to
generating public support and attracting more clinical
research volunteers. Ultimately, CISCRP hopes to
empower patients and the public to make more informed
decisions about participating in clinical research. During
the 2013-2014 period, EMD Serono collaborated with the
Lupus Research Institute in a pioneering effort to make
our Lupus Clinical Trials more patient-centric.
We are planning to expand the dialogue with patient
organizations, especially for therapeutic areas in which
we are conducting clinical trials. For instance, we would
like to increase the degree of informed consent and make
clinical trials more patient-friendly in order to ensure that
the trials are designed and conducted around patient
needs.

Clinical trials conducted in developing health
care systems
Regardless of location, all Merck’s clinical trials are
conducted in compliance with international scientific and
ethical standards, in addition to the locally applicable laws
and regulations. We are actively shifting our development

73

PRODUCTS | Animal testing

activities to more diverse markets in order to address the
healthcare needs in various regions and to support the
development of their health care systems.

research to be performed prior to testing the effect of new
drugs in humans, or prior to marketing chemicals on a
large scale.

In performing clinical trials in developing health care
systems, we apply the same principles that apply when
conducting such trials in developed countries. When we
conduct clinical trials in a developing health care system:

Animal research is only permitted if there are no
recognized alternative methods available; otherwise, the
alternative methods must be utilized. Animal research is,
however, still unavoidable in many fields and frequently
cannot be replaced by alternative testing. Because living
systems are extremely complex, the entire living system
of an animal must be observed and tested in order to
explore, explain, or predict the course of diseases or the
effects of possible treatments. All aspects of animal
research are regulated by laws and regulations, which
govern the housing of laboratory animals (such as cage
size, temperature, ventilation and relative humidity), the
conduct and approval of animal tests, and the reliability
and expertise of all involved individuals. Animal testing is
approved and monitored by regulatory authorities.

• We only do so in an environment that can follow
Good Clinical Practice, i.e. where ethics committees
and well-trained clinical investigators are present.
• We only address diseases and test innovative
medicines that are relevant for the local population.
• We conduct clinical trials in countries where there is
a reasonable expectation that the drug tested will be
submitted for marketing authorization and be made
available to patients after proof of efficacy and safety.
• We assure that enrollment into a clinical trial does
not discriminate against participants on the basis of
ethnic origin, gender or socio-economic status.
Within the scope of the Merck Praziquantel Donation
Program (MPDP), Merck is partnering with the World
Health Organization (WHO) to combat the parasitic worm
disease schistosomiasis in African school children.
Praziquantel tablets in their current form are suitable for
adults and children over the age of six. For children
younger than six, it is currently not possible to properly
treat the disease. Within the scope of a public-private
partnership (PPP), Merck is researching a liquid
formulation of praziquantel that is intended to be suitable
for small children. This project makes it necessary to
conduct clinical trials involving children in Africa. Further
details are described under Neglected Diseases on p. 61.

For Merck, animal welfare is not just an important ethical
issue, but also influences the quality of test results. In
order to get reliable, accurate data from our studies, we
need animals that are comfortable and provided the best
living conditions possible. In addition to this, Merck is
committed to applying high, state-of-the-art quality and
animal welfare standards in the housing, care and feeding
of laboratory animals, striving to continuously improve
these conditions. We therefore promote the 3R principles
of animal welfare:
1. Reduction of the required number of animals.

at Merck

Group-wide regulations and organizational
structures

In line with ICH guidelines and the REACH regulation,
research-based chemical and pharmaceutical companies
are statutorily required to perform animal tests when
developing new drugs in order to test the product safety
of biological preparations and chemicals. Animal research
provides crucial information on product efficacy and
safety. Therefore, international laws require animal

Merck keeps animals in its own facilities at various sites
worldwide. At all Merck sites where animals are kept or
animal tests are performed, we have appointed
responsible individuals and groups (such as animal care
and welfare officers, institutional animal care and use
committees) both on a voluntary basis as well as in
response to national requirements. These units assess and

assure the quality of the respective animal husbandry
practices. In 2010, Merck Serono signed the Interpharma
Charter on Animal Welfare. In this charter, pharmaceutical
companies commit to global Animal Welfare principles
and highest possible standards in animal research
worldwide.
Our Corporate Policy "Use, Care and Welfare of Laboratory
Animals" describes our principles for the housing, care
and feeding of laboratory animals, as well as the roles and
responsibilities of the Group function Corporate Animal
Science and Welfare. In this guideline, we commit
ourselves to high quality and to continually improving
the housing, care and feeding of our laboratory animals
and expect the same from contract research organizations
(CRO) as well as our business partners.
In 2014, we created the "Merck Group Manual for the
Group function Animal Science and Welfare". It describes
the requirements for the implementation, maintenance
and improvement of laboratory animal science and
welfare.
Merck’s Animal Science and Welfare unit is headed by the
Corporate Animal Welfare Officer, who creates uniform
animal welfare standards. This Group function initiates
and conducts audits as well as institutes additional
improvements to animal welfare at Merck and its
partners. A global laboratory animal science network,
established in 2013, brings together Merck Animal Science
and Welfare experts. The network supervises the local
animal welfare units and supports specific projects and
processes related to animal science and welfare (e.g. site
accreditation, strategic planning concerning animal
science and welfare).

Audits and site accreditation
In 2013 and 2014, our Animal Science and Welfare
organization performed five audits at Merck’s own
laboratory animal facilities; eight animal science and
welfare audits took place at contract research
organizations and animal breeders.
To demonstrate that we adhere to the highest
international animal welfare standards, it is our goal to
have all our laboratory animal facilities at Merck Serono

accredited by the Association for Assessment and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International
(AAALAC) by the end of 2015. The AAALAC accreditation
factors in national laws and guidelines while also taking
into account the high international quality standards of
the "Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals"
from the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research (ILAR).
Our two laboratory animal facilities in Darmstadt,
Germany were successfully reaccredited in 2013 and
2014. The Grafing site in Germany was accredited at the
beginning of 2015. The U.S. facility in Billerica, MA was
AAALAC-accredited in 2012 and is preparing for
reaccreditation in 2015.

Employee training
In order to ensure that animals are handled, tested,
housed, fed, and cared for according to the latest
standards, all employees working with laboratory animals
at Merck are specially trained and receive continual
advanced training. These training seminars are planned,
scheduled, performed, and documented by Merck animal
welfare managers in accordance with local legislation. The
Group function Animal Science and Welfare supervises
these measures, providing consultation and selected
training as well.
The nature and scope of this training is governed by
national and international legislation as well as local
requirements, and the training is monitored by the
responsible regulatory authorities. In addition to this, our
employees participate in external continuing education
programs, such as the accredited laboratory animal
science courses offered by the Federation of European
Laboratory Animal Science Association, and training
provided by the Society of Laboratory Animals, the
Industrial Laboratory Animal Scientists and the
“Interessengemeinschaft Tierpfleger” (Community of
Animal Caretakers). We also provide online training
programs and classroom courses on animal welfare, the
3R principles and the AAALAC accreditation standard.

Using and developing alternative methods
Whenever practical and legally feasible, Merck uses
alternative testing methods instead of animal research,
including in-vitro tests and computer-based methods. In

represents EFPIA at the AAALAC Board of Trustees and is
the chair of the IQ 3Rs Consortium in 2015.

Over the last several years, Merck researchers have
received multiple awards for developing alternative test
methods:

We actively support the SET Foundation and the 3R
Foundation, both of which are dedicated to finding
alternative and complementary animal testing methods
with the aim of reducing animal testing. Currently, the
Corporate Animal Welfare Officer is the Vice Chair of the
SET board. In addition to these foundations, we are also
collaborating with EFPIA to devise performance indicators
that can be used to evaluate the methods for 3R
improvements developed by companies.

Research-based Pharmaceutical Companies (VFA),
Interpharma, and the IQ 3Rs Consortium, we strive to
obtain regulatory recognition for alternative testing
methods that transcends national boundaries. There is
a serious need for action here because animal research
can only be truly reduced if a new methodology gains
widespread recognition at an international level. Without

Since 2015, Merck has also been a member of the
European Animal Research Association (EARA). The EARA
informs, educates and unifies audiences in support of
research and facilitates an open debate on animal
research.

Animal species
Before a substance is administered to an animal, we
perform a careful species selection process involving
computer simulation and in vitro preliminary scientific
testing, as well as comparison with similar compounds.
Mice and rats constitute more than 96% of the species
used within the Merck Group. Other animal species (in
particular non-rodents like dogs, pigs or non-human
primates) are only used if specified by statutory
regulations or if essential for scientific reasons. For
example, regulatory authorities require pharmaceuticals
in development to be safety tested in both a rodent
species (e.g. rat or mouse) as well as a non-rodent species.
Other guidelines (e.g. REACH) also require testing in nonrodents under certain circumstances. In this way,
potential side effects can be identified with higher
accuracy and included in the risk assessment. In all
experiments, the safety of human beings is our top
priority.

Animal welfare practices of external partners
We procure our lab animals from special animal breeders
and furthermore hire special contract research
organizations to conduct animal research on our behalf.
We also collaborate or partner with industry institutes
and universities. Around 80% of animal research activities
are conducted in-house, around 20% by leading contract
institutes or partners from industry and academia. Our
animal welfare policy stipulates that the same high
standards that apply within Merck also be applied equally
to these external partners.
Merck is developing its own auditing concept and
performs animal science and welfare audits on external
partners on a risk-based approach. In addition, within the

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

scope of our work with Interpharma, Merck was closely
involved in developing an audit concept for contract
research institutes and animal breeders. An Interpharma
audit was conducted on an animal breeder at two
different sites in Germany in 2013. In 2014, Interpharma
performed two more audits on animal breeders in France
and Denmark. Three animal breeder sites and five CROs
were audited by Merck in 2013 and 2014. Generally, all
sites were considered of high quality and well suited to
serve as animal breeders. Only in a few specific instances
did findings suggest some room for improvement. Three
audits on breeder facilities in the Netherlands and the U.S.
are planned for 2015.

New goal

Responsible marketing
Group-wide regulations for pharmaceutical
marketing
Merck's number-one goal for patients is for them to
receive effective, high-quality treatment. Patient-centered
health care requires that the pharmaceutical industry
market its pharmaceuticals transparently and responsibly.
Merck is committed to ensuring that its promotional
practices are responsible and patient-centered, and that
they comply with or even exceed strict ethical standards
and statutory requirements. In October 2013, Merck
adopted a revised version of its “Pharma Code for
Conducting Pharmaceutical Business and Pharmaceutical
Operations”. This Code is compliant with industry
association codes (IFPMA, EFPIA) and sets the standards
within Merck for ethical marketing practices.
In addition, Merck also abides by codes established by
national industry associations as well as guidelines from
major international industry associations, such as the
“Code of Practice” and “Code of Pharmaceutical
Marketing Practices” published by the International

Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers &
Associations (IFPMA). Merck adheres to all provisions
included in these codes, which cover marketing practices
as well as interactions with health care professionals,
medical institutions and patient organizations.
Merck’s marketing and promotion is based on robust
scientific evidence, is consistent with national prescribing
information documentation and complies with all
applicable laws and regulations established at national
levels. Individuals responsible for medicines promotion, as
well as employees working in sales, marketing, medical,
and regulatory positions, are annually trained on Merck
marketing codes. In addition, all of Merck’s employees
also have access to its marketing codes and must receive
annual training on compliance (which includes the
marketing and promotion of pharmaceuticals).
Merck has in place internal processes and compliance
officers to govern its sales and marketing activities at the
global, regional and national level.
Should one of Merck’s marketing/promotional codes be
violated, Merck has a system to take immediate corrective
and, if need be, punitive action. Merck Serono is in full

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

PRODUCTS | Interactions in the health care industry

compliance with local regulations on advertising. This
includes policy requirements such as disclosing the side
effects, contra-indications and effectiveness of the
advertised prescription drug, as well as presenting clear,
accurate and balanced health information to patients and
consumers. Merck only engages in direct-to-consumer
advertising (DTC) in jurisdictions where this is currently
allowed. DTC advertising can increase people’s awareness
of disease and available treatments, enabling consumers
and patients to make informed decisions about their
treatment.
The industry associations with which Merck is associated
have put in place reporting channels for health care
professionals, patients and the general public to report
on any wrongdoing with regard to marketing practices.
For Merck employees, we have implemented the SpeakUp Line to support anonymous reporting of compliance
concerns. We have also set up systems to take immediate
corrective and, if need be, punitive actions.
The Group-wide guideline "Pharmaceutical Operations of
Merck KGaA and Merck Serono S.A. in the United States"
specifically applies to Merck's pharmaceutical activities in
the U.S. market.
Merck is a member of the Association for the Voluntary
Self-Control of the Pharmaceutical Industry (FSA), which
has defined its own rules of conduct for collaboration
between physicians and industry. When violations of the
FSA Code are suspected, members and third parties can
file complaints with an arbitration board.
In 2013 and 2014, Merck had to deal with three
proceedings regarding alleged violations of the FSA Codex
with regard to the disclosure of sponsorship money. All
three proceedings were terminated.
All guidelines pertaining to marketing and advertising are
part of the Group-wide compliance program. They are
regularly adapted to reflect current developments and
apply for all employees who work in the corresponding
fields.
Within the scope of the compliance training plan, all
relevant employees receive online training and participate
in classroom seminars. Participation is monitored, and the

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

78

results of the online training are evaluated. In 2013 and
2014, 12,416 employees participated in seminars on the
Merck “Pharma Policies”, in addition to the regular Code
of Conduct training.

Marketing chemicals
Responsible marketing is likewise important in our
Chemicals business. In order to ensure careful handling,
we supply our chemicals only to commercial customers
who have the proven expertise. In addition, we provide
customers with information on the safe handling and
use of our products. To prevent the misuse of dual-use
products, Merck has established an extensive safety and
security net. Standardized export control guidelines are
monitored by our central Export Control & Customs
Regulations unit, as well as by trade and export control
officers at the local Merck subsidiaries. If we suspect
misuse, we refrain from doing business with that
customer.

Interactions in the health care
industry
We believe that worldwide access to medicinal product
information is one of the keys to improving health care
and treatment for patients. For this reason, we support
scientific research, patient organizations, health care
organizations, health care professionals, and other key
players in the health care industry by donating money
and supplies. We furthermore sponsor activities such as
independent initiatives and medical capacity
advancement programs.
With this type of support, it is important for key players to
remain neutral in order to protect the patients and ensure
them the best treatment. All donations and sponsoring
activities must comply with the internal and external
standards that apply to Merck's marketing operations. To
meet our commitments as members of various
associations, we furthermore transparently report on the
support we provide.

79

Promoting research and education
To support the health care industry, Merck makes
monetary contributions and donates supplies to
professional institutions, organizations and associations.
These include medical science professional associations,
hospitals and university clinics. Our engagement reflects
the Merck Values and makes it easier for research
institutes and related institutions to do their work, which
ultimately serves the common good. Our contributions
are not intended to influence decisions regarding
treatment, prescriptions or purchasing. In compliance
with the code of conduct of the German Association for
the Voluntary Self-Control of the Pharmaceutical Industry
(FSA), Merck publishes its contributions made in
Germany in excess of € 10,000 per recipient per year and
updates the information on an annual basis.
In order to promote advances in the field of medicine,
Merck sponsors research and advanced medical training
across the world. Merck Serono supports outstanding
research projects through its Grants for Innovation
in Fertility, Multiple Sclerosis, Oncology and Growth
Disorders. Through its Global Medical Education unit,
Merck Serono furthermore provides grants to
independent medical education providers, which enables
them to develop and deliver advanced medical training
for scientists, physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other
health care professionals. These service providers must
fulfill certain criteria, including a proven track record of
high-quality medical content and a system to assess
educational outcomes. In addition, our Medical Education
Funding Policy prohibits any third-party medical
education provider or related party from conducting
activities that promote Merck unless an adequate system
to prevent improper influence and ensure separation of
such activities has been instituted.

Collaboration with patient organizations
Patient organizations play an important role in providing
patients, their family members and their caregivers
with support for and information on dealing with
diseases. With these institutions, we share the common
goal of improving quality of life for patients, which is
why we support this important work. Merck explicitly
endeavors to exert no influence or control over the

PRODUCTS | Transport and storage safety

information that the organizations communicate to their
members. For comprehensive transparency, we publish
our donations to European patient organizations on our
website and update the information annually. This enables
us to fulfill a commitment we have made through our
membership in the European Federation of
Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA).

Increasing transparency
The transparency requirements for interactions in and
contributions to the health care industry are growing
increasingly stringent. Global transparency initiatives such
as the Sunshine Laws in the United States and the
initiatives of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical
Industries and Associations (EFPIA) require the disclosure
of collaborations between the pharmaceutical industry
and physicians, medical organizations, and patient
organizations. They are also requiring companies to
disclose individual partnerships, specifically naming the
physicians in question, as well as to disclose the purpose
of the interaction and the amount contributed. We have
adapted the necessary processes, such as our contract
management process, thereby ensuring compliance with
the data protection laws. We will start reporting in 2016.

Transport and storage safety
For the storage and transport of our goods, we adhere to
strict safety guidelines in order to prevent risk to people
and the environment. Environment Health Safety Security
Quality (EQ) (see Environmental Management on p. 106),
the Group function in charge of environmental protection
at Merck, possesses the expertise to ensure warehouse
and transport safety and sets our policies, standards and
procedures. At the individual Merck Group sites
worldwide, the Site Director or Site Manager is responsible
for the implementation of our standards and regulations,
as well as for issues pertaining to warehouse and
transport safety.
The local Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) Manager
supports the Site Director or Site Manager and employees
regarding compliance with all applicable national and
international EHS regulations as well as EHS Group
policies, standards and procedures, providing technical
guidance and advice.

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

PRODUCTS | Transport and storage safety

The local Dangerous Goods Manager is in charge of
advising the Site Director or Site Manager on all aspects
regarding the transport of dangerous goods. Furthermore,
the Dangerous Goods Manager’s tasks include monitoring
of and compliance with legal requirements for the safe
transport of dangerous goods, as well as the related
health and safety procedures. In 2014, the main tasks and
duties of the Dangerous Goods Manager were adapted to
reflect the European regulation for the "Dangerous Goods
Safety Adviser".
To evaluate and further improve our approach to
managing transport and storage safety, we created a
process and developed indicators for warehouses and
transport in 2013. The results of the process have led to
intensified training on cool and mixed storage. We are
working to enhance this monitoring process as well as
develop further key performance indicators for all sites
and third-party warehouses.
Regular training is provided for our warehouse
employees, as well as for those employees involved in
the transport of goods. EHS Managers, Dangerous Goods
Managers and Logistics Managers are regularly trained on
our standards and procedures, changes to international
requirements, and incident management. Our EHS
managers meet regularly at the EHS conference in
Darmstadt, Germany, whose agenda includes bestpractice sharing as well as training on transport and
materials storage. These topics are also covered in the
three-day start-up training seminar that is mandatory for
new EHS managers.
For the recently acquired company AZ Electronic
Materials, we have retained the existing transport and
storage safety systems for the time being, but will be
incrementally migrating them to Merck’s system starting
in 2015.

Storage safety
In order to safely store substances, we have implemented
global safety concepts and standards for all our
warehouses worldwide. The "Warehouse Safety" standard
defines the operational measures needed to prevent
substance leakage, as well as fires and explosions.
According to this standard, risk evaluations must be

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

80

conducted on all stored substances, including finished
chemical and pharmaceutical products, raw materials,
intermediates, waste, packaging material, and technical
materials. In addition to this, the standard lays out
mandatory rules of workplace conduct for all warehouse
employees. All warehouses are audited thoroughly and
regularly to check for compliance with safety
requirements. Merck revisited and revised its current
safety concept during 2013 and 2014.
Our Group-wide standard “Warehouse requirements for
third-party warehouses” defines the structural and
organizational requirements for a facility. Third-party
warehouse providers have to provide a statement on
environment, health and safety before we sign contracts
in order to show that they are in line with Merck’s
warehouse requirements. Third-party warehouses are
regularly assessed by our EHS Managers; in 2013 and
2014, we audited four of these warehouses and developed
corrective action plans to address the findings.

Transport safety
For shipments transported by Merck or on behalf of
Merck, safety is our top priority. We want to ensure that
shipments reach our sites and customers undamaged,
with the correct labeling and documentation. Several
substances that we ship are classified as hazardous
materials. Hazardous goods transport – whether by road,
rail, plane, or ship – is heavily regulated across the globe
by conventions such as the European Agreement
concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous
Goods by Road (ADR). The rules on the transport of
dangerous goods are revised every two years; the changes
are implemented by our local sites worldwide with
support from our EQ Group function experts. In 2014, we
introduced the new Group standard “Transport Safety”.
In this standard, we define the safety levels for our sites
based on the United Nations “Recommendations on the
Transport of Dangerous Goods”. This is especially
important for sites in countries that do not have local
regulations for the transport of dangerous goods. We
have refined our audit concept in order to monitor
compliance with the transport safety regulations at Merck
sites as well as the compliance of those partners involved
in the transport of goods on our behalf.

Suppliers
Merck's supplier management focuses on more than just
typical sourcing priorities such as competitive pricing,
quality and delivery reliability - for us, compliance with
fundamental environmental and social standards is also a
key strategic goal. With this in mind, in 2013 and 2014 we
further optimized our procurement strategies, processes
and guidelines, aiming to improve adherence to
internationally recognized compliance, environmental,
and social standards along our supply chains, as well as to
prevent violations of those standards. Because developing
and emerging economies are gaining significance as
sourcing markets, it is essential to ensure that suppliers
located in these countries particularly adhere to these
standards.

Supplier management

Supplier monitoring

Our Group function Procurement is responsible for
integrating corporate responsibility (CR) with our sourcing
and supplier management processes. An office within
Group Procurement coordinates all corresponding
measures, such as revising our guidelines and processes,
or joining the Together for Sustainability chemical
industry initiative. Through reporting lines and the Merck
intranet, our Procurement employees in all countries
receive information on the guidelines and measures used
to ensure compliance with our supply chain standards.

A key element of our supplier management process is
ensuring that our suppliers implement CR standards, as
well as monitoring their compliance. For this reason, we
introduced an IT system in 2013 that utilized a structured
questionnaire to collect self-reported information from
suppliers. After deciding to join the Together for
Sustainability (TfS) initiative, we discontinued this system
because the initiative's EcoVadis® platform provides
extensive supplier assessments.

Procurement guidelines
Our fundamental expectations for suppliers and service
providers include their compliance with fundamental
environmental and social standards that are derived
primarily from the International Labour Organization Core
Labor Standards and the UN Global Compact. To this end,
we have been supporting the Compliance Initiative of the
German Federal Association for Materials Management,
Purchasing and Logistics (BME) since 2009 and have
additionally signed the BME Code of Conduct. This
document contains essential rules for combating
corruption, violations of antitrust law, and child labor,
and features principles on promoting human rights,
environmental protection, human health, and fair working
conditions.
Through our "Group Procurement Policy", updated in
2013, we ensure that our procurement processes adhere
to CR standards. These processes cover everything from
selecting to assessing and monitoring our vendors and
service providers. This policy reflects numerous internal
and external guidelines, such as the Merck Code of
Conduct, the Merck Human Rights Charter, our Corporate
EHS policy, ISO 14001, and the BME Code of Conduct.
To complement our procurement policy, we drafted the
"Merck Responsible Sourcing Principles" and integrated
them Group-wide into our general terms and conditions
in 2013. These principles define what we require of our
suppliers with regard to corporate responsibility,
obligating them to apply our corporate responsibility
standards to their upstream value chain.

The TfS initiative, founded in 2011 by companies in the
chemical industry, aims to systematically assess and
improve sustainability sourcing practices, including
ecological and social aspects. Suppliers are assessed either
on self-reported and publicly accessible information, or
on information obtained during audits. The evaluation
results are utilized by member companies, who abide by
all restrictions stipulated by competition law. Beyond
evaluations of the suppliers we have selected under our
risk-based approach, we thus also have access to
evaluations and audit results for other vendors who work
for us.
In the course of 2015, we will be switching our supplier
CR assessments and CR audits to the TfS method and
integrating the TfS database into our supplier
management system. We are planning to start conducting
assessments and audits according to this new procedure
in 2015.

Sustainability audits
In addition to collecting self-reported supplier
information, Merck also conducts CR audits on select
vendors based on the potential risk they pose. These
audits are based on the corresponding company standard.
Suppliers are assigned a risk category based on the risk
levels in their country, the product category, and the share
of their sales that come from Merck. In general, we assign
vendors from non-OECD countries to a higher risk
category. Regardless of their OECD status, suppliers are
also audited if there are indications that they have failed
to comply with our requirements.

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

SUPPLIERS | Management

All deviations from the "Merck Responsible Sourcing
Principles" or from national statutory requirements
identified in the course of an audit are classified as either
critical, major or minor. The audit results as well as any
corrective action required are communicated to the
vendors via an audit report. When an audit reveals defects
in a supplier's processes and conduct, we require them to
provide us with a corrective action plan that describes the

84

course of action needed to address the issues. When it
comes to defects that are classified as critical or major, we
check whether the appropriate corrective action has been
taken. For critical defects in particular, we consider the
option of terminating business relations if the problems
are not sufficiently rectified. The audit team additionally
determines how often follow-up audits need to be
conducted.

Defect classification
• Critical defects: Any defect rated as critical must be rectified or mitigated as soon as possible. The supplier must submit a corrective action
plan to Merck within one week of receiving the audit report.
• Major defects: For major defects, the supplier must submit a formal corrective action plan within one month of receiving the audit report.
• Minor defect: Minor defects do not require a formal corrective action plan, nor will we monitor the implementation of the corresponding
corrective actions.

In response to the results of our risk assessment, a total of
49 CR audits were conducted in 2013 and 2014, either by
us or by a service provider. We found critical defects at 16
suppliers, and major defects at 40 suppliers. For 26 of the
vendors with critical or major defects, the issues had to do
with their ecological impacts, in particular stemming from
waste and hazardous material storage at their facilities.
In addition to this, we also identified 40 suppliers who
exhibited flawed work practices, primarily in terms of
occupational health and safety. Neither our audits nor
the self-reported supplier information revealed significant
risks regarding violations of the right to assemble or
engage in collective bargaining, nor with regard to child
labor, forced labor or compulsory labor.
In 2013 and 2014, our CR audits focused particularly on
our mica suppliers in India, 14 of whom were audited
within this period. We terminated our business relations
with two of our vendors because they failed to carry out
the required corrective action in a satisfactory manner.

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

We aim to cultivate long-term working relationships with
our direct suppliers. To this end, we conduct workshops
in order to help them comply with our standards as well
as to develop and grow. We held one vendor workshop in
China in 2013 and one in 2014. In addition to focusing
on quality assurance, the training also covered our CR and
EHS standards. Merck is furthermore involved in the local
and regional supplier workshops organized by Together
for Sustainability (TfS). One such workshop was held in
China in 2014, and TfS is planning to host an event in
Brazil in 2015.

Reporting violations within the supply chain
Via our central SpeakUp Line, our employees can report
compliance violations as well as violations of CR
standards that occur within our supply chain. In the
2013-2014 period, we received no such reports. We do
not have a formal procedure for handling reports from
outside of the company, nor do we currently have plans
to establish one.

These figures make it clear that emerging economies are
playing an increasingly important role in Merck's sourcing
activities. One major reason is that certain pharmaceutical
products are being produced in the developing and
emerging countries in which they are commercialized. For
instance, the medicines we manufacture in India, Pakistan
and Indonesia are intended for those markets. This
approach reflects our Access to Health strategy and is
also stipulated by local law. For our products to be
manufactured locally, we require compliance with our
quality and safety standards; the same goes for the
transfer of our technology, skills and intellectual property.
All of Merck's pharmaceutical products, whether for
developed or developing markets, are produced in
manufacturing plants that meet global Good
Manufacturing Practices (GMPs).
Merck has no internal guidelines stipulating that local
suppliers are to be given preference in the contract award
process. However, there are cases in which local vendors have
a competitive advantage owing to their proximity, for
instance when it comes to the purchase of technology or
packaging materials. Furthermore, local legislation sometimes
requires us to use local vendors, especially in the
pharmaceutical industry. Otherwise, we source our goods and
services globally, depending on availability and supply.

Responsibility in the mica supply chain
Merck utilizes mica from India as a primary raw material for
effect pigment production. This special mica has properties
that are necessary for the manufacture of top-quality
pigments. In the course of an investigation in 2008, we
discovered that at the start of the supply chain, mica is
sometimes collected by children, generally together with their
parents. This is not compatible with our corporate values, nor
with the principles of our Human Rights Charter.
Merck takes a firm stance against child labor. As a
signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, we are
actively fighting to end this practice. We require our
suppliers to act accordingly and contractually prohibit
them from utilizing child labor.

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

86

As a result of our 2008 supply chain audit, we have realigned
the mica supply chain in order to prevent child labor and to
ensure that vendors comply with the principles of our Human
Rights Charter. Since then, we have been sourcing only mined
mica. We no longer use any mica that is collected because,
in this informal work environment, we cannot guarantee that
child labor is not being used. However, we consider it
important to maintain our business relationships with
suppliers in the regions where mica comes from and thus
safeguard jobs in Jharkhand, a region in northeast India
plagued by poverty and political uncertainty. This is why we
maintain direct business relationships with our partners along
the mica supply chain, meaning the mica mine operators
and the mica processing plants. We have set up an office
in the region; our staff there are in close contact with our
business partners, whom we have instructed on our values,
along with the social and environmental standards that we
expect of them. Mine owners and processing plants accept
their responsibilities and help us keep the mica supply chain
free of child labor.
In addition to these measures, we have also set up a mica
tracking system in order to guarantee that the raw materials
supplied to Merck come exclusively from mines and not from
uncontrolled sources. In order to track the mica flow, owners
maintain a daily log of the amount produced by their mines.
It is unlikely that mine owners would falsely reported inflated
production figures for the individual mines and then make up
the difference with mica from uncontrolled sources. After all,
such a course of action would incur additional licensing fees
that would then have to be paid to the government. Merck
crosschecks the final amounts once a month.
On top of this tracking system, we have also developed an
audit system that entails surprise audits conducted by Merck
or third party partners. This system aims to ensure that the
mines and processing plants are complying with our
requirements for environmental protection, safety, and
working standards. Once a month, a local organization
investigates the working conditions and standards in the
mines. In addition to this, an international organization also
conducts an annual audit that reviews both working
standards, as well as environmental, health and safety
standards. The audit reports indicate all issues identified and
specify corrective action. Our employees in Jharkhand check
whether the required corrective action has been taken.

SUPPLIERS | Supply chain

Mica supply chain

In 2013 and 2014, we conducted 14 audits on our mica
suppliers that were part of the standard yearly audit
process. Around three-fourths of the corrective actions
specified in the previous audits had already been taken or
were underway when the audit was performed. Because
they failed to carry out the corrective actions in a
satisfactory manner, we terminated business relations
with two of our vendors.

Social engagement along the mica
supply chain
Apart from our strategy to guarantee oversight of the
entire mica supply chain, we are working together with
the IGEP Foundation to better the living conditions of
the families in the mica mining regions of India. We are
therefore financing three schools with daycare centers
as well as a vocational training center for tailoring and
carpentry. These schools now have an enrollment of
around 500 children. At a fourth school opened by one of
our mica suppliers in 2014, Merck furthermore provides
scholarships for 100 children.

project aimed to improve understanding for children's
rights and foster the basic conditions for children to
regularly attend school. In collaboration with local
communities, civil servants, and teachers, the project has
made visible progress.

Stakeholder dialogue on the mica supply chain
Since the start of our supply chain changeover, we have
been keeping interested customers and other stakeholders
regularly informed on the progress made on mica
sourcing as well as the associated projects. Employees
in our Jharkhand office are in communication with our
project partners and other stakeholders, such as local and
federal agencies.

We are improving medical care in the region through
a local wellness center that is operated by the IGEP
Foundation. This facility has a doctor and a nurse on duty
every day and is highly appreciated by the region's 20,000
inhabitants, who previously had no health care at their
disposal. The doctor and nurses also pay visits to schools
and villages in the vicinity.
From 2010 until 2013, we partnered with the Indian nonprofit organization Bachpan Bachao Andolan to develop
20 "child-friendly villages" in Jharkhand. This three-year

complying with fundamental labor and social standards,
as well as the International Labour Organization’s (ILO)
core labor standards, the UN Global Compact and the
Responsible Care® program of the chemical industry. We
have put global policies and guidelines in place to ensure
that these standards are implemented at our sites, often
going beyond the legal requirements.

Distribution of employees (by region, %)

Strategic goals
Our strategic HR goals include developing a goal-oriented,
performance-driven corporate culture that features a
global talent development process and a performancerelated, market-oriented compensation structure. We are
furthermore focused on recruiting talent, building their
loyalty and retaining them for the long term. For this
reason, Merck has introduced global programs, for
example the Performance Management Process and
Global Rewards Policy, as well as the Talent and
Succession Management Process. Through targeted
measures, we are also aiming to build workforce diversity
and foster a culture of inclusion within our company. For
instance, we are thus striving to increase the percentage
of management positions (Global Grade 14 and higher)
held by women to 25%-30% by 2016 (26% are currently
held by women). Through our vocational training and
continuing education offerings, we are working to build
employee buy-in to our performance culture as well as
bolster their professional development.

In order to evaluate the impact of our strategic measures,
we conduct surveys on our programs. For instance, in the
2013-2014 period, we surveyed our employees regarding
our new mywork@merck working model, in which
employees can decide when and where they work. One
year after implementing this system in July 2013, we
turned our attention to Generation Y employees. The
results revealed that far more than 90% of those surveyed
consider flexibility in the choice of working hours and
work location to be highly important. In addition to a new
working model, we also introduced a new comprehensive
approach to employee surveys in the 2013-2014 period.
The key tool here is the Organizational Health Index, which
serves to predict Merck's future performance capacity.

Organization and responsibilities
Kai Beckmann, an Executive Board Member, is responsible
for human resources at Merck. The Group Human
Resources (Group HR) function manages and coordinates
all HR activities worldwide. Regional employees of Group
HR are in charge of implementing the measures in their
respective subsidiaries.

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

EMPLOYEES | Management

Group HR comprises the units Corporate HR, HR Business
Partners and HR Services. Corporate HR designs all global
HR guidelines, programs and policies. HR Business
Partners provide advice and support to business units
at all subsidiaries; HR Services performs administrative
services and supports all employees with regard to HRrelated matters. In the 2013-2014 period, we completed
the transition to this structure across all local HR
organizations.

Actions taken in 2013-2014
The Group-wide "Fit for 2018" transformation and growth
program aims to maintain Merck's competitive edge in
the long term. A key goal of this initiative is to bolster
buy-in to the company's performance culture. For us, this
means setting clear expectations and goals for all our
employees, providing regular and transparent feedback,
and recognizing good performance. This is why Merck
launched the capability initiative known as ONE Talent
Development, Rewards and Performance Management.
Part of our Group strategy, this initiative aims to recruit
the talent needed for our business success, offer them
development and growth opportunities, and retain them
for the long term. We are therefore working to establish a
talent pool for all critical positions at Merck. This includes
jobs that, from a strategic standpoint, are absolutely
essential to our operations. In addition to this, we are
striving to further improve our internal talent pool, as well
as to identify and start nurturing talent earlier on in their
Merck career.
To ensure that all HR functions partner more closely with
the businesses during the growth phase of "Fit for 2018",
the HR Business Partner functions that previously
operated separately are being consolidated into one single
HR Business Partner organization starting in 2015. The
Organization Center of Expertise and HR Services are also
being consolidated into one organization. The heads of
both units will report to Kai Beckmann, Executive Board
Member and Head of Group Human Resources.

Global employee data collection and
controlling
We collect and assess employee data across the Merck
Group in order to check whether we are making progress
toward our strategic goals.
Since 2012, all relevant HR processes have been
consolidated on a single IT platform: global performance
management, development planning, identification and
assessment of talent and successors, recruiting, learning
management, bonus calculation, and annual
compensation review. Called "HR Suite", this platform has
harmonized and simplified HR processes Group-wide.
Over the 2013-2014 period, we gradually expanded the
HR Suite group of users. We will be focusing on further
integrating processes and data as well as consistent
reporting.
Through internal audits, Merck regularly reviews all issues
covered in HR guidelines and regulations, such as
compliance with the statutory minimum working age
among all employees.

Training and educating employees
All new employees at Merck receive training on our Code
of Conduct, and are educated on what diversity and
inclusion means to Merck. This is how we convey a
common understanding of our Values and reinforce our
corporate culture.
In the 2013-2014 period, we adapted our activities and
measures in order to meet new challenges such as
increased international and Group-wide collaboration, as
well as accelerated innovation cycles. Since many teams
now feature employees of differing nationalities, we are
focusing our education and training activities more
heavily on a solid, fundamental understanding of other
cultures. In addition to this, Merck has developed a tool
kit that aims to improve team performance and
collaboration, and features workshop formats and elearning courses. So far, 35 workshops have been held
for various teams from various units. Furthermore, we
have implemented talent identification and development
processes across the entire Group.

EMPLOYEES | Good leadership

91

In the coming years, cooperation between HR and the
managers of the businesses will continue to grow, which
will ensure that all managers and staff worldwide live our
Values and strengthen our corporate culture.

Good leadership
Merck managers drive our innovative business model by
motivating their teams, as well as by recognizing and
leveraging the opportunities offered by the diverse
cultures and experience of their employees. They
furthermore act as role models, bolstering our Values and
feedback culture.
In order to reinforce good leadership qualities, we
launched the strategic initiative known as ONE Talent
Development, Rewards and Performance Management in
2014 as part of the growth phase of our "Fit for 2018"
program. We furthermore initiated the Merck
Competence Model, which has replaced the Merck
Competency Compass and Merck's leadership guidelines.
This new model is based on six core competencies:
customer-focused, global, innovative, result-oriented,
efficient, and engaged. They describe the type of conduct
that we expect of and therefore encourage in our
employees and managers in order to drive Merck's
strategic alignment and business success. This model
constitutes the foundation of learning and development
activities at Merck. In addition to this new model, during
2013 and 2014 the Diversity Council also developed
diversity and inclusion expectation criteria for managers.
We offer our top talent and senior managers programs
on the topic of "good leadership". For instance, the Future
Leaders program helps employees acquire business and
leadership skills in the early phases of their career. The
participants take on strategic cross-functional projects
and work abroad for two years. During the nine-month
International Management Program, young talent have
the chance to hone their leadership skills as well as their
ability to think globally. In addition to this initiative, the
Merck University, launched in 1999, offers a multiregional, modular one-year program in cooperation with
top international universities. To date, 284 senior
managers have taken part. Merck also cooperates globally
with universities to support employees who wish to study

for an Executive MBA. We plan on further harmonizing
our training programs so that all of our managers live the
same concept of good leadership.
Our teams are increasingly composed of employees from
various sites and various countries. Our management
processes must therefore take a global approach, and our
managers must possess cross-cultural leadership qualities
that are effective across an Internet connection. In the
2013-2014 period, we further harmonized our manager
development activities. Since 2013, we have been offering
our employees and managers Group-wide an enhanced
development portfolio. Take for instance our Emerging
Markets Management Program, which we developed in
China in collaboration with the renowned China Europe
International Business School. This initiative is targeted to
young managers in emerging markets in order to groom
them and build loyalty to the company. Over a period
of up to two years, the program covers business
administration content such as marketing and financial
analysis, along with topics specific to Merck such as our
strategy and corporate culture. The goal is to equip
participants to work in any of Merck's businesses in an
international setting. Merck launched the Emerging
Markets Management Program in China in 2013 and in
the Intercontinental region in 2014. Similar programs are
being initiated in Latin America in 2015 and in India in
2016.
We gauge the efficacy of our activities through our
Performance and Talent Management Process, as well as
by the fluctuation rates of managers and top talent in
the company. In addition to this, we conduct an
organizational health survey as well as an employee
engagement survey to get employee feedback on
leadership qualities.

Identifying talent
Continuous performance assessment is critical for both
individual employees as well as the success of the
company. Clear objectives, differentiated feedback, and
individual development plans constitute the foundation
of employee development. We utilize the Performance
and Talent Management Process to evaluate our
employees' performance and identify talent. In doing so,
we are bolstering Merck's performance and feedback

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

EMPLOYEES | Diversity and inclusion

culture while ensuring that in-house positions are filled
more efficiently. This harmonized approach has replaced
all previous tools for talent identification, performance
evaluation and skill development; it is managed and
documented via our HR IT system, known as the HR Suite.
Key components of our Performance and Talent
Management Process include annual feedback meetings
and performance evaluations for employees rated Global
Grade 10+ in our position grading system. In 2013, Merck
extended the variable bonus model of the Performance
and Talent Management Process to include non-exempt
employees as well. We are thus encouraging outstanding
performance as well as furthering the success of the
business and the company.
The Performance and Talent Management Process
features three assessment tools that employees can use to
systematically advance their development. Line managers,

92

select colleagues, and, as needed, external consultants
assess for instance the employee's skills and conduct,
thereby helping them better identify their personal
strengths and development opportunities. In addition, line
managers can utilize the assessment results to create a
detailed development plan for their employees.
Around the world, approximately 27,600 employees in
2014 and 31,395 employees in 2014 took part in the
Performance and Talent Management Process. In total,
we identified 4,200 talented individuals in 2014, which
represents around 19% of the participants. These talented
employees must work with their line manager to design a
development plan. Starting in 2015, we will be expanding
the process to include employees rated Global Grade nine
or lower.

Six competencies define important leadership skills

Diversity and inclusion
We believe that workforce diversity and a culture of
inclusion lead to greater innovation and better team
performance within the company. A good balance
between different cultures and nationalities, between
different age groups, and between male and female
employees is conducive to the company’s success. We

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

have therefore set ourselves the goal of increasing
workforce diversity and optimally leveraging this for our
business by creating the conditions for each employee to
reach their maximum potential. Here, we are focusing our
efforts on promoting women in management positions
as well as addressing the topics of internationality and
demographics.

93

Ultimate responsibility for diversity lies with Kai
Beckmann, who as an Executive Board Member is
responsible for Group Human Resources, among other
areas. The Chief Diversity Officer (CDO) is responsible for
strategic diversity management and reports directly to the
Executive Board Member responsible for Group HR.
In 2013, we instituted the Diversity Council, which
consists of managers from all businesses as well as select
Group functions. In the 2013-2014 period, the Diversity
Council revised Merck's diversity and inclusion strategy.
The strategy focuses on four areas:
• Attracting the right employees to the company,
fostering them and building long-term loyalty
• Fostering efficient collaboration
• Driving innovation and improvements

EMPLOYEES | Diversity and inclusion

The companies report on their progress at an annual press
conference. With support from the Chief Diversity Officer,
the Diversity Council is developing specific performance
indicators to assess whether the objectives of the 2015
diversity and inclusion strategy are being attained.

Training and educating employees
In September 2014, we presented our new diversity and
inclusion strategy to our employees in Darmstadt
(Germany) and Billerica (MA, USA) at our Diversity Days
event. Members of the Diversity Council discussed the
new strategy with several employees, the results of which
were then presented at a panel session. In addition, the
topics of diversity and inclusion are also featured in all
training courses for employees, as well as in all
management seminars for employees with managerial
responsibility.

• Meeting the needs of our diverse customers
The new strategy places a heavier focus on how a diverse
workforce can contribute to the success of our business
strategy. Clear goals can be derived from each of the
four focus areas, such as promoting intercultural
understanding in order to improve the performance of
global teams, or promoting managers who drive inclusion
and innovation within the company. The Diversity Council
is responsible for implementing the new strategy within
Merck's various businesses and units, as well as for
reviewing it. In the first half of 2015, Group Human
Resources will be conducting an audit to check whether
all HR programs and processes reflect the new approach.
In 2015, the Diversity Council will continue to push ahead
with the new strategy across the Merck Group.

Monitoring and controlling
Each quarter, Merck compiles data on the gender
distribution, nationality, and other demographics of its
employees for internal evaluation purposes. We analyze
this data at the business and Group function level, as well
as by key countries and by groups of young professionals
and managers. We present select data in both our Annual
Report as well as our Corporate Responsibility Report.
In 2011, Merck joined together with all other DAX® 30
companies to sign a voluntary commitment to increase
the proportion of management positions held by women.

Promoting women in management positions
In 2011, Merck made the strategic decision to increase
the percentage of management positions held by women
to 25%-30% by 2016. We reached the lower range of
this objective by 2013, having achieved 25%. In 2014, the
share of management positions held by women increased
to 26%. On top of that, 2014 was the first time that
two women assumed leadership of two Merck businesses
(Merck Serono and Consumer Health). At the beginning of
2015, Belen Garijo, a native of Spain and previously CEO
of Merck Serono, joined the Executive Board and took over
leadership of our Healthcare business sector.
At local level, we have implemented numerous measures
designed to further increase the percentage of women
across the entire workforce and to specifically increase
the number holding management positions. For one, we
facilitate work-life balance for our employees in many
countries, such as by offering flexible working hours and
childcare options. Furthermore, women benefit from
special ongoing training and continuing education
programs. These measures also include support from inhouse networks initiated by Merck employees, such as
Women at Merck. In order to promote exchange among
women in management positions within the Merck
Group, we support the internal Women in Leadership
network at Global headquarters in Darmstadt, Germany,

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

EMPLOYEES | Diversity and inclusion

as well as the Group-wide Merck International Women’s
Network. Our Chief Diversity Officer and Kai Beckmann,
an Executive Board member, engage these networks in
a regular dialogue. In addition, we also support external
global networks that work toward diversity and inclusion
in the professional world. Since 2012, Merck has been a
partner in the Healthcare Businesswomen´s Association
(HBA). Thanks to this partnership, women in Darmstadt,
Lyon (France) and Boston (MA, USA) can take advantage
of the organization's seminars, mentoring programs and
conferences. In October 2013, Merck in Darmstadt hosted
the HBA's European summit. Among other topics,
attendees discussed the development and advancement
of leadership skills for professionals in the health industry.
In the United States, Merck sponsored the 10th
Massachusetts Conference for Women, which took place
on December 4, 2014 and was attended by 150 EMD
Millipore and EMD Serono employees.

Employee networks
In order to promote dialogue on diversity, Merck supports
various employee networks, such as networks for women
in management positions (see “Promoting Women in
Management Positions”), networks for international
employees, and the Rainbow Network for homosexual,
bisexual and transsexual employees. Through their
involvement in these networks, employees can advance
and hone their leadership and organizational skills. In
addition to this, in 2014 we launched a project designed
to systematically foster individual network members and
to better leverage the networks' potential for Merck's
business activities. In 2015, these networks will be
developing objectives for future planned activities as well
as expanding their scope regionally and internationally.

Promoting internationality
Being an international global player, one of our
fundamental principles is to recruit employees from the
countries in which we operate and offer them career
development opportunities. Merck currently employs
people from 122 different countries, 27% of which come
from Germany. Altogether, our managerial staff includes
representatives of 67 nationalities. In the 2013-2014
period, 61% of our management positions were held by

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

94

non-German employees. The Diversity Council is working
on a concrete goal for increasing the percentage of
managers who come from emerging markets.
In order to promote the internationality of our workforce,
we pursue two goals when hiring people for new
positions: one, to increase the number of local employees
at sites outside of Germany, across all hierarchical levels;
and two, to offer our employees international
development opportunities. In addition to this
recruitment approach, we also require employees in upper
management to have acquired international work
experience. Furthermore, we help our employees to
acquire intercultural competencies. For this purpose, we
promote intercultural training courses and international
teamwork throughout the entire Merck Group. We offer
special cultural immersion courses to managers working
outside their home countries, which include language
courses and international networks.

Demographic change
In Germany, Switzerland, several other EU countries,
Japan, and the United States, demographic change is
already underway. At our sites in industrialized countries,
the average age of our employees is already more than 40,
and we expect this to continue rising in the coming years.
In Germany, Merck has implemented various programs
to respond to demographic change. For instance, we are
fostering the employability of our workforce and working
to build employee loyalty. This includes adapting
workplaces to the needs of older employees and
establishing a health management program to maintain
their health, as well as their ability to do their job. Take
for example the health intervention program that we are
running in cooperation with the company health
insurance fund at our facility in Darmstadt, Germany.
When they resume exercising and sports activities,
employees older than 40 receive special support in the
form of the "Leben nach Herzenslust" (Living Life to the
Fullest) program. Furthermore, the Darmstadt site offers
courses specifically for employees over 40 and for
employees over 50, such as the "Dranbleiben - aber wie?
Learning 40+" course ("How to stay sharp - Learning at
40+").

EMPLOYEES | Recruiting and retaining talent

95

On top of this, health counseling sessions between
managers and employees also help reinforce healthy
behaviors and promote good health. In training sessions
on healthy leadership, we educate managers on the
connection between management culture, managerial
conduct and employee stress. In addition, in 2014 we
issued our "Group Health Policy", which promotes and
maintains employee health as well as their ability to
perform.

Preventing discrimination
Our commitment to diversity also means that we do not
tolerate discrimination anywhere within our company –
whether based on gender, age, ethnicity, skin color,

nationality, religion, sexual orientation, or disability – a
stance that is mandated by the Merck Code of Conduct. If
an employee feels they have been discriminated against,
they can report the issue via various channels. Their first
point of contact is their manager, but they can also
contact Group Human Resources, Legal, or Compliance.
If an employee prefers to anonymously report their case,
they can call our free hotline from anywhere in the world.
Our compliance organization is responsible for processing
suspected cases. Confirmed cases of discrimination can
lead to disciplinary action or consequences stipulated by
labor law. In 2013 and 2014, one suspected case of
discrimination was reported via the SpeakUp Line. After
thoroughly examining the case, legal steps were taken.

qualified employees. Across all our sites, we face the
challenge of attracting talent and retaining them.
Particularly in Europe and the United States, but also in
China and other Asian countries, we are seeing growing
competition for specialists and experts, primarily the
consequence of demographic change. We are constantly
seeking chemists, pharmacologists, medical scientists,
biostatisticians, biochemists, business administration
experts, engineers, and IT specialists, as well as people who
are able and willing to take on managerial responsibility.
In emerging markets, we face the particular challenge of
recruiting qualified executives for our company.

Merck is striving to build its reputation as an attractive
employer for potential employees. Our goal here is to
recruit and retain employees who represent our Values
and show the potential for growth. For instance, we are
systematically driving the development and growth of our
internal talent pool, thereby reducing the risk of vacancies.
In addition to personal development opportunities, a
competitive compensation policy is also instrumental to
recruiting and retaining talent.
The Center of Expertise (CoE) for Strategic Talent and
Performance, part of Group Human Resources, is
responsible for developing strategies and leading
initiatives for attracting talent and retaining employees.
The measures devised by this CoE are implemented by
local HR personnel.

Attracting young professionals

guide, which aims to help graduates identify their
personal strengths, such as leadership potential or
outstanding dedication.

In 2010, we launched the "Make great things happen"
campaign to position Merck globally as an attractive
employer. This initiative highlights our strengths. For
instance, we offer diverse opportunities for employees
to contribute to the development and marketing of
innovative products, as well as career opportunities in an
international, motivating and modern work environment.
Furthermore, the claim of "Make great things happen"
is also intended to reflect our strong sense of social
responsibility as well as our commitment to maintaining
work-life balance. The positive impact of the campaign is
confirmed by Merck's ranking among the best employers
for senior scientists in Germany, which is published every
year by the company Universum following a survey of
over 5,000 participants. In 2013 and 2014, Merck ranked
fifth out of 100 companies, versus sixth in 2012. As part
of Merck's realignment under our "Fit for 2018"
transformation and growth program, we have revised our
commitment to existing and potential employees, known
as the Employee Value Proposition, along with its key
statements. Furthermore, we have expanded our employer
branding campaign to cover a broader target audience,
an effort to prepare us for issues such as greater future
demand for engineers.
Our primary target groups are university graduates and
young professionals such as MBA graduates. For instance,
in China, Germany, various other European countries, and
the United States, we have selected universities with
whom we will be cooperating more closely in the future.
These institutions were chosen based on their courses of
study and degree programs, their student body diversity,
and the distinctions their courses have received. Our
partner universities include, among others, the London
School of Economics. In February 2014, Executive Board
Chairman Karl-Ludwig Kley attended a networking event
at the London School and held discussions with a select
group of students. In addition, Merck regularly exhibits
at recruiting fairs, which offer a suitable platform for
directly interfacing with young talent, advising them on
career choices, and providing them information on job
opportunities at Merck. A company's visibility and image
are also key criteria used by our target group to search
for and decide on an employer. In the 2013-2014 period,
we furthermore compiled a campus recruiting interview

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

University graduates can join Merck via direct hire or
through a trainee program. Our trainee programs enable
participants to switch between different projects over a
period of two years and include continuing education
opportunities as well as mentoring programs. In the
2013-2014 period, we further increased the number of
trainee positions. In 2015, Merck has around 50 trainees,
primarily employed in Inhouse Consulting, but also in IT
and Finance as well.
To further increase Merck's reputation as an employer,
we have also expanded our loyalty-building Student
Excellence Program to include a larger target audience.
This program is now open not just to our work-study
students, but to all interested university students. In order
to reach out to university students, we launched a new
event format in November 2014 known as Merck
Discovery Day, which aims to give people a chance to
experience our company first-hand. The Discovery Day
held in Darmstadt in November 2014 was attended by
35 process engineering students from various German
universities. Moreover, around 500 university students
and 321 high school pupils completed an internship at
Merck in Germany in 2013, with 316 university students
and 312 pupils in 2014.

Apprenticeships and vocational training
We view the vocational training of young people as one
of the most important ways to prevent a shortage of
trained staff resulting from demographic change. 2013
was the first year in which the number of high school
graduates who went to university exceeded the number
of high school graduates who entered a traditional dual
vocational training program. Merck will nevertheless need
not just academics in the future, but also specialists
trained via the dual system. In the 2013-2014 period,
we therefore launched various initiatives and activities
in order to make our vocational training programs more
attractive. For instance, young people can now do an
apprenticeship part-time. In addition to this, our
apprentices can also collaborate on charitable projects.
In October 2014, for instance, nine apprentices built a

97

EMPLOYEES | Recruiting and retaining talent

dormitory for homeless children in Kenya. We
furthermore help our apprentices pursue a work-study
program after completing their apprenticeship.

our employees on seminars and workshops across the
Group in order to gauge and compare their efficacy as
well as ensure their quality.

In 2013 and 2014, we filled all the apprenticeship slots
that we offered in Germany. More than 450 young people
completed an apprenticeship in one of 24 professions;
more than 60 young people completed a dual degree
program in Business Administration, Business IT,
Chemistry/Process Engineering, and Mechanical
Engineering. Since 2014, Merck has been giving unlimited
employment contracts to all apprentices working in
occupations for which we have sustained demand. The
hiring rate – taking into account voluntary terminations
– has been around 90% for several years now. As part of
the MobiPro-EU program of the German Federal Ministry
of Labour and Social Affairs, for the first time five young
people from Spain started an apprenticeship at Merck in
Darmstadt in 2014. Moreover, in Darmstadt we offer our
own one-year work preparation program called "Start in
den Beruf" (Preparing to join the workforce). Thanks to
the time spent at Merck, 20 secondary school students
previously unable to find an apprenticeship successfully
qualified themselves for the job market. Since the
program's launch in 2006, 92% of the participants have
started an apprenticeship, 32% of which have now
successfully completed said apprenticeship.

In 2014, for the first time Merck employees had the
opportunity to utilize the Development Advisor, an online
tool that promotes lifelong learning. The Development
Advisor offers individual employees suggestions on
development opportunities that build on our competency
model. This tool is part of our Performance and Talent
Management Process, helping employees and line
managers identify suitable development options during
the target agreement process.

Professional development
Fostering talent, developing our employees and providing
ongoing training – this is an investment in our future and
a key factor in our entrepreneurial success. Merck strives
to help its employees optimally develop their personal
and professional strengths. Satisfied employees who grow
within a company are a critical prerequisite for the
success of our businesses.
Key features of employee development are clear
objectives, differentiated and open feedback on
performance, as well as individual development plans. The
Performance and Talent Management Process at Merck
therefore mandates an annual overall performance
assessment for all employees. In addition we, offer a
catalog of continuing education courses throughout the
Merck Group that is adapted to specific regional
participant needs. On top of this, we gather feedback from

In 2014, the U.S. magazine "Training" named EMD Serono
and EMD Millipore in the United States as one of 125
companies that excel in employer-sponsored training and
development programs. The Training Top 125 winners
were officially announced at an award gala held on
February 9, 2015.

Performance-based pay
Competitive salaries and additional benefits increase not
only our attractiveness as an employer; they also motivate
employees and build loyalty to the company. At Merck,
compensation is based on market analyses in the relevant
field and the value of the position, as well as the
employee's competence and performance. Our "Global
Rewards Policy" defines the framework for compensation
and additional benefits across the entire Merck Group.
In order to harmonize our compensation structures at a
regional and global level, we are constantly implementing
measures to improve processes and boost efficiency. Our
goal here is to offer all Merck Group employees the most
comparable compensation structures possible.
When reviewing and optimizing our compensation
policies, we engage relevant stakeholders early on in the
process. We coordinate closely with employee
representatives to define our Group-wide compensation
policy. In order to achieve competitive compensation
structures, we consider both internal and external factors,
assessing market requirements every year with regard to
income developments and positioning. Controlling for
hierarchy level and value, current analyses of job
conditions indicate no gender-specific differences in
compensation.

Work-life balance
As a family-friendly company, we strive for our employees
to achieve a good balance between work, family and leisure
time. We are thus helping maintain and strengthen their
motivation and performance potential. Besides this, we build
their trust in our company. Our employees can therefore take
advantage of flexible working models and diverse childcare
options, making it easier for them to schedule their lives and
achieve their personal goals. We furthermore offer our
employees various health management programs along with
ways to better reconcile the demands of a career while caring
for family members. In addition to this, employees at all
German sites can make use of a referral service that advises
them and connects them with home service providers. We
conduct regular surveys to gauge employee satisfaction with
the respective services.
In 2012, berufundfamilie GmbH, an initiative of the Hertie
Foundation, certified Merck's Darmstadt and Gernsheim sites
as being "family-friendly" for the third consecutive time
(following 2005 and 2008). This distinction is based on a
family-friendliness audit conducted in accordance with
predefined criteria and is valid for three years. In 2013, Merck
submitted an interim report for the 2015 audit cycle. The
Hertie Foundation has already certified that Merck is
continuously working to adapt its operations and strategy to
help employees reconcile the demands of a career and family.

Flexible work hour models
In Germany and other countries, we offer numerous options
for employees to flexibly structure their work, including
choice of working hours and locations. In 2013 and 2014,
our employees made use of more than 30 different part-time
models, such as varying weekly work hours and individually
agreed working days. Globally, approximately 5% of our
employees worked part-time.
In 2013, Merck officially implemented "mywork@merck" for
all exempt employees at its Darmstadt, Gernsheim and
Grafing sites in Germany. This flexible working hour model
aims to bolster the performance and trust culture within
Merck. Employees have the flexibility of selecting when and
where they work. Working hours are no longer clocked –
the important thing is that employees meet performance
expectations. To this end, line managers and employees work
together to define targets. In October 2014, the

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

98

mywork@merck program was opened up to non-exempt
employees whose position suited the working model. When
mywork@merck was introduced, employees and line
managers were given access to an e-learning program. In
addition, supervisors, HR business partners, members of the
Works Council, and employee representatives met to discuss
open issues pertaining to this flexible working model. By the
end of 2014, around 3,500 employees in total were taking
advantage of mywork@merck.

Entitlement to parental leave
At numerous sites, our employees are able to take parental
leave; this option is also provided for by law in some
countries, such as Germany and the United States. Often, we
offer our employees better conditions than those required by
law.
In the United States, employees are legally entitled to a
12-week unpaid leave of absence per year in the event of the
birth of a child or illness of a family member. In addition to
this, EMD Millipore also provides its employees with financial
support. In total, the company offers eight weeks of paid
maternity leave, two weeks of paid paternity leave, and five
weeks of paid leave when adopting a child. Moreover, EMD
Millipore will reimburse up to US$ 5,000 in adoption fees.
As of December 31, 2013, 433 of the employees working for
Merck's subsidiaries in Darmstadt, Gernsheim and Grafing representing around 24% of total Merck Group employees
globally in 2014 - were on parental leave, with 507 on
parental leave as of December 31, 2014. Fathers represented
33% of this total in 2013 and 31% in 2014. We provide
parents returning to work after parental leave with
information on childcare support services. In addition to this,
Merck in Germany also holds presentations and meetings
with parents, and the Darmstadt site furthermore offers
contacts for individual consultation.

Childcare options
At various sites, our employees benefit from childcare options
that we subsidize. A daycare center for children aged 1-12 has
been operating at our headquarters in Darmstadt, Germany for
more than 40 years. It is supported by the family of owners
(Merck'scher Kindertagesstätten-Verein e. V). In the 2013-2014
period, we extended the hours of operation and added an
additional 50 daycare spots. The center is now open year-round
from 6:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. and offers 150 slots total. In

EMPLOYEES | Recruiting and retaining talent

99

Darmstadt, employees can furthermore take advantage of our
emergency service if their regular childcare provider falls
through. For employees at the Gernsheim site in Germany, five
slots are available at a public daycare center.
We have been offering vacation camps for the children of
Darmstadt site employees since 2008 and considerably
expanded the program in 2013 and 2014. In 2014, we offered
a total of 365 spots that employees could book in weekly
increments. The vacation camp includes sports programs, art
and research projects, as well as numerous outdoor nature
activities.
Since 2013, employees throughout Germany have had access
to an external partner to advise them on childcare options,
helping them find a suitable childcare solution. The service
connects employees with nannies, "loaner" grandparents and
tutors, among others.

In the United States, EMD Millipore offers its employees
assistance in finding the best childcare options.

Reconciling demands of career and family
In an aging society, more and more employees will be required
to care for family members with special needs. In Darmstadt,
Merck has therefore been offering special information and
consultation services since 2009. This includes the offerings of
Merck's company health insurance fund (BKK), which provides
informational material and connects employees with nursing
staff. Furthermore, we regularly hold training seminars in
Darmstadt on the topic of nursing care. Since 2013, an external
partner has also been available to advise employees in their
search for suitable nursing care. This includes finding day
nurses or setting up an individual nursing network.
In the United States, EMD Millipore supports its employees
financially by enabling nursing care to be paid out of gross pretax income.

EMPLOYEES | Employee engagement

Employee engagement
As a global, science-based company, we strive to create a
working environment that nurtures innovation and continual
improvement. In this approach, our employees take center
stage. Their dedication and skills are crucial to our company's
success. We therefore aim to foster a culture that broadens the
knowledge base of our employees that creates opportunities
and motivates them to take a proactive role in our success.
We want our employees to take an active interest in our goals
and Values, to engage in shaping processes and ideas.
Dedicated, strong managers as well as self-motivated
employees both contribute equally to our success. We have
built a framework of clearly defined, clearly communicated
strategic goals, using this foundation to design measures that
promote employee engagement and incorporate it into our
processes. Through our idea management programs, we
nurture and reward unconventional thinking, while our stateof-the-art internal communication processes encourage
interdisciplinary collaboration. Employee surveys allow us to
better understand the needs of our employees.
Our global Center of Expertise for Development and
Engagement designs and steers our approach to conducting
employee engagement surveys. We utilize survey results to
devise concrete measures for our businesses, the
implementation of which is steered by Group Human
Resources.

Idea management
At our Darmstadt site, we utilize an employee suggestion
system to leverage our employees' ideas for the benefit of our
business. Here, Merck rewards employee suggestions that have
been brought to fruition. The amount of money awarded
depends on the actual cost savings achieved and/or the idea's
contribution to occupational safety, environmental protection,
or quality improvement. Merck employees submitted a total of
3,460 suggestions for improvement in 2013 and 3,590 in 2014.
These led to savings amounting to € 3.4 million in 2013 and
€ 2.8 million in 2014. In exchange, Merck paid out prize money
of € 0.96 million in 2013 and € 1.0 million 2014. Around 75%
of the suggestions for improvement related to production;
approximately 25% comprised suggestions relating to analysis,
technology and logistics. The ideas helped significantly in many
instances to optimize production processes and occupational

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

100

safety, as well as to lower waste output and emission levels.
For instance, one group of employees modified the standard
packaging for liquid crystals in such a way as to cut down on
packaging material.
In addition to this, we also reward the outstanding ideas of
our employees with Merck Awards. Every year, recognition is
given in the categories of Change, Innovation, and Customer
Orientation, along with the special prize, the CEO Award.
Through the strategic initiative known as ONE Global
Headquarters, Merck is striving to transform the Darmstadt site.
In line with our approach to employee engagement, we are
focusing heavily on meeting the requirements of a changing
working world. This initiative aims to create an attractive
environment for existing and potential employees that offers
scope for creativity and promotes innovation. In September
2014, for instance, we started construction on a modular
Innovation Center. This is where teams will have a place to
work for the duration of their innovation projects, where
interdisciplinary collaboration will flourish amidst a creative
atmosphere. We sincerely believe that this will tangibly improve
our employees' performance and productivity.
In order to involve employees in helping decide the company's
strategic alignment, we provide an internal online forum in
which they can engage in a dialogue and discuss new ideas.
This forum is one of the many tools of our "Fit for 2018"
transformation and growth program. In 2014, we hosted a
major employee celebration at our Darmstadt site as thanks for
the successes achieved thus far under "Fit for 2018". The event
also provided an opportunity for around 5,000 employees to
learn about ongoing strategic initiatives as well as to interact
with people from other departments and units.

Channels of communication
Internal Communications develops and steers global
communications activities within the company, providing tools
such as target group-specific media. For instance,
communication packets and information are posted on the
online "pro Manager" portal in order to improve manager
discourse with employees. In the 2013-2014 period, Merck
conducted two employee surveys on internal communications
and then used the results to design new media that better
satisfy the needs of employees and managers. One example
is "pro", our international employee publication that has

101

transformed from a newspaper into a magazine. It has been
available in seven languages since September 2014 and is now
also available as an online magazine and app. It is thus reaching
more than 90% of our approximately 39,000 employees
worldwide in their local language. For our employees in
Germany, we have also been publishing the "pro vor Ort"
newspaper. In addition to this, our businesses and Group
functions issue their own newsletters to update their
employees on progress and changes. Starting in 2015, we will
be launching our new online collaboration platform known as
EVA, which will replace our former Intranet. Here, we will be
focusing more on video communication to convey information
quickly, concisely and directly to the desired target group.

Employee surveys
We are striving to incorporate the ideas and know-how of our
employees more heavily into our business operations. Because
our company has changed greatly in the course of our "Fit
for 2018" transformation and growth program, we developed
a new approach to employee surveys in 2014. Through this,
Merck is aiming to strengthen its corporate culture and help
managers create a motivating work environment that will
increase its success. The new approach includes a survey that
is part of the Organizational Health Index (OHI), along with
another survey that specifically addresses employee
engagement. Together, these will be taking the place of the
"Pulse" employee survey that Merck conducted in 2009, 2010
and 2011. Because of the broader-based approach of these
surveys, their results cannot be compared against Pulse results.
Both surveys are being implemented globally at the business
level as well as the Group function level.
The OHI survey results serve to predict Merck's future
performance capacity as well as indicate aspects that are
particularly important for the success of the company. The OHI
survey is based on nine dimensions: direction, accountability,
coordination and control, external orientation, leadership,
innovation and learning, capabilities, motivation and culture
and climate. The OHI Score reveals how well employees think
Merck is doing in each of the dimensions. In 2014, 4,251 Merck
Serono employees and 2,600 Performance Materials employees

EMPLOYEES | Employee engagement

took part in the survey. Results show that employee motivation
at Merck is above average relative to other companies. In
response to the OHI survey, Merck Serono has introduced
initiatives to promote more motivational management styles
and to foster talent. Performance Materials utilized the results
in planning the integration of AZ Electronic Materials.
Building on the OHI survey, Merck Serono and Performance
Materials will be conducting the second employee engagement
survey in 2015. The survey will cover topics such as leadership,
performance, reward, and career and development, along with
content specific to Merck such as inclusion. By the end of 2015,
Merck Millipore, Consumer Health and all Group functions will
be starting with the new employee survey approach by taking
the OHI survey.

Engaging employees in corporate responsibility
We educate our employees on corporate responsibility through
events and communication campaigns. For instance, in
September 2013 we hosted an Africa Week at our Darmstadt
and Gernsheim facilities in Germany. CR employees manned
booths at site cafeterias, spreading information on our CR
projects in Africa. In addition to this, the cafeteria menu
featured ethnic African dishes.
As part of Earth Month, Energy Month and World Water
Week, Merck Millipore hosted environmental awareness
campaigns that provided tips on how employees can
minimize their impact on the environment at both work
and home. During the Earth Month campaign in 2014,
employees also took part in numerous volunteer activities.
In Temecula, California (USA), for instance, employees
worked together to clean the beach, while staff in Cork,
Ireland cleaned the river bank; in Quito, the capital of
Ecuador, they planted trees, and in Massachusetts (USA)
they picked up trash in parks and on roadsides.
Merck Millipore furthermore utilizes volunteer work as part of
its global team building activities. For instance, at a gathering
of the Merck Millipore leadership team, 130 managers built 26
bikes for children at the East Boston YMCA.

Corporate Responsibility Ambassador Network
In April 2014, Merck Millipore launched the Corporate Responsibility Ambassador Network, a global employee network for CR-related issues.
Members view themselves as role models of proactivity, getting fellow co-workers involved in CR initiatives such as on-site recycling or
community engagement in the vicinity of Merck's sites. Thus far, eight sites have CR Ambassador teams: Jaffrey (NH, USA), Billerica (MA, USA),
Bedford (MA, USA), St. Charles (MO, USA), Temecula (CA, USA), Cork (Ireland), Amsterdam (Netherlands), and Molsheim (France). For instance,
the network in Jaffrey invited people to a Biomass Lunch & Learn aimed at educating co-workers about the site's new biomass central steam
plant along with its benefits for the environment. During Earth Month, CR Ambassadors in Cork organized a corporate responsibility open house
to spread information on wastewater management, recycling and the "Bike to work" program.

In addition to this, Merck fosters its employees' ideas for
new businesses through its Innospire program. In 2014,
the program centered on the topics of energy
conservation, conversion and efficiency, water treatment,
water quality analyses, and efficient water consumption,
along with patient focus, personalized medicine and
digital/mobile health. Merck employees were called upon
to submit suggestions for new materials and systems,
as well as for new business models. During the 2014
Innospire program, 300 ideas were submitted, including
some that pertained to the above-mentioned topics.

Employee co-determination
We foster employee participation, co-determination and
dialogue in our company. For this reason, we regularly
involve local employee representative bodies, relying on
them extensively for input. Take Germany for instance,
where 11 Merck subsidiaries have employee
representative councils. Here, local works councils as well
as an overall Group Works Council represent our
employees' interests, discussing issues such as
compensation, working hours, and realignment. The
Senior Executives Committee represents the interests of
senior management.
The Merck Euroforum is our employee representative body
at the European level and also serves as an information
and advisory platform. Topics that are addressed regularly
include the economic and financial situation of the Merck
Group in Europe, the employment situation, and also
significant changes within our company, such as
acquisitions.

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

For its work on the "Fit for 2018" program, the Darmstadt
Works Council was awarded the German Works Council
Prize in 2013.

Occupational health and safety
As a responsible employer, it is especially important to
us to prevent workplace-related illnesses and accidents.
To this end, our Group-wide guidelines and management
structures establish uniform standards for occupational
health and safety that are oriented to the requirements
of the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the
Responsible Care® program of the chemical industry.
Occupational health and safety are an integral component
of Merck's Environment, Health, Safety (EHS)
management system, which is aligned with the OHSAS
18001 standard. The Group function Environment, Health,
Safety, Security, Quality (EQ) is responsible for this
management system; they define goals, steer Group-wide
measures, and conduct internal audits to check that the
management system is functioning. In addition to this,
the EHS management system is also audited every year by
independent experts. Local EHS managers are responsible
for compliance with occupational safety laws and
regulations, as well as for the implementation of
measures at individual sites.
We compile data on workplace accidents at the individual
sites on a monthly basis. The Group function EQ evaluates
all data and informs the other facilities about preventive
measures as needed. In turn, all Merck sites are required
to immediately report relevant accidents to EQ.

103

Issued in 1995, our "Environment, Health and Safety
Policy" describes our approach to occupational health and
safety and is the basis for numerous other guidelines.
In 2014, we drafted our "Group Health Policy", which
defines the manner in which we promote occupational
health and safety as well as the welfare of our employees.
One component of this policy is the "Global Wellbeing
and Health Promotion Framework", which describes the
requirements of each individual country in which we
operate. In line with this framework, the interdisciplinary
Health Management steering committee designs and
implements measures to promote good health, such as a
health prevention program for shift workers. Furthermore,
at our individual sites, employee and employer
representatives have reached company agreements on
occupational health and safety. For instance, in October
2013 such an agreement was reached on health
counseling at our German sites. Among other measures,
this document covers counseling training for managers
so that they learn to promptly recognize health risks and
psychological strain in their employees. Reached in
September 2014, the agreement on health prevention for
shift workers includes an extensive health intervention
program. The goal here is to educate shift workers and
make them aware of the adverse effects of such work,
providing them with the tools to minimize these effects.
The key performance indicator for the success of our EHS
measures is the lost time injury rate (LTIR), which means
the number of workplace accidents resulting in lost
workdays per one million hours worked. This indicator is
applied to both Merck employees and temps. Our goal is
to achieve a lost time injury rate of 2.5 by the end of
2015. In 2014 we outperformed this goal, achieving an
LTIR of 1.8. In addition to slips, trips and falls, the primary
causes of lost time incidents were accidents involving
the operation of machinery as well as business travel
incidents, primarily car crashes.
Despite our efforts to prevent accidents, there were
unfortunately two workplace accidents resulting in
fatalities in 2014. In Venezuela, an employee died in a car
accident, and in Pakistan, one employee was killed while
performing maintenance work on a scissor lift.

EMPLOYEES | Occupational health and safety

The BeSafe! program
In order to prevent behavior-related workplace accidents,
we have implemented the BeSafe! Program. This initiative
works to continually educate and train our employees – in
particular those at production sites throughout the Group
– on potential workplace hazards, thereby reinforcing our
safety culture. In 2014, Merck rolled out the BeSafe!
program across our warehouse sites as well, which means
that all of Merck's production sites and warehouses are
now part of this program.
At our annual EHS congress in Darmstadt as well as EHS
forums in North and South America, Europe and Asia,
EHS managers share best practices and learn from one
another. In the 2013-2014 period, EHS forums were held
in Poseung (South Korea), San Diego (CA, USA), and Bari
(Italy), which particularly focused on health management,
occupational exposure limits, and safety management for
temp employees. At our Darmstadt and Gernsheim sites
in Germany, we hosted an EHS training seminar for 18
EHS managers from 15 countries in 2014. In addition to
this, in December 2014 at our Bari site we held our fourth
EHS Best Practice Sharing Meeting. Participants included
EHS managers from various European sites as well as
representatives from local and international companies,
industry associations, and academia.
In 2014, we continued to educate our employees
worldwide on workplace hazards through initiatives,
training seminars, awareness campaigns, and educational
activities. In addition to this, individual subsidiaries in
Latin America, such as in Brazil and Mexico, hold safety
competitions at specific sites that help reinforce our
safety culture.
In 2014, Merck presented the Safety Excellence Award for
the fifth time, which recognizes those production sites
with no workplace accidents on record for the year. 42 out
of 69 sites received the award in 2014, with 38 out of 63
production sites in 2013.

Health management
Merck issued its "Group Health Policy" in 2014, which
aims to maintain and continually nurture employee
health and performance. In line with this policy, we have

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

EMPLOYEES | Occupational health and safety

104

implemented health-promoting programs to bolster
employee welfare and performance. To this end, we have
established a Group-wide occupational health
management system that aims to incorporate healthrelated goals into our corporate culture. Our health
promotion activities focus on health fundamentals (e.g.
workplace ergonomics), healthy leadership (e.g.
managerial approaches that maintain employee health),
and individualized health intervention (e.g. offering health
promotion courses, encouraging employees to take
responsibility for their own health).
At our Darmstadt site, we furthermore offer numerous
other activities and programs to promote good health.
Our company medical center offers services such as
check-ups, medical care, and psychosocial counseling.
Through local offerings, we raise employee health
awareness and encourage them to take responsibility for
their own health. Merck's company health insurance fund
(Merck BKK) supports these programs across all areas of

the company and additionally offers special courses and
health care programs. In addition to this, Merck BKK runs
the Fit@Merck program on behalf of our Health
Management unit. This program enables employees to
participate in health prevention classes and will subsidize
up to € 195 in costs. In addition to this, employees can
take part in our company athletics program. At our
cafeterias, we furthermore offer our employees meals that
meet the requirements of the German Society of Nutrition
(DGE).
EMD Millipore employees at the Massachusetts and New
Hampshire facilities in the United States can take
advantage of a comprehensive health intervention
program offered within the company. This program aims
to prevent, detect, and/or treat diseases and injuries early
on. It includes special exercise/training programs,
seminars, sports competitions, and ergonomic workplace
assessments. Employees who attend health intervention
courses can receive up to US$ 300 in financial incentives.

Environment
Our responsibility to protect the environment is derived
from our values and our Group strategy. We have
instituted Group-wide principles, strategies and
organizational structures for corporate environmental
protection and have also implemented a certified
environmental management system for our Group-wide
activities. In this way, we aim to reduce our emissions and
waste while also ensuring that resources such as energy,
water and raw materials are utilized as efficiently as
possible. Process safety is a key prerequisite here.

ENVIRONMENT | Management

Environmental management
Our responsibility to protect the environment stems from
our Values and our Group strategy. We aim to continually
improve our performance and reduce our impact on the
environment by applying the precautionary principle. This
especially means efficiently conserving resources such as
raw materials, auxiliaries, operating supplies, energy, and
water. In addition to this, we strive to lower our emissions
and waste so that we can reduce our costs as well as our
impact on the environment.
Our Corporate Environment, Health and Safety (EHS)
Policy, in effect throughout the Merck Group, establishes
the framework for principles, strategies and
organizational structures for environmental protection at
Merck. The topics of health and safety are covered under
Employees: Occupational Health and Safety on p. 102.
Our EHS policy is implemented through internal
guidelines and instruction manuals on compliant
behavior, such as the "Merck Group EHS, Security and
Quality Manual". This manual describes, for instance, the
fundamental global processes and organizational
structure for environmental protection and occupational
safety at Merck. Our guidelines are based on the
Responsible Care® Global Charter, which the chemical
industry drafted in 2005. Merck was among the first
companies to sign the revised version of this charter in
2014. We have furthermore aligned our guidelines to the
ISO 14001 (environmental management systems) and
OHSAS 18001 (occupational health and safety
management systems) standards. Merck has developed
Group-wide standards as well as standard operating
procedures for all environment, health and safety issues
relevant to Merck.
For our environmental protection activities, we have
established a management system that is structured
according to ISO 14001. We require all production sites
with more than 50 employees to implement our
environmental management system, which is optional for
sites with 50 employees or fewer. This system is certified
on an annual basis by an accredited, independent
organization. New production sites must subsequently set

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

106

up and implement an environmental management system
that conforms to Group standards and meets the
requirements for ISO 14001 certification.
Since 2009, Merck has had an ISO 14001:2004 group
certificate for its environmental management system. As
part of the certification process, multiple surveillance
audits are conducted every year, which we passed with
flying colors in both 2013 and 2014. Suitable action plans
have been drawn up and are now being implemented. The
group certificate currently covers 58 sites, including eight
of nine production sites from AZ Electronic Materials, a
company that was acquired in 2014. Due to site
acquisitions made mid-year and the time needed to fully
implement an environmental management system, there
are generally always a few production sites still
undergoing implementation that have not yet been
certified to ISO 14001:2004 by year-end. At the time of
the surveillance audit in 2014, four sites fell into this
category.
A new version of ISO 14001 is scheduled for publication
in 2015. Merck will be adapting its Group-wide
environmental management system and corresponding
documents such as the "Corporate EHS Policy" and the
"Merck Group EHS, Security and Quality Manual" to meet
these new requirements.

Organization
Bernd Reckmann, Member of the Merck Executive Board,
bears overall responsibility for environmental protection
at Merck. The Merck Group function EQ is responsible for
globally steering all environmental protection measures
and is furthermore in charge of occupational health and
safety, security, and quality.
Each site has specific employees in charge of EHS-related
matters. The local site managers are responsible for
operational environmental protection as well as
occupational health and safety. When it comes to these
matters, they receive support and guidance from EHS
managers or, at smaller sites, from EHS coordinators.
The company AZ Electronic Materials, acquired in 2014,
has been completely integrated into EQ's structural
organization and processes since the beginning of 2015.

107

The processes for complying with local environmental
protection laws, regulatory requirements, standards, and
business requirements are stipulated by EQ, but are also
partially defined by the sites themselves. EQ has created
internal standards and standard operating procedures for
all key environmental topics. Regular internal and external
audits are conducted to verify compliance with these
standards, the frequency of which is based on the site's
risk potential. Employees can report violations to
Compliance. In the 2013-2014 period, no significant
violations of environmental laws or regulations were
recorded within the Merck Group.

ENVIRONMENT | Management

and plant security. When sites and property are acquired
or divested, EQ performs its due diligence, drawing up
detailed EHS statements in order to ensure that
contaminated or otherwise problematic sites are neither
bought nor sold.

Using the Group-wide LION electronic data management
system, environmental data is recorded at the individual
sites and reported to the Group function EQ at least once
a year.

All employees tasked with environmental protection
responsibilities are trained on a continuous basis and
obtain additional qualifications. In addition to local
programs, this training also includes the annual
international EHS Congress in Darmstadt, as well as the
regional EHS Forum. These events inform attendees about
new EHS issues as well as planned guidelines and laws,
and furthermore encourage best practice sharing at an
expert level. In 2014, these events focused on topics such
as management systems, pharmaceutical residue in the
environment, and environmental performance indicators.

For all capital expenditure projects, either EQ or the local
EHS unit will conduct environmental impact assessments
to ensure sufficient environmental protection and
occupational safety, as well as a proper degree of building

In 2014, Merck’s spending on corporate environmental
protection totaled € 146 million worldwide (€ 142 million
in 2013). These figures also include capital investments
made during 2013 and 2014.

Plant and process safety
Plant and process safety is of great significance to Merck.
Failed safety systems can lead to chemical spillage, which
can in turn adversely impact people and the environment.
This can also result in financial damage from issues such
as production stoppages. One of our top goals is therefore
to prevent production disruptions that can cause
workplace accidents and chemical leaks.
We apply the same uniform standard to plant and process
safety across the globe. Our Group-wide standard "Plant
and Process Safety" mandates safety-related
requirements be applied to the entire life cycle of a plant
- including construction, normal operation, modifications,
maintenance, repair, and shutdown. This standard applies
to all production plants and warehouses. A safety concept
is always developed for each plant before the plant is
commissioned. Continuously revised and updated, this
concept contains an overview of potential risks (e.g. fires,
explosions, substance leakage into the environment) as
well as the corresponding protective measures. The
Group-wide standard "Spillage Control" defines
organizational measures for preventing spillage during
storage and transport, and also details how to handle

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

hazardous materials. We furthermore have a Group-wide
"Risk Management Process" operating procedure that
specifies how to identify and assess risks, as well as how
to develop and implement measures to minimize them.
The Group function EQ (see Environmental management
on p. 106) is in charge of environmental protection and is
the expert in plant and process safety guidelines as well as
all related topics. At our individual sites worldwide, local
EHS managers are appointed to handle environmental
issues pertaining to plant and process safety.
In order to continuously identify potential for
improvement, we regularly assess the plant and process
safety of each site using EHS performance indicators,
which gives us a comprehensive overview of safety at
our sites. Accidents are evaluated retrospectively using
lagging indicators, and potential future situations are
identified using leading indicators, which are based on
factors such as near-accidents and identified areas of
improvement.
These comprehensive EHS performance indicators consist
of a variety of data. For instance, since 2013 we have
been tracking the EHS Incident Rate, an indicator that

109

synthesizes the following data: the number of workplace
accidents involving Merck employees and contractors
who work at Merck sites; environmentally relevant
incidents (e.g. product spills); activation of operational
safety systems without an adverse impact on people and
the environment (e.g. preventive system shutdown), and
deviations identified in the course of external reviews and
audits. For these indicators, product spills are defined
according to a concept developed by the European
Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC) and the German
Chemical Industry Association (VCI).
Across all production, research and storage sites, we
registered a total of 44 incident-related substance spills
in 2013. Thanks to improved plant and process safety, we
only recorded 26 incidents across all sites in 2014. We
investigate each individual incident at the respective site
and take appropriate countermeasures in order to prevent
the same scenario - or a similar one - from recurring. We
regularly organize best practice and information sharing
sessions so that all our production sites can learn from
incidents and implement preventive measures. Of the
incident-related spills reported in 2013 and 2014, none
resulted in significant environmental pollution.
Since plant and process safety always involves the
interaction of man and machine, we consider it highly
important for our employees to be well-trained and to
receive ongoing training on a regular basis. To this end,
in-house training on plant and process safety is regularly
conducted at production sites. In 2013 and 2014, two
training workshops were offered as part of an internal
advanced training program for both site managers as well
as for production, engineering and EHS managers from
our Life Science and Performance Materials business
sectors. The primary topics included systematic risk
identification in processing plants, explosion protection,
and static electricity.

Climate protection
As a company that operates responsibly, we are
committed to helping protect the environment and
mitigate climate change by conserving energy and
reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. Our climate
change mitigation activities are also of financial benefit
to us since improved energy efficiency means that we

ENVIRONMENT | Climate protection

save on operating costs. Pressure from a growing number
of statutory regulations governing greenhouse gas
emissions has also encouraged us to take action. Merck
is subject to a variety of national as well as international
energy and emissions regulations, such as emissions
trading systems. Currently, the EU Directive 2012/27/EU
on energy efficiency is being incorporated into the
national legislation of EU member states. It requires major
industrial companies to conduct energy audits or
implement energy management systems.
Within the scope of the Carbon Disclosure Project, we
have been reporting on our greenhouse gas emissions
activities, measures, and achievements for several years.
In 2014, we were once more ranked in performance band
B in the Climate Performance Scoring, which puts us
clearly in the upper range of all participating companies
in the Germany, Austria and Switzerland category. In the
Climate Disclosure Scoring, which rates the thoroughness
and transparency of a company's reporting, Merck scored
87 out of 100 points, putting it well above the average.
The Merck Group function EQ is responsible for globally
steering all climate protection activities (see
Environmental management on p. 106). At the individual
Merck sites, operational units are responsible for
implementing climate change mitigation measures.
In 2014, we implemented a new guideline on Group-wide
energy management. Our "Energy Management" standard
defines general principles for uniform energy
management across all Merck sites. Our "Emissions of
Refrigerants" standard, implemented at the end of 2013,
aims to reduce emissions from cooling processes that may
cause global warming as well as ozone layer depletion. In
2013, we furthermore revised our company car policy and
set a goal to reduce the average CO2 emissions from our
global company car fleet by 30% by 2020, relative to 2012
levels. In order to reach this goal, we are switching our
pool of leased company cars over to more efficient, more
economical models.

Our strategic EDISON program
We have set ourselves the goal of reducing greenhouse
gas emissions by 20% by 2020, relative to the 2006
baseline. In order to achieve this target, we initiated in

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

ENVIRONMENT | Climate protection

2009 the EDISON energy efficiency and climate protection
program, which consolidates the climate change
mitigation activities of the Merck Group. Worldwide, 20
Merck sites jointly account for 80% of our greenhouse
gas emissions, so EDISON is focusing on these sites in
particular. The reduction of our energy-related emissions
is one of our primary measures. To this end, we are
working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from energy
generation as well as to enhance the energy efficiency of
research and production processes. Furthermore, we wish
to lower process-related emissions through initiatives
such as a process efficiency program at Merck Millipore.
Improving the energy efficiency of our facility operations
and employing renewable energy are other measures that
will contribute to this goal. For our Merck Millipore sites,
we have set ourselves the intermediate goal of reducing
greenhouse gas emissions by 10% by the end of 2015,
relative to the 2006 baseline.
To create and implement climate change mitigation
projects, EQ collaborates with a working group that spans
all of Merck's businesses. This group develops measures
and evaluates site-specific project proposals in terms of
absolute CO2 reduction, CO2 reduction relative to capital
spending volume, and potential cost savings.
Through the approximately 300 EDISON projects that
have been initiated since 2012, Merck aims to annually
save around 60,000 metric tons of CO2 in the medium
term. Around two-thirds of these projects have already
been launched, or are currently being implemented. For
2015, we have initiated 57 new projects, which we expect
to reduce CO2 emissions by approximately 37,000 metric
tons in the medium term.
At the end of 2014, Merck commissioned a carbonneutral biomass power plant in Goa, India that runs on the
shells of locally farmed coconuts and cashews. This will
enable us to cut CO2 emissions by around 11,500 metric
tons per year. On top of this, a biomass central heat plant
went into operation in Jaffrey, New Hampshire (USA) in
December 2014. This renewable energy biomass plant will
run on locally produced wood chips and will enable us to
cut CO2 emissions by around 3,500 metric tons per year.

Merck's production sites in Darmstadt and Gernsheim,
Germany, account for around 40% of Merck's global
energy consumption. With the cogeneration plant in
Darmstadt and the heating plant in Gernsheim, these two
sites are subject to the EU Emissions Trading System.
Merck operates very efficient energy generation plants
and, in this third period of EU emissions trading stretching
from 2013 to 2020, we are also benefiting from a
situation in which some certificates are being allocated
free of charge. As things stand today, however, we will
need to purchase additional CO2 certificates in the future.
At the Darmstadt site, Merck is spending around
€ 27 million on the construction of two state-of-the-art
energy stations. In July 2014, Executive Board Chairman
Karl-Ludwig Kley and the German Federal Minister for
Economic Affairs and Energy Sigmar Gabriel inaugurated
the first station, which is supplying the site's
pharmaceutical production operations and research
activities with power, heating and cooling. The second
station is currently under construction and will cover the
refrigeration needed by the site's chemical plants and
laboratories, among other power needs. Once both plants
are in operation, the site's CO2 emissions will decrease by
around 2,500 metric tons per year.
In mid-2013, a highly efficient cogeneration plant was
commissioned in Gernsheim, which saves around 7,000
metric tons of CO2 emissions per year.
Energy management is another component of EDISON.
Eight of our sites have been certified to ISO 50001 "Energy
Management Systems": Darmstadt, Gernsheim and
Wiesbaden in Germany, Molsheim in France, Bari and
Tiburtina in Italy, Taoyuan in Taiwan, and Poseung in
South Korea.

Energy consumption and CO2 emissions in
2013 and 2014
In 2014, Merck consumed a total of 1,622 GWh of energy,
which represents a slight increase over 2013 (1,566 GWh).
Due to the complexity involved in collecting the data, we
are currently not calculating the energy that is consumed
upstream or downstream during the production and
transport of our raw materials.
In 2014, the Merck Group emitted 524,000 metric tons
of greenhouse gas emissions (CO2 equivalents), with
567,000 metric tons emitted in 2013. This decrease can be
attributed mainly to a 30% reduction in emissions from
one production process. In this process, we have managed
to reduce the emissions relative to production volume by
almost two-thirds since 2008. CO2 emissions fell by 9%
relative to the 2006 baseline, which means that Merck is
on the right path to achieving its 20% reduction target by
2020.
In order to report and calculate its greenhouse gas
emissions, Merck utilizes the Greenhouse Gas (GHG)
Protocol, an internationally recognized standard. Merck is
currently reporting Scopes 1 and 2 of the GHG protocol,
and parts of Scope 3. Scope 1 covers direct emissions that
the company produces itself by burning fossil fuels, or
through its own processes. Scope 2 pertains to emissions
from imports of energy, such as electricity or district
heating. Scope 3 includes emissions such as those from
the manufacture and transportation of products, raw
materials, and waste, or from employee business travel.
Due to the complexity of Scope 3 emissions reporting,
Merck is currently only reporting on Scope 3 emissions
from business travel, from employee commuting, from
fuel and energy-related activities, and from the disposal
and recycling of waste generated in the course of our
business operations. Merck has done some product life
cycle assessments and carbon footprint analyses (see
Sustainable products on p. 50).

Educating employees
Our commitment to climate change mitigation is not only
observed at work - we encourage our employees to
exhibit this through more sustainable living habits as well.

To keep our employees informed, we publish a selection of
climate protection facts and figures on Merck's intranet.
Furthermore, various tools such as energy checklists or
examples of best practices are also available to help
employees share information and learn from one another.
We continuously provide information on Merck's climate
change mitigation efforts in our employee magazine and
in an employee newsletter.
Through an online training system, we have trained
employees at our Darmstadt and Gernsheim sites in
Germany on the topic of energy management. As an
incentive to use public transportation, the Darmstadt
Merck site offers a "Jobticket", the cost of which is
partially covered by the company. In 2014, nearly 4,000
employees took advantage of this option.
In the United States, Merck Millipore supports employees'
individual climate change mitigation efforts through
engagement programs and monetary subsidies.
Employees receive subsidies to install solar panels on their
homes, have an energy audit conducted on their homes,
or purchase hybrid and/or electric vehicles. New for 2015
will be the addition of select electric motorcycles to the
personal climate change mitigation subsidies. The vehicle
subsidy has already encouraged over 150 employees to
switch to a hybrid or electric car. In addition to this, Merck
Millipore is bolstering its employees' awareness of and
engagement in environmental protection through global
campaigns such as Energy Month and its Corporate
Responsibility Ambassador Network. Through the end of
2014, Merck Millipore and Merck Serono also installed
electric vehicle charging stations at our Bedford and
Billerica sites (Massachusetts, USA), where employees and
visitors can charge their electric cars free of cost.

Logistics
We are working to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions
that result from the transport of our products. To achieve
this, we are reducing the use of air transport in favor of
sea shipping. We have undertaken a project to identify
products that can be shipped by sea instead of air in order
to reduce costs and CO2 emissions. These products need
to safely withstand the longer travel time at sea without
compromising the product quality and service level to
customers. This project encompasses all shipments from

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

ENVIRONMENT | Climate protection

112

our Global Distribution Centers to customers and local
warehouses worldwide. For instance, thanks to changing
how we transport goods worldwide from Darmstadt,
Germany, we reduced CO2 emissions by approximately
800 metric tons in 2014.
We are also focused on reducing emissions from shipping
thousands of products to customers. In the United States,
Merck Millipore is an EPA SmartWay® Shipper. As a
SmartWay® Shipper, we are committed to benchmarking

operations and implementing supply chain efficiencies in
order to improve our performance annually with respect
to how we ship our products.
As we continue to evaluate our logistics for further
climate-saving measures, we believe this will not only
help reduce our own greenhouse gas emissions, but will
also support our customers' needs as they seek more
products and services with reduced carbon footprints.

Waste management
Waste management is a key aspect of our corporate
environmental protection activities. This includes
measures to prevent, reduce, and properly dispose of
waste, as well as recycle materials and energy. Our waste
management activities also cover proper waste storage at
our sites, which is also crucial to occupational health and
safety.
When it comes to waste management, Merck utilizes a
Group-wide environmental management system that is
certified to ISO 14001. In the course of the ISO 14001
certification process as well as internal EHS audits, our
waste management system is examined at both
headquarters as well as at the relevant sites.
EQ, the Merck Group function in charge of environmental
protection, bears overall responsibility for waste
management
(see
Environmental
management
on p. 106). At sites outside of Germany, EHS managers
are responsible for implementing measures and receive
regular training from EQ. As part of the annual ISO 14001
audit of our environmental management system, EHS
managers and site management are educated on waste
prevention and recycling.
With our Group-wide “Waste Management” standard, we
have implemented a uniform waste management
framework for all Merck sites. This standard defines
organizational structures and processes and is regularly
updated. The type and quantity of waste is logged and
documented at all sites and communicated to the EQ
Group function.

Waste output in 2013 and 2014
The Merck Group produced more waste in 2014 than
in the previous year, which rose from 161,000 metric
tons in 2013 to 229,000 metric tons in 2014. Waste from
construction and renovation projects accounted for the
majority of the waste (2013: 24%; 2014: 47%), stemming

ENVIRONMENT | Waste management

in particular from the remodeling of our Global
headquarters in Darmstadt. Merck disposed of 108,000
metric tons of the total waste produced in 2014, and
121,000 metric tons were recycled/recovered (material
recycling plus waste to energy).
For the most part, waste is externally recycled or disposed
of (2013: approx. 85%; 2014: 91%). Being the one who
generates the waste, Merck is ultimately responsible for
its final disposal. As such, service providers are chosen
with extreme care. The terms and conditions for disposal
are contractually stipulated, and service providers are
required to prove that the waste is properly disposed of.
Merck regularly audits these providers, especially if they
are involved with handling hazardous waste.
Merck continuously works to optimize chemical processes
in order to prevent, reduce and recycle waste. Among
other measures, solvents are treated and recycled.
For instance, in the 2013-2014 period, we started
recycling heptane, a chemical that accumulates during
the purification of liquid crystals. In this process, heptane
is utilized as a solvent to separate mixtures. We collect
the heptane, have an external recycling company treat it,
and then reuse the purified solvent in our processes. Our
recycling rate is over 85%, which is enabling us to lower
our heptane consumption by 1,900 metric tons per year
and thus reduce our total waste. This is simultaneously
leading to significant improvement in the carbon
footprint of the process.
Merck Millipore uses methanol for the production of
filtration membranes. While the majority of the methanol
is treated on site and then reused, the remainder cannot
be reused in the process. Luckily, methanol constitutes
an important raw material for municipal wastewater
treatment, and Merck Millipore's remaining reclaimed
methanol is now being utilized by a local wastewater
treatment plant. You can find more information on our
website.

Resources

Water consumption

For our business activities, we require energy, water, and
raw materials, along with numerous other materials,
which we mostly utilize for production purposes. Given
that these resources are becoming ever scarcer and more
costly, we consider it important to utilize them efficiently.
We strive to not only cut costs, but also to preserve the
environment and conserve resources.

In its production processes, Merck uses water primarily for
cooling, as process water, and for exhaust air purification.
For the most part, we draw groundwater from our own
wells and drinking water from the local water supply.
In 2013, we utilized a total of 9.6 million cubic meters
of freshwater, with 11.1 million cubic meters consumed
in 2014. The water utilized in 2014 consisted of 57%
groundwater from our own wells, 41% water from the
public water supply, and 2% surface water. No sensitive
water sources were impacted by Merck's water intake.

We have therefore implemented programs and processes
throughout the Merck Group in order to continually make
resource management and consumption more efficient.
This is a core component of our operations and a
prerequisite for maintaining our competitive edge.

Energy use
In 2014, Merck utilized 1,622 GWh of energy in total,
particularly in production, which represents a slight
increase compared to 2013 (1,566 GWh). Our energy
management processes are described in detail under
Climate protection on p. 109.

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

In the 2013-2014 period, we used public databases such
as the WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas and the Water
Risk Filter to determine which of our sites are located
in areas of high water stress and consume more than
30,000 cubic meters of water per year. Three of our sites
- located in Mexico, Spain and Pakistan - meet these
criteria. Furthermore, at our facility in Savannah, Georgia
(USA) we identified an increased risk to local water
availability. Within the scope of their ISO 14001
environmental management systems, these four sites will
be focusing on sustainable water management, setting
for instance water targets.

115

Where expedient, we also plan to help sites in areas of
moderate water stress implement more efficient water
management systems as well. At the end of 2013, we
therefore created a best practice sharing platform for
water management projects, which we will be
continuously expanding.
At Merck, cooling water for production processes is
utilized in both closed/open circuit systems and in oncethrough cooling systems; in some processes, production
wastewater is treated and reused. We recycled a total
of 16.6 million cubic meters of water in 2013, and
16.0 million cubic meters in 2014.

Material consumption
From the very start of the process development phase, we
focus on making the processes efficient and minimizing
the resulting waste. We furthermore ensure that the
materials utilized pose as little danger to people and the
environment as possible.
In particular, Merck uses production materials such as
chemical and pharmaceutical raw materials. In addition to
these, we also employ operating supplies and packaging
materials such as folding boxes, glass bottles and
ampules.
The purchased materials that go directly into our
pharmaceuticals and chemicals are generally quantified
by weight. We utilized a total of 209 metric kilotons of
these materials in 2013 and 176 metric kilotons in 2014.
These figures do not include packaging materials and
operating supplies such as energy or lubricants.
The portfolio of our Merck Millipore business features
numerous devices and tools whose production requires
semi-finished and finished materials, such as fully
assembled electronic components or device casing. We
log these by the piece.

Water
At Merck, water is used in production primarily for
cooling, as process water, or for exhaust air purification.
After being utilized, the water may contain eutrophicating
substances, heavy metals, or active pharmaceutical

ENVIRONMENT | Water

ingredients. The treatment of this wastewater, and thus
the prevention of environmental pollution, is a
fundamental part of our corporate environmental
protection activities worldwide.
EQ, the Merck Group function in charge of environmental
protection, bears overall responsibility for water
protection (see Environmental management on p. 106). At
sites outside of Germany, local EHS managers are tasked
with implementing measures and receive regular training
from EQ.
Our Group standard "Water Protection" defines the
processes and responsibilities required for clean
wastewater in the Merck Group, and also covers the hiring
of third parties to handle it. This standard is derived from
our obligations under the Responsible Care® initiative. It
requires all sites to estimate and assess the specific risks
and effects of wastewater using tools such as
ecotoxicological data. The standard also requires risk
assessments to take a site's wastewater treatment plants
into account. Furthermore, each individual site must
develop and implement a water pollution response plan
that features measures to prevent wastewater or reduce
its volume. The plan must also define the documentation
process for wastewater volume, points of origin, and local
limits. The standard provides strict guidelines for
wastewater treatment via external service providers. For
instance, the service provider agreement must stipulate
the wastewater quality to be attained - if not already
specified by law - as well as the responsibilities involved.
Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) audits are
conducted to verify whether our "Water Protection"
standard is being properly implemented. In the
2013-2014 period, 57 internal audits were conducted by
the Environment, Health and Safety (EQ-E) unit, and 18
audits were performed by external ISO 14001 certifiers.
These audits examine water-related aspects in proportion
to how relevant they are to the individual site - for
instance, water is a bigger issue at production sites than
at administrative locations.
In 2014, Merck produced 10.1 million cubic meters of
wastewater. At our Darmstadt site in Germany, the
discharge of purified wastewater into the Darmbach (a
stream in the Darmstadt area) accounted for over 5% of

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

ENVIRONMENT | Biodiversity

116

the average annual volume of this body of water, which
is permissible by law. The discharge did not have any
significant impact on the Darmbach, or the associated
habitats. In the 2013-2014 period, Merck did not
discharge significant amounts of purified wastewater into
other bodies of water either.

Active pharmaceutical ingredients in the
environment
Our standard "Water Protection" stipulates that the
amount of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in our
wastewater should be kept to a minimum. Appropriate

measures are defined and implemented on a site-by-site
basis. For instance, production and purification processes
are being optimized at our sites in order to maximally
reduce API concentrations in the wastewater.
All our pharmaceutical production sites have wastewater
treatment plants. At these sites, we regularly take readings
to assess the amount of APIs being discharged. For these
assessments, we apply the predicted no effect
concentration (PNEC) values. If the concentrations are
below the PNEC, then the substance is not expected to
adversely impact the environment. In the 2013-2014
period, we did not exceed these limits.

Biodiversity
Since the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)
entered into force in 1993, the concept of biodiversity has
included diversity within species, between species and of
ecosystems. Opened for signature at the United Nations
Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED)
in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, this treaty has the following
three main goals: conservation of biological diversity,
sustainable use of its components, and fair and equitable
sharing of benefits arising from genetic resources.
The loss of biodiversity is one of the greatest challenges
of our time. Ecosystems provide us with services and
resources such as sufficient quantities of good-quality
water that are absolutely essential to our business
operations worldwide. We therefore consider it extremely
important to protect biodiversity and have put numerous

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

environmental protection measures in place, all of which
work indirectly to safeguard biodiversity. For instance, we
have implemented measures to assess and reduce
pharmaceutical residues in wastewater.
Our production sites are located in established industrial
and commercial zones; they are located neither inside of
nor within 10 kilometers of IUCN Category I or Category
II protected areas, which are set aside to safeguard
biodiversity. Category I includes strict nature reserves and
wilderness areas in which human visitation, use and
impacts are strictly controlled and limited, while Category
II includes national parks. In order to prevent substances
that could negatively impact biodiversity from leaking
into the environment, we design and operate our facilities
according to strict Group-wide safety and environmental
requirements. For instance, in our Group-wide standards
we have defined measures for processing waste and

117

ENVIRONMENT | Biodiversity

production wastewater (see Resources on p. 114). We
have furthermore implemented a Group-wide program
called EDISON in order to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions.
We improve the habitats for plants and animals at our
sites, for instance by increasing the amount of unsealed
surface area. This is, however, not always possible since
we seal certain surfaces to protect them from any leakage
that may occur. In 1995, we developed a green open space
concept for our Darmstadt site, and around 30% of the
premises have now been greened. The green areas are
designed to improve the functionality of the production
areas without degrading the ecological value of existing
open areas. In 2008, we signed an agreement with the city
of Darmstadt that established the framework to increase
the role of nature conservation in the industrial use of
our site, as well as better integrate the site into its urban
surroundings. The stipulated planning guidelines require,
for example, an increase in the percentage of native plants
on the site.
When planning new sites and facilities, we consider
environmental aspects such as aeration, land-use
structures that contribute to a favorable microclimate,
and energy-efficient construction concepts. For instance,
we conducted a biodiversity study when planning the
expansion of our site in Corsier-sur-Vevey, Switzerland.
To protect the bordering alpine meadows, we developed a
landscape plan in which the meadows are tended to by a
local farmer.
When we acquire new sites, we investigate their
environmental situation, taking into consideration
information from public sources such as neighbors and
non-governmental organizations (NGOs). We assume
responsibility for pollution we have caused and
investigate our sites before selling them.

Managing our social engagement
Merck sees itself as part of the community, not only at
its individual locations, but also at a global level. Within
the scope of our business activities, we play an important
role in the vicinity of our sites. We create jobs and invest
in the training and welfare of our employees. We source
goods and services from many local companies. On top of
this, we also support charitable initiatives, often doing so
in partnership with our employees.
Our social responsibility activities are primarily focused on
areas in which we have specific expertise stemming from
our businesses. We therefore engage in health promotion
projects and environmental protection, while also
fostering cultural activities and education initiatives. We
provide disaster relief in emergency situations, especially
in those regions in which we operate.
To increase the effectiveness and impact of our projects,
we focus our resources on three global projects:
• In the Merck Praziquantel Donation Program, we are
partnering with the World Health Organization
(WHO) to combat the worm disease schistosomiasis in
African school children.
• The Global Pharma Health Fund is a charitable
initiative funded by Merck to fight counterfeit
medicines in developing and emerging countries.
• The Deutsche Philharmonie Merck is the musical
ambassador of our company.
Our subsidiaries are also engaged in local projects and
invest in the communities in which we operate, which
also serves to secure our future. When it comes to
choosing projects, we have defined criteria that are used
by our local subsidiaries to decide which initiatives to
pursue. The Public Affairs & Corporate Responsibility
Group function coordinates and implements global
projects and regularly provides progress reports to the
Executive Board.
We conduct annual global surveys to ascertain the
regional scope of our social engagement, to determine
our goals and focus, and to track our progress. In 2014,
Merck spent a total of € 50.8 million on its social
engagement activities, with € 46.2 million in 2013. Of the

SOCIETY | Management

total monetary and non-monetary donations made by our
subsidiaries in 2014, 61% (2013: 63%) went to Emerging
Markets (Latin America and Asia, excluding Japan), 37%
(2013: 36%) to Europe, and 2% (2013: 1%) to North
America and the Rest of World region.
These figures do not include activities that primarily serve
to market our products.

Fighting schistosomiasis
Over 232 million people in Africa suffer from
schistosomiasis, a tropical worm disease. It is estimated
that more than 200,000 people die each year as a result
of this chronic parasitic condition, which makes
schistosomiasis one of the most devastating neglected
tropical diseases (NTD) in terms of public health burden
and economic impact. Schistosomiasis is prevalent
primarily in the tropical and subtropical areas of subSaharan Africa, and is considered to be the third highest
burden among Neglected Tropical Diseases. In these
regions, the vast majority of the population has no access
to clean water and sanitary installations, which also
contributes to the spread of the disease.
Schistosomiasis is caused by flatworms and is spread
through stagnant water. People become infected by the
worm larvae in the water while bathing, fishing, playing,
washing their clothes, or working on agricultural land.
These larvae penetrate human skin and enter the blood
vessels, where they grow into adult worms. The female's
eggs infest inner organs such as the intestines, bladder,
spleen, or liver and often cause severe inflammation.
Symptoms include severe abdominal pain, diarrhea and
bloody urine or stool. The infection rate is especially high
among children, and the chronic symptoms that result are
particularly serious. For example, schistosomiasis stunts
growth and contributes to malnutrition, causing learning
disabilities and anemia in children.
Praziquantel, which was developed by Merck in the 1970s
as part of a research collaboration, is the only active
ingredient to treat all forms of schistosomiasis and is a
well-tolerated drug. Since 1983, it has been on the Model
List of Essential medicines published by the World Health
Organization (WHO).

Managing and monitoring

Research

In 2007, we launched the Merck Praziquantel Donation
Program (MPDP) in partnership with WHO. This project was
originally intended to run for a period of 10 years, but Merck
has decided to continue the fight until the parasitic disease
schistosomiasis has been eliminated in Africa. In order to
reach this goal, we pledged in 2012 to significantly expand
our donation by a tenfold increase of up to 250 million
praziquantel tablets per year. Our efforts to fight
schistosomiasis reflect the United Nations Millennium
Development Goals as well as the WHO strategic NTD
roadmap; they are also part of the London Declaration, an
initiative to fight neglected tropical diseases launched by the
Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2012.

Within the scope of a public-private partnership (PPP), Merck
is researching a formulation of praziquantel for small children.
Praziquantel tablets in their current form are suitable for adults
and children over the age of six; for children younger than six,
it is currently not possible to properly treat the disease.

In close collaboration, WHO and Merck each provide their
respective expertise to the MPDP. Merck donates Cesol® 600mg
praziquantel tablets to WHO. We produce quality-assured
praziquantel and ship the tablets to the respective countries,
where WHO in turn manages, monitors, and documents the
local distribution of the tablets and works with local authorities
to administer the treatment at schools. WHO is also responsible
for supplying local data on morbidity rates and treatment
frequency in the countries in which the MPDP has been rolled
out. The data for each country can be found in the WHO PCT
databank which is the global repository of preventive
chemotherapy treatments. A steering committee consisting of
representatives from WHO and Merck convenes twice a year in
order to review the program's progress and decide on its future
course. This committee also advises on the allocation of tablets
for each country.

Merck supports an awareness program at schools in Africa
that uses comic booklets and posters to explain the causes of
schistosomiasis, teaching pupils how to prevent the disease.
Following the success of the pilot projects, the program was
extended in 2013 to Senegal and Malawi. In addition to 75,000
informational posters on schistosomiasis, we provided one
million educational booklets in total; 250,000 of these went to
Malawi and the rest to Senegal. In collaboration with WHO,
we are funding the translation of the booklets that are already
available in English and French into Swahili, Arabic and
Portuguese.

Since the start of the program, Merck has donated over
200 million tablets. To date, more than 54 million people have
been treated, mainly school-aged children. In 2013, Merck
donated around 50 million tablets for twelve African countries.
We produced around 75 million tablets in 2014, more than
72 million of which were supplied to 20 African countries by
the year's end, a collaborative effort with the World Health
Organization.

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

As part of the donation program expansion, Merck is also
working to optimize the formulation of the drug. For instance,
our researchers are also working on a film coating to make
praziquantel tablets easier to swallow as well as more resistant
to long transport times.

Educating people

During the 2013-2014 period, Merck also helped the Uraha
Foundation Germany set up a local radio station in the north of
Malawi. Radio Dinosaur has been broadcasting since the end of
2014; it provides information on politics, environmental issues,
history, culture, and health, doing so in the local languages of
KyaNgonde and ChiTumbuka. Among other activities, Merck
is funding the production of broadcasts that educate people
about schistosomiasis.

Fighting schistosomiasis worldwide
In May 2014, Merck called for different NTD constituencies to
form the Global Schistosomiasis Alliance (GSA). This initiative
focuses and coordinates efforts to address remaining gaps and
challenges in order to meet the schistosomiasis elimination
target worldwide. In December 2014, Merck organized the first
meeting of the GSA at the UN Conference Centre in Addis
Ababa, Ethiopia. During this roundtable, the key founding

SOCIETY | Counterfeit pharmaceuticals

partners of the GSA introduced themselves to an expert
audience from all over the world. Besides Merck, these
founding partners include, among others, the Bill and Melinda

Gates Foundation, the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, the
United States Agency for International Development, and
World Vision International.

Detecting counterfeit
pharmaceuticals
Substandard medicines and counterfeits pose a deadly
hazard. Interpol estimates that up to 30% of all medicines
in developing nations are either illegal, counterfeit or of
inferior quality. The Global Pharma Health Fund (GPHF),
a non-profit initiative funded by Merck, has therefore
taken up the fight against counterfeit medicines. With
the Minilab developed by the GPHF, counterfeit medicines
can be detected quickly, easily and cheaply. Two suitcases
each weighing around 30 kilograms contain a large
number of test methods that state healthcare workers in
developing countries can use to inspect pharmaceuticals.
Reference samples are used to test the identity and
concentration of 75 active ingredients in total, including
anti-malarials, antibiotics, analgesics, and antipyretics.
The GPHF has specifically developed the Minilab for use
in regions with a simple infrastructure. The rapid analyses
can be performed even without lab equipment using
normal drinking water. There is currently no other product
like it. The majority of the countries where Minilabs are
used are located in Africa and Asia. Since 1998, the GPHF

has supplied 685 Minilabs to 90 countries at cost. In 2013
and 2014, they donated 113 Minilabs in total. These
compact labs are utilized by national health agencies,
often in collaboration with governmental drug safety
laboratories. They are also frequently a key component
of multilateral health projects in partnership with
organizations such as UNICEF or the Global Fund. In
addition to selling them at cost, which is handled by a
distribution agent, the GPHF and Merck will also
sometimes donate the test kits. In the 2013-2014 period,
25 Minilabs were donated by the GPHF and 13 by Merck.
We participate in external research with the aim of
increasing the number of medicines that can be tested.
In 2013 and 2014, the GPHF developed testing methods
for 12 additional pharmaceuticals and updated the user
manual accordingly. The GPHF offers training courses in
order to familiarize local users with the testing procedures
and ensure that the Minilabs are utilized in a professional
manner. In 2013, four courses were offered in Germany,
Kenya, Mozambique, and Myanmar, which were attended
by 70 participants in total. In 2014, the GPHF trained
60 participants total in Ethiopia, Germany, Kenya, and
Nigeria.

Deutsche Philharmonie Merck
Merck has a long tradition of cultural commitment. We
consider classical music in particular to be the universal
language that brings people together; as such, it is an
important part of our culture that is represented by the
Deutsche Philharmonie Merck, our musical ambassador.
The concerts of this professional ensemble are highly
popular, with more than 26,000 people attending them
per year. They represent an integral part of the cultural life
in the vicinity of our Global headquarters in Darmstadt,
Germany. Special events for children and adolescents as
well as partnerships with schools are intended to
encourage young people to develop a taste for classical
music. In both 2013 and 2014, around 50 children
participated in our annual orchestra workshop, rehearsing
and performing with the philharmonic members.
Furthermore, the Deutsche Philharmonie Merck gave four
"cushion concerts", thereby reaching around 800 children.
The Deutsche Philharmonie Merck regularly invites
international ensembles to Darmstadt while itself also
touring internationally. In July 2013, the philharmonic
orchestra gave a concert at the International Jazz Festival

CORPORATE RESPONISIBILITY REPORT 2014

in Istanbul. In 2014, the orchestra gave a charity concert
in the United Arab Emirates (Dubai) to benefit patients
with multiple sclerosis.

Community engagement at our
sites across the globe
Health, environment and culture are key focal areas of
our social engagement at both the global and local level.
In accordance with the Merck Values, all subsidiaries of
the Merck Group assume responsibility for their local
communities. They foster an open dialogue with their
neighbors and other community representatives and
therefore know where Merck can make the most valuable
contributions. Sustainable engagement means that
projects have a long-term scope, and that we generally
oversee and support them over a period of multiple years.
Our subsidiaries were involved in 136 projects in 2014
(2013: 125). Take for example the Erbitux® China Patients
Aid Program (ECPAP) launched in 2012. In this program,
we work with the Beijing Red Cross Foundation to provide
Erbitux® free-of-charge to low-income patients with
colorectal cancer. Over 3,100 patients have participated
in the program to date. Other examples include running

a hospital on the island of Baba Bhit in Pakistan and
a wellness center in Jharkhand. Merck employees also
support and institute numerous initiatives. For instance,
in the School Water Project in China, our Merck Millipore
employees taught elementary school pupils about
environmental issues and clean water.
Merck grants and promotes four literary prizes worldwide.
Since 1964, we have been sponsoring the renowned
Johann Heinrich Merck Award for Literary Critique and
Essay, which is presented by the German Academy for
Language and Poetry at its annual autumn conference.
The award, which comes with a € 20,000 prize, went to
publicist Carolin Emcke in 2014. For 12 years, Merck has
been sponsoring the Premio Letterario Merck in Italy. This
award is worth € 10,000 and recognizes authors who
build bridges between literature and science, thereby
making them accessible to a wide audience. In 2014, the
award went to Carlo Rovelli, an Italian physicist, and to
Francisco Gonzales-Crussi, a Mexican physician and
writer. In India, Merck collaborates with the GoetheInstitut Calcutta to present the Merck Tagore Award,
which is worth 500,000 Indian rupees (around € 7,200);
this literary prize is granted every two years to authors
who have made a distinctive contribution to the cultural
exchange between Germany and India. In April 2014, the
award went to Professor Pramod Talgeri, Vice Chancellor
of the India International Multiversity. In October 2014,
Merck and the Goethe Institut Tokyo presented the firstever Merck Kakehashi Literature Prize. Worth a total of
€ 20,000, this award is granted to contemporary works
by German authors that are made accessible to a wider
readership in Japan. The prize went to German author
Arno Schmidt for his book "Seelandschaft mit
Pocahontas" (Lake Scenery with Pocahontas) and to the
book's Japanese translator, Jun Wada.

medical education and capacity in the fight against ebola.
At universities in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, the
first set of seminars were held for aspiring doctors and
pharmacists, part of the Merck Capacity Advancement
program. In addition to this, Merck also provided disaster
aid for the victims of Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines,
the earthquake in Ludian, China, and the flooding in
Pakistan.
More examples of Merck’s engagement at our sites across
the globe can be found on our website.

In Brazil, we sponsored projects to help integrate
disadvantaged children and adolescents, enabling them to
learn skills such as playing a musical instrument.
In the 2013-2014 period, we extensively revised our
processes for and approach to strategic disaster relief. The
Public Affairs & Corporate Responsibility Group function
partners with representatives from our businesses and
subsidiaries to steer our efforts to help disaster victims. In

FACTS AND FIGURES

Facts and figures
The report profile specifies the reporting framework,
shows how data was collected, and describes how the
content of the report was determined. We use indicators
to facilitate comparison of our ecological, economic and
social performance. The figures have been subjected to a
limited assurance audit. We have compiled our goals into
a single overview. The GRI Index documents Merck's
fulfillment of the requirements of the GRI guidelines on
sustainability reporting. In the "Communication on
Progress for the Global Compact", we describe the
implementation of the Compact's ten principles. We have
issued a statement of compliance with the German
Sustainability Code.

Report profile
This is Merck's seventh Corporate Responsibility (CR)
Report. We have a long history of reporting on issues
pertaining to our corporate responsibility - a tradition
that began in 1993 with the publication of environmental
reports. In 2003, we published our first full Corporate
Responsibility Report detailing how we fulfill our
obligation to society and have since done so every two
years. Our goal is to create transparency and inform
stakeholders about our activities and successes, as well as
challenges that we face. At the same time, our CR Report
also documents the progress we've made in implementing
the principles of the United Nations Global Compact
("Communication on Progress") while also meeting the
criteria of the Sustainability Code (DNK) established by the
German Federal Government. We have issued a statement
of compliance with the German Sustainability Code.

Reporting framework
This CR Report covers the 2013 and 2014 fiscal years
and pertains to the entire Merck Group with legal entities
across 66 countries. This report also covers the activities
of AZ Electronic Materials, a company that we acquired
during this period. As needed, we specifically indicate
when the information provided diverges from this
reporting framework.

impact as well as the number of employees there. LION's
scope of consolidation therefore covers all Merck Group
sites that have a relevant impact on the environment.
The occupational health and safety indicators reflect the
inclusion of the new AZ Electronic Materials production
sites since they were incorporated into our data collection
process in 2014, which now covers more than 95% of all
employees.
To improve data quality, we help our sites optimize their
data collection processes as well as the associated quality
control procedures. The processes and the reported data
are reviewed by EQ through measures such as internal
EHS audits.
The data on employees and social engagement pertains
to the entire Merck Group. Employee master data is
continually updated in an SAP-based database. Other
employee data - such as info pertaining to core ILO
standards - and data on social engagement are queried on
an annual basis.
Some employee data is only disclosed for the sites in
Darmstadt, Gernsheim and Grafing (all in Germany),
which employed around 24% of the Merck Group
workforce in 2014. We indicate accordingly when
referring only to this restricted set of data.

Data collection and consolidation systems

Determining report content

Since 2005, we have been using the Group-wide Location
Information Online System (LION) to collect
environmental data as well as occupational health and
safety data, which is input locally at the individual sites
and approved after being reviewed. In order to ensure
that the data is highly reliable, the Merck Group function
Environment Health Safety Security Quality (EQ)
furthermore checks the data’s plausibility.

We use the results of our materiality analysis as well as
input from stakeholders to inform our CR Reports, which
are aligned to the internationally recognized guidelines of
the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) as well as its principle
of completeness. This report was drafted in accordance
with the requirements of the GRI G4 guidelines and meets
the criteria for a "comprehensive" application level.

We compile environmentally relevant performance
indicators from all Merck Group production sites, as well
as from relevant warehouse and research sites. In
assessing the relevance of these warehouse and research
sites, we take into account the sites' environmental

We have furthermore taken into account the
requirements of the capital market for assessing
companies' contributions to sustainability.
In 2014, we performed a materiality analysis to determine
the CR issues of relevance to Merck. As part of this
process, we conducted an international online stakeholder
survey in summer 2014, and hosted an internal

materiality workshop in Darmstadt in autumn 2014. We
have derived the content of this CR report from the results
of this materiality assessment. This report addresses all
issues identified as material. Detailed information on the
materiality analysis as well as the materiality matrix can
be found under Materiality analysis on p. 27.
The Executive Board of the Merck Group has reviewed and
approved this report.

External audit
KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft has audited
the annual financial statements and management report
of the Merck Group and issued an unqualified opinion.
Furthermore, after undergoing a limited assurance audit,
Merck has obtained an independent audit certificate for
non-financial key performance indicators.

* The figures for 2011 and 2012 have been recalculated based on the reporting date and therefore now differ from the figures reported in prior
years.

The table contains unadjusted turnover rates, calculated as follows: number of separations*100/number of employees as
of Dec. 31.
The unadjusted turnover rate excludes employees who leave due to parental leave or a long-term illness, as well as
employees who are transitioning to the non-working phase of partial retirement.

Merck records the new employee turnover rate over the course of 18 months because 12 months is too short a time to
become truly familiar with a new position, especially when it comes to management positions.
The turnover rate is calculated as follows: (Number of new hires within the preceding 18 months who left Merck within
this period)/(average number of employees in the preceding 18 months)*100.
The figures exclude employees who leave due to parental leave or a long-term illness, as well as employees who are
transitioning to the non-working phase of partial retirement.

* Figures retroactively adjusted.
** from 2013 onwards: incl. supervised workers

Merck employees have been included in the calculation of the indicators as well as supervised employees of external
companies. Independent contractors have not been taken into account.
Using the LTIR, we record work-related accidents of Merck employees that involve at least one day of missed work. A
work-related accident is an injury that results from the type of work, in the course of doing said work, and that has
no internal cause (cumulative trauma). Work-related accidents are considered relevant if they occur on the premises, on
business trips, during a transport accident, in the course of external influences (e.g. natural disasters), or due to criminal
acts involving personal injury. Commuting accidents and accidents during company sporting activities are not included.
First-aid incidents are generally not included in the LTIR since these usually do not result in more than one day of missed
work.
We have set ourselves the goal of reducing the LTIR to 2.5 by 2015. In 2014, by means of targeted accident prevention
measures we again outperformed this goal as we did in the previous three years, achieving an LTIR of 1.8.
For Merck KGaA (24% of the employees of the Merck Group) we report work-related illnesses if these have been
diagnosed and verified by a physician. In the reporting period, one case of work-induced illness was recorded. We do not
keep track of the number of work-related illnesses throughout the entire Merck Group.
We have defined the LTIR as the key indicator for the Merck Group. Therefore, we do not publish any other indicators
such as workplace accidents, lost days or days of absence. The LTIR is not broken down by gender as this differentiation
is not relevant to our strategic planning.

% of employees who receive a performance and

by employee category

* The fluctuations in participant numbers by employee category can be explained by Merck’s acquisition of AZ Electronic Materials, among other
factors. By the 2014 reporting date, the majority of AZ employees had been classified according to our grading system. However, because they
were not integrated until the end of 2014, they had not yet taken part in Merck’s Performance Management Process.
** The 2013 data in the above table is based on a reporting date of March 12, 2014.
*** The 2014 data in the above table is based on a reporting date of March 2, 2015.

Regular feedback and employee performance evaluations are essential to a systematic development process. Our globally
uniform Performance and Talent Management Process requires annual feedback meetings and performance assessments
for all employees rated Global Grade 10 and up in our position grading system. Apart from evaluating employee
performance, this helps us to identify individual development opportunities.
When it comes to applying this process, our individual subsidiaries can decide for themselves whether to include
employees rated below Global Grade 10. In Germany, all permanent employees have been participating in
the Performance and Talent Management Process since 2013. In 2014, around 31,395 employees worldwide (including
non-exempt employees in Germany) were involved in the process (2013: approx. 27,600 employees). The Performance
and Talent Management Process is coordinated via the HR Suite IT system.
As of 2013, we changed the table to reflect only the performance evaluations that are documented in the HR Suite
IT system. For these evaluations, we can provide details on the Global Grade as well as gender of the participating
employees.
For all other employees not participating electronically in this globally uniform process, other methods of performance
assessment are available. In 2014, 97% of our employees took part in a performance and development evaluation, the
same percentage as in 2013.

Depending on the legal, economic and fiscal circumstances prevailing in each country, different retirement benefit

service and salaries of the employees. Pension obligations of the Merck Group include both defined benefit and defined
contribution plans and comprise both obligations from current pensions and accrued benefits for pensions payable in
the future. In the Merck Group, defined benefit plans are funded and unfunded. Provisions also contain other postemployment benefits, such as accrued future health care costs for retirees in the United States (see our Annual Report

the calendar year, but who had not returned by Dec. 31.
** Since parental leave can be taken for a period ranging from one month to three years, it is possible for employees to be recorded across a period
of up to four calendar years. This explains why the number of employees on parental leave exceeds the number of employees who have a right
to it.

* In line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, for all previous years (up to the 2006 baseline) the greenhouse gas emissions have been calculated
based on the current corporate structure of the reporting year and retroactively adjusted for acquisitions (e.g. AZ Group in 2014) or divestments
of (parts of) companies, or for changes in emission factors (portfolio-adjusted).
** Baseline for our emission targets is 2006.
eq = equivalent

Our response to the Carbon Disclosure Project contains a detailed description of our calculation methods. We have
included the following gases into our calculation of direct and indirect CO2eq emissions:
• Direct CO2 emissions: CO2, HFCs, PFCs; CH4/N2O negligible; SF6/NF3 not available.
• Indirect CO2 emissions: CO2.
In 2014, we emitted 0.046 kg of CO2eq per euro of sales. This calculation includes data from the AZ Group and assumes
that first-time consolidation had already taken place as of January 1, 2014 (further information can be found in the
Annual Report 2014).

** Light and heavy fuel oil, liquified petroleum gas (LPG), diesel and gasoline.

At our sites in Billerica, Massachusetts (USA), Bedford, Massachusetts (USA), Molsheim (France), Tel Aviv (Israel), Rome
(Italy) and Ciudad de Guatemala (Guatemala), we use photovoltaics to produce power.
Merck currently only records purchased secondary energy – this is primarily electricity and, to a lesser extent, heat/steam/
cold. Details on the local energy mix, including the respective percentage of primary energy, renewable energy, etc. are
currently not available. Data on local energy efficiency in electricity or heat generation are currently not available either.
Merck production sites are located in countries with a widely varying energy mix. Our Darmstadt and Gernsheim sites in
Germany have a high energy consumption, representing 40% of our Group-wide total. At these sites, fossil energy (coal,
gas, etc.) accounts for approx. 57%, nuclear energy approx. 17% and renewable energies approx. 26% of the energy mix.
Renewable energies account for a higher share in electricity generation at production sites in Switzerland, with nuclear
energy taking the lead in France and Japan. Based on an estimated global energy efficiency of 37% for the conversion
and distribution of generated electricity, this results in a primary energy consumption of 1,260 GWh for 2014. Based
on an estimated global energy efficiency of 85% for heat/steam/cold, this results in a primary energy consumption of
100 GWh for 2014. This gives a total primary energy consumption of 1,360 GWh for 2014. (The calculation is based on
factors stated in the "Handbuch für betriebliches Energiemanagement - Systematisch Energiekosten senken" ("Manual
for energy management in practice - Systematically reducing energy costs") published by DENA, 12/2012.
In 2014, Merck's energy intensity relative to sales totaled 0.141 kWh/€. This calculation includes data from the AZ Group
and assumes that first-time consolidation had already taken place as of January 1, 2014 (further information can be
found in the Annual Report 2014).

The sharp decrease in total water use in 2013 is attributable to the closure of the Merck Serono site in Geneva,
Switzerland. The site utilized surface water from Lake Geneva for cooling and heating purposes and used lake water to
cover a large portion of the site's energy requirements.
Our water usage increased in 2014 because this was the first time that the manufacturing sites of the AZ Group acquired in 2014 - were incorporated into our reporting. These figures do not include the ground water that we utilize in
relation to safety measures at the Gernsheim site in Germany. Here, the water is fed back directly into natural circulation.

The wastewater volume includes indirect discharge into both public and Merck-owned wastewater treatment plants, as
well as direct discharge (such as rainwater and cooling water). Our water usage increased in 2014 because this was the
first time that the manufacturing sites of the AZ Group - acquired in 2014 - were incorporated into our reporting.
Wastewater from the neighboring municipality of Biebesheim is also treated at the wastewater treatment plant at the
Gernsheim site in Germany. The communal wastewater from Biebesheim is included in the wastewater volume as well as
in the emissions stated in the table.
Emissions are determined partially based on measurements and partially based on calculations or estimates. Only some
sites are required to measure individual parameters.
