Dear readers,
2015 was by far the most successful year for HeidelbergCement since
the financial crisis. This success shows that long-term thinking and
responsible action pay off — especially in times that are characterised
by a wide variety of economic and political challenges.
For us, sustainable corporate governance involves reconciling our profit
targets with the need to safeguard our future viability. By taking on
responsibility for the environment and society and reducing the
negative effects of our activities as much as possible, we are also
minimising the risks for our business. We are also contributing to sustainable construction through product and process innovations. We
do this using a holistic approach that is valid for all of our business
lines and Group areas. This approach is being implemented and put
into practice at the more than 2,300 locations where we operate.
Our sustainability strategy therefore focuses on local responsibility —
towards our employees and our neighbours as well as towards the
environment. And we take on this responsibility in more than 40 countries all over the world.
Dr. Bernd Scheifele
Chairman of the Managing Board

Occupational safety — the top priority at HeidelbergCement
Occupational safety plays a key role at HeidelbergCement. In 2015 we
tightened our corporate guidelines and once again highlighted occupational health and safety as a leadership responsibility for all levels
of management. In addition, we introduced a number of binding rules
that apply to all employees and contractors. Even though accident
frequency declined substantially at all of our business lines, severe
accidents, sometimes involving fatalities, still occur. We must and we
will further intensify our efforts in the area of occupational safety in
order to reduce the number of accidents permanently.

Climate protection: New technologies for capturing and
using CO2
Another focus last year was on climate protection and the prevention of CO2 emissions. During the reporting year, HeidelbergCement
greatly intensified its efforts to develop technologies for the use of
CO2 as a raw material. To this end, the company also formed promising new partnerships. This has enabled us to take the lead in this
area in the cement industry. Thanks to our major achievements in climate protection and climate reporting in 2015, the Carbon Disclosure
Project (CDP) also honoured us as one of the five best companies
from the energy and raw materials sector in Germany, Austria and
Switzerland.
Compared to the figure for 1990, we reduced our CO2 emissions by
22% to 606 kilograms per tonne of cement. As a result, we barely
missed our ambitious reduction target of 23%. Moreover, we have set
ourselves a new target for the next 15 years. For 2030, our aim is to
further reduce the emissions by around 20 million tonnes of CO2 per
year compared with the level of 1990. And despite the low prices for
coal and petroleum coke, we kept our use of secondary fuels stable
at 21%.
During the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) in
Paris in December 2015, HeidelbergCement and 17 other cement
companies underscored their commitment to climate protection by
signing the Low Carbon Technology Partnership initiative (LCTPi) that
was launched by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD).

projects. We also addressed water management issues and established a reporting system for the cement business line. In this report,
we are publishing our water consumption figures for the first time.
Innovative solutions for future challenges
Society and the economy are continuing to face major challenges. As
a leading manufacturer of construction materials, we can help overcome these challenges with innovative building materials and efficient
production processes. Big synergies will also be generated in these
two areas by our acquisition of our competitor Italcementi, which will
be finalised in 2016. This Italian construction material manufacturer’s
state-of-the-art production facilities and extensive research activities
will give our sustainability performance a further boost at the product
and process levels.
As we integrate Italcementi, we will also adapt our sustainability strategy to current economic, social and political challenges. In future, this
strategy will more clearly unite our social responsibility with our efforts
to safeguard our company’s future viability.

Water and biodiversity management: New projects and

We have also made progress in other key fields of our sustainability
strategy. For example, we expanded our cooperation with the international nature conservation organisation BirdLife International to Africa
and Asia, where we have already initiated individual species protection

Products and services

Our core business encompasses the production and distribution
of cement and aggregates, the two essential raw materials for
manufacturing concrete. Our product range is mainly supplemented
by the downstream materials ready-mixed concrete and asphalt.
Our core products, cement and aggregates (e.g. sand, gravel and
crushed stone), are generally homogeneous bulk goods. Their product properties are standardised so that they are sufficiently strong
and reliable and can be properly processed and used.

Because cement and aggregates are heavy compared to their price,
they are generally produced close to their sales markets. When
transported on roads, cement normally has a delivery radius of less
than 200 kilometres, while the radius for aggregates and readymixed concrete is less than 100 kilometres. That’s why we have local
production facilities in the more than 40 countries where we offer
building materials. We operate 85 cement plants worldwide, as
well as more than 600 quarries and gravel pits and considerably
over 1,000 production facilities for ready-mixed concrete. All in all,
our 45,453 employees work at more than 2,300 locations.

We respect and obey applicable laws and regulations in all the countries in which we operate, and we regard them as the legal foundation
of our business activities. As an internationally operating company, we
are also obliged to adhere to global values and standards. As a result,
we are committed to upholding the ILO’s core labour standards, the
OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN’s Universal
Declaration of Human Rights. We expect our employees and business
associates around the world to act in conformity with these essential
guidelines and recommendations.

HeidelbergCement has dedicated itself to a responsible corporate
management system: We aim to achieve our business objectives
in a morally acceptable and ethical manner with socially and environmentally responsible methods. This is the only way to ensure
that our success will be sustainable.
Outstanding business performance, ecological expertise, social responsibility as well as acting in an ethically as well as legally correct
manner form the basis for responsible and sustainable corporate governance at HeidelbergCement.
Our management and monitoring structures comply with the laws governing stock corporations in Germany, the company’s memorandum
and articles of association, the rules of procedure of the Managing
Board and Supervisory Board and, with a few exceptions, the guidelines laid out in the German Corporate Governance Code.

Our leadership principles reflect our commitment to the aforementioned standards. We commit our suppliers to these standards with
our Supplier Code of Conduct. Our compliance reporting system offers
both employees and external parties the opportunity to report compliance violations. This system also includes criteria for violations of
human rights and core labour standards such as anti-discrimination
and anti child-labour regulations. The system encompasses a variety
of channels through which suspected compliance violations can be
addressed, ranging from reports sent directly to specifically authorised
contact partners to information submitted through our whistleblower
hotline. All such reports are handled anonymously if desired.
Most of the reported violations in the reporting year involved employee
issues and occupational safety. The whistleblower hotline received 59
reports, including four cases of alleged discrimination. No instances of
child labour or forced labour were reported. We examine every report
we receive and take appropriate disciplinary action when necessary. In
addition to taking corrective action, we implement preventative measures in order to reduce the likelihood of recurrences in the future.
Every two years we conduct a survey in our Group’s country organisations in order to assess the risk of human rights violations or violations
of core labour standards. As a second step, we review the risk-minimi-

sation measures in place and implement additional measures where
necessary.
Our compliance programme
Our compliance programme is based on a Group-wide Code of Conduct
that requires all employees to adhere to basic principles of responsible
corporate governance, regardless of whether or not such principles
have been written into law. It is particularly important that
– our employees and managers act with integrity and professionalism when dealing with customers, suppliers, government
authorities and business partners;
– conflicts of interest are consistently avoided and prevented;
– company property and assets are treated carefully and
responsibly;
– confidential company and business information and personal
data are treated carefully and responsibly;
– fair conditions and a workplace free of discrimination are
ensured and fair discussions are conducted with employee
representatives;
– safe and healthy workplaces are provided;
– natural resources are utilised responsibly and sparingly.
A key element of our compliance programme is our executives’ nontoleration of violations of applicable law (especially competition law
and anti-corruption regulations), and their commitment to taking
action against all those who commit such violations. Our compliance
programme also includes internal measures and guidelines that
provide more specific information on the relevant legal regulations.
Measures here include periodic training courses for our employees.
For example, we have an e-learning module that addresses our Code
of Conduct and provides basic information about compliance topics.
Our electronic courses cover topics such as discrimination and harassment in the workplace, competition law and measures to prevent
corruption. A total of 10,000 employees were registered to use the
e-learning module in the reporting year.

REPORT PROFILE

Our compliance organisation
The Director Group Compliance, who heads our compliance organisation, reports directly to the Chairman of the Managing Board. Each
country in which we operate also has its own Compliance Officer.
Every manager is responsible for ensuring that employees comply with
applicable laws and regulations, and of course the employees themselves are also responsible for their own compliance. Defined control
mechanisms throughout the Group ensure that our compliance programme is implemented correctly. Such mechanisms include regular
and special audits by our Internal Auditing department, as well as halfyear compliance reports submitted by the Director Group Compliance
to the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee.
In addition, every Managing Board member receives a report each
quarter on major compliance violations in his region.
We closely monitor developments in the area of compliance and regularly review our programme in order to determine whether it needs to
be adjusted. Most recently, such adjustments had to be made in the
areas of trade sanctions and corruption prevention.
Compliance activities
Our Trade Sanctions Policy has been in effect since November 2014.
The policy stipulates that all companies controlled by HeidelbergCement have to check whether their business partners are on the
sanction lists published by the EU and the USA. They then have to
take appropriate measures if such is the case. The Group Compliance department helps the country organisations implement the Trade
Sanctions Policy by supplying data processing solutions in cooperation
with Group IT and by delineating business processes that regulate the
necessary activities resulting from the evaluation of business partners.
In 2015 we fully implemented processes for evaluating new business
partners and introduced a system for the periodic evaluation of nearly
all of our existing business partners.

In response to the UK Bribery Act and the IDW PS 980 audit standard,
we have worked together with external experts to develop a system
for assessing and avoiding corruption risks and possible conflicts of
interest. The system is divided into three stages: In the first stage, the
system assesses the potential risks in a particular country organisation. Existing measures are then applied to limit such potential risks.
In the last step, the system determines whether additional measures
might be required. This assessment results in a plan of measures for
each country. The implementation of these measures is monitored by
Group Compliance. In 2015 we introduced this assessment system
for all business lines in all countries where the Group is active. The
assessments will now be conducted every three years.
The information submitted via our compliance reporting system in
2015 showed that there were only a few isolated cases of suspected
corruption. The necessary countermeasures here include improving
process monitoring systems, terminating supplier contracts and taking
specific personnel-related actions.
In addition to such aspects, we continue to focus on occupational
safety and environmental legislation. This approach reflects the characteristics and special aspects of a heavy industry that extracts raw
materials and generally operates on a local level with its production
and sale of homogeneous bulk goods. Extensive efforts are also made
to ensure compliance with internal procurement stipulations, the ban
on insider trading and the regulations governing capital markets, data
security and equal opportunity for all employees.
Antitrust law
Antitrust proceedings prompt us to continuously examine and enhance
our precautions for the prevention of competition law violations. To
this end, our antitrust law compliance system was reviewed in 2010
and 2013 by an external specialist, who confirmed its effectiveness.
In order to make further improvements, we have developed electronic
antitrust-law courses that have been introduced throughout the Group.
These courses are mandatory for senior managers, sales staff, procure-

ment employees who have direct contact with suppliers, employees
involved in merger and acquisition projects, and employees in contact
with competitors or who might be affected by antitrust regulations in
some other way. Throughout the Group, around 5,200 employees from
36 countries and/or functions have registered for the antitrust-law
course to date. An additional 650 employees have registered for a
country-specific antitrust course in Australia.

Our sustainability strategy
Our company’s mission is to not only achieve outstanding business
results but also to act in an environmentally and socially responsible
way. While we are minimising the risks for our business and exploiting
new opportunities, we are at the same time developing solutions for
environmental, social and societal challenges. This work focuses on
the following topic areas:

–	Occupational safety: Because we are a manufacturing company,
occupational health and safety are a top priority at HeidelbergCement. We employ targeted measures to improve technical and
organisational safety standards and make people more aware
of workplace safety issues. Here, we focus not only on our own
employees but also on those from outside companies and third
parties.
–	Securing raw materials and conserving resources: Our business
operations are dependant on having long-term access to mineralbased raw materials in the vicinity of our plants. Such resources are
finite and their local exploitation often leads to conflicts of interest.
We therefore view the sustainable safeguarding and conservation
of raw materials as a key strategic task.
Our strategy for resource conservation in cement production also
involves the use of alternative raw materials and fuels. At the same
time, the substitution potential here is heavily dependent on the
availability of industrial by-products and the quality requirements
for cements.
Water protection and water management are playing an increasingly important role in our business operations as well. Water is
scarce in many parts of the world and climate change is exacerbating the situation. Even though the construction materials industry has only a relatively small water footprint as compared to other
industries, the scarcity of fresh water at several of our locations
presents a challenge to the company. Our Cement business line
is now implementing water management plans at those locations
where water is particularly scarce.
–	Nature conservation and species protection: Our raw material
extraction and quarrying activities temporarily disrupt the surrounding water supplies, soil, flora and fauna. While we are unable
to compensate in the short term for these encroachments, we can
offset them over the medium and long term. Here, we place great

11

HeidelbergCement I Sustainability Report 2015

store in the high-quality after use of our quarries in line with nature
conservation principles, and to this end we seek to engage in a
dialogue with local stakeholders.
–	Energy efficiency and climate protection: The production of
cement requires a lot of energy. From both an economic and
environmental standpoint, it is therefore imperative that we further
increase our energy efficiency. Cement production by its nature
also leads to a high level of CO2 emissions. Our efforts to lower
such emissions focus primarily on increasing our use of alternative
CO2-neutral raw materials and fuels. As a result, we have been able
to continually reduce our CO2 emissions over the last few years
and we will continue to reduce them further in future. Along with
our research on new types of cements with a lower CO2 footprint,
we are also investing in the development of methods for separating and exploiting the CO2 emissions produced by our cement
manufacturing operations. We also support international targets
and initiatives for reducing CO2 emissions and slowing the pace of
global warming. We and other cement companies are taking part
in the Low Carbon Technology Partnership initiative (LCTPi). To this
end, we have committed ourselves to a global plan that specifies
measures for reducing CO2 emissions worldwide.

The HeidelbergCement Sustainability Ambitions 2020 describes our
most important activities for promoting sustainability. This programme,
which is valid throughout the Group, defines the main components
and objectives of our sustainability strategy. However, our efforts to
achieve greater sustainability can also extend to areas other than those
described in the programme, which we are currently updating in order to define our sustainability strategy for the period up until 2030.

Materiality analysis
We use our materiality analysis to regularly determine how important
various sustainability issues are from the point of view of different
stakeholder groups and the company itself. The analysis thus helps
us identify and evaluate issues that are important for our business
success today, or could prove to be important in future. The topic list
we utilise here is based on our Sustainability Programme 2020 and
the key issues defined by the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) of
the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)
after close consultation with numerous stakeholder groups and
G4-18, G4-26
experts.
We last reviewed our topic list and the materiality matrix in 2014. In
order to bring the external assessments of these topics and issues
up to date, we asked 57 of our most important stakeholders from various countries to give us their opinions. These stakeholders included
suppliers, investors, scientists and representatives of government
agencies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). A total of 26
stakeholders agreed to take part in our survey, which included standardised and open-ended questions. For our internal assessment, we
queried some 50 staff members from relevant business lines in all
G4-18, G4-24, G4-25
Group areas in the same manner.

Our sustainability management
Organisational basis
Effective management systems at our various business lines help ensure a continual process of improvement in accordance with our sustainability strategy. Within the framework of these systems, we have
defined areas of responsibility and created structures that support the
effective implementation and monitoring of the measures we employ
to achieve our sustainability targets.
The Sustainability Steering Committee, which reports to the Chairman of the Managing Board, manages and monitors our sustainability
strategy. The interdisciplinary committee’s members are chosen from
throughout the Group and consist of the Managing Board member
responsible for Environmental Sustainability and the Directors of the
Group departments for Environmental Sustainability, Legal Affairs,
Human Resources, Procurement, Logistics, Sales and Marketing, Research and Development, Communication and Investor Relations. Operational responsibility for the achievement of sustainability targets
and the implementation of associated measures lies with the individual Group departments and the Group Environmental Sustainability

Our stakeholder engagement
In view of the strong local focus of our business operations, we can
only be successful in the long term if we maintain good cooperative
relationships with stakeholders in society. We seek to establish and
maintain a dialogue based on trust with all relevant stakeholder groups
— especially those on the local level but also with national and international stakeholder groups. The resulting exchange of ideas and opinions helps us identify critical issues at an early stage and gain greater
acceptance for our activities. Each country organisation is responsible for establishing and maintaining its own dialogue with national
and local stakeholders. The stakeholder dialogue on the international
level is managed by the Group departments for Communication and

REPORT PROFILE

The stakeholder dialogue at the international level
HeidelbergCement is a member of both general and industry-specific
associations that represent their members’ interests vis-à-vis governments, businesses and the public. These memberships also promote
an exchange with other companies and organisations and a common
determination to achieve greater sustainability. The topics addressed
focus on challenges specific to individual countries and industrial
policy, particularly as regards the secure supply of raw materials, environmental protection, energy conservation, health and occupational
safety and social and labour issues.

Relations with local stakeholders
As most of our plants and quarries are situated near local communities, it is essential for us to continually maintain contact with local
communities and government agencies and local organisations. Plant
or facility management teams are generally responsible for such stakeholder relationships. Wherever necessary, they are supported by the
national subsidiary’s communication department. We take criticism
expressed by our stakeholder groups seriously and we discuss with
them the points they bring up. We have adopted new approaches in
many places in order to reconcile the interests of the company with
those of the local community. Along with personal discussions, we
also make use of the entire range of modern information and dialogue
media (e.g. in the form of newsletters or guidelines) as well as different concepts of civic participation. G4-24, G4-26
A CSR expert group at Group level regularly brings together managers from all levels for discussing local activities and the various
experiences the managers have had in their communities. This helps
us continually improve the stakeholder dialogue and the associated
G4-26

Dialogue with political decision makers
Legislation in the European Union is increasingly impacting our business operations by addressing all aspects of sustainability. For this
reason, HeidelbergCement has established a separate corporate
function for political dialogue at the EU level. The manager responsible for this dialogue chiefly represents our interests in CEMBUREAU,
the European Cement Association, which speaks for European cement
manufacturers in discussions and negotiations with the EU and its
various institutions. The key issues addressed by CEMBUREAU include
the use of alternative raw materials and fuels, climate protection, emissions, biodiversity and occupational health and safety. As a member
of the European Aggregates Association (UEPG), we also present our
positions on aggregates through an effective lobbying organisation.
Our interests concerning concrete are represented by the European
Ready-Mixed Concrete Organisation (ERMCO) and the European
G4-18, G4-25
Concrete Platform (ECP).
Dialogue with analysts and investors who focus on
sustainability issues
Dialogue with the capital markets is also becoming more and more
important, as our shareholders and an ever greater number of financial
analysts and rating agencies are now interested in how HeidelbergCement integrates the issue of sustainability into its corporate strategy. They also want to know how successful the company has been in
this regard. Dialogue with capital-market stakeholder groups generally
G4-24, G4-25
has a bilateral format.

Here too, we adhere to ethical principles such as respect, fairness and
credibility, as laid out in our Supplier Code of Conduct. We systematically and transparently communicate this code to our global and local
suppliers, who are obligated to act in line with the principles defined
in the code. The code incorporates the key elements of the SA 8000
International Social Accountability Standard, the ISO 14001 international environmental standard and the principles of the International
Labour Organisation (ILO). The code is meant to motivate our suppliers
to make continual improvements to their operations. The failure of a
supplier to correct a weakness or deficiency that has been identified
can result in the termination of the contractual relationship.
Within the framework of a working group in the international Cement
Sustainability Initiative (CSI), HeidelbergCement is also helping to
establish a standardised approach to sustainable supply chain management in the cement industry. The working group has developed a
joint catalogue of principles that are based on the UN Global Compact
and ILO standards, and which cover the following areas:
– Occupational health and safety
– Working conditions
– Freedom of association and protection against retaliation
– Forced labour
– Child labour
– Anti-discrimination
– Observance of environmental regulations
– Environmental impact management
– Bribery and corruption
– Transparency and integrity.

In 2015 HeidelbergCement also launched a project for the systematic
management and assessment of suppliers. A main component here
will be the establishment of a platform for evaluating the sustainability aspects addressed in our Supplier Code of Conduct. This online
platform will simplify the systematic collection and consolidation of
data and serve as an important tool for identifying areas where the
implementation of additional measures, including physical audits and
onsite visits, might be necessary. The platform will thus serve as the
basis for a continual improvement of sustainability performance in the
HeidelbergCement supply chain.
Management of customer relationships
We seek to offer our customers the greatest possible utility, and to
establish partnerships based on trust. This in turn requires open and
honest communication — and this also applies to advertising measures
for innovative products and/or products that improve environmental
protection, which require more explanation than standard products.

and introducing new product recipes.
Organisation and areas of responsibility for research and
technology
Our Heidelberg Technology Center Global (HTC Global) and Competence Center Materials bring together knowledge and expertise from
throughout the Group and make them available to all operating units
quickly and comprehensively. The two competence centers employ numerous international experts who have extensive expertise with regard
to cement and aggregates.
Focus of research and development activities
Our innovation activities focus on five main areas:
Customers who wish to file complaints can get in touch with their local
contact partners, whereby all complaints — whether of a technical,
logistical, or commercial nature — are forwarded directly to the appropriate department. The structural design and computer-supported
implementation of our Complaint Management System is carried out
worldwide in accordance with a predefined standard.
In order to offer our customers even greater utility, we are stepping up
our systematic, continual and comprehensive customer survey process
around the globe within the framework of our Group-wide Customer
Excellence Programme (CEP). These surveys enable us to focus our
efforts more strongly on the needs of our customers. We use the survey results and other market analyses to develop plans for optimising
our products and services and to further enhance the satisfaction of
our customers. We treat all the customer data we collect confidentially
and do not pass any information on to third parties.

– Products and applications: Our research and development
activities are geared strongly towards the market and our customers. The main priority here is the development and improvement
of binders and concretes with optimised properties and innovative
functionalites. We also provide our customers with expert advice
on the use and optimisation of their products.
– Cement production: The focus here is on the continual improvement of processes and cost structures. This includes the costefficient substitution of fossil fuels and natural resources with alternative fuels and raw materials, as well as measures that reduce energy consumption in production. Up until the end
of 2013, we pursued such goals in the Group-wide Operational
Excellence initiative, which successfully identified and exploited
existing potential in our cement plants. The Continuous Improvement Programme (CIP) launched in 2014 is designed to not only
maintain the progress we’ve already made but also to achieve
further improvements.

– Aggregates: With the help of various optimisation programmes,
we have achieved important improvements in terms of, among
other things, throughput, uptime, labour and energy efficiency
and the balance between production and sales. We have increasingly focused on implementing standardised processes at all of
our plants. We also continue to implement targeted training programmes at all levels — from management to production staff at
our facilities. Local managers will remain responsible for ensuring
continual improvements and efficiency enhancements in future.
– Cross-divisional activities: We are focusing on vertical integration
in major metropolitan areas in particular. Extensive financial savings
can be achieved through the closely coordinated optimisation of
the product ranges, production processes and logistics operations
across the aggregates, ready-mixed concrete and cement business
lines. The exploitation of our complete raw materials portfolio in
individual market regions enables us to optimise the material mix in
our ready-mixed concrete plants to an extent that allows us to use
our raw material deposits in the best possible manner and lower
costs in all of the above-mentioned business lines. At the same
time, we are able to guarantee a high level of concrete quality for
our customers.

– Cements and concretes with improved CO2 footprints: A key
focus here is to further develop composite cements with lower
clinker content levels — even lower than required by today’s standards, in fact. The reduction of clinker content is the most important
factor for reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions and
conserving natural resources. We are also conducting research into
completely new binder systems that require no clinker. Such innovative alternative products are still in the research stage, and it will
therefore take several years before they are ready for the market
and wide deployment.

Securing and conserving resources, increasing energy efficiency,
limiting CO2 emissions, minimising land use and restoring valuable habitats — these are the key components of our approach to
environmental protection. We made progress in all of these areas
in 2015.
Environmental protection measures at the HeidelbergCement Group
are centrally managed by the Group Environmental Sustainability
Committee. Under the lead management of the Global Environmental
Sustainability department, experts from the various business lines and
Group areas define environmental guidelines, goals and measures, and
coordinate their implementation.
Our environmental protection goals: pp. 47-48

In an effort to place environmental protection on a firmer footing at
our facilities and achieve continual improvements in this area, we plan
to introduce certified environmental management systems at all of
our cement plants worldwide by 2020. We will focus here on the ISO
14001 international standard and will also use recognised national
standards. At the end of 2015, 78% of our integrated cement plants
were operating with a certified environmental management system.
In line with the stipulations in our Sustainability Ambitions 2020, we
conducted environmental audits at all business lines throughout the
Group in 2015. Our goal is to analyse all of our locations in this manner
by 2020. The audits conducted to date have led to the development
of several measures to improve our environmental performance. These
measures have now been successfully implemented. No violations of
environmental protection laws that would have led to significant fines
or non-financial penalties were reported during the reporting year.

Energy and climate protection
Our environmental policies focuses on protecting the earth’s climate.
In December 2015, we reconfirmed our commitment by joining the
LCTPi during the COP 21 in Paris. As an energy-intensive company,
we have for many years been diligently striving to reduce our CO2
emissions. Between 1990 and 2015, we reduced specific net CO2
emissions by 22% to 606 kg CO2/t cement. By 2030, we plan to
lower CO2 emissions by around 20 million tonnes of CO2 per year as
compared to 1990 levels. This is an ambitious goal, but also one that
can be achieved.

Participation in the EU’s emissions trading system
HeidelbergCement operates 35 facilities in 11 countries that participate in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). Our Group is also
actively involved in the market for emissions certificates. A Grouplevel position for dealing with emissions trading issues was therefore
established in 2004. The associated corporate department not only
manages our trading activities within the European Union (EU), but
also monitors developments in countries outside of Europe that might
impact the operations of our plants.

Innovations for climate protection
In 2015 we completed our tests of four different technologies for separating CO2 from combustion exhaust gases at our plant in Brevik,
Norway. We presented the test results at the Carbon Capture and
Storage (CCS) conference that we held in May 2015 with the support
of Norway’s Ministry of Petroleum and Energy. We are now using the
knowledge gained from the tests to put together a comprehensive
feasibility study for the construction of a major CO2 capture facility in
Brevik. We are receiving financial support for the study from Norway’s
state-owned Gassnova carbon capture and storage company. This
facility would be the first major CCS plant in the cement industry.
CCS conference: www.norcem.no/en/CCS-conference

The EU now has to make critical decisions regarding the future of
the European emissions trading system. Moreover, uncertainty will
increase due to the discussions regarding a fundamental reform of
the EU emissions trading system. We are trying to minimise the effect
that these uncertainties in the European emissions trading market can
have on our company by making more extensive use of alternative,
CO2-neutral fuels and replacing some of our CO2-intensive clinker.
Emissions trading systems outside of Europe
Emissions trading systems are also being set up in regions outside
of Europe. China, for example, is testing a variety of concepts in six
of its provinces. One of these provinces is Guangdong. We operate
a joint venture there, so we closely monitor how the local emissions
trading system is developing. A national emissions trading system will
be introduced in China in 2017. In 2013 California (USA) launched its
long-awaited emissions trading system, which we helped to develop.
However, the system has minimal impact on our business operations.

As part of our efforts to further develop oxy-fuel technology, HeidelbergCement is participating in the CEMCAP project for promoting the use
of CO2 separation technology in the cement industry. The project is
being financed through the EU’s Horizon 2020 programme. In the
oxy-fuel process, pure oxygen rather than ambient air is fed into a
rotary furnace, which makes it easier to capture CO2. We are currently
working on the development of this technology on a pilot-plant scale
at our facility in Hanover, Germany.
www.sintef.no/projectweb/cemcap

HeidelbergCement is also playing a major role in the LEILAC (Low
Emissions Intensity Lime And Cement) project, which is also being
funded via Horizon 2020. The goal here is to demonstrate the technological and economic feasibility of a process technology that helps
separate CO2 in a highly pure form when the latter is released by the
combustion of the raw material. This approach complements the oxyfuel process described above.

In December 2015, HeidelbergCement began working with Joule
Unlimited Inc, a pioneer in CO2 recycling. The goal of this new strategic partnership is to examine ways of producing biofuels from
CO2 emissions.

Development of an alternative clinker
With the discovery of a new reactive clinker phase, HeidelbergCement
has created the foundation for an alternative clinker technology. The
associated altered chemical composition and lower combustion temperatures result in CO2 emissions that are roughly 30% lower than
is the case with conventional clinker, as well as energy savings of
10%–15%. The basic technology is protected by several patents and
the new clinker has been registered under the brand name TernoCem®.
After completing a preliminary study, we launched a multi-year research programme in 2015 to prepare the technology for the market.
This programme, which will establish the conditions necessary for
the future standardisation of products, is being supported by the
ECOBINDER project, which is funded in part by the EU.
www.ecobinder-project.eu/en

Energy efficiency
We have been generating electricity from waste kiln heat at our plant
in Fieni, Romania since July 2015. The power-generation facility has
an average net output of 3.6 MW. This facility and other energy efficiency measures have enabled the plant to reduce the amount of
electricity it obtains externally by 25%. Some 40% of the investment
required to build the facility was provided by the EU and the Romanian
government. We have also set up facilities for generating electricity
from waste kiln heat at our plants in Damoh, India and Guangzhou,
China.

REPORT PROFILE

In 2015 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) awarded the
ENERGY STAR® to four of our cement plants in the USA: Leeds (Alabama), Union Bridge (Maryland), Glens Falls (New York) and Redding
(California). The four facilities were honoured for their above-average
energy efficiency. All four plants meet stringent EPA requirements and
are also among the top 25 cement plants in the USA when it comes
to energy efficiency. The Union Bridge plant received the award for the
third time, while the plants in Leeds, Glens Falls, and Redding were issued the award for the second time in a row. The Rocky Mount quarry
in North Carolina was also awarded the ENERGY STAR® in recognition
of its extraordinary energy efficiency.

Raw materials and fuels
Many waste materials and by-products from other industries serve
as valuable raw materials for HeidelbergCement. We use these resources as alternatives to finite natural raw materials and fossil fuels
in the production of cement. In this way, we are helping to reduce the
problems that municipalities and industrial companies near our plants
have with waste. At the same time, these efforts are reducing our CO2
emissions as well.
Alternative fuels replace natural resources
In all countries in which HeidelbergCement produces clinker (the main
component of cement), we investigate possibilities for using waste
from municipalities, agriculture and industry in an economically and
environmentally responsible manner. In order to develop optimal solutions, we work together with regulating authorities, waste producers,
neighbours, employees, NGOs and other stakeholders.
In 2015 we were able to increase the share of alternative fuels at our
TulaCement plant in Russia to a double-digit figure, although we had
only started using such fuels the year before. Our three plants in Romania have now significantly increased the share of alternative fuels
used in their operations for the seventh consecutive year. We’ve even

been successful in this area in countries with relatively low prices for
fossil fuels and waste disposal. The best example of this is our plant
in Kunda, Estonia, where we have been able to substitute more than
45% of the fossil fuels previously used. The highest substitution rate
for the Group as a whole in 2015 was achieved at our Lengfurt plant
in Germany, where 90% of the coal we previously used was replaced
by alternative fuels.
We also made good progress in China with the use of sewage sludge
as an alternative fuel at our Guangzhou plant. We are now making
preparations for testing the use of sewage sludge in another kiln at
the nearby Zhujiang plant.
Our pilot plant in Indonesia for utilising local domestic waste as fuel
has exceeded all expectations. This plant is playing an important pioneering role in the development of solutions for waste disposal problems in Jakarta and surrounding cities. For example, two other cities
— Depok and Bogor — are now using the technology to develop a major
project for waste use.
As a result of all these measures, HeidelbergCement is well on track
to reach the Group’s target of using 30% alternative fuels as defined
in our Sustainability Programme 2020.
Alternative raw materials for clinker and cement manufacturing
One of the most important measures for reducing CO2 emissions in
cement manufacturing involves the use of alternative raw materials
that are produced as waste in other industries. Particularly valuable
here are materials whose composition and/or properties enable them
to be used as a logical supplement to raw materials such as limestone,
marl, clay, sand and iron. A very large share of these secondary raw
materials comes from the steel industry. However, coal-fired power
plants also produce ash of a very uniform quality. The systematic assessment of the suitability of all raw materials used — both primary
and secondary — ensures a consistently high level of product quality.

24

HeidelbergCement I Sustainability Report 2015

REPORT PROFILE

HeidelbergCement generally uses alternative raw materials in two
areas: in the combustion process for the production of clinker, which
is the most important intermediate product in the manufacture of
cement, and as additives that give cement special properties. The increased use of alternative raw materials in cement production is a core
element of our climate strategy, along with the use of alternative fuels.
At Group level, we were able to maintain the share of alternative raw
materials used for cement production at 12% during the reporting period. We were also able to reduce the amount of clinker in our cement
to 75%.
HeidelbergCement continues to introduce composite cements made
with alternative raw materials, especially in countries where Portland
cements predominate. Huge amounts of alternative raw materials that
have remained unused for decades are available in Eastern Europe and
Central Asia in particular. We are also conducting extensive research
on additional alternatives, with a focus on the creation of completely
new types of cement.
Additional information: pp. 23 and 27

Use of hazardous wastes
The careful handling of hazardous wastes is a key element of every
country’s waste disposal infrastructure. For most types of hazardous
waste, reuse in cement plants has proved to be a totally safe means
of disposal and utilisation. The high temperatures and long incineration period in the kilns ensure that all harmful components are completely destroyed. This has been confirmed by measurements taken by
independent state-certified institutes. At the same time, HeidelbergCement does not use certain types of waste, including nuclear, medical and highly toxic waste.

Land use and biodiversity
We only extract worthwhile deposits if they can be exploited in an
environmentally compatible and economical manner. Before making
any decision concerning the development of a new quarry or the expansion of an existing one, the company first conducts an extensive
approval process in line with the corresponding laws and regulations.
This process includes an environmental impact assessment and — if
the affected area is of exceptional biological value — special biodiversity studies. In these studies, the priorities are set as follows: prevention, mitigation, compensation. We accordingly first check whether
excavation work can be avoided or at least adjusted in such a way
that the ecosystem isn’t disrupted or that such disruptions are kept
to a minimum. Wherever necessary, we then implement a biodiversity
management plan in order to reduce the impact of our excavations,
and we also take suitable compensatory measures.
Concepts for the limitation of land consumption
For environmental and economic reasons, we always strive to limit
land consumption when planning our quarry and renaturation activities. In principle, the authorised raw material supply is always completely extracted in order to minimise land consumption. As a result,
we prefer to expand existing quarries rather than develop new sites.
Our production and plant facilities are also optimised so as to require
the smallest possible amount of land area.
Biodiversity management at our quarries
Recultivation plans are now an integral part of approval processes.
These plans define the goals and timetable for the reintegration of a
quarry into the surrounding landscape. Even while a quarry is still in
operation, we renaturate and recultivate those areas of the quarry that
are no longer used.

Report profile

HeidelbergCement I Sustainability Report 2015

As early as 2010, we began to collect and analyse information about
the biodiversity of our quarries. In cooperation with our partner,
BirdLife International, we conducted a study to determine how far our
quarries are from nature reserves in Europe, Africa and Asia. The study
encompassed slightly more than half of our active quarries worldwide.
We collect global data on three key indicators:
– Proportion of active quarries with restoration plans
– Proportion of quarries in areas with a high level of biodiversity
– Proportion of quarries in areas with a high level of biodiversity for
which biodiversity management plans are being implemented.
In 2015 85% of the cement-related quarries had restoration plans. The
corresponding figure for aggregates quarries was 89%. By 2020, we
plan to increase this share to 100% in both areas.
HeidelbergCement has also committed itself to implementing locally
adapted biodiversity management plans at quarries in areas with a
high level of biological diversity. Altogether, 74% of such quarries operated by the cement business line already have such plans in place;
the corresponding figure for the aggregates business line is 81%. As

a result, there are approximately 200 biodiversity management plans
in place today, and we are steadily extending biodiversity monitoring
to more and more quarries, and are also implementing corresponding
management plans.
Habitat protection
HeidelbergCement has been able to restore many habitats by recultivating and renaturating former quarries. In order to effectively promote
biological diversity, we became the first company in the construction
materials sector to define uniform standards for recultivation, renaturation and habitat management. These standards are combined in a
guideline that is binding throughout Europe. In comparable form, the
standards are also used as a handbook in Asia and Australia.
We determine at country level which areas our company has renaturated and recultivated. The associated activities cover a variety of
habitats:
– Aquatic habitats: lakes, ponds, fens and springs
– Terrestrial habitats: forests, grasslands, cliffs and escarpments
– Anthropogenous habitats: settlements and agricultural areas
Several of these habitats are particularly important for biodiversity
because many endangered species settle there. This is especially true
of those habitats marked by the early stages of ecological succession.
In Europe in particular, our quarries are now important refuges and
stepping-stone biotopes for certain species such as the sand martin,
the yellow-bellied toad, the eagle-owl and the tree frog. HeidelbergCement takes part in numerous species-protection programmes run
by governmental and non-governmental institutions and thus supports
local and international nature conservation efforts.

Our joint projects support the achievement of global nature conservation objectives while also having a local impact. During the reporting year, we implemented 15 projects that restored natural habitats
or else linked them together, brought invasive non-native vegetation
under control, expanded the populations of endangered bird and amphibian species and helped local communities gain access to natural
environments. We are now extending our cooperation with BirdLife
International to Asia and Africa, among other ways by establishing a
partnership with the Ghana Wildlife Society.
Quarry Life Award
In 2015 we started our third Quarry Life Award research competition,
which is designed to make people aware of the high biological value
of our quarries. Here, we offered young scientists and students the
opportunity to conduct research at 69 quarries and gravel pits in 22
countries, and enter their projects in both national and international
competitions. Estonia, Togo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo
— all countries where the Group operates facilities — are participating
for the first time. A total of 454 project proposals were submitted
worldwide up until the end of the registration period on 1 March 2016.
The winners will be announced at the end of 2016.

Sustainable construction
HeidelbergCement continued to focus on the development of more
sustainable construction materials in 2015 as well. Experts at our central research laboratory have discovered a new reactive clinker phase
and we are now working on the development of a manufacturing technology for this clinker, which has already been registered under the
brand name TernoCem®. To this end, and within the framework of the
TernoCem® product development programme launched in 2015, we
now want to obtain scientific-technical knowledge about raw materials
suitability, clinker production and hydration mechanisms for cement.
We are also establishing the expertise needed to ensure important
product attributes such as workability and durability.
Development of an alternative clinker: p. 23

As a leading member of the European Construction Technology Platform, we also promote the development and utilisation of product
solutions for energy efficient buildings and cities. In 2015, for example, we continued to move ahead with the distribution of our Cemflow technology for a self-levelling floor finish that perfectly embeds
in-floor heating pipes. We also continue to develop Heatcrete, a new
concrete-based solution for thermal energy storage.
As a founding member of the Concrete Sustainability Council, we
actively participated in 2015 in the development of a new certification system for sustainably manufactured concrete. This system takes
into account social, ecological and economic aspects along the value
chain. The widespread use of this transparent certification system will
make it possible for the concrete industry to obtain greater recognition
from Green Building Councils and in tendering processes for public
construction projects. HeidelbergCement is also a member of 12 national Green Building Councils.
As early as 2013, we launched Ecocrete® in the Netherlands. This
concrete, which contains recycled aggregates, makes an important
contribution to closing the loop in the material cycle. In 2015 our orga-

which supports the goals of the European Commission regarding the
transition to a more circular economy, was launched with several cooperation partners and receives funding from the German government.

Local environmental impact
Air pollution and noise
During the reporting year, we made technical improvements at many
of our plants in Europe and Indonesia in order to reduce emissions of
dust, nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides. In the Czech Republic, we
continued our long-term project for reducing noise and dust at our
cement plants in Mokra and Radotin. We also installed sound dampers at TulaCement in Russia in order to reduce noise levels at that
facility. Our new plants in Togo and Burkina Faso comply with international standards for reducing emissions. Facilities for the continual
monitoring of dust, nitrogen oxide and sulphur oxide emissions in line
with CSI guidelines were installed at our new clinker plant in Tabligbo,
Togo. In 2015 activities at our aggregates business line also focused
on reducing noise and dust emissions.

New emission standards went into effect in the USA in September
2015: In order to be able to meet the National Emission Standards for
Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), we implemented measures for
monitoring and reducing dust, mercury, hydrochloric acid and hydrocarbon emissions at all of our cement plants in the USA.
Water management
HeidelbergCement has committed itself to the goal of mitigating the
impact of its activities on natural water resources to the greatest
extent possible. We comply with stringent environmental regulations
to ensure that our raw material quarrying will not endanger local bodies of surface water and ground water resources.
In 2014, a global water-risk study supplied us with fundamental information for the creation of a Group-wide guideline concerning sustainable
water management in the cement, aggregates and ready-mixed concrete
business lines. The study showed that 14.3% of our plants are located
in regions suffering from water scarcity, i.e. regions where less than
1,000 m3 of water is available per person each year. In response to
this situation, we began developing individual water management
plans for these facilities in 2015. The plans, which will be completed
by 2030, will ensure the sustainable use of scarce water resources
and include concepts and measures for reducing water consumption.
In addition, the plans aim to involve external local stakeholders in order to implement non-commercial and sustainable water utilisation
concepts that minimise local water risks. We will begin this process at
those locations where water scarcity is an especially urgent problem.
In 2013 and 2014, we introduced industry indicators for water reporting at all of our cement plants. We developed these indicators in cooperation with the CSI. We are publishing the key figures for the first
time in this sustainability report.

28

HeidelbergCement I Sustainability Report 2015

We have also started to introduce these indicators at our aggregates
and ready-mixed concrete business lines. However, we are only collecting this information in regions suffering from water stress, due to
the large number of plants involved. In this context water stress means
that less than 1,700 m3 of water are available per person each year.
This information will be collected at all of our plants in the affected
regions by 2030.
Waste materials
Our primary focus in terms of waste management concerns the kiln
dust that is a by-product of clinker production. This dust has to be
removed from the kiln systems at several facilities in order to prevent
disruptions to proper kiln operation. We generally use the kiln dust as
an alternative raw material in cement production, thereby improving
our ecological efficiency. In some exceptional cases, the composition
of the dust prevents us from being able to recycle it 100%. A second
option for us is to use the kiln dust as a raw material for the production of special concrete. If no other option is available, it can be
deposited in landfills in a controlled process. The local operating permit at each plant specifies the allowable amount of process-related
waste products and how it is to be used.

More than 45,400 men and women work for HeidelbergCement
worldwide. Their achievements make us one of the leading
companies in our sector. That’s why it is very important for us to
provide them with good and attractive working conditions. As a
manufacturing company, we put a high priority on occupational
safety and the protection of our employees’ health.

Because outstanding business performance is also a result of legally
and ethically compliant behaviour, the Managing Board has approved
a Code of Conduct that is binding throughout the Group. This code
specifies our values and our ethical and legal standards. This particularly includes non-discriminatory employment conditions and an open
and fair dialogue with employee representatives.

To ensure our company’s sustained success, we must have highly
qualified and motivated employees. That’s why our human resources
policy focuses especially on identifying talented individuals in the
market, developing them within the company, and binding them permanently to our enterprise.

HeidelbergCement is also committed to upholding the ILO’s core labour standards, the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises and
the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We have also enshrined this commitment in our Leadership Principles. We expect our
employees and business partners worldwide to act in conformity with
these essential guidelines and recommendations.

Our Leadership Principles specify binding personnel management
regulations. They deal with issues such as respectful treatment, employee development and our company’s pronounced feedback culture.
The main leadership principles are embedded in standard human
resources processes and described in detail in HeidelbergCement’s
Human Resources Guidelines.

Employment and co-determination
Development of workforce numbers worldwide
At the end of 2015, HeidelbergCement employed 45,453 (2014:
44,909) men and women. The increase of 544 employees was primarily the result of two opposing developments. On the one hand, we
eliminated more than 1,000 jobs, most of them in the Group areas of
Eastern Europe-Central Asia as well as in India and Indonesia. These
job cuts resulted from facility optimisation and increased efficiency at
sales and administrative units. On the other hand, the merger of our
Swedish subsidiary Abetong AB with Contiga AB to create Nordic
Precast Group AB caused our workforce to increase by almost 1,400
employees in Northern Europe. Moreover, around 200 employees
were added in Australia, mainly due to the insourcing of truck drivers.

Dialogue with employee committees
HeidelbergCement has a long tradition of employee co-determination,
which has proven its worth at our business locations in Germany. The
employee committees at the individual locations constitute the Central
Works Council and its associated committees for the company and the
Group Works Council. Moreover, employees are equally represented
on the Supervisory Board.

management level. This bonus plan pursues the same objective as the
long-term bonus plan of the Managing Board.

Employee representation committees also exist in most of the European countries. Managers and employee representatives engage in a
continuous, constructive dialogue on the European Works Council. The
council supplements the local information and consultation processes
in the various European countries.

Personnel costs and insurance contributions
In 2015 expenditures for wages, salaries, social security, pension contributions and social assistance increased by 10.9% to EUR 2,274
million (2014: EUR 2,050 million). That corresponds to 16.9% of turnover (2014: 16.3%). After adjusting for currency effects, the increase
amounted to 5.3%. Higher provisions for the ongoing long-term bonus
plans accounted for 2.3% of this increase.

In addition, there are labour unions and similar organizations in nearly
all countries in which HeidelbergCement operates. As required by our
Code of Conduct, we also engage in a fair and open dialogue with their
representatives.

Remuneration policy and work time regulation
Our remuneration systems are based on performance and results, in
accordance with the market standards for internationally operating
companies in our sector. In addition to fixed salaries, which are specified by collective bargaining agreements or individual employment
contracts, our employees also receive variable remuneration elements
that depend on individual job performance and the success of the
company.
We want the variable component to make up a large share of our
managers’ total remuneration so that their individual and joint performance and the company’s success are clearly and directly taken
into account. For the period from 2015 to 2017/18, we have created a
Group-wide long-term bonus plan for the 150 executives from our top

32

REPORT PROFILE

HeidelbergCement I Sustainability Report 2015

The employees of our foreign subsidiaries profit from attractive remuneration systems that correspond to the conditions of the respective
local labour markets. Collective regulations apply to more than half of
the Group’s employees.

The amount of the contribution to the pension scheme at HeidelbergCement corresponds to the accepted market level. In Germany, we
have created a matching model for the pension scheme, with contributions from the employer and the employees. In countries without any
statutory retirement or health insurance, we support our employees in
a manner that is at least commensurate with local practices.
Work time regulation
In our work time regulation practices, we conform to the legal requirements in effect at our locations. We promote adherence to these regulations by means of our compliance system, which enables employees to individually report possible violations (passive monitoring). To
promote flexible work time options, we offer models such as flextime,
work time accounts, part-time positions and leaves of absence to our
employees in Germany. Older employees have the option of switching
to pre-retirement part-time work. Part-time work currently accounts
for 11% of all positions at HeidelbergCement AG and for 2.2% of the
positions at the Group as a whole.

Occupational health and safety
Occupational health and safety have top priority at HeidelbergCement. Health and safety are, in fact, two of our main corporate
values. Our stated objective is to minimize the risk of accidents and
injuries, and the risk of occupational illness, by means of effective preventative measures. In our corporate guideline on occupational health
and safety we have specified our principles for promoting the health
of the workforce.
www.heidelbergcement.com/en/occupational-health-and-safety

Group standards
In the reporting year, we further improved the Group’s technical and
organisational safety standards in order to strengthen the company’s
safety culture. Occupational safety management systems that correspond to the internationally widespread OHSAS 18001 standard, for
example, have already been introduced at most of our plants. These
systems require the site managers to employ a structured approach
involving plans, clear work regulations, responsibilities and controls
in order to ensure a continuous improvement process and prevent accidents even more effectively than in the past. In 2015 several plants
in Sweden and Malaysia introduced new management systems in accordance with OHSAS 18001, while other plants were able to renew
their certifications. As a result, 77% of our operational locations
worldwide have externally certified occupational safety management
systems. Additional locations will introduce management systems in
2016.
To enable us to identify and exploit additional improvement potential,
we have supplemented the required management audits with Health
& Safety Improvement Reviews.

Occupational safety as a management task
Even though we have been continuously improving the technical and
organizational aspects of occupational health and safety for many
years now and further reduced accident frequency, serious accidents,
and even deaths, continue to occur at our facilities and the cause is
often human error.
To make it unmistakably clear that all of the management levels at
HeidelbergCement are responsible for occupational health and safety,
we once again highlighted this management responsibility in our
corporate guideline on health management and occupational safety,
which was revised in 2015. At the same time, we emphasize that every
employee, contractor and visitor is responsible for complying with the
occupational safety regulations.

Together with the Group guideline, we have also introduced a series
of basic rules that are binding for all employees and contractors.
These basic rules relate to actual accident black spots. Although
they are already covered by our Group standards, we still have to pay
attention to them at all times. In 2016 we will intensify our communication activities regarding these basic rules.
Our Group-wide Safety Week, which was first held in 2011, has now
become an integral part of our company training activities. As part of
these activities, both our employees and our customers receive occupational safety training and are made more aware of dangerous situations. The line managers have also launched and supported many local
events that demonstrate that everyone has to work together so that
occupational health and safety measures can be effective. In addition
to various occupational safety topics, the local units primarily focus on
emergency and health issues. Family members, customers and neighbours also get involved in the activities during the Safety Week.
Accident management software
In 2015 we introduced a new software for the Group-wide registration
of accidents. The software eliminates the need for manual entries, as
was previously the case, and combines the qualitative recording of
accident details with the statistical evaluation of accidents. The software will replace a series of local programs and standardise accident
investigations Group-wide. The uniform processes will make accident
analyses and the implementation of corrective and preventative measures more transparent for the responsible supervisors. We will further
enhance the software so that it can be used for other applications as
well.

REPORT PROFILE

Development of accident figures
For the first time in several years, we were unable to significantly reduce accident frequency in 2015. This is very unfortunate, especially
since many locations have now experienced no accidents for years
while others drastically reduced their accident rates. As encouraging
as the latter development is, we will have to continue to implement
the current measures and further intensify them in order to prevent
accidents everywhere and on a lasting basis. This applies especially
to locations where accident frequency rose substantially in 2015 compared to the prior year.
During the reporting year, we mourned the death of six Group employees who lost their lives as a result of work accidents. We also regret
that eight employees from external companies died, with two of them
being traffic fatalities. Although these results constitute a slight improvement on the prior year, they also clearly show that we will have to
further intensify our efforts and continue to improve our occupational
health and safety. We analyse every fatality in depth and the Managing
Board discusses all such cases. Appropriate measures are then drawn
up and shared throughout the Group in order to prevent similar accidents from happening at other locations.
Occupational illnesses
The general sick rate has been low at HeidelbergCement for many
years, amounting to around 1.8% of all hours worked.
Most of the cases of occupational illness acknowledged in recent years
have involved noise-induced hearing impairment. In addition, some
employees suffered from respiratory diseases and back problems.
To prevent job-related illnesses, we check the levels of noise and dust
at the work sites and regularly conduct medical examinations of the
employees. In countries with less-developed statutory healthcare systems, our subsidiaries offer comprehensive health check-ups for all
employees and in some instances for their families. In regions where

set up programmes to advise the employees and inform them of the
risks. These services are mostly offered through our own medical stations or the medical staff of in-house hospitals.

Human resources development
Talent management
Qualified, motivated employees are a key prerequisite for the long-term
success of our company. That’s why our Group-wide human resources
policy focuses on identifying and further developing highly talented
individuals and competing with other companies to retain them. We
use the HeidelbergCement competence model to do so. This model
defines the professional and personal talents and skills that are crucial
for our business success. It thus allows the respective supervisors to
carry out systematic Group-wide evaluations of performance and potential on the basis of standardised criteria. It also serves as a basis
for strategic executive development and effective succession planning.
Supervisors and employees hold structured human resources talks
in which they discuss development opportunities and prospects. The
dialogue is primarily geared toward senior and middle management,
experts and future executives. It helps us to attain three goals:
– To fill key positions worldwide with top-quality candidates from
within the company;
– To develop highly talented individuals in a targeted way;
– To bind talented employees to the Group over the long term by
offering individual development planning programmes.

ment plan processes for senior executives on the new IT-supported
platform HR GLOBE. At the end of 2015, we completed the platform’s
expansion to the middle management and the future executives as
scheduled.
Training and career development
Sustainable human resources work means investing in the systematic
training of our staff and thus in recruiting and training highly qualified
young employees. In Germany as a whole, 5% of our employees are involved in training programmes (2014: 5%). Around 80% of the people
who complete their traineeships are retained as permanent employees
(2014: 84%).
Technical and mechanical skills are indispensable for ensuring that
process engineering and maintenance activities are properly carried
out at our plants. Besides professional training, we therefore offer
master craftsman courses every year at the Verein Deutscher Zementwerke (VDZ).

IT-supported human resources processes
In recent years, one of the focal points of the Human Resources unit
was the global introduction of key IT-supported processes for the top,
senior and middle management levels. Since the beginning of 2013,

As was the case in the previous year, occupational safety was a key
focus of our Group-wide training and career development programmes in 2015. Around 50% of all the training measures were
devoted to this topic. Other focal points included specialist career
development (30%) and advanced management training (6%). Each
of the Group’s full-time employees spent 31 hours on training measures on average.
Our extensive training programmes cover nearly all areas of work and
are characterised by a practical and business-oriented curriculum that
enables our employees to increase their skills in a targeted way.
Management training
The motivation and skills of our managers are key reasons why
HeidelbergCement occupies such a strong position in the global competitive field. In order to prepare managers for their future assignments
and challenges, we offer training courses that are specially tailored to
the needs of our company. Training is provided in classic disciplines
such as strategy, leadership and management, and special training
options are offered in the area of engineering, for example. The stand-

ardised course content ensures that everyone at the company develops a shared understanding of strategy, leadership and integrated
management.
One of the Group’s strategic initiatives focuses on further increasing
the skills of our top managers. In the Summit programme that was
developed in close cooperation with Duke Corporate Education, all of
the Group’s top managers from 41 countries participate in a threestage curriculum. The programme focuses on general management
and leadership, and takes global, regional and local issues into account.
Securing and promoting future executives
The promotion of future executives continued to be a very important
objective during the reporting year. We always offer highly motivated
and qualified college graduates international training programmes that
focus on engineering, sales, finance, human resources, purchasing and
IT.
We continued to expand our programmes for the advancement of future executives and further intensified our global activities for the recruitment of college graduates with or without initial job experience.
In 2015 we hired a total of 296 college graduates. Around 830 employees are currently participating in programmes that prepare them
for higher-level tasks.
In 2011 we launched a pilot project in Europe and Central Asia that
prepares high-quality engineers from the cement business line for
higher-level engineering positions. After completing the introductory
Engineer in Training programme, the participants attend specific engineering courses for several years, during which they work at various
plants in Germany and abroad. This training is supplemented by additional courses in management and leadership. Since 2013 we have
been expanding this programme to other Group areas, such as Africa
and Asia.

Aggregates Academy
At the aggregates business line, the company’s Aggregates Academy
offers a comprehensive range of training and career development
opportunities. Over 1,800 managers from 18 countries were trained
in 2015. The courses offered by the Aggregates Academy are geared
towards almost all of the levels of our company’s hierarchy — from the
Managing Board as well as the top and senior managers to the plant
directors and the specialists from quality assurance and sales.
During the reporting year, we introduced additional practice-related
CREW training modules at our plants. With the help of these modules,
we want the participants to achieve key learning objectives and our
plant workers to receive further qualification in order to forge ahead
with the continuous improvement process. The Aggregates Academy has also developed several e-learning modules and video clips
as well as printed and electronic handbooks. They enable employees
to learn at their workplaces at their own pace. The training materials
and courses are generally offered in the employees’ languages. The
career development activities are supported by local managers who
have been trained in adult education techniques.
Knowledge management
Because knowledge is needed in order to gain a competitive edge, we
promote the sharing of knowledge, experiences and expertise — not
only in our business operations, but also during in-house projects and
in our cooperation with external partners. Our Knowledge Management Board, which consists of representatives from our Group areas
and functions, controls internal knowledge management and supports
our external activities in national and international bodies. Key components of our Group-wide system involve the systematic networking
of our experts — for example, through the utilisation of an integrated
online knowledge platform and a Technical Discussion Forum on our
company’s intranet. Both platforms enable access to knowledge and
promote the sharing of experiences throughout the entire Group.

Generation management
HeidelbergCement is also faced with the consequences of demographic change. Only about 14% of our employees are under 30. Most
of our employees are aged 30 to 49; they constitute about 51% of the
Group’s total workforce. A total of 35% of our employees are over 50.
This age group’s share of the workforce will rise in many countries in
future.
We are responding to this development with numerous regionally
adapted measures that are intended to maintain the employees’ ability
to work and promote cooperation between people of different generations. In Germany, for example, we have further expanded our range
of health management services and consolidated them in our FIT for
LIFE initiative. Besides encompassing a preventative programme for
the early detection of illnesses and risk factors, the initiative primarily
helps employees take a proactive approach to leading a healthy life.
The services include check-ups to prevent intestinal cancer, flu vaccinations, special “Health Days” and presentations on health-related

focus on preventing typical age-related health risks and increasing
employees’ awareness of this issue. As a result, we particularly promote company sports activities for people of all ages.
Diversity as a success factor
When putting together teams of employees, our Group-wide human
resources policy makes sure that they consist of a balanced mixture of
people with different personalities, skills and experiences. We see diversity as a management concept that brings various cultures, talents and
experiences together to create a workforce that reflects the diversity
and international scope of our markets, our customer structure and our
business environment. We achieve this goal by:
– Local country management in order to create an international
leadership team;
– Maintaining an international workforce at corporate headquarters;
– Ensuring the complementary composition of the management
and the various teams (nationality, skills, experience, age, gender
etc.);
– Ensuring the percentage of women in leadership positions is as
high as women’s share of our entire German workforce.
The goal is to recruit and promote highly qualified, top-performing
employees worldwide and apply their various social and professional
skills to contribute to our company’s business success. The international character of our management team enables us to benefit from a
varied spectrum of experiences in different cultures and thus to react
more flexibly to global challenges and also satisfy the needs of local
markets. Local managers continue to hold around 80% of all of our
senior management positions.

work at our Group headquarters. We benefit greatly from their knowledge of local markets and their presence makes it easier to cooperate
with colleagues on site. Of the 584 employees at our Group headquarters and the technology centres (Competence Center Materials
and Heidelberg Technology Center) in Heidelberg and Leimen, 424 are
from Germany and 160 are from 42 other countries all over the world.
At our company we believe diversity also means that when we are
hiring to fill management positions the ratio of women to men should
reflect the corresponding ratio in our workforce as a whole. In 2015
women accounted for 15% of the total Group workforce and 9% of
senior managers.
In Germany, HeidelbergCement and other DAX-listed companies
signed a voluntary self-commitment in 2011. As a result, we committed ourselves to more than double the share of women in management
positions in Germany: from 7% in the base year of 2011 to 15% by
2020. In 2015 women accounted for 15% of our total workforce in
Germany and held 8% of leadership positions in the top, senior, and
middle management.

advancement of future executives is already at 24% across Germany
as a whole, and thus much higher than the percentage of women in
the total workforce.
The global NOW – Network of Women also aims to promote women
at HeidelbergCement and assist them in their individual career development. This initiative connects women with one another worldwide
— virtually as well as face to face. Among other things, it offers specific
development training and provides an informal setting where women
can regularly share their ideas and experiences.

According to the law for the promotion of women in leadership positions, companies in Germany have to specify concrete targets for the
two management levels below that of the Managing Board. The first
of these two levels consists of the HeidelbergCement executives who,
in their main position, report directly to the Managing Board, while the
second level encompasses their employees with leadership responsibilities.
In 2015 women held 10% of the positions on the first level and 9%
on the second level. HeidelbergCement has decided to retain its target for the two levels from its self-commitment, but to pull the target-achievement date forward to mid-2017. This means that by 30th
June 2017, we want women to hold 14% of the positions on the first
management level below that of the Managing Board and 15% of the
positions on the second level. As a result, the percentage of women in
leadership positions would then correspond to their share of our entire
German workforce. Our decision to pull the target-achievement date
forward to mid-2017 demonstrates that we have forged ahead with
the promotion of women in recent years and achieved successes in
this regard. For example, the share of women in programmes for the

Reconciling work and family
In competing for the best employees, we are making adjustments
worldwide in line with changing lifestyles. In support of our employees who must reconcile their family and professional responsibilities,
we rely on models such as flextime, part-time and leave of absence.
Part-time work currently accounts for 11% of all positions at HeidelbergCement AG. Given the small size of our facilities, cooperation with
external networks has provided good solutions for support services
such as daycare centres, summer camps for children and the care of
family members who require assistance. This enables our employees
to benefit from easy access to a professional and flexible network
at affordable costs. As part of our FIT for FAMILY initiative, we have
formed partnerships with daycare centres for our location in Heidelberg. In this way, we can offer a number of daycare slots specifically
for our employees.

As a global company with strong regional ties, we are dedicated
to the principle of “Think globally, act locally”. Our business operations create value for our company and for the communities all
over the world in which we are based. We do more than simply
conduct business in these communities; we also take measures
that protect the environment and promote social progress.

Corporate citizenship

Good cooperative relationships with the communities in the areas
where we are active are indispensable for our business operations
and also one of the keys to our business success. Here, we establish
business contacts, capitalise on local know-how and maintain a dialogue with our neighbours. Our materiality analysis has confirmed that
good relations with local communities is extremely important, especially from the viewpoint of our internal stakeholders. That’s why we
will take local communities into account to a greater extent in our
revised Sustainability Programme 2020.

This understanding of our role forms the basis for our Group-wide
Corporate Citizenship Guideline, which lays down the general criteria
and objectives relating to our social responsibility. We revised the
guideline in 2015. We paid special attention here to corporate citizenship activities within the framework of investment projects, as such
activities could be misconstrued as an attempt to exert influence. The
reworked guideline therefore expressly requires compliance with the
relevant stipulations of our Anti-Corruption Guideline.

Materiality analysis: p. 12

We aim to create value not only for our company but also for the communities in which we operate. Wherever possible, we therefore make
sure that local employees are selected to manage operations at our
locations. Over the past three years, local managers have held 80% of
the senior management positions at our various sites. All of our plants
work closely with local suppliers and service providers, and we invest
around 90% of our procurement volume in the immediate vicinity of
our plants or within the respective countries. In this way, and through
the creation of jobs, we contribute to creating value at our locations
and promote economic development by means of wages, investment,
purchases and taxes.

Our corporate responsibility is not limited to our business processes
and their direct impact. We are also a part of society, and we benefit
from the regional networks at our locations worldwide. We therefore
also play an active role in addressing social issues.

Our social responsibility focuses on three areas in which our core competencies enable us to benefit others the most and achieve noticeable
improvements:
– Construction, architecture and infrastructure: We offer practical
assistance in construction projects by providing materials, time,
financial assistance and know-how.
– Environment, climate and biodiversity: We support initiatives that
address the most significant environmental impacts associated
with our business operations.
– Education, training and culture: Here, we tailor our activities to
the specific needs of each region.

We have also defined certain evaluation criteria in order to ensure that
these activities are both transparent and effective. We support projects, initiatives and organisations that are active at our locations, or
to which we have a direct link. We also make sure that the guidelines
and principles of such organisations are in accordance with our own
corporate philosophy.
The decisions regarding our support of projects in individual countries
or at our locations are made decentrally by country managers on the
basis of a predefined budget. These managers are also responsible for
implementing and controlling projects as well as for local reporting.
Group Communication & Investor Relations is responsible for reporting on Group-wide corporate citizenship activities within the framework of our sustainability-related communication measures.
The exact wording of our Corporate Citizenship Guideline:
www.heidelbergcement.com/en/society

Our CSR expert group, which was established in 2014, has begun
documenting various corporate citizenship activities and has also
produced a handbook for community relationship management. A
planned internal platform for knowledge transfer and the sharing of
experiences will be established in 2016 and made available throughout the Group. The expert group also plans to introduce a system that
will facilitate the selection and evaluation of CSR projects.

Practical examples
Center of Entrepreneurship
At the end of November 2015, we opened a Center of Entrepreneurship at our Tabligbo plant, Togo. The center offers training courses
to residents from the surrounding communities and also assists with
the establishment of small businesses and companies. However, the
center, which is funded by the HeidelbergCement Togo Foundation,
will also be used for social and cultural events. A committee made
up of representatives from the communities and the foundation will

ensure that projects that promote sustainability are funded and that
disadvantaged groups such as young people and women are supported. The foundation’s general support of entrepreneurship is meant
to promote the economic and social development of the region.
Solar energy from kiosks
The HeidelbergCement Togo Foundation has also launched a project
with expert assistance from the energy company Solergie: A solar
kiosk that generates electricity has been installed in each of five villages located in the vicinity of our Tabligbo plant. Some 300 households not connected to the power grid can now use these kiosks to
recharge batteries for their lamps and mobile phones, which means
they no longer have to rely on petroleum or expensive batteries. Five
additional solar kiosks will be built in 2016.

Israel in a legally binding ruling on 26 December 2011. The quarrying
of aggregates was thus deemed as being in compliance with international law.
Nevertheless, non-governmental organisations and interest groups
repeatedly demand that we explain and clarify various aspects of the
business activities of Hanson Israel in the West Bank. We have carefully examined this issue with our local management team and are
engaging in a dialogue on the local level. We also take care to ensure
that our Israeli and Palestinian employees are treated and paid equally.
Here, we place great priority on close cooperation in intercultural
teams that promote an exchange between our Israeli and Palestinian
employees and thus understanding between these two groups in a
conflict-ridden region.
KIS – Cooperation Industry-School education initiative
In 2000 HeidelbergCement launched its nationwide “KIS – Cooperation Industry-School” education initiative in Germany. We are
now working with ten schools just in Heidelberg, where our Group
headquarters is located, and we have 25 school cooperation partners throughout Germany. The goal of KIS is to teach students principles of economics and economic relationships and enable education
with high practical relevance at schools. The initiative offers everything from practice-oriented instruction modules to presentations by
HeidelbergCement employees, job-application training, continuing
education for teachers and tours of company plants and quarries.

Local conflicts of interest

The Palestinian people also benefit economically from our quarrying
activities. For example, we pay a quarrying tax to the Israeli civil administration in the West Bank, which uses the funds to maintain local
infrastructure and promote economic development. Our activities also
create good jobs in an area otherwise plagued by high unemployment.
Palestinians from the occupied territories account for more than 60%
of the workforce in our quarry in the West Bank, and the wages we
pay them are many times higher than the local average. Moreover, our
quarrying activities have virtually no impact on the existing raw material reserves in the region, which will last for several centuries.
We received all required permits, without exception, before we commenced our quarrying activities. In addition, there has never been a
single instance in which we continued our quarrying activities without
permission, and no such instances will ever occur in future.

Over the last few years, allegations have been made in Israel that our
business operations are not in conformity with international standards.
A lawsuit filed by an Israeli human rights organisation concerning the
general cessation of aggregates mining by foreign companies in occupied territory was, however, dismissed by the Supreme Court of

About this report
HeidelbergCement is publishing a Group Sustainability Report for the seventh time. In
this publication we explain how HeidelbergCement is fulfilling its economic, environmental and social responsibilities and report on the progress we have made in 2015 in the
implementation of our Sustainability Ambitions. The report targets our employees, investors and analysts, business partners, as well as political players and non-governmental
G4-18, G4-24
organisations.
Report content and organisation
This sustainability report has been prepared according to the latest guidelines of the
internationally recognized Global Reporting Initiative (GRI 4). The report conforms to the
requirements of the “Core” option of the GRI G4 guidelines.

We report our key figures for environmental performance and occupational safety according to the guidelines of the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) of the World Business
Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD).
The guidelines in their original wording: www.wbcsdcement.org/publications

Some of the key figures on environmental protection and occupational safety from the
cement business line were subject to an independent limited assurance, as required by
our membership in CSI. The review also fulfils the wish of our stakeholders to have key
G4-27 The results of this audit can be found on our
indicators independently verified.
website:
www.heidelbergcement.com/assurance

Our complete GRI Index: www.heidelbergcement.com/GRI-index

Our decisions concerning the most important sustainability themes for the articles in our report
were guided by the GRI principles (materiality, inclusion of stakeholders, sustainability context,
completeness). We continuously refine our reporting processes in line with these standards.
G4-18

In accordance with these principles, we already streamlined the reporting on target
achievement in our Sustainability Report 2013/14 and oriented it more closely to the results
of the materiality analysis. We have eliminated targets that were immaterial or difficult to
measure. This is a preparatory measure that is part of the preparation of our new SustainG4-23
ability Ambitions.
Precise definition and methodology of the report
This Sustainability Report for 2015 deals with the business year 2015 of the HeidelbergCement Group. The business year ran from 1 January to 31 December. The key facts and
figures included in this report correspond to those in the consolidated financial statements and the management report of HeidelbergCement’s Annual Report for 2015. This
is also the case for the facts and figures concerning our workforce.
You can find information about the indicators G4-17 in the Annual Report 2015,

Data collection
Methods and systems that have been defined Group-wide are used to collect data at
our business locations. Internal reporting and consolidation of the data take place via
centralised electronic KPI data management systems at the Group; here the key figures
are checked for completeness and credibility. Uniform Group-wide definitions of all the
relevant key figures, as well as process guidelines for the reporting processes, are available on the intranet.
Information about the editing process
This Sustainability Report is published in German and English. The editorial deadline was
30 May 2016. The previous Sustainability Report was published in July 2015. In line with
the new annual reporting cycle, the next report will be published in 2017.
Disclaimer of liability
We have compiled the information and key figures contained in this report with extreme
care. All of the contents of this report were examined by the employees responsible for
this task. However, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that this report includes
erroneous information. The report and the information contained in it do not constitute
a test of compliance with the current laws, legal regulations or recognised sustainability
practices in the industry.
