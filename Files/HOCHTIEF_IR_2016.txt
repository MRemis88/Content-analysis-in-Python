2016.
The quality of our profits is illustrated by our cash generation performance. Net cash flow from operating activities increased to EUR 1.2 billion, helped by a further improvement in our management of working capital. We
are consistently converting profit into cash, as evidenced
by an outstanding EBITDA cash-conversion rate of 106%
(versus 99% in 2015). It is pleasing to note that all our

morrow”—and embraces the Group’s principles.1)
Our sustainability strategy pursues clear objectives and
addresses the needs and aspirations of our stakeholders.
Actively shaping business opportunities, lever­
aging market potential, and minimizing risks:
To achieve this, we develop and implement innovative
products and services. We deliver customized, resourceconserving solutions and bring cutting-edge technologies into play. Our end-to-end approach to projects lets
us create one-of-a-kind solutions with a high level of
quality throughout.
We are committed to achieving this goal by applying
Group-wide occupational safety, health, and social
standards as well as conduct and compliance guidelines, such as our Code of Conduct. In many cases,
these internal benchmarks exceed statutory requirements.
Our pursuit of sustainable activities takes its cue from
the HOCHTIEF business model. In the process, we take
into consideration our stakeholders’ views and interests.
The feedback we receive through materiality analyses
and direct dialog with stakeholders, for instance, helps
us identify relevant topics and distill them into six focus

Thanks to its global nature, solid financial position and
great flexibility, HOCHTIEF is excellently positioned to
take advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead in our
regional markets. This enables us to react quickly to
changing market conditions. Relevant projects will soon
come to our markets in North America, the Asia-Pacific
region, and Europe, for instance. HOCHTIEF aims to
achieve an operational net profit in the range of EUR
410–450 million in 2017.
In its project activities, HOCHTIEF considers financial,
environmental, and social aspects. We champion sustainable, responsible business and also integrate our
business partners, subcontractors, and suppliers into
our objectives. This is why HOCHTIEF has again combined financial and sustainability reporting in a single

performance was the important improvement achieved
on the working capital front, a key performance indicator

Code recommendation may be used to challenge

Group Management Report

With regard to the recommendation given in Section
4.2.3, paragraph 2, sixth sentence of the Code—that
the amount of compensation be capped, both overall
and for variable compensation components—we note
that the contracts with the members of our Executive
Board, as well as providing for a fixed salary, include
caps on the amounts of all variable compensation el­
ements. Supplementary to this, the Supervisory Board
has reserved the right, in addition to the fixed annual
salary and the variable compensation components, to
grant at its own discretion a one-off payment for exceptional performance. The contracts also provide for normal fringe benefits (private use of company car, accident
insurance, etc.). There is no cap on the amount of any
one-off payment for exceptional performance or on the
value of fringe benefits because it does not appear necessary for such amounts to be capped in accordance
with the letter and spirit of the Code recommendation
and, in our legal appraisal, the Code recommendation
does not extend to this. For the same reason, such payments and benefits are not covered by any cap on the
amount of overall compensation.

In 2016, the long-established annual Occupational Safety

the banner of identifying hazards and judging risks.
Topics addressed included unsafe routines, after-effects
of drugs and alcohol, and smartphone use. Besides

Notes to the consolidated financial
statements
Accounting policies
General information
The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) as adopted by the EU and with supplementary provisions of German commercial law applicable under Section 315a (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). There have been no changes to the accounting policies during the reporting year.
Alongside the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the
Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Consolidated Financial Statements also include a Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. Segment reporting is provided in these Notes.
For purposes of understandability, various items are combined in the Balance Sheet and in the Statement of
Earnings. These items are broken down into their constituents and commented on elsewhere in these Notes. The
Statement of Earnings is presented using the nature of expense method.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in euros.
As an independent listed group, HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen, Germany, Court of Registration: Essen
District Court, HRB 279, publishes its own consolidated financial statements, which are also included in the consolidated financial statements of ACS Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A., Madrid, Spain (ACS).
The Consolidated Financial Statements relate to the year 2016, comprising the reporting period from January 1 to
December 31, 2016.
The Executive Board of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft released the financial statements for publication on February 24, 2017. They will be approved at the Supervisory Board meeting on February 27, 2017.
Scope of consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements generally include HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft as well as all German
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

and foreign subsidiaries that are controlled directly or indirectly. This generally goes hand in hand with a majority
shareholding. Seven companies are fully consolidated by virtue of contractual arrangements. Associates and
joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Companies in which HOCHTIEF Aktien­gesellschaft
holds a majority of voting rights but over which it exercises joint control by contractual arrangement with other
parties are likewise accounted for using the equity method unless classified as joint operations.

170

Group Report 2016

Holdings in subsidiaries or associated companies or joint ventures deemed to be of minor overall significance from
a Group perspective are not consolidated and are accounted for in accordance with IAS 39.
A number of the subsidiaries included in the Consolidated Financial Statements make partial use of the exempting
provisions in either Section 264 (3) or Section 264b of the German Commercial Code. A list of the companies that
make use of these exemptions is included on pages 246 and 247.
The Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2016 include HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and a total
of 55 German and 430 foreign consolidated companies as well as four special-purpose investment funds (Spezialfonds). The number of consolidated companies increased by 30 compared with the previous year. The number of
special-purpose investment funds stayed the same. A total of two German and 80 foreign companies were consolidated for the first time in the reporting year. The additions were in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division (71), the
HOCHTIEF Ameri­cas division (9), and the HOCHTIEF Europe division (2). A total of five German and 47 foreign
companies were removed from the consolidated group. The companies removed from the consolidated group
mainly related to the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division (19), the HOCHTIEF Europe division (17), and the HOCHTIEF
Americas division (15). An entity is generally added to or removed from the consolidated group at the time the
equity stake in the entity is acquired or disposed of.
Thirty-eight affiliated companies of minor overall significance to the Group’s financial position and results of operations were not consolidated. Their combined sales represented less than 1% of consolidated sales.
Sixteen domestic and 156 foreign associates were accounted for using the equity method. This number declined by
a total of 10 companies, with 22 companies added and 32 removed. Most of the additions were in the HOCHTIEF
Asia Pacific division (14) and the HOCHTIEF Americas division (6). The removals related to the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific
division (14) and the HOCHTIEF Americas and HOCHTIEF Europe divisions (9 each). Due to their minor overall significance, a further 13 companies were not accounted for using the equity method.
A total of 63 joint operations from the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division are included in the Consolidated Financial
Statements in relation to the interest in these joint operations. In the reporting year, 13 entities were added and

nine removed.

Acquisition—UGL Limited
On October 10, 2016, the CIMIC Group, through its subsidiary CIMIC Group Investments No. 2 Pty Limited (CGI2),
acquired 13.84% of the issued shares of Australian services group UGL Limited (“UGL”) and gave notice in a takeover bid that it wished to acquire the shares not yet held at a price of AUD 3.15 per share. Effective November 24,
2016, CIMIC increased its interest to over 50% and consequently consolidated UGL. The interest as of the December 31, 2016 balance sheet date was 95%. Acquisition of the remaining shares was completed on January 20,
2017. CIMIC now holds 100% of the shares.
The provisional fair values of the identified assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date are as follows:

(EUR million)
Intangible assets
Property, plant and equipment
Equity-method investments and other financial assets
Income tax assets and deferred tax assets
Inventories
Trade receivables and other receivables

The acquisition was accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3. Non-controlling interests in the acquiree were meas­
ured at the present ownership instruments’ proportionate share in the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The purchase price transferred for obtaining the non-controlling interests was EUR 167.3 million
as of December 31, 2016. An amount of EUR 19.7 million was recognized as a liability for outstanding shares. The
acquisition resulted in recognition of goodwill in the amount of EUR 323.7 million based on UGL’s expected future profitability, its expertise, as well as expected synergies from the takeover. The goodwill is not deductible for
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

tax purposes.
From the acquisition date to the December 31, 2016 balance sheet date, UGL contributed EUR 137.5 million to sales
and EUR 3.6 million to profit after tax. Had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2016, UGL’s contribution to the
Group for the year ended December 31, 2016 would have been EUR 1,335.4 million revenue and EUR 70.2 million
of loss after tax. The loss includes EUR 134.7 million of provisions recorded prior to acquisition on the Ichthys
project—in the CIMIC Group as of the balance sheet date.
Acquisition—Sedgman Pty Limited
On January 13, 2016, the CIMIC Group, through its subsidiary CIMIC Group Investments Pty Limited, gave notice
in a takeover bit that it wished to acquire the 63.01% ownership interest not yet held in publicly listed mining services
group Sedgman Limited, New South Wales, Australia (“Sedgman”). CIMIC increased its interest and thereby gained

172

Group Report 2016

control of Sedgman on February 23, 2016. The acquisition of the remaining shares was completed on April 13,
2016. As a result, CIMIC now holds 100% of the shares.
The fair values of the identified assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date are as follows:

(EUR million)
Intangible assets
Property, plant and equipment
Equity-method investments and other financial assets
Income tax assets and deferred tax assets
Trade receivables and other receivables

The acquisition is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3. The total purchase consideration comprises cash paid
of EUR 3.8 million on the date of obtaining control and the fair value of the previously held equity interest in the amount
of EUR 70.4 million. Non-controlling interests in the acquiree are measured at the present ownership instruments’
proportionate share in the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The acquisition resulted in
recognition of goodwill in the amount of EUR 41.4 million based on Sedgman’s expected future profitability, its expertise, as well as the expected synergies from the takeover. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.
The acquisition as a whole resulted in a gain before tax of EUR 31.4 million comprising remeasurement of the equity
interest (EUR 17.1 million) and recycling of the reserves of associated equity interests (EUR 14.3 million) previously
held by the CIMIC Group. Sedgman contributed EUR 150.6 million to CIMIC Group sales from the acquisition date
to the December 31, 2016 balance sheet date. Had the acquisition occurred as of January 1, 2016, Sedgman’s contribution to Group sales would have been EUR 172.2 million. It is not possible to assess the contribution of the
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

business to profit for the year because of the full integration of Sedgman into the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division.
Consolidation policies
The financial statements of German and foreign companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements are
prepared in accordance with uniform Group accounting principles. All business combinations are accounted for
using the acquisition method. Business combinations are measured at the acquisition date by allocating the consideration given to the acquired subsidiary’s net assets measured at fair value. Transaction costs arising in connection with such acquisitions are recognized directly as expense. All assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities of an
acquired subsidiary that satisfy the recognition criteria are measured at full fair value regardless of any non-controlling interest. In accordance with the optional treatment under IFRS 3, non-controlling interest is measured at
the acquisition date at either fair value or the present ownership instruments’ proportionate share in the recognized
amounts of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets. Intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill if they

Group Report 2016

173

are separable from the reporting entity or arise from contractual or other legal rights. Any remaining positive difference is recognized as goodwill. Goodwill is not subjected to scheduled amortization, but is tested instead for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 on an annual basis and whenever there are indications that the value may be
impaired. A remaining negative difference arising from the initial measurement is recognized in profit and loss.
On divestment, a pro rata share of the divesting division’s goodwill is taken into account when measuring disposal
proceeds.
Income, expenses, receivables, and liabilities between consolidated companies are eliminated. Unrealized intercompany profits and losses are eliminated unless they are of minor significance. Any impairment losses recognized for consolidated companies that are incluced in the consolidated financial statements are reversed.
The same policies apply to equity-method investments. These include the Group’s associates and joint ventures.
Any goodwill increases the carrying amount of an investment. Like other goodwill, goodwill on equity-method investments is not subject to scheduled amortization. Reductions in carrying amount due to impairment are included in the share of profits and losses of equity-method associates and joint ventures. The financial statements of all
equity-method investments are prepared in accordance with uniform Group accounting policies.
Non-current assets held for sale
In view of the intention to sell, mining assets of PT Thiess Contractors Indonesia (HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division)
are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 as assets held for sale. An agreement for the sale of the assets was
signed in January 2016 and largely put into effect during the year under review.
The remaining assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale and presented separately in the balance sheet.
The table below shows the major classes of assets and liabilities held for sale. No amount is additionally recognized in other comprehensive income.

In their separate financial statements, Group companies disclose transactions denominated in foreign currency using
the average exchange rate on the day of recording the transaction. Exchange gains or losses up to the reporting date
on the measurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets or liabilities are included in other operating
income or other operating expenses at the average exchange rate on the reporting date. Currency translation differences relating to a net investment in a foreign company are accounted for in accumulated other comprehensive
income until the company is sold. This includes foreign currency receivables from fully consolidated Group companies
for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future and which therefore resemble
equity.
Financial statements of foreign companies are translated by applying the functional currency approach. As all companies outside the euro zone operate autonomously in their own national currencies, their balance sheet items are
translated into euros using the average exchange rate prevailing on the reporting date in accordance with official
requirements. The same method is used to translate the shareholders’ equity of equity-method foreign associates
following equity-method adjustment. Differences from the previous year’s translated amount are recognized in other
comprehensive income and are reversed to income or expense on sale of the equity interest. Goodwill of commercially independent foreign Group entities is translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the reporting date. Income
and expense items are translated into euros using the annual average exchange rate.
Accounting policies
Intangible assets are reported at amortized cost. All intangible assets have a finite useful life with the exception
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

of company names recognized as assets on initial consolidation and of goodwill. Intangible assets include concessions
and other licenses with useful lives of up to 30 years. These are amortized according to the pattern of consumption
of economic benefits. They also include future earnings from additions to the order backlog arising from business
acquisitions; these are amortized over the period in which the corresponding work is billed. Intangible assets
further encompass software for commercial and engineering applications, which is amortized on a straight-line
basis over three to five years, and entitlements to various financing arrangements with banks amortized over a
maximum of ten years in accordance with the term of the arrangement. Estimated useful lives and depreciation
methods are reviewed annually.

Group Report 2016

175

Company names and goodwill are not subject to scheduled amortization. They are tested instead for impairment
in accordance with IAS 36 on an annual basis and whenever there are indications that they may be impaired. The
company names recognized in the HOCHTIEF Americas and HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific divisions were classified
as intangible assets with an indefinite useful life as they do not have a product life cycle and are not subject to
technical, technological, or commercial depletion or any other restriction.
Capitalized development costs are reported in intangible assets and amortized on a straight-line basis over three
to five years.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at its cost less accumulated depreciation. Only amounts directly attributable
to an item of property, plant or equipment are included in its cost. Borrowing costs are included in cost in the case
of qualifying assets. Property, plant and equipment is normally depreciated on a straight-line basis, except in the
contract mining business, where depreciation is mostly recognized on an activity basis.
Items of property, plant, machinery, and equipment typically encountered in the HOCHTIEF Group are depreciated
on a straight-line basis over the following Group-wide uniform useful lives:
No. of years
Buildings and investment properties
Technical equipment and machinery; ­transportation equipment
Other equipment and office equipment

20–50
3–10
3–8

Estimated useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed annually.
Items of property, plant and equipment classified as finance leases are recognized at fair value or the present
value of the minimum lease payments, whichever is lower, and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives or over a shorter contract term if applicable.
Investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Transaction costs are included on initial
measurement. The fair values of investment properties are disclosed in the Notes. The fair values are measured
using internationally accepted valuation methods, such as taking comparable properties as a guide to current
market prices or by applying the discounted cash flow method. As with property, plant and equipment, investment
properties are normally depreciated using the straight-line method.
Impairment losses are recognized for intangible assets (including goodwill), property, plant and equipment, or
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

investment properties if their recoverable amount falls below their carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an
asset or cash-generating unit is defined as fair value less cost of disposal or value in use, whichever is higher.
Impairment testing may require assets and, in some cases, liabilities to be grouped into cash-generating units. For
goodwill, impairment testing is performed on cash-generating units corresponding to the HOCHTIEF divisions that
feature in segmental reporting. For any asset that is part of an independent cash-generating unit, impairment is
determined with reference to the recoverable amount of the unit. If the recoverable amount of a cash-generating
unit falls below its carrying amount, the resulting impairment loss is allocated first to any goodwill belonging to the
unit and then to the unit’s other assets, normally pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset. Except in
the case of goodwill, impairment charges are reversed (up to a maximum of amortized cost) when the impairment
ceases to exist.

Group Report 2016

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

A joint arrangement is an arrangement in which two or more parties have joint control. The parties to a joint arrangement classify it as a joint operation or a joint venture depending on their respective rights and obligations. In a joint
operation, the parties have direct rights to the assets and direct obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. Each party recognizes assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, in relation to its interests in a joint operation, relative to the HOCHTIEF Group’s rights and obligations. In a joint venture, where the parties have rights to
the net assets arising from the arrangement, the parties each account for their interests in the joint venture using
the equity method.
Equity-method investments are stated at cost, comprising the acquired equity interest in an associate or joint
venture plus any goodwill. The carrying amount is increased or decreased annually to recognize the Group’s share
of after-tax profits or losses, any dividends, and other changes in equity. The full carrying amount is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 whenever there are indications that it may be impaired. If the recoverable amount
of an equity-method investment is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.
Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss.
All other financial assets, comprising interests in non-consolidated subsidiaries, other participating interests,
and non-current securities, are classed as available for sale and are measured at fair value where a fair value can
be reliably estimated. In the case of publicly listed financial assets, fair value is determined as the market price. If
there is no active market, fair value is calculated using the most recent market transactions or a valuation method
such as the discounted cash flow method. In cases where fair value cannot be measured reliably, financial assets
are reported at cost (less any impairments). Initial measurement is performed as of the settlement date. Unrealized
gains or losses are accounted for, after adjusting for deferred taxation, in other comprehensive income and are
reversed to income or expense on disposal of the asset. If there is objective evidence of impairment, the carrying
amount of an asset is reduced and the impairment loss recognized as an expense. Such evidence includes a
significant or prolonged decline in fair value below cost.
Long-term loans are stated at amortized cost. Loans yielding interest at normal market rates are reported at face
value, and non-interest-bearing and low-interest-bearing loans are discounted to present value. Discounting is always
done using a risk-adjusted discount rate.
Receivables and other assets are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method (accounting for factors such as premiums and discounts). An impairment loss is recognized if there is any objective material
evidence that a financial asset may be impaired. Objective evidence for impairment includes, for example, downgrading of a debtor’s credit rating and related interruptions in payment or potential insolvency. Impairment losses
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

are recognized according to actual credit risk. “Receivables” comprise financial receivables, trade receivables, and
other receivables. Sales are shown net of VAT and other taxes and expected reductions such as trade discounts
and rebates. Sales of goods are recognized when:
• The significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer
• The HOCHTIEF Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with
ownership nor effective control over the goods sold
• The amount of revenue and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured
reliably
• It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the HOCHTIEF Group.

Revenue from transactions involving the rendering of services is recognized by reference to the stage of completion. Revenue under construction contracts is recognized as described in the following.
*See glossary on page 258.

Construction contracts are accounted for using the percentage of completion* (POC) method. Cumulative work
done to date, including the Group’s share of net profit, is reported under sales on a pro rata basis according to the
percentage completed. The percentage of completion is measured by reference to the stage of completion; that is,
as the ratio of performance delivered up to the end of the reporting period to total contract performance. Construction contracts are reported in trade receivables and trade payables, as “Gross amount due from/to customers for/
from contract work (POC).” If cumulative work done to date (contract costs plus contract net profit) on contracts in
progress exceeds progress payments received, the difference is recognized as an asset and included in amounts
due from customers for contract work. If the net amount after deduction of progress payments received is negative,
the difference is recognized as a liability and included in amounts due to customers from contract work. Anticipated
losses on specific contracts are accounted for on the basis of the identifiable risks. Construction contracts handled
by construction joint ventures are also accounted for using the POC method. Trade receivables from construction
joint ventures include pro rata entitlements to contract net profit. Anticipated losses are immediately recognized in
full in contract net profit. Contract income on construction contracts undertaken by the Group independently or in
construction joint ventures is recognized in accordance with IAS 11 as the income stipulated in the contract plus
any claims and variation orders. Construction contract receivables are realized within one operating cycle at the
HOCHTIEF Group. In accordance with IAS 1, they are therefore included in current assets even though they are
not expected to be realized in full within twelve months of the balance sheet date.
The POC method is primarily used in the mainstream construction business, construction management, and contract mining.
Deferred taxes arising from temporary differences between the IFRS accounts and tax base of individual Group
companies or as a result of consolidation are recognized as separate assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are
also recognized for tax refund entitlements resulting from the anticipated use of existing tax loss carryforwards in
subsequent years provided it is sufficiently certain that they will be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
offset within each company or tax group. Deferred taxes are measured on the basis of tax rates applying or expected to apply in each country when they are realized. For domestic operations, as in the prior year, a tax rate of
31.5% is assumed, taking account of corporate income tax plus the German “solidarity surcharge” and the average rate of municipal trade tax faced by Group companies. For all other purposes, deferred taxes are measured

Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

on the basis of the tax regulations in force or enacted at the reporting date.

178

Group Report 2016

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Inventories are initially stated at cost of purchase or production. Production cost includes costs directly related to
the units of production plus an appropriate allocation of materials and production overhead, including productionrelated depreciation charges. Borrowing costs for inventories that are qualifying assets are capitalized as part of
cost. Most materials and supplies are measured using first-in-first-out, the rest using weighted average. Inventories
are written down to net realizable value if their recoverable amount is less than their carrying amount at the reporting date. Should the recoverable amount of inventories subsequently increase, the resulting gain must be recognized. This is done by reducing materials expense.
All marketable securities are classed as held for sale and measured at fair value. They mainly comprise securities
held in special-purpose and investment funds as well as fixed-income securities with a residual term of more than
three months at the time of acquisition and where there is no intention to hold the securities to maturity. Initial meas­
urement is performed as of the settlement date and includes any transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the securities. Unrealized gains or losses are reported in other comprehensive income and are reversed to
income or expense on disposal. If there is objective evidence of impairment, the carrying amount of an asset is
reduced and the impairment loss recognized as an expense. Such evidence includes a significant or prolonged
decline in fair value below cost.
Cash and cash equivalents consist of petty cash, cash balances at banks, and marketable securities with maturities
of no more than three months at the time of acquisition that are subject to insignificant fluctuations in value only.
Non-current assets held for sale and associated liabilities are measured in accordance with IFRS 5 and
presented separately in the current section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. To be classed as assets held for
sale, assets must be available for immediate sale and their sale must be highly probable. Assets held for sale can
be individual non-current assets, groups of assets held for sale (disposal groups), or discontinued operations. A
component of an entity is a discontinued operation if it represents a separate major line of business or geographical
area of operations and is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a major line of business or geographical
area of operations, or if it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Liabilities disposed of with assets
in a single transaction are part of a disposal group or discontinued operation. Non-current assets held for sale cease
to be depreciated or amortized, and are measured at their carrying amount or at fair value less costs to sell, whichever
is lower. Gains or losses arising on the measurement of individual assets held for sale or of disposal groups are
reported in the Statement of Earnings under profit or loss from continuing operations until their ultimate disposal.
Conversely, gains or losses arising on the measurement of discontinued operations at fair value less costs to sell,
profits or losses of discontinued operations, and gains or losses on their disposal are presented separately in the
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

Statement of Earnings under profit or loss from discontinued operations.

Share-based payment transactions are measured in accordance with IFRS 2. Stock option plans are accounted
for Group-wide as cash-settled share-based payment transactions. Provisions for obligations under the Long-term
Incentive Plans and Top Executive Retention Plans are recognized in the amount of the expected expense that is
or was spread over the stipulated waiting period. The fair value of stock options is measured using generally accepted
financial models, the value of the plans being determined with the Black/Scholes option pricing model. The specific
problem of valuing the plans in question is solved using binomial tree methods. The computations are performed
by an outside appraiser.
Provisions for pensions and similar obligations are recognized for current and future benefit payments to
active and former employees and their surviving dependants. The obligations primarily relate to pension benefits,
partly for basic pensions and partly for optional supplementary pensions. Varying from one country to another, the
individual benefit obligations are determined for the most part by length of service and pay scales. The Turner Group’s
obligations to meet healthcare costs for retired staff are likewise included in pension provisions due to their pensionlike nature. Provisions for pensions and similar obligations are computed by the projected unit credit method. This
determines the present value of future entitlements, taking into account current and future benefits already known
at the reporting date plus anticipated future increases in salaries and pensions and, for the Turner Group, in healthcare costs. The computation is based on actuarial appraisals using biometric accounting principles. Plan assets as
defined in IAS 19 are shown separately as deductions from pension obligations. Plan assets comprise assets transferred to pension funds to meet pension obligations, shares in investment funds purchased under deferred compensation arrangements, and qualifying insurance policies in the form of pension liability insurance. If the fair value of
plan assets is greater than the present value of employee benefits, the difference is reported—subject to the limit
in IAS 19—under other non-current assets.
Amounts ensuing from the remeasurement of defined benefit plans are recognized directly in equity in the period
during which they arise. The current service cost is reported under personnel costs. The net interest component,
comprising the interest element of the increase in pension obligations less the anticipated returns on plan assets
(each calculated using the discount factor for the pension obligations), is reported in net investment and interest
income.
Tax provisions comprise current tax obligations. Income tax provisions are offset against tax refund entitlements
if they relate to the same tax jurisdiction and are congruent in nature and timing.
Other provisions account for all identifiable obligations as of the reporting date that result from past business transactions or events but are uncertain in their amount and/or settlement date. Provisions are stated at the estimated
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

settlement amount, i.e. after making allowance for price and cost increases, and are not offset against any rights to
reimbursement. For obligations with a settlement probability exceeding 50%, the amount set aside is calculated on
the basis of the most likely settlement outcome. A provision can only be recognized on the basis of a legal or constructive obligation toward third parties. Non-current provisions are stated at the present value of the estimated settlement
amount as of the reporting date and reported under non-current liabilities.

180

Group Report 2016

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Liabilities are reported at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method (accounting for factors such as
premiums and discounts). Finance lease liabilities are initially recognized at fair value at the inception of the lease
or the present value of the minimum lease payments, whichever is lower.
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value regardless of their purpose and reported under other
receivables and other assets or other liabilities. Initial measurement is as of the settlement date. All derivative financial instruments are measured on the basis of current market rates as of the balance sheet date. The recognition
of changes in fair value depends on the purpose for which a derivative is held. Derivatives are only ever used in the
HOCHTIEF Group for hedging purposes. Hedges are structured for maximum effectiveness. A cash flow hedge is
a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows from a hedged item, as with the hedging of variable rate loans
to counter variations in payment amounts due to interest rate changes. Unrealized gains and losses are initially recognized in equity, taking account of deferred taxes. The portion of the changes in value initially recognized in equity is
reclassified to income or expense as soon as the hedged item is recognized in income or expense. If a hedged
planned transaction subsequently results in recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, gains or losses
recognized in equity in the meantime are reclassified to income or expense in the period when the financial asset
or financial liability affects income. If a hedged planned transaction subsequently results in recognition of a nonfinancial asset or liability, gains or losses recognized in equity in the meantime are taken out of equity and subtracted
from or added to the initial cost of the asset or liability. In the cases described, only the portion of changes in value
that are determined to be effective for hedging purposes are recognized in equity. The ineffective portion is recognized directly as income or expense. In the HOCHTIEF Group, only cash flow hedges are entered into. Derivatives are also used for economic hedging purposes where no hedge accounting is applied, and as call options.
In such cases, changes in fair value are recognized in income or expense.
Contingencies, commitments, and other obligations are possible or current obligations, based on past transactions, that are unlikely to lead to an outflow of resources. These are disclosed separately and not included in the
Balance Sheet unless assumed in the course of a business combination. The amounts stated for contingent liabilities reflect the extent of the liability as of the reporting date.
Judgments made by management in applying the accounting policies primarily relate to the following
­issues:
• Leases must be assessed to determine whether the substantial risks and rewards of beneficial ownership transfer
to the lessee.
• Marketable securities may be grouped in different categories.
• Assets earmarked for sale must be assessed to confirm that they are available for immediate sale and their sale
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

is highly probable. If the result of this assessment is positive, those assets and any liabilities to be disposed of in
the same transaction must be reported and accounted for as assets held for sale and liabilities associated with
assets held for sale.
• It is necessary to determine whether construction revenue is accounted for under IAS 11 or IAS 18.
The decision made by the HOCHTIEF Group for general application in each instance is set out under Accounting
Policies in these Notes.

Group Report 2016

181

Preparation of the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements requires Group management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and disclosures of
contingencies, commitments, and other obligations. The main estimates and assumptions relate to the following:
• Assessing projects on a percentage of completion basis, in particular with regard to accounting for change orders,
the timing of profit recognition, and the amount of profit recognized.
• Estimating the economic life of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and of investment properties.
• Accounting for provisions.
• Testing goodwill and other assets for impairment.
• Testing deferred tax assets for impairment.
All estimates and assumptions are based on current circumstances and appraisals. Forward-looking estimates
and assumptions made as of the balance sheet date with a view to future business performance take account of
circumstances prevailing on preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and future trends considered
realistic for the global and industry environment. Actual amounts can vary from the estimated amounts due to changes
in the operating environment that are at variance with the assumptions and lie beyond management control. If such
changes occur, the assumptions and, if necessary, the carrying amounts of affected assets and liabilities are revised

Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

accordingly.

Group Report 2016

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

New accounting pronouncements
Adoption by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) of revised or new IFRS pronouncements has
resulted in changes to accounting policies in those instances where the pronouncements have been adopted
by the EU and their application is mandatory for the reporting period January 1 to December 31, 2016.
These changes relate to the following IFRS:
• Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other
Entities and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception
• Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations
• Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Disclosure Initiative
• A mendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 Intangible Assets: Clarification of
Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation
• Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 41 Agriculture: Bearer Plants
• Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits: Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions
• Amendments to IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements: Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements
• Endorsement of Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010–2012 Cycle
• Endorsement of Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012–2014 Cycle
The IFRS pronouncements applicable in the reporting year had no material impact on the HOCHTIEF Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Other new accounting pronouncements issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the
IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) take the form of standards and one interpretation that affect the HOCHTIEF
Consolidated Financial Statements but do not have to be applied for the 2016 year and in some cases have not yet
been endorsed by the EU:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: The new standard on financial instruments is divided into several phases and
was published by IASB in its final version in July 2014. The new standard notably introduces major changes relating
to the classification and measurement of financial assets, with classification to be based on the type of business
model as well as on contractual cash flows. In the same connection, impairment assessment is extended from an
incurred loss model to an expected loss model. A new hedge accounting model is also introduced that aims to
bring hedge accounting more closely into line with the risk management activities of the entity. The complete overConsolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

haul of IAS 39 with the publication of IFRS 9 results in additional disclosures.
The standard is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Initial application is retrospective, although transitional provisions apply. Earlier application is permitted. The standard was endorsed by the EU
in November 2016. On current assessment, the new standard will result in a reclassification of financial assets in
the HOCHTIEF Group. The new rules on financial liabilities will probably have no material effect on the HOCHTIEF
Group. Further quantitative and qualitative effects may result from the fundamental changes in the recognition of
impairment losses and in hedge accounting.

Group Report 2016

183

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: The IASB issued this new standard in May 2014 with the
objective of bringing together in one standard the rules on revenue recognition previously contained in various
different standards and interpretations. IFRS 15 applies across all sectors to revenue from all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of other IFRSs, such as leases, insurance contracts, and financial
instruments. Revenue recognition is carried out with regard to both timing and amount by applying the following
five steps:
(1) Identify the contracts with a customer
(2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract
(3) Determine the transaction price
(4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
(5) Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation
This five-step model may give rise to separate performance obligations according to the contractual arrangements,
such as in mining projects. Alongside this basic model, IFRS 15 includes an array of further provisions, such as on
contract costs and contract modifications, and additional notes disclosures. The revised IFRS 15 applies for annual
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018; earlier application is permitted. The standard was endorsed by the
EU in September 2016. The HOCHTIEF Group will not elect early application. With regard to the HOCHTIEF Consolidated Financial Statements, it is assumed on current assessment that the new standard will lead to changes in
revenue recognition. Accordingly, it is expected to affect the recognition of contractual assets and liabilities as, for
example, incremental costs of obtaining a contract are required to be recognized as an asset if the costs are expected to be recovered and would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained. The same applies
with regard to contract modifications in the form of changes in the scope and/or price of a contract, including change
orders. Such modifications may only be included in the transaction price if variable remuneration is highly probable,
meaning that a significant reversal in the amount of the remuneration recognized will not occur. Based on analysis
performed so far, it will be possible for revenue from construction contracts currently accounted for using the percentage of completion method to be recognized over time. Other changes relate to presentation changes and
additional requirements for notes disclosures.
IFRS 16 Leases: Issued by the IASB in January 2016, the standard mainly stipulates new rules for the classification
of leases by the lessee. As part of this, the previous risk-and-rewards approach is abandoned in favor of recognizing
a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all leases. The only exceptions are if the lease term is 12
months or less or the underlying asset has a low value. By contrast, lessors continue to classify leases as operating
or finance leases based on the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. The revised IFRS 16
applies for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019; earlier application is permitted. EU endorsement
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

is still pending. In view of the existing volume of operating leases, it would result in a noticeable increase in assets
and liabilities in the balance sheet. Other potential implications for the HOCHTIEF Group are currently being assessed.
As part of its annual improvements process, the IASB published an omnibus standard in December 2016 (Annual
Improvements Cycle 2014–2016). This involved minor but necessary changes to various standards. The omnibus
standard amends IFRS 1, IFRS 12, and IAS 28; EU endorsement is still pending. On current assessment, the changes
are not expected to have a material impact on the presentation of the financial position or financial performance of
the HOCHTIEF Group.

184

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

The remaining changes adopted by the IASB and the IFRS IC are not expected to have any material relevance for

Group Report 2016

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Intangible assets include EUR 54,895 thousand (2015: EUR 59,867 thousand) for company names recognized on
initial consolidation, comprising EUR 45,303 thousand (2015: EUR 43,756 thousand) in the HOCHTIEF Americas
division and EUR 9,592 thousand (2015: EUR 16,111 thousand) in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division. The company
names are not subject to systematic amortization, but are tested for impairment annually and if there is any indication
of impairment. Impairment testing is performed in accordance with IAS 36 as described below for goodwill. The
changes relative to the prior year relate to exchange rate adjustments and to a EUR 6,733 thousand impairment on
the Devine name in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division.
Goodwill recognized for consolidated companies on initial consolidation is allocated to cash-generating units at
segment level for the purposes of impairment testing as described in the following. The cash-generating units correspond to the divisions used in segment reporting.
Annual impairment testing of goodwill at segment (division) level is performed at HOCHTIEF in the fourth quarter of
each year. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of a division is compared with its carrying
amount.
The recoverable amount for the HOCHTIEF Americas and HOCHTIEF Europe cash-generating units is measured
separately for each unit as value in use. Value in use is the present value of future cash flows expected to arise
from a cash-generating unit. It is determined from an internal Group perspective using the discounted cash flow
method. This is applied on the basis of cash flow budgets derived as a rule from the three-year budget for the
detailed planning horizon as approved by the Executive Board and current at the time of impairment testing. The
forecasts incorporate past experience and expected future market developments. Cash flows are assumed to
remain constant in subsequent years. Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is used for cost of capital figures.
Value in use is first measured on an after-tax basis by discounting the cash flows with an after-tax WACC determined separately for each cash-generating unit. The pretax discount rate is then found by iteration for the purposes
of the Notes disclosures.
The discount rates used for cash-generating units in impairment testing are between 9.44% and 9.66% before tax
(2015: between 10.40% and 10.84%).
The recoverable amount of the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific cash-generating unit is measured at fair value based on
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

CIMIC’s stock market valuation.
As in the prior year, comparison of the divisions’ recoverable amounts with their carrying amounts did not reveal
any impairment of goodwill.
Changes in goodwill by division in 2016 were as follows:

On November 30, 2016, an agreement was reached with HLG Contracting’s existing shareholders which allowed one
shareholder, Al Habtoor Holdings LLC, to transfer its shareholding to the other partner, Riad Al Sadik. Following this
transfer, CIMIC’s shareholding remained unchanged at 45%, with Riad Al Sadik now owning the remaining 55%.
Following the completion of this agreement, CIMIC’s management determined that the company has joint control

no deferred tax assets have been recognized amount to EUR 628,685 thousand (2015: EUR 486,865 thousand) in
respect of corporate income tax and EUR 1,016,228 thousand (2015: EUR 828,148 thousand) in respect of German

basis of tax audits together with the changes that result.
No deferred tax assets have been recognized in relation to interest expense carryforwards in the amount of EUR
350,816 thousand (2015: EUR 373,807 thousand). The change in the interest expense carryforward figures relates

Deferred tax assets are normally recognized for tax-deductible temporary differences if it is probable that taxable
profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilized.
Domestic Group companies that generated losses in the past year or previous years have EUR 44,739 thousand
(2015: EUR 41,636 thousand) in deferred tax assets resulting from temporary differences or tax loss carryforwards
deemed to be probable and were recognized on the balance sheet.
Deferred tax liabilities totaling a gross amount of EUR 650,592 thousand (2015: EUR 671,082 thousand) are entirely
due to taxable temporary differences, mostly from adjustments to ensure uniform Group-wide compliance with IFRS
valuation principles.

payables is EUR 5,349,789 thousand (2015: EUR 5,119,984 thousand). The combined total of progress payments
received and offset against the gross amounts due to and from customers for contract work (POC) in the reporting year stands at EUR 4,117,990 thousand (2015: EUR 3,839,359 thousand).
Various fully consolidated companies in the HOCHTIEF Group have been granted service concession or similar
arrangements. These arrangements are mostly accounted for as financial assets and reported as part of gross
amount due from customers for contract work (POC). The service concession arrangements, which are in the
social infrastructure/Europe segment, are agreements to build and modernize, operate, and maintain schools and
other public buildings. Construction work and improvements are on schedule. These activities broke even with
sales of EUR 1,141 thousand (2015: EUR 34,289 thousand). The HOCHTIEF Group companies concerned are
accordingly required to perform their obligations under the service concession arrangements and are granted the
rights necessary to do so in each instance. At the end of a service concession arrangement, the infrastructure to
which the arrangement relates is returned to the public-sector client. The assets associated with a service concession arrangement generally remain property of the public-sector client for the entire duration of the arrangement.
The sole termination option provided for in the service concession arrangements relates to termination for cause.

the meaning of Section 17 AktG. Such transfers are only permitted for the purpose of settling the transferees’ variable compensation entitlements. Further conditions of transfer are detailed in the resolution. Where shares are issued
to members of the Executive Board of the Company, the decision to issue the shares is taken solely by the Supervisory Board.
Shareholders’ statutory subscription rights to such shares are barred pursuant to Sections 71 (1) No. 8 and 186 (3)
and (4) of the German Stock Corporations Act (AktG) to the extent that the shares are used in exercise of the authorizations set out above.
The Executive Board is also authorized, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to cancel shares of treasury stock
without a further resolution of the Annual General Meeting being required for the cancellation itself or its execution.
The conditions governing awards of subscription rights and the sale, transfer, and cancellation of treasury stock
are set forth in detail in the Annual General Meeting resolution.
By a further resolution of the Annual General Meeting of May 11, 2016, the Company is authorized to acquire shares
of treasury stock in accordance with Section 71 (1) No. 8 AktG using equity derivatives as well as to exclude shareholders’ tender rights and subscription rights. This is not intended to increase the total volume of shares that may
be purchased; instead, it merely opens the way for other alternatives to purchase shares of treasury stock within
and against the upper limit set in the aforementioned authorization. The Executive Board has been authorized to
acquire options which, when exercised, entitle the Company to acquire shares of the Company (call options). The
Executive Board is further authorized to sell options which, when exercised by their holder, require the Company to
acquire shares of the Company (put options). Moreover, the shares can be acquired using a combination of call and
put options or forward purchase agreements. Additional details of the conditions for the use of equity derivatives in
the acquisition of treasury stock and for the exclusion of shareholders’ rights to sell and subscription rights are set
out in the Annual General Meeting resolution.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

25. Share-based payment
The following Group-wide share-based payment plans were in force for managerial staff of HOCHTIEF Aktien­
gesellschaft and its affiliates in 2016:
Top Executive Retention Plan 2008
The Executive Board resolved in June 2008 to launch a Top Executive Retention Plan 2008 (TERP 2008) for selected
managerial employees.
This plan is based on stock awards and consists of three tranches. The first tranche was granted in July 2008, the
second in July 2009, and the third in July 2010.
The total term of the plan is ten years. The waiting period after the granting of each tranche is three years. The
exercise period is between five and seven years, depending on the tranche.
The conditions stipulate that, after the waiting period, entitled individuals receive for each stock award either a
HOCHTIEF share or, at HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft’s discretion, a compensatory cash amount equal to the closing
price of HOCHTIEF stock on the last stock market trading day before the exercise date. The gain is capped for
each year of the exercise period. The cap rises annually up to a maximum gain at the end of the term. The maximum
gain is set to EUR 160 per stock award for the first tranche, EUR 81.65 for the second tranche, and EUR 166.27
for the third tranche.
The first tranche was exercised in full in 2015 and the third tranche in 2016.
Long-term Incentive Plan 2010
The Long-term Incentive Plan 2010 (LTIP 2010) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2010 and
is open to Executive Board members and upper managerial employees of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and its
affiliates. Alongside grants of stock appreciation rights (SARs), LTIP 2010 also provided for grants of stock awards.
Alongside grants of stock appreciation rights (SARs), LTIP 2010 also provided for grants of stock awards. The SARs
can only be exercised if, for at least ten consecutive stock market trading days before the exercise date, the ten-day
average (arithmetic mean) stock market closing price of HOCHTIEF stock is higher relative to the issue price compared with the ten-day average closing level of the MDAX index relative to the index base (relative performance
threshold) and, additionally, return on net assets (RONA) in the then most recently approved set of consolidated
financial statements is at least 10% (absolute performance threshold). The relative performance threshold is waived if
the average stock market price of HOCHTIEF stock exceeds the issue price by at least 10% on ten consecutive
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

stock market trading days after the end of the waiting period.
Provided that the targets are met, the SARs can be exercised at any time after a four-year waiting period except
during a short period before publication of any business results. When SARs are exercised, the issuing entity pays
out the difference between the then current stock price and the issue price. The gain is limited to EUR 27.28 per SAR.
The LTIP conditions for stock awards stipulated that for each stock award exercised within a two-year exercise period
following a three-year waiting period, entitled individuals received at HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft’s discretion either
a HOCHTIEF share or a compensatory cash amount equal to the closing price of HOCHTIEF stock on the last stock
market trading day before the exercise date. The gain was limited to EUR 81.83 per stock award.
The plan for the stock awards ended in 2015.

Group Report 2016

207

Long-term Incentive Plan 2011
The Long-term Incentive Plan 2011 (LTIP 2011) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2011 and is
open to Executive Board members and upper managerial employees of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and its affili­
ates. The conditions did not differ in any material respect from those of LTIP 2010. The gain was limited to EUR
32.67 per SAR and EUR 98.01 per stock award.
The plan for the SARs was exercised in full in 2016 and the plan for the stock awards ended in 2016.
Long-term Incentive Plan 2012
The Long-term Incentive Plan 2012 (LTIP 2012) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2012 and is
open to Executive Board members and upper managerial employees of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and its affili­
ates. The plan conditions differ from those of LTIP 2011 in two points:
1. R
 eturn on net assets (RONA) as per the most recently approved Consolidated Financial Statements must be at
least 15%.
2. The waiting time for stock awards was extended from three to four years and the total term of the plan accordingly from five to six years.
The gain is limited to EUR 25.27 per SAR and EUR 75.81 per stock award.
Long-term Incentive Plan 2013
The Long-term Incentive Plan 2013 (LTIP 2013) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2013 and is
open to Executive Board members. The plan conditions differ from those of LTIP 2012 in only one point:
The performance target for RONA was replaced with a performance target for adjusted free cash flow. The number
of SARs that can be exercised depends on attainment of the planned value range for adjusted free cash flow. This
value range is set in the business plan for each exercise year.
The gain is limited to EUR 24.61 per SAR and EUR 73.83 per stock award.
Long-term Incentive Plan 2014
The Long-term Incentive Plan 2014 (LTIP 2014) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2014 and is
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

open to Executive Board members. The plan conditions do not differ in any material respect from those of LTIP 2013.
The gain is limited to EUR 30.98 per SAR and EUR 92.93 per stock award.
Long-term Incentive Plan 2015
The Long-term Incentive Plan 2015 (LTIP 2015) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2015 and is
open to Executive Board members. The plan conditions do not differ in any material respect from those of LTIP 2014.
The gain is limited to EUR 31.68 per SAR and EUR 95.04 per stock award.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Long-term Incentive Plan 2016
The Long-term Incentive Plan 2016 (LTIP 2016) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2016 and
is open to Executive Board members. The plan conditions differ from those of LTIP 2015 solely in that the waiting
period was shortened from four to three years and a total term of the plans accordingly to six years (SARs) and
five years (stock awards).
The gain is limited to EUR 41.54 per SAR and EUR 124.62 per stock award.
Other information
Return on net assets (RONA)
Return on net assets (RONA) indicates how well HOCHTIEF’s assets are performing as an investment and thus
measures the profitability of the HOCHTIEF Group. RONA measures return as a percentage of net assets. For this
purpose, return is defined as operational earnings (EBIT, shown in the Operational Statement of Earnings) plus
interest income from the Group’s financial assets. The net assets figure reflects the total capital commitment from
which returns are to be generated.
The HOCHTIEF Group generated a return on net assets (RONA) of 15.9% in 2016 (2015: 13.2%). RONA thus
­increased by 2.7 percentage points compared with the prior year.
The conditions of all plans stipulate that on the exercise of SARs or stock awards—and the fulfillment of all other
requisite criteria—HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft normally has the option of delivering HOCHTIEF shares instead of
paying out the gain in cash. Where the entitled individuals are not employees of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, the
expense incurred on exercise of SARs or stock awards is borne by the affiliated company concerned.
The quantities of SARs and stock awards granted, expired, and exercised under the plans so far are as follows:

26. Provisions for pensions and similar obligations
Defined benefit plans
Under defined benefit plans, the Company’s obligation is to provide agreed benefits to current and former employees.
The main pension obligations in Germany consist of direct commitments under the current 2000+ pension plan and
deferred compensation plans. The 2000+ plan in force since January 1, 2000 takes the form of a modular defined
contribution plan. The size of the annual pension component depends on employee income and age (resulting in
an annuity conversion factor) and a general pension contribution reviewed by HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft every
three years and adjusted as necessary. The future pension amount is the sum total of the pension components
earned each year. In isolated instances, length-of-service and final salary pension arrangements are in existence
for executive staff, although except at Executive Board level such arrangements have no longer been offered since
1995. Benefits comprise an old-age pension, an invalidity pension, and a surviving dependants’ pension, and in
almost all cases are granted as a lifelong annuity.
Up to December 31, 2013, employees in Germany additionally had the option of deferred compensation in a company pension plan. The deferred compensation was invested in selected investment funds. The pension amount is
based on the present value of acquired fund units at retirement, subject to a minimum of the deferred compensation
amount plus an increment that is guaranteed by HOCHTIEF and ranges from 3.50% down to 1.75% p.a. There is a
choice at retirement between a lump sum payment and an annuity for five or six years.
Outside of Germany, there are defined benefit plans at Turner in the USA and HOCHTIEF (UK) in the United Kingdom.
The plan at Turner was frozen as of December 31, 2003, and no new entitlements can be earned under it. Benefits
comprise an old-age pension, an invalidity pension, and a surviving dependants’ pension. There is a choice at retirement between a lifelong annuity and a lump sum payment. Commitments at Turner also include post-employment
benefits in the form of medical care for pensioners. HOCHTIEF (UK) has a length-of-service, final salary pension
plan. For each year of service, 1/75th of the eligible final salary is granted as a monthly pension. Benefits comprise
an old-age pension, an invalidity pension, and a surviving dependants’ pension.
Defined benefit obligations in the HOCHTIEF Group are made up as follows:

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Plan assets
Germany
There are no statutory or regulatory minimum funding requirements for pension plans in Germany. Domestic pension
obligations are fully funded. The funded plans take the form of a contractual trust arrangement (CTA). The transferred
assets have been administered since January 1, 2015 by an external trustee and serve exclusively to fund domestic
pension obligations. The transferred cash is invested in the capital market in accordance with investment principles
set out in the trust agreement and the investment guidelines. Investment decisions are not made by the trustee but
by an investment committee.
The investment guidelines and decisions are based on the findings of an asset liability matching (ALM) study compiled by outside specialists at regular intervals of three to five years. This uses Monte Carlo simulation to model the
development of the pension liabilities and other key economic factors over a very long forward horizon and in
numerous combinations. Based on the ALM study, a range of criteria are then applied to determine the optimum
asset allocation in order to ensure that pension liabilities can be met in the long term.
To assure an optimum conservative risk structure, we have also established risk overlay management using the
services of an external overlay manager who is given a fixed annual risk budget and works fully autonomously in a
clearly structured risk overlay management process. HOCHTIEF aims to ensure full funding of pension obligations
and to fund new vested benefits on the basis of current service cost annually or at least on a timely basis. The
companies pay in additional amounts from time to time in the event of any shortfall. Pension commitments in Germany in excess of the contribution assessment ceiling applied in the statutory pension insurance scheme are additionally covered using pension liability insurance. Pension liabilities from deferred employee compensation offered
up to December 31, 2013 were funded by the purchase of retail fund units. Funding of the obligations served by
HOCHTIEF Pension Trust e. V. as of December 31, 2016 is about 55% (2015: 61%); the figure for Germany as a
whole is about 60% (2015: 67%). It should be noted in this connection that pension obligations have increased
significantly in recent years due to the low level of market interest rates and that the funding ratio will significantly
increase again when interest rates recover.
USA
The frozen defined benefit obligations in the Turner Group are likewise managed in a pension fund. Plan assets are
administered in trust by BNY Mellon and serve exclusively to fund the plan. The trust’s independence is reviewed
annually and attested to by auditors. Investment decisions are not made by the trust but by a special committee.
The investment of plan assets is based on a regularly compiled ALM study. The investment objectives are to maxiConsolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

mize the funding ratio and reduce volatility in the funding ratio. With the pension obligations fully funded, high-risk
investments in equities are to be reduced in favor of fixed-interest bonds. These ideally perform in line with plan liabilities, thus ensuring full funding. There is no statutory minimum funding requirement, but low funding levels result
in higher contributions to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, and limits to lump-sum payments, hence
maximum funding is aimed for. The funding of obligations covered by plan assets at Turner as of December 31, 2016
is about 86% (2015: 87%); funding at Turner overall is about 69% (2015: 71%).

Group Report 2016

211

UK
Funding of plan assets at HOCHTIEF (UK) is likewise on a trust basis. Statutory minimum funding requirements
apply. If funding is insufficient to make up a funding shortfall, an additional restructuring plan is drawn up. Plan
funding is reviewed at least once every three years. Funding of pension obligations at HOCHTIEF (UK) is about
69% (2015: 81%).

The discount factors are derived from the Mercer Pension Discount Yield Curve (MPDYC) model, taking into account
the company-specific duration of pension liabilities. Salary and pension increases ceased to be taken into account
in the USA (Turner Group) in 2004 due to the changeover in pension arrangements.
Mortality assumptions are based on published country-specific statistics and experience. The following mortality

In addition to the expenses recognized in profit or loss, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

includes EUR 84,425 thousand in actuarial losses in 2016 before deferred taxes and after changes in the scope of
consolidation and exchange rate adjustments (2015: EUR 28,516 thousand actuarial gains). Before deferred taxes,
the cumulative amount is actuarial losses of EUR 527,496 thousand (2015: EUR 443,071 thousand).
The Turner Group’s obligations to meet healthcare costs for retired staff are included in pension provisions due to
their pension-like nature. The defined benefit obligation as of December 31, 2016 came to EUR 60,470 thousand
(2015: EUR 54,350 thousand). Healthcare costs accounted for EUR 1,532 thousand (2015: EUR 1,785 thousand) of
the current service cost and EUR 2,397 thousand (2015: EUR 2,223 thousand) of the interest expense.

Group Report 2016

Sensitivity analysis
Pension obligations in the HOCHTIEF Group are subject to the following material risks:
Interest rate risk
For defined contribution plans, (notional) contributions are translated into benefits using a table of fixed interest
rates, independent of the current market interest rate. HOCHTIEF thus bears the risk of general capital market interest
rate changes with regard to the determination of benefits. Pension obligations have increased significantly in recent
years due to the generally low level of capital market interest rates. The correspondingly strong impact is due to
the relatively long term of the obligations.
Inflation risk
By law, company pensions in Germany must be raised level with the inflation rate at least every three years. German
company pensions under the 2000+ plan rise at a fixed 1% p.a., hence there is only minor inflation risk in the pension
phase. Turner plans are free from inflation risk as the main defined benefit plan is frozen and no more adjustments
to the company pension are made.
Longevity risk
The granting of lifelong pensions means that HOCHTIEF bears the risk of pensioners living longer than actuarial
calculations predict. This risk normally averages out across all pension plan members and only comes into play if
life expectancy is greater than expected.
The impact of the stated risks on the defined benefit obligations under a corresponding change in actuarial
­assumptions is shown in the sensitivity analysis that follows.

Future benefit payments and contributions to defined benefit plans
As of December 31, 2016, anticipated pension payments for future years are as follows:
(EUR thousand)
Due in 2017

Due in 2019
Due in 2020

Contributions to defined benefit plans will probably be higher in reporting year 2017 than in the prior year. This is
due to higher defined benefit obligations for members of the Executive Board and related pension liability insurance contributions as well as higher transfers to the CTAs as a result of rising service costs.
Defined contribution plans
Under defined contribution plans, the Company pays into a state or private pension fund voluntarily or in accord­
ance with statutory or contractual stipulations. It has no obligation to pay further contributions.
There are defined contribution plans at Turner, Flatiron, and E.E. Cruz in the USA as well as at CIMIC in Australia.
Depending on length of service and salary level, Turner pays between 3% and 6% of an employee’s salary into an
external fund. In addition, Turner employees have an option to pay up to 25% of their salaries into an investment
fund as part of a 401 (k) plan. Turner matches the first 5% of the deferred compensation by up to 100% depending
on length of service. All employees can join the plan immediately, and are vested in the company’s contributions
after three years’ service. Tax relief is granted on most payments into the fund, although it is also possible to pay
contributions from taxed income and receive the investment earnings free of tax; the investment risk is borne by
employees. The defined contribution plans at Flatiron and E.E. Cruz are similar to 401 (k) plans. All non-union employees are entitled. Flatiron pays a contribution in the amount of 6.0% of the wage or salary, while E.E. Cruz doubles one-third of employee contributions, in each case up to the statutory maximum. Since July 1, 2014, CIMIC in
Australia has paid 9.50% (previously 9.25%) of the wage and salary total into the statutory pension (superannuation)
scheme. The contribution rate is expected to rise incrementally up to 12.0% by 2025. Employees have a choice of
investment funds and bear the investment risk. They are able to pay top-up contributions on a voluntary basis. Tax

consequently no longer had any outstanding promissory note loan issues at the reporting date.

In December 2011, an international banking syndicate provided HOCHTIEF with a five-year credit facility at market
terms including a EUR 500,000 thousand cash tranche. The credit facility expires in April 2019. As in the prior year,
there are no drawings on the cash tranche as of the reporting date.
There are no financial liabilities due to equity-accounted companies (2015: EUR 1,000 thousand).
The minimum lease payments for liabilities under finance leases break down as follows:

33. Reporting on financial instruments
Financial instruments include financial assets and liabilities as well as contractual claims and obligations relating to
exchanges and transfers of financial assets. Financial instruments can be derivative or non-derivative.
Non-derivative financial assets mostly comprise cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, receivables, and
other financial assets. Marketable securities are carried at fair value. The fair values of available-for-sale financial
assets are established with reference to market prices or, in the absence of such prices, determined using accepted
valuation methods.
Non-derivative financial liabilities are mostly current liabilities measured at amortized cost.
According to their fair value, derivative financial instruments are reported either in other receivables and other assets
or in other liabilities. Derivatives are used in the HOCHTIEF Group exclusively for the hedging of existing transactions and in asset management.
Holdings of non-derivative and derivative financial instruments are carried on the balance sheet; the maximum risk
of loss or default is equal to the total value of financial assets. Any such risk identified in respect of financial assets is
accounted for with an impairment loss.
Risk management
All finance activities in the HOCHTIEF Group are conducted on the basis of a Group-wide financial directive. This is
complemented by function-specific operating work instructions on issues such as currency and collateral management. These lay down principles for dealing with the various classes of financial risk.
Management of liquidity risk
HOCHTIEF uses largely centralized liquidity structures—notably cash pooling—to pool liquidity at Group level, among
other things to avoid cash flow bottlenecks at the level of individual entities. The central liquidity position is calculated
at regular monthly intervals and budgeted in a bottom-up process over a rolling 18-month period. Liquidity budgets
are supplemented with monthly stress testing. HOCHTIEF uses liquidity budgets in active management of the
marketable securities and loans portfolios.
The tables below show maximum payments. The tables show the worst-case scenario for HOCHTIEF, i.e. the earliest
possible contractual payment date in each case. Creditors’ rights of termination are taken into account. Foreign
currency items are translated using the closing rate as of the balance sheet date. Interest payments on variable
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

rate items are translated uniformly using the last interest rate fixed prior to the balance sheet date. Both derivative
and non-derivative financial instruments (for example, forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps) are
taken into account. Credit facilities granted but not yet drawn in their full amount are also included, as are financial
guarantees issued by the Group.

continuously monitored as part of corporate planning. In light of the broad international syndication in each instance
and the successful extension of the credit and guarantee facilities in April 2014, no refinancing risk is currently seen
with regard to long-term guarantee and credit facilities. The authorized capital in the amount of up to EUR 54,000
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

thousand and conditional capital in the amount of up to EUR 46,080 thousand provide appropriate scope for raising
additional capital as needed. If use were to be made of both of these facilities, the capital stock of currently EUR
164,608 thousand could—if necessary—be increased by a total of up to approximately 60%.

In the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division, under a legally binding arrangement with banks, financial assets in the
amount of EUR 17,402 thousand (2015: EUR 856,688 thousand) and financial liabilities in the amount of EUR
17,334 thousand (2015: EUR 407,601 thousand) are offset and presented in the balance sheet with their net
amount of EUR 68 thousand (2015: EUR 449,087 thousand).
Management of currency risk
HOCHTIEF is exposed to currency risk (transaction risk) arising from receivables, liabilities, cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and pending transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the Group
company concerned in each instance. Currency derivatives, mainly forward exchange contracts, are used to hedge
against fluctuations in these payments or items caused by exchange rates. HOCHTIEF normally hedges all currency
risk.
Hedges for Group companies—with the exception of hedges in the CIMIC Group—are mainly administered via
HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. Binding guidelines clarify their use as well as separate controls and responsibilities
for all Group companies. Currency derivatives are normally only used to hedge risk. Any form of speculation is
ruled out under a binding, Group-wide financial directive. The counterparties for derivatives entered into externally
are banks with a top credit rating.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Where hedge accounting is used, unrealized gains and losses on hedges are initially recognized in other comprehensive income, taking into account deferred tax. Gains and losses are not realized until a hedged item affects
income. Derivatives are measured on the basis of current market rates as of the balance sheet date. When interpreting positive or negative fair value changes relating to derivatives, it is important to remember that they balance
hedged items whose values move in the opposite direction.
The following sensitivity analyses demonstrate the impact on HOCHTIEF Group equity and profit that would result
from a 10% fluctuation in foreign currencies relative to each Group company’s functional currency. The analysis is

Management of interest rate risk
HOCHTIEF is exposed to interest rate risk through financial items primarily consisting of interest-bearing marketable
securities on the assets side and financial liabilities on the liabilities side of the balance sheet. Two approaches are
used to minimize this risk. Firstly, the Company uses natural hedging, meaning that it eliminates contrary interest
rate risk from non-derivative financial instruments on the asset and liabilities side. The second method is to use interest
rate derivatives. These generally take the form of interest rate swaps used in accordance with the Group annual
financing strategy to manage cash flow risk from changes in interest rates for variable-rate financial items. As with
currency derivatives, hedges for Group companies—with the exception of hedges in the CIMIC Group—are mainly
administered via HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. There are also parallel regulations and guidelines, and derivatives
are used solely for hedging (i.e. not speculatively) as a matter of principle. The counterparties for derivatives entered
into externally are banks with a top credit rating.
The following table shows the fair values of interest rate derivatives, changes in their fair values, and their maximum
remaining maturities:

Management of other price risk
Other price risk results at HOCHTIEF from investing in current and non-current non-interest-bearing marketable
securities, chiefly shares, that are classified as available for sale and therefore measured at fair value through other
comprehensive income. In addition, price risk stems from participating interests that are classified as available for
sale, to the extent that they are ­measured at fair value. Such items are shown in the following table. Participating
interests measured at amortized cost because their fair value cannot be reliably measured are not included.

Management of credit risk
The HOCHTIEF Group is exposed to credit risk from operations and from certain financing activities.
HOCHTIEF performs risk management for operations by continuously monitoring trade receivables at divisional
level. If a specific credit risk is detected, it is countered by recognizing an individual impairment.
The HOCHTIEF Group has given third parties financial guarantees and loan commitments in respect of Group
companies. Financial guarantees and loan guarantees are only given in respect of companies with top credit
standing, restricting to a minimum the probability of the guarantees being drawn upon.
The maximum credit risk exposure of financial assets is equivalent to their carrying amounts in the balance sheet.
However, the actual credit risk exposure is lower due to collateral given in favor of the HOCHTIEF Group. The maxi­
mum risk exposure on financial guarantees issued by HOCHTIEF is the maximum amount to be paid by HOCHTIEF.
The maximum credit risk for loan commitments is the amount of the commitment. As of December 31, 2016, the
maximum credit risk from financial guarantees and loan commitments amounted to EUR 97,509 thousand (2015:
EUR 144,414 thousand). No recourse has ever been made to these guarantees provided by HOCHTIEF and, in
light of the financial circumstances, none is currently anticipated for the future.
HOCHTIEF accepts collateral to secure contract performance by subcontractors, subcontractors’ warranty obligations,
and claims to remuneration. Such collateral includes guarantees relating to warranty obligations, contract perform­
a­nce, advance payments, and receivables. Acceptance of collateral is governed by a HOCHTIEF work instruction.
Among other aspects, this covers the contractual drafting, implementation, and management of all agreements.
The detailed rules vary according to factors such as the country jurisdiction and applicable case law. In the case of
credit risk, HOCHTIEF examines the credit rating of the party providing the collateral for all guarantees accepted.
HOCHTIEF uses external specialists (such as rating agencies) to assess credit standings where possible. The fair
values of accepted collateral are not disclosed as they regularly cannot be measured reliably as a rule.

The age structure of financial assets that are past due is shaped by industry-specific factors. Receipt of payment
depends on acceptance of the contract works (inspection) and invoice checking, which can often take a relatively
long time, especially for large-scale projects. Most of the unimpaired financial assets that are past due are from
public-sector clients and industrial companies with top credit ratings.

Capital risk management
The HOCHTIEF Group manages capital with the aim of ensuring that all Group companies can continue to operate
as a going concern. The Group keeps the cost of capital as low as possible by optimizing the balance between equity
and debt as the need arises. These measures primarily serve to secure the best possible credit standing as well as
to maximize shareholder returns.
The Group’s capital structure consists of the balance sheet items comprising net debt (defined as current and
non-current liabilities less cash and cash equivalents) and shareholders’ equity. The Risk Reporting Committee
assesses and examines the Group’s capital structure at regular intervals, taking into account the risk-adjusted cost
of capital.
The overall capital risk management strategy did not change in the reporting year compared with the prior year.

As current financial instruments have short remaining maturities and are measured at market value, their carrying
amounts generally correspond to market value as of the balance sheet date. Non-current securities in the available-for-sale category are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI); as such, their carrying amounts also correspond to fair value.
Shares in non-consolidated subsidiaries and other participating interests are measured at fair value if fair value can
be reliably determined. Otherwise, such items are measured at cost in the available-for-sale category.
In the disclosures on the fair value hierarchy for financial instruments measured at fair value as set out below, fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., the exit price).
For non-financial assets, fair value is measured assuming the highest and best use of the asset by market participants. The following three-level hierarchy is applied that reflects the observability of the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; e.g. quoted securities.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); e.g. interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts.
Level 3: No relevant observable inputs available, hence unobservable inputs are determined as an exit price from
the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability; e.g. investments measured at fair
value determined by business valuation.

There were no transfers of assets measured at fair value between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy in
the reporting year. This means that there were likewise no changes in Level 3.
In Level 3, the fair value of investments in unlisted entities is measured using generally recognized valuation techniques
based on discounted cash flow analysis. The unobservable inputs used for this purpose are an internal rate of return
of 9%, growth rates of between 2.5% and 3%, and required discount rates of between 10% and 15%. Call options

234

Group Report 2016

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

are measured using Monte Carlo simulation. Assumed inputs are an expected exercise period of one to ten years,
an EBITDA multiplier of six to twelve times, and a 15% discount factor. Changes in the unobservable inputs have
no material effect on total comprehensive income, total assets and liabilities, or equity.

The EUR 1.5 billion syndicated guarantee facility* continues to be a central long-term financing instrument for
HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. The facility permits the furnishing of guarantees for ordinary activities, mainly of the
HOCHTIEF Europe division.

**See glossary on page 257.

HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft has provided an unlimited bonding** guarantee in favor of U.S. insurance companies
in respect of obligations of the Turner Group and the Flatiron Group. There is also a syndicated credit facility in
favor of Flatiron, which is likewise backed by a Group guarantee furnished by HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. No
recourse has ever been made to these guarantees provided by HOCHTIEF, and none is currently anticipated for
the future.
Group order exposure from awarded capital expenditure projects is EUR 55,707 thousand (2015: EUR 2,468 thousand)
and mostly relates to the CIMIC Group in the amount of EUR 55,448 thousand (2015: EUR 2,211 thousand). In

Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

addition, letters of credit were issued in the CIMIC Group in the amount of EUR 77,191 thousand (2015: EUR 174,269
thousand). The CIMIC Group also has EUR 656,482 thousand (2015: EUR 603,145 thousand) in contingent liabilities
relating to insurance, fulfillment, and payment guarantees.
There are cash call commitments in the amount of EUR 10,607 thousand to non-consolidated entities in the
HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division (2015: cash call commitments in the amount of EUR 4,209 thousand to joint
ventures in the HOCHTIEF Europe division).

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

The obligations from operating leases mainly relate to plant and machinery leased by the CIMIC Group. Lease
payments under operating leases came to EUR 282,874 thousand in 2016 (2015: EUR 280,026 thousand).
Several companies in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division have a number of leasing arrangements. These companies concerned are financed by third parties and HOCHTIEF itself holds neither interests in their equity nor assets
such as loans or receivables. Relevant activities are managed by third parties under contractual agreement and
therefore they are not consolidated. The minimum lease payments under operating leases come to EUR 129,693
thousand (2015: EUR 143,184 thousand).
Amounts due under long-term tenancies are EUR 146,725 thousand (2015: EUR 176,665 thousand). The term for
which such tenancies cannot be terminated is between two and eleven years (2015: two and twelve years). The
amounts due under tenancies are partly offset by anticipated rental income of EUR 61,174 thousand (2015: EUR
65,786 thousand).
Other financial obligations include EUR 69,314 thousand (2015: EUR 103,307 thousand) in commitments relating
to shareholder loans and under long-term contracts for the supply of goods and services.
Legal disputes
HOCHTIEF Group companies are involved in various legal disputes and arbitration proceedings in the context of
their operating activities. As currently assessed, however, HOCHTIEF does not anticipate that the disputes and
arbitration proceedings will have any material adverse impact on the Group’s business and financial situation.
35. Segment reporting
HOCHTIEF’s structure reflects the operating focus of the business as well as the Group’s presence in key national
and international regions and markets. Segmental reporting in the HOCHTIEF Group is based on the Group’s
divisional operations. The breakdown mirrors the Group’s internal reporting systems.
The Group’s reportable segments* (divisions) are as follows:
HOCHTIEF Americas encompasses the construction activities of operational units in the USA and Canada

*Detailed information on the
­various operating segments is
included in the Management
Report on pages 76 to 89.

develops, builds, operates, and manages real estate and infrastructure.
The Corporate Headquarters/Consolidation unit comprises Corporate Headquarters, other activities not assignable
to the separately listed divisions, including management of financial resources and insurance activities, plus consolidation effects. Insurance activities are managed from Corporate Headquarters under the responsibility of HOCHTIEF
Insurance Broking and Risk Management Solutions GmbH with various companies in Luxembourg, including
Builders Reinsurance S.A. The HOCHTIEF insurance companies primarily provide reinsurance offerings for contractors’ casualty and surety, subcontractor default, liability, and occupational accident insurance.

Explanatory notes to the segmental data
Intersegment sales represent revenue generated between divisions. They are transacted on an arm’s length basis.
External sales mainly comprise revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method in the mainstream
construction business, construction management, and contract mining, in the amount of EUR 16,946,731 thousand
(2015: EUR 17,965,879 thousand). The sum of external sales and intersegment sales adds up to total sales revenue for each division.
The share of profits and losses of equity-method associates and joint ventures comprises income and expenses,
including impairment losses, relating to equity-method investments.
Depreciation and amortization relates to intangible assets with finite useful lives, property, plant and equipment,
and investment properties.
The impairment losses relate to intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment properties, and
­f inancial assets.
Purchases comprise additions to intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment properties, equitymethod investments (excluding equity-method adjustments), subsidiaries, and other participating interests.
Total assets are equivalent to the divisions’ totals in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Gross debt equals total
assets minus consolidated shareholders’ equity.
Operational earnings (EBIT) are derived from profit from operating activities as follows:
(EUR thousand)

The net income from participating interests included in EBIT consists exclusively of net income from joint ventures.
Non-recurring items consist of income and expenses classified as exceptional for business management purposes
or resulting from exceptional transactions or not attributable to operating activities. The non-recurring items mainly
relate to non-recurring expenses, gains/losses from disposals of controlled entities, asset disposals, exchange

36. Notes to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows classifies cash flows into operating, investing, and financing activities.
Exchange rate effects are eliminated and their influence on the cash position is disclosed separately. Changes in
cash and cash equivalents due to acquisitions and disposals of consolidated companies are shown separately under
cash flow from investing activities. The EUR 163,986 thousand increase in cash and cash equivalents due to changes in
the scope of consolidation (2015: EUR 465,847 thousand decrease) comprised EUR 164,555 thousand (2015: EUR –
thousand) in cash and cash equivalents from acquisitions and EUR 569 thousand (2015: EUR 465,847 thousand)
in cash and cash equivalents in disposals.
The EUR 2,847,426 thousand (2015: EUR 2,808,707 thousand) year-end total for cash and cash equivalents shown
on the cash flow statement matches the cash and cash equivalents item on the balance sheet. The total comprises
EUR 728 thousand (2015: EUR 913 thousand) in cash in hand, EUR 2,209,678 thousand (2015: EUR 2,243,934
thousand) in cash balances at banks, and EUR 637,020 thousand (2015: EUR 563,860 thousand) in marketable
securities with maturities of no more than three months at the time of acquisition. Cash and cash equivalents to the
value of EUR 137,745 thousand are subject to restrictions (2015: EUR 110,963 thousand).
Cash flow from operations was EUR 1,173,391 thousand in 2016. Cash flow changes as a result of capital expenditure
and asset disposals resulted in a net cash outflow from investing activities of EUR 66,172 thousand. The EUR 1,135,574
negative cash flow from financing activities includes the stock buyback programs at HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft
and CIMIC, additional share purchases at subsidiaries in the course of the acquisitions of UGL and Sedgman,
dividend payments, and debt repayments. Including exchange rate changes, cash and cash equivalents increased
overall by EUR 38,719 thousand.
All non-cash income and expense and all income from asset disposals or arising on deconsolidation is eliminated
in cash flow from operations.
Cash flow from operations included:
• Interest income of EUR 49,381 thousand (2015: EUR 61,736 thousand),
• Interest expenses of EUR 161,793 thousand (2015: EUR 240,247 thousand),
• Income tax paid amounting to EUR 83,995 thousand (2015: EUR 428,899 thousand).
After deducting the non-cash component of income from equity-accounted interests, net income received (as
dividends) from such interests was EUR 319,585 thousand (2015: EUR 116,703 thousand).
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

Divestments relate to the deconsolidation of fully consolidated subsidiaries. This reduced non-current assets by
EUR 23,981 thousand (2015: EUR 832 thousand) and current assets by EUR 24,853 thousand (2015: EUR 548,510
thousand). Non-current liabilities decreased by EUR 21,765 thousand (2015: EUR 3 thousand) and current liabilities
by EUR 12,633 thousand (2015: EUR 81,648 thousand). As in the prior year, the EUR 36,655 thousand (2015: EUR
494,008 thousand) sale proceeds as of the balance sheet date were settled in full from cash and cash equivalents.
Dividends of EUR 128,473 thousand (2015: EUR 128,926 thousand) were paid to HOCHTIEF’s shareholders in the
reporting year. Dividends paid to non-controlling interest totaled EUR 96,902 thousand (2015: EUR 107,294
thousand), of which EUR 68,796 thousand (2015: EUR 79,017 thousand) relates to the CIMIC Group.

Independent Auditors’ Report
We have audited the consolidated financial statements – comprising consolidated statement of earnings, consolidated
statement of comprehensive income, consolidated balance sheet, statement of cash flows, statement of changes
in equity, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, prepared by HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen/
Germany, as well as the combined management report for the financial year from January 1, to December 31,
2016. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the management report of the Company and
the Group in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as applicable in the EU, and the
additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315a (1) German Commercial Code (HGB) is the
responsibility of the Company‘s Executive Board. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements, together with the bookkeeping system and the Group management report, based on our audit.
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Sec. 317 German Commercial
Code (HGB) and German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the
Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit such that misstatements materially affecting the presentation of the net assets, financial position
and results of operations in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the applicable ­financial reporting
framework and in the management report of the Company and the Group are detected with reasonable assurance.
Knowledge of the business activities and the economic and legal environment of the Group and expectations as
to possible misstatements are taken into account in the determination of audit procedures. The effectiveness of
the accounting-related internal control system and the evidence supporting the disclosure as in the consolidated
financial statements and the Group management report are examined primarily on a test basis within the framework of the audit. The audit includes assessing the annual financial statements of the companies included in consolidation, the determination of the companies to be included in consolidation, the accounting and consolidation
principles used and significant estimates made by the Executive Board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and the Group management report. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Our audit has not led to any reservations.
In our opinion, which is based on the results of our audit, the consolidated financial statements of HOCHTIEF
Aktiengesellschaft, Essen/Germany, comply with the IFRS, as applicable in the EU, and the additional requireConsolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

ments of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315a (1) German Commercial Code (HGB) and give a true
and fair view of the Group‘s net assets, financial position and results of operations in accordance with these regulations. The Group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with the
legal requirements and as a whole provides a suitable view of the Company‘s and Group‘s position and suitably
presents the opportunities and risks of future development.

Focus on
pulling
­together
Building bridges is not just part of
our business, as in Scotland. It is
also a key focus of HOCHTIEF’s
sponsorship activities. In cooperation with the Bridges to Prosperity
organization and local volunteers,
we built our 20th pedestrian bridge
in 2016. For the first time, two CIMIC
staff members joined a team of
HOCHTIEF colleagues from Europe
in Rwanda. On completion of the
project, everyone agreed—the team
spirit made it a very special experience.

Independent Assurance Report
To HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen
Our Engagement
We have been engaged to perform a limited review of the materiality analysis, management approaches and quantitative and qualitative information in the chapter “Sustainability at HOCHTIEF” in the Group Report (hereinafter: the
report) of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen (hereinafter: HOCHTIEF), for the business year starting January 1st
to December 31st, 2016. It was not part of our engagement to review any product or service related statements,
any links to external sources, future-looking statements or statements from external experts.
Management’s Responsibility
The Company’s Executive Board is responsible for the accurate preparation of the report in accordance with the
criteria stated in the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines G4 of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).
This responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the report as well as
the usage of reasonable assumptions and estimates for individual sustainability disclosures. Furthermore, the
responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining systems and processes relevant for the preparation of the report in a way that it is free of – intended or unintended – material misstatements.
Our Independence and Quality Control
We have met the requirements regarding independence along with the additional requirements relating to profes­
sional conduct of the IESBA “Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants”, which is based on the fundamental
principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional conduct
worthy of the profession.
The quality assurance system of Deloitte GmbH is based on the International Standard on Quality Control 1 “Qual­
ity Control for Audit, Assurance and Related Service Practices” (ISQC 1) and, in addition on national statutory requirements and professional standards, especially the Professional Code for Certified Accountants as well as the
joint statement of WPK (Chamber of Public Accountants) and IDW (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany): Require­
ments for quality assurance in the auditing practice (VO 1/2006).
Practitioner‘s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion based on our work performed and the evidences obtained on the
above mentioned information of the report.
Procedures and extent of the assurance engagement
We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000
(Revised): “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information”. This standard
requires that we comply with our professional duties and give an attestation, based on the results of our work, as
to whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the sustainability information as stated
in the report 2016 does not comply, in all material respects, with the above mentioned criteria of the Sustainability
Reporting Guidelines G4 of the GRI. In a limited assurance engagement the evidence gathering procedures are
more limited than in a reasonable assurance engagement. Hence, the scope of a limited review is less comprehensive
and may not reasonably assure all material facts that a reasonable assurance could. The selection of audit activities
is subject to the auditor’s own judgement. This includes the assessment of the risk of material misstatement in the

Further Information

report under consideration of the GRI reporting criteria.

254

Group Report 2016

Within the scope of our work, we performed amongst others the following procedures when conducting the limited
assurance engagement:
• Interviewing employees at group level in order to gain an understanding of the process for determining material
sustainability topics and the stakeholder engagement process of HOCHTIEF
• Interviews with relevant staff at group level responsible for providing the data and information, carrying out internal
control procedures and consolidating the data and information, including the explanatory notes
• Analytical procedures on relevant data
• Comparison of selected data with corresponding data in the HOCHTIEF consolidated financial statements and
management report
• Evaluation of information on selected sustainability performance measurements
Our Conclusion
Based on our limited review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the information of the
materiality analysis, management approaches and quantitative and qualitative sustainability information as stated
in the report for the business year starting January 1st to December 31st, 2016 of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft,
Essen, does not comply with the criteria of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines G4 of the GRI.
Recommendations
Without qualifying our conclusion above, we make the following recommendations for the further development of
the company‘s sustainability management and sustainability reporting:
• Development of strategy process with particular focus on stakeholder engagement and materiality analysis
• Further harmonization of reporting processes and structures among divisions
• Implementation of a centralized IT-system to increase automation of sustainability data collection, validation,
consolidation processes and documentation
This assurance report is issued based on an assurance engagement agreed upon with HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft.
The assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance is issued for the purposes of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft
and the report is intended solely to inform HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft of the results of the assurance engagement. This assurance report is not intended as a basis for (financial) decision-making by third parties of any kind.
We have responsibility only towards HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. We do not assume any responsibilities for third
parties.

Forward-looking statements
This Group Report contains forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the current views, expectations and assumptions of the Executive Board of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft concerning
future events and developments relating to HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and/or the HOCHTIEF Group and are based on information currently available to the Executive Board of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties and do not guarantee future results (such as profit before tax or consolidated net profit) or developments (such as with regard to possible f­uture divestments, general business activities or business strategy). Actual results (such as profit before tax or consolidated net profit), dividends and other developments (such as with regard to possible ­future divestments, general business activities or business strategy) relating to HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and the HOCHTIEF Group may therefore differ materially from the expectations and assumptions described or
implied in such statements due to, among other things, changes in the general economic, sectoral and competitive environment, capital market developments, currency exchange rate fluctua­tions, changes
in international and national laws and regulations, in particular with respect to tax laws and regulations, the conduct of other shareholders, and other factors. Any information provided on dividends is additionally subject to the recognition of a corresponding distributable profit in the published separate financial statements of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft for the fiscal year concerned and the adoption by
the competent decision-making bodies of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft of appropriate resolutions taking into account the prevailing situation of the Company. Aside from statutory publication obligations, HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft does not assume any obligations to update any forward-looking statements.
