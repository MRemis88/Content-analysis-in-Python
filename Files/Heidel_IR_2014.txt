Dear readers,

Preface

Dr. Bernd Scheifele
Chairman of the Managing Board

The years 2013 and 2014 were special ones for HeidelbergCement.
In 2013 the company celebrated its 140th anniversary — a fact that
demonstrates the stability and solidity of our long-term oriented
business model. 2014 was the most successful year for
HeidelbergCement since the financial crisis. This result shows that
long-term thinking and sustainable action pay off.
We believe that sustainable corporate management means continuously bringing our profit targets into harmony with the goal of
safeguarding our future viability. By taking on responsibility for
society and the environment and reducing the negative effects of
our activities to the greatest extent possible, we are minimising the
risks to our business operations. In doing so, we are pursuing a
holistic approach that is binding on all of our business lines and
every area of the Group. In other words, this approach is followed
by our more than 2,300 locations worldwide. The core of our sustainability strategy is therefore local responsibility — for our
employees and our neighbours, as well as for nature and the
environment. That is our policy in the more than 40 countries all
over the world in which we operate.
Occupational health and safety play a particularly important role at
HeidelbergCement. Although we have been continually improving
our occupational health and safety measures at the technical and
organisational levels for many years, serious accidents still occur.
We have determined that these accidents are often caused by
human error. That’s why we have continued our Group-wide Safety
Leadership Initiative, which we launched in 2012. This initiative
makes managers at all levels more aware of their leadership
responsibilities regarding issues related to occupational health and
safety. The aim is to strengthen the safety culture at our company.

We have also made considerable progress in other central areas
of our sustainability strategy. In the area of climate protection and
resource conservation, we have in some cases clearly surpassed
our targets. For example, we committed ourselves to reducing our
specific CO2 emissions in comparison to the figure for 1990 by 23%
by 2015. In 2014 we had already achieved a reduction of 21.2%.
Alternative fuels currently make up 20.6% of our total energy
sources; in this respect we are among the best companies in our
sector. Our renaturation and recultivation of quarries that are no
longer in service focuses on the protection of local species of plants
and animals. In partnership with the international nature conservation organisation BirdLife International, we have already achieved
a great deal in this area in recent years. We have also tackled the
challenge of water management and established a reporting system for our cement business line. And we’re also pursuing the
aim of greater sustainability in our products. Concrete in particular
fulfils the requirements for sustainable construction due to its durability and heat storage capacity.
Business and society are facing huge challenges today. As a leading
producer of construction materials, we can help to solve these challenges through innovative construction materials and efficient
production processes that conserve natural resources and reduce
CO2 emissions. In order to respond to these challenges even more
effectively in the future, our experts are currently working to update
our sustainability strategy. In the future, we want this strategy to
link our sense of social responsibility even more clearly than before
with the safeguarding of our company’s future viability.

ing company, we are also obligated to adhere to global values and
standards. As a result, we are committed to upholding the ILO’s
core labour standards, the OECD guidelines for multinational
enterprises and the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
We expect our employees and business associates worldwide to
act in conformity with these essential guidelines and recommendations.

Responsible corporate management
Among other things, responsible and sustainable corporate management means achieving outstanding business performance and
acquiring ecological expertise, while at the same time taking on
social responsibility and acting ethically in line with the relevant
legislation.
The management and monitoring structures at HeidelbergCement
comply with the laws governing stock corporations in Germany,
the company’s memorandum and articles of association, the standing rules of the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board, and
— with a few exceptions — the guidelines laid out in the German
Corporate Governance Code.
Compliance
We respect and obey the applicable laws and regulations in all the
countries in which we operate, and we regard them as the legal
foundation of our business activities. As an internationally operat-

Internally, our management guidelines reflect our commitment to
the aforementioned standards. We commit our suppliers to these
standards with our Supplier Code of Conduct. Employees and
external individuals can report violations through our compliance
reporting system. The system was introduced in 2007. Since 2013,
it has also included criteria for violations of various human rights
and of core labour standards such as discrimination and child
labour. The system encompasses a variety of channels through
which noncompliance can be addressed, ranging from reports sent
directly to specifically authorised contact partners to information
submitted through our whistleblower hotline. All such reports are
handled completely anonymously if desired. Most of the violations
during 2013 and 2014 involved employee issues and occupational
safety. In 2013 the whistleblower hotline received 65 reports,
including one case of alleged discrimination. In 2014, 62 reports
were submitted, with discrimination being the subject of two of
them. No instances of child labour or forced labour were reported.
We examine every report we receive and take appropriate
disciplinary action if a violation has been proved. We also implement corrective and preventive measures in order to reduce the
likelihood of recurrences.
At our facility in Citeureup, Indonesia, the local management and
the labour union had differences of opinion regarding the exercise
of labour union rights. These differences were addressed in mediation proceedings at the National Contact Point for the OECD
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. The proceedings concluded in May 2014 with a joint declaration.

REPORT PROFILE

Since 2013 we have been conducting a survey in our Group’s country organisations every two years in order to determine the risk of
human rights violations or of infringements of core labour standards. In the next step, we determine whether the existing measures should be augmented to minimise risks.

about the prohibition of discrimination and harassment in the workplace. In 2012 we expanded the range of online courses by adding
a module on competition law and another one on corruption prevention. Throughout the Group, around 5,500 users are currently
registered for the second of these modules.

Our compliance programme
Our compliance programme is based on a Group-wide Code of
Business Conduct that requires all employees to adhere to basic
principles of responsible corporate management, regardless of
whether or not such principles have been written into law. It is particularly important that
– all of our employees and managers should act with integrity
and professionalism when dealing with customers, suppliers,
government authorities and business partners;
– consistently avoid and prevent conflicts of interest;
– treat company property and assets carefully and responsibly;
– treat confidential company and business information and
personal data carefully and responsibly;
– ensure fair conditions and eliminate discrimination at work,
and conduct fair discussions with employee representatives;
– provide safe and healthy workplaces; and
– utilise natural resources responsibly and sparingly.

Our compliance organisation
The Director of Group Compliance, who heads our compliance organisation, reports directly to the Chairman of the Managing Board.
Each country in which we operate has its own Compliance Officer.
Every manager is responsible for ensuring that employees comply
with the applicable laws and regulations, and of course the employees themselves are responsible for their own compliance.
Clearly defined control mechanisms are used to monitor implementation of our compliance programme throughout the Group. Such
mechanisms include both regular and special audits by our Internal
Auditing department, as well as special half-year compliance
reports submitted by the Director of Group Compliance to the
Managing Board and the Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee. In
addition, every Managing Board member receives a report each
quarter on major compliance violations in his or her region.

A key element of our compliance programme is our executives’
commitment not to tolerate violations of applicable law (especially
competition law) or anti-corruption regulations, and to take action
against all those who commit such violations.
The programme also includes internal measures and guidelines
that more concretely specify the legal regulations. Among other
things, these measures include periodic training courses for our
employees. In 2008, for example, we began using an e-learning
module for the Code of Business Conduct and basic compliance
topics. Throughout the Group, around 10,000 people currently take
part in the course, which, among other things, teaches employees

TARGETS

We closely monitor developments in the area of compliance and
regularly review our programme in order to determine whether it
needs to be adjusted. Most recently, such adjustments had to be
made in the areas of trade sanctions and corruption prevention.
Compliance activities
In November 2014 we put an internal Trade Sanctions Policy into
force, according to which all companies controlled by HeidelbergCement have to check whether their business partners are on the
sanctions lists published by the EU and the USA. The measures
that the EU countries have implemented to combat terrorism serve
as the basis for the expansion of the content and geographic range
of the inspection processes. Group Compliance helps the country
organisations to implement the Trade Sanctions Policy by supplying
data processing solutions in cooperation with Group IT and by
delineating business processes that regulate the activities that must
be taken after an inspection of the business partners has been
completed. We want to implement the inspection processes
throughout the Group by the end of 2015.
In response to the UK Bribery Act and the IDW PS 980 audit standard, we have worked together with external experts to develop a
system that assesses corruption risks as well as the occurrence and
prevention of possible conflicts of interest. It is divided into three
stages. In the first stage, the system assesses the potential risks in
a particular country organisation. The associated criteria are based
on Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index for
the country in question, the business model, previous cases with
regard to the specific risk and the potential effects of a case of corruption. The existing measures for reducing individual risks are
then set against the potential risks. In the last step, the system
determines whether additional measures might be required.
This assessment results in a plan of measures for each country.
The implementation of these measures is monitored by Group
Compliance.

KEY FIGURES

REPORT PROFILE

The introduction of the assessment system will be completed in
2015 at all of the business lines in the Group countries. The assessments will afterwards be conducted every three years. In geographic terms, the risk focus is on countries with scores that are
low on Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index;
at the functional level, the focus is on procurement.
During the period under review, the information submitted through
our compliance reporting system showed that there were a few isolated cases of possible corruption. When misconduct was detected,
we took measures ranging from restructurings to improved
process controls and personnel measures. In response to corruption-related violations by business partners, in some cases we
decided to not renew their contracts.
Antitrust law
Antitrust proceedings prompt us to continuously examine and
enhance our extensive precautions for the prevention of cartel law
violations. Our antitrust law compliance system was reviewed in
2010 and 2013 by a renowned external specialist, who confirmed
its effectiveness. To make further improvements, we have developed special electronic antitrust law courses that were introduced
throughout the Group. These courses are mandatory for senior
managers, sales staff, procurement employees who are in direct
contact with suppliers, employees involved in mergers and acquisition projects, and those in contact with competitors or who might
be affected by antitrust regulations in some other way. Throughout
the Group, around 5,600 users from 27 countries and/or functions
have registered for the antitrust law course to date. Moreover, 650
employees have registered to take part in a course conceived
specifically for Australia, where it will continue to be used in the
future.

Our sustainability strategy
Our company’s mission is to achieve outstanding business results
as well as to act in an environmentally and socially responsible
manner. While we are minimising the risks for our business and
exploiting new opportunities, we are at the same time developing
solutions for environmental, social and societal challenges. This
work focuses on the following topic areas.
Occupational safety
Because we are a manufacturing company, occupational health and
safety have top priority at HeidelbergCement. We employ targeted
measures to improve technical and organisational safety standards
and make people more aware of workplace safety. We focus not
only on our own employees but also on those from external companies and third parties.
Securing raw materials and conserving natural resources
Our business operations depend on our long-term local access to
mineral-based raw materials. These resources are finite, and their
exploitation often leads to local conflicts of interest. As a result, we
regard the sustainable securing of raw materials and the conservation of resources as key strategic tasks.
Our resource conservation strategy specifies that we use alternative raw materials and fuels for the production of cement. However,
the substitution potential is very much dependent on the availability of industrial by-products and on the high quality standards that
cement has to meet.

Water management and water protection are also playing an
increasingly important role. Water is scarce in many parts of the
world, and this scarcity is being made worse by climate change.
Even though the construction material industry has a relatively
small water footprint compared to other sectors, the scarcity of
fresh water represents a challenge for our company at some of its
locations. In response, our cement business line has begun to
introduce water management plans in places where water scarcity
is especially acute.
Nature conservation and species protection
Our raw material extraction operations temporarily disrupt the surrounding water deposits, soil, plants and wildlife. Although we cannot do much to change this in the short term, we can offset the
effects over the medium and long terms. Here, we make sure that
the subsequent use of our quarries is of high quality, is in line with
nature conservation principles and is carried out in close consultation with local stakeholders.

Energy efficiency and climate protection
The high energy requirements of cement production make the
enhancement of energy efficiency vitally important from the economic and environmental points of view. Moreover, cement production by its very nature leads to high levels of CO2 emissions.
To reduce these emissions, we are increasing the proportion of
alternative, CO2 -neutral raw materials and fuels in particular. In this
way, we have continually reduced our CO2 emissions in recent
years, and we will decrease them further in the future. We also support international CO2 reduction targets and initiatives as well as
policies for limiting global warming — provided that such initiatives
and policies ensure the same competitive conditions for all manufacturers of building materials and do not result in a mere shifting
of CO2 emission sources.
Our Sustainability Ambitions 2020
Back in 2009, we combined our most important activities for promoting sustainability in the HeidelbergCement Sustainability Ambitions 2020, which is valid for the entire Group. The programme
defines the core components and targets of our sustainability strategy but does not exclude the incorporation of additional measures
into our efforts to improve sustainability. We are currently working
to update the Sustainability Ambitions. Once this is done, the proG4-19,
gramme will define our sustainability strategy until 2030.

stakeholder groups as well as from the entrepreneurial standpoint
of HeidelbergCement. This helps us to identify and assess issues
that are currently important for our business success or that will
become important in the future. We use a list of topics that is based
on the Sustainability Ambitions 2020 and on the core activities that
were defined by the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) of the

the 2012 Progress Report.
At the end of 2014 we reviewed the topic list and materiality matrix.
In order to update the external evaluation of the topics, we asked a

Quality management
Building materials are subject to a stringent system of standardisation. We ensure these standards are met, thanks to final inspections and a dense network of quality checks that accompanies the
workflow in our company’s own laboratories. As part of our extensive quality assurance programmes, additional quality checks are
made by external experts. We also provide product and safety manuals to our customers to ensure that they use our products in the
safest possible manner.
Knowledge management
To gain a competitive edge, we have adopted an approach that
relies on the targeted sharing of knowledge and experience in our
business operations as well as in internal projects and external
partnerships. Our Knowledge Management Board, which consists
of representatives of our Group areas and functions, monitors and
controls our internal knowledge management and supports our
activities in national and international bodies. A key component of
our Group-wide knowledge management system is the systematic
networking of our experts through, among other ways, the utilisation of an integrated knowledge platform and the Technical Discussion Forum on our company’s intranet. Both of these platforms
provide access to knowledge and promote the sharing of experiences throughout the entire Group.
Environmental management
At HeidelbergCement, environmental protection policies and measures are managed by the Group Environmental Sustainability Committee. Under the lead management of the Global Environmental
Sustainability department, the committee’s experts from the various business lines and Group areas define guidelines, goals and
measures, and coordinate their implementation.

KEY FIGURES

REPORT PROFILE

We plan to introduce certified environmental management systems
at all of our cement plants worldwide by 2020. This will further
solidify our systematic environmental protection activities at all of
our locations. Our efforts will be based on the ISO 14001 international environmental management standard. However, we will also
enable the use of nationally recognised environmental management systems where appropriate. At the moment, 79% of our
integrated cement plants operate with a certified environmental
management system. In line with our Sustainability Programme
2020, we have conducted environmental audits at all of the Group’s
business lines. We want to audit all of our locations between 2015
and 2020. The improvement measures resulting from the previous
audits have already been implemented and are helping to improve
our environmental performance.
In 2013 and 2014 we have not detected any violations of environmental laws that could have led to the payment of significant fines
or non-monetary penalties.
Additional information on environmental protection: p. 18 ff.

Research and development
Our Heidelberg Technology Center Global (HTC Global) brings
together knowledge and expertise from throughout the company
and quickly makes it widely available to operating units. Our innovation efforts at HTC Global and in the local business units focus
mainly on three areas:
– Market and customer-oriented products and applications:
In particular the development and improvement of binders and
concretes with optimised properties and innovative functionality.
This also includes providing our customers with expert advice
on the use and optimisation of their products.

– Process and cost-optimised production:
The focus here is on finding cost-efficient substitutes for fossil
fuels and natural resources and on reducing energy consumption
in cement production. We are also working on the optimisation
of products and production methods in the aggregates and concrete sectors. For example, if sand production is changed in an
aggregates plant and the recipe for concrete in a ready-mixed
concrete facility so that raw material deposits are more efficiently
utilised while maintaining or even improving the concrete’s quality, the results will pay off for the company as well as benefit the
environment.

ventional clinker whatsoever. Because this research is still in the
early stages, it will probably take several years before such innovative alternative products are market-ready and available for
extensive use.
Total expenditure in the area of research and technology amounted
to EUR 103.2 million in 2014 (2013: EUR 103.9 million), which corresponds to 0.8% of our turnover. Personnel costs accounted for
approximately three quarters of overall expenditure. Altogether,

Qualified, motivated employees are a key prerequisite for the longterm success of our company. Our human resources policy thus
focuses on identifying talented employees, promoting their development and retaining them for our company. As a responsible employer, we also strive to offer our employees an attractive and safe
working environment.
We have developed a competence model that defines our expectations regarding our employees. This model allows us to carry out
systematic performance and potential assessments based on
Group-wide standardised criteria. It is also the basis of strategic
executive development and effective succession planning. We believe that the diversity of our workforce as well as our clear focus
on performance, professional expertise and integrity provide us

(Logistics Efficiency Optimisation) project. Since LEO was introduced in Poland and Germany in April 2014, the cement business
unit’s transport performance per vehicle has risen by 6% in Poland,
compared to the previous year. This improvement was the result
of optimised transport routes, a lower share of empty runs and
reduced downtimes. We expect the optimisation effect to be at least
of the same magnitude in all of the other countries in which LEO is
introduced.
Road transport is used for more than half of our deliveries to customers. For Germany as a whole, transports in the cement business
line consumed an average of about 35 litres of diesel per 100 km in
2013. This figure dropped to around 33 litres in 2014. In early 2015,
around 400 drivers took part in a driver training course in Germany.
The evaluation of the trips shows that fuel consumption can be
reduced by 10% if driver behaviour is changed.
In addition to driver training courses, our logistics measures focus
on the use of vehicles with higher payloads and lower fuel consumption. Moreover, the introduction of a terminal processing system enables shipments to be better distributed; long transport
routes are handled by trains, while trucks are used for short distances.
Supplier relations management
In 2014, HeidelbergCement purchased goods and services worth a
total of EUR 8,678 million (2013: EUR 8,171 million). These costs
correspond to 68.8% of total turnover. Around 90% of the costs are
accounted for by locally purchased goods and services. In this case,
the term “local” refers to expenditures that the company has made
in the vicinity of one of its plants or within the corresponding country. The procurement volume generated by the Group is thus a key
economic factor in many regions. Around 10% of the purchasing
costs are generated on the international level.

We know that our role as a good corporate citizen will also be
judged according to our success in terms of ensuring compliance
with sustainability standards throughout our supply chain. Groupwide procurement guidelines give clear instructions regarding
the supplier relationships and purchasing activities at HeidelbergCement.
As a basic principle, these relationships are based on ethical values
such as respect, fairness and credibility, which are also laid down
in our Supplier Code of Conduct. We systematically and transparently communicate this code to our local and global suppliers, who
must adhere to the code’s principles. The code incorporates the key
elements of the SA 8000 International Social Accountability Standard, the ISO 14001 international environmental standard, and the
principles of the International Labour Organisation. Our code
should encourage our suppliers to continuously make improvements wherever necessary. Contractual relations can be terminated
if suppliers fail to rectify weaknesses and deficiencies.

REPORT PROFILE

In 2015 we will continue to hold consultations with global and local
suppliers. On the basis of the aforementioned principles, the CSI
members also want to create a joint framework for the evaluation
of suppliers. An online platform will simplify the collection and consolidation of data. The data from this platform will be interpreted
separately for each company. An audit and a continuous improvement process will increase the suppliers’ involvement in the evaluations. The details for this are currently being drawn up.

HeidelbergCement is also cooperating with other sector representatives in a working group of the international Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) to develop a uniform approach to sustainable
supply chain management for the cement industry. The aim is to
create a guideline that will encompass the CSI approach as well as
joint principles on the basis of the UN Global Compact and the ILO
standards. The principles will address the following topic areas:
– Occupational health and safety
– Working conditions
– Freedom of association and protection against retaliation
– Forced labour
– Child labour
– Anti-discrimination
– Observance of environmental regulations
– Management of environmental impacts
– Bribery and corruption
– Transparency and integrity

Customer relations management
We seek to offer our customers the greatest possible utility and to
establish partnerships that are based on trust. Such an approach
includes sincere and honest communication, particularly when it
comes to advertising measures for the marketing of innovative and
environmentally compatible products, which require more explanation than standardised products.
Customers who wish to make complaints or file claims can get in
touch with their local contact partners. All complaints, no matter
whether they are of a technical, logistical or commercial nature, are
forwarded directly to the appropriate office. The structural design
and computer-supported implementation of our Complaint Management System is carried out on a global scale in accordance with
a predefined standard.
To increase customer utility, we have been intensifying our ongoing
systematic customer surveys in all areas worldwide. These surveys
enable us to focus our activities even more strongly on our customers’ requirements. In addition to conducting other market
analyses, we develop action plans for optimising our products and
services and for increasing customer satisfaction. All customer data
is treated confidentially, and under no circumstances is the information that we collect ever passed on to or processed by third parties.

Our engagement with stakeholders
In view of the strong local focus of our business, we can only be
successful in the long run if we maintain cordial relationships with
our stakeholders. We want to foster an open dialogue with all of
the relevant stakeholder groups on the local, national and international levels. Such a dialogue helps us to recognise important
topics early on and achieve greater acceptance of our activities.
Dialogue with local stakeholder groups
Most of our plants and quarries are situated in the direct vicinity of
residential communities. As a result, it is absolutely essential that
we have an ongoing dialogue with the respective communities,
government authorities and local organisations. As a rule, this dialogue is conducted by the heads of the plants and locations; if
necessary, support is provided by the communication department
of the respective national subsidiary. In addition to face-to-face discussions, we employ the entire range of information and dialogue
systems — from guidelines and information letters to regular
roundtables and community advisory panels.

KEY FIGURES

REPORT PROFILE

Stakeholder dialogue at international level
HeidelbergCement is a member of cross-sector as well as industryspecific associations that represent their members’ interests
through a continual dialogue with governments, businesses and
the general public. These memberships also enable us to exchange
information with other companies and organisations, and help us
to jointly promote sustainability. The partnerships focus on challenges that are specific to individual countries and to industrial
policy. These challenges pertain mainly to raw materials security,
environmental protection, energy conservation, occupational
health and safety, and social and employee-related issues.
As an industrial group that has its headquarters in Germany, we
are also active in the „econsense – Forum for Sustainable Development of German Business.“ The forum is an association of leading globally operating companies and organisations in Germany,
and addresses topics related to sustainable development and
corporate social responsibility (CSR). This business network primarily considers itself to be a dialogue platform and a think tank. econsense aims to promote the economy’s sustainable development
and enable its members to jointly take on social responsibility.

We take our stakeholders’ criticisms seriously and cooperate in
addressing them. In many places, we have taken new approaches
to reconcile the interests of the company with those of the communities in which we operate. At the Group, staff members at all levels
regularly discuss local activities and experiences. This helps us to
continuously enhance the stakeholder dialogue and the associated
internal guideline.

TARGETS

At the international level, we are active in the Cement Sustainability
Initiative, which was co-chaired by HeidelbergCement from 2013
to 2014. During this two-year period, we primarily focused on two
areas: occupational health and safety and the development of a
global certification system for sustainably produced concrete.
In all areas, the CSI always includes third parties that are affected
by the measures. As a result, the initiative lets interested parties
take part in the development of standardised sector-wide guidelines
and protocols in many projects. These parties include industry
associations, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and government representatives.

Dialogue with sustainability-oriented analysts and investors
The dialogue with capital market representatives is playing an
increasingly important role for us. Our shareholders and increasing
numbers of financial analysts and rating agencies want to know
how HeidelbergCement is integrating sustainability into its corporate strategy and what successes the company has achieved in this
area to date. In most cases, information is exchanged in bilateral
discussions.

Moreover, HeidelbergCement and its subsidiaries are working
together with the national Green Building Councils in 11 countries
to develop certification systems for sustainable construction and
to make the design, construction and operation of buildings more
sustainable.
Dialogue with political decision-makers
European Union legislation is having a growing impact on all
the sustainability aspects of our business operations. HeidelbergCement therefore has an officer who manages the political dialogue
on the EU level. In particular, this individual represents our interests
in the European Cement Association (CEMBUREAU), an organisation that represents European cement manufacturers in discussions
and negotiations with the EU and its institutions. Key issues
addressed by CEMBUREAU include the use of alternative raw materials and fuels, climate protection, emissions, biodiversity and
occupational health and safety. As a member of the European
Aggregates Association (UEPG), we are also involved in lobbying
activities for aggregates. Our interests concerning concrete are represented by the European Ready Mixed Concrete Organisation
(ERMCO) and the EU Concrete Platform.

Energy and climate protection
Our environmental policies focus on protecting the climate. As an
energy-intensive company we have for many years been diligently
striving to reduce our CO2 emissions. Between 1990 and 2014, we
reduced specific net CO2 emissions by 21.2% to 609.1 kg of CO2 / t of
cement throughout the Group. By the end of 2015, we plan to achieve
a reduction of 23% compared to the 1990 value. The Group’s annual

Participation in the EU’s emissions trading system
HeidelbergCement operates 38 facilities in eleven countries that
participate in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). Our Group
is also actively involved in the market for emissions certificates.
A position on Group level for dealing with emissions issues was
therefore established several years ago. In the associated corporate
department, we not only manage our trading activities within the
European Union (EU) but also monitor developments in countries
outside of Europe that might impact the operations of our plants.
The EU will have to make critical decisions regarding the future of
the European emissions trading system. For one thing, the current
debate concerning the market stability reserve will have a big impact on the future price development of emissions certificates.
Moreover, uncertainty will increase due to the discussions regarding a fundamental reform of the EU emissions trading system. We
are trying to minimise the effect that these uncertainties in the

European emissions trading market have on our company by making more extensive use of alternative, CO2-neutral fuels and by
using substitutes for some of the CO2-intensive clinker.
Emissions trading systems outside of Europe
Emissions trading systems are also being set up in regions outside
of Europe. China, for example, is testing a variety of concepts in six
of its provinces. One of these provinces is Guangdong. We operate
a joint venture there, so we closely monitor how the local emissions trading system is developing. In 2013 California (USA)
launched its long-awaited emissions trading system, which we
helped to develop in recent years. However, the system has only a
minimal impact on our business operations.
Innovations for climate protection
At our plant in Brevik, Norway, we launched the world’s first pilot
project for the capture of CO2 from combustion gases produced in
the cement industry. The project was launched in May 2013 and will
run until 2016. It is being conducted in cooperation with the European Cement Research Academy (ECRA) and receives funding from
the Norwegian government. As part of this project, we tested several
small CO2 capture systems in 2014. These systems use amines,
membranes and two different solid materials.
We also launched a project for the use of waste heat from kilns at
our Narsingarh clinker plant in central India. The facility that is
currently being set up to turn waste heat into electricity will enable
the clinker plant to generate 13 MW of power itself.
Outstanding energy efficiency
In 2014 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) awarded the
ENERGY STAR® to four of our cement plants in the USA: Leeds
(Alabama), Union Bridge (Maryland), Glens Falls (New York) and
Redding (California). The four facilities were honoured for their
exemplary energy efficiency, as they are among the top 25 cement
plants in the USA when it comes to energy efficiency. The Union

ENERGY STAR® was also awarded to the Downingtown Quarry in
Pennsylvania and to the Romeoville Quarry in Illinois.

REPORT PROFILE

In 2014 we successfully used alternative fuels for the first time at
our new cement plant at TulaCement in Russia and at our plants in
Bosnia-Herzegovina and India. We were able to further increase the
share of alternative fuels in more mature markets such as Sweden,
Norway, the UK, Hungary, Estonia, Romania and increasingly also
in Turkey. The substitution rate rose to over 80% at our cement
plant in Beremend, Hungary. As a result, the facility’s fuel costs are
among the lowest of any plant in the company.
Our cement plant in Guangzhou, China, also uses dried sewage
sludge. The technique used at the plant has proved to be very successful. At the city’s request, we are now investigating how we can
further increase the facility’s recovery capacity.

Raw materials and fuels
Many waste materials and by-products from other industries are
valuable raw materials for HeidelbergCement. In the production of
cement, these resources serve as alternatives to finite natural raw
materials and fossil fuels. In this way, we are helping to reduce
the problems that municipalities and industrial companies near our
plants have with waste. At the same time, these efforts are also reducing our CO2 emissions.

In Indonesia, we set up a pilot plant for using local household
waste. This is the first step in an effort to solve the waste disposal
problems in greater Jakarta and elsewhere and to reduce the load
that the existing landfills have to bear. The pilot facility is being
used to fine-tune the system’s technology and economic efficiency
in order to pave the way for larger projects in the future.

Alternative fuels replace natural resources
In all of the countries in which HeidelbergCement produces clinker
— the main component of cement — we investigate the possibility
of using waste from municipalities, agriculture and industry in an
economically and environmentally responsible manner. In order
to develop optimal solutions, we work together with supervisory
authorities, waste producers, neighbours, employees, NGOs and
other stakeholders.

TARGETS

As a result, HeidelbergCement is well on track to reach the Group’s
target of using 30% alternative fuels. This is the goal that we set
for ourselves in our Sustainability Ambitions 2020.
Alternative raw materials for cement manufacturing
We use alternative raw materials for the production of clinker,
which is the most important intermediate product in the manufacture of cement. In this way we reduce the amount of CO2-intensive
clinker in the final product. The increased use of alternative raw
materials in cement production is generally a core element of our
climate strategy. At Group level we have been able to increase the
amount of alternative raw materials to 12% and stabilise the
amount of clinker in the cement at 75.3%.
In the past two years we made progress in the development and
introduction of cements containing a lower proportion of clinker.
In Belgium, Poland and the Netherlands, we were able to replace a
large share of clinker with blast furnace slag and fly ash. In Norway
and Sweden, we take advantage of the positive interaction between
fly ash and limestone. In this way, we reduced the share of clinker
in standard cement by 4% in Norway. In Sweden, the switch from
pure limestone cement to the new mix reduces the amount of
clinker needed by 10%. In Romania, we introduced a new limestone-based composite cement in 2014 in order to reduce our
dependence on blast furnace slag.
Large amounts of industrial by-products are available in Central
Asia. Our plants exploit every opportunity to integrate these byproducts into the raw material mix for clinker production. In the
Ukrainian town of Kryvyi Rih HeidelbergCement has been producing cement for the local market since 2002. In 2014, we increased
the alternative raw material rate of the plant to 12% for the first
time.
Indonesia is our biggest sales market in Asia. In this hotly contested
market, we used 10% more materials as substitutes for clinker

REPORT PROFILE

during the reporting period. In 2014 we used 4 million tonnes of fly
ash, pozzolan, blast furnace slag and limestone for the production
of our composite cements. We benefited here from our investments
in processes for drying and grinding these materials. The clinker
factor dropped by 2% to 75% — a new benchmark for the sector in
Southeast Asia.
Use of materials requiring supervision
The careful handling of hazardous substances is a key element of
every country’s waste disposal infrastructure. For most types of
hazardous waste, reuse in cement plants has proved to be a totally
safe means of disposal and utilisation. The high temperatures and
long incineration period in the kilns ensure that all harmful components are completely destroyed. This has been confirmed by precise measurements taken by independent state-certified institutes.
However, HeidelbergCement (as well as all other member companies of CSI) does not use certain types of waste, including nuclear,
medical and highly toxic waste.

Land use and biodiversity
We only extract worthwhile deposits if they can be exploited in an
environmentally compatible and economical manner. Before making any decision concerning the development of a new quarry or
the expansion of an existing one, the company first conducts an
extensive approval process in line with the corresponding laws and
regulations. This process includes an environmental impact assessment and — if the affected area is of exceptional biological value
— special biodiversity studies. In these studies, the priorities are
set as follows: prevention, mitigation, compensation. Accordingly
we first check whether excavation work can be avoided or at least
adjusted in such a way that the ecosystem isn’t disrupted or that
such disruptions are kept to a minimum. If this is not possible,
HeidelbergCement implements appropriate compensation measures.

TARGETS

Concepts for the limitation of land consumption
For environmental and economic reasons, we always strive to limit
land consumption when planning our quarry and renaturation
activities. In principle, the authorised raw material supply is always
completely extracted in order to minimise land consumption. As a
result, we prefer to expand existing quarries rather than developing
new sites. Our production and plant facilities are also optimised so
as to require the smallest possible amount of land area.
Biodiversity management at our quarries
Recultivation plans are an integral part of approval processes.
These plans define the goals and the timetable for the reintegration
of a quarry into the surrounding landscape. Even while a quarry is
still in operation, we renaturate and recultivate those areas of the
quarry that are no longer used.
As early as 2010 we began to collect and analyse information about
the biodiversity of our quarry sites. In cooperation with our partner,
BirdLife International, we conducted a study to determine how far
our quarries are from nature reserves in Europe, Africa and Asia.
The study encompassed slightly more than half of our active quarries worldwide. It only collected data for the cement and aggregates
business. Concrete and asphalt plants are not taken into account,
because they have a negligible impact on biodiversity.
In the years ahead, we will conduct a similar study in North America and Australia.
The company collects data on three key indicators worldwide:
– Proportion of active quarries with after-use plans
– Proportion of quarries in areas with a high level of biodiversity
– Proportion of quarries in areas with a high level of biodiversity
for which biodiversity management plans are being implemented

23

HeidelbergCement I Sustainability Report 2013/2014

KEY FIGURES

REPORT PROFILE

In 2014, 83% of the cement-related quarries had subsequent use
plans. The corresponding figure for aggregates quarries was 89%.
By 2020, we plan to increase this share to 100% in both areas.
Altogether, 79% of our cement business line quarries in regions
recognised as having a high level of biological diversity already
have biodiversity management plans. The corresponding figure
for the aggregates business is 80%. We are steadily extending the
biodiversity monitoring to more and more quarries, and are also
implementing corresponding management plans.
Habitat protection
HeidelbergCement has restored many habitats by recultivating and
renaturating former quarries. In order to effectively promote biological diversity, we became the first company in the construction
materials sector to define uniform standards for recultivation and
renaturation. These standards are compiled in a regulation that is
binding throughout Europe. In comparable form, these standards
are also used as guidelines in Asia and Australia.
We record at the country level which areas our company has renaturated and recultivated. However, we generally do not check to
see how successfully habitats are preserved. In spite of this,
HeidelbergCement has committed itself to implementing locally
adapted biodiversity management plans at quarries in areas with
a high level of biological diversity. Around 200 such management
plans are currently in force. Moreover, a team of experts is currently
working on a habitat management handbook that will be published
at the end of 2015.
The areas that HeidelbergCement has renaturated and recultivated
encompass a wide variety of habitats:
– Aquatic habitats: lakes, ponds, fens and springs
– Terrestrial habitats: forests, grasslands, cliffs and escarpments
– Anthropogenous habitats: settlements and agricultural areas

Quarry Life Award
In 2011 we established the Quarry Life Award in order to make
people aware of the high biological value of our quarries. The
international award competition is held every two years. The
second round, which was completed at the end of 2014, was again
a big success. This was partly due to the fact that higher-quality
projects were submitted for the award. Awards were given to 57
projects at the national level, and seven projects were honoured at
an international award ceremony in December 2014.

This is one of the reasons why many endangered species settle in
our quarries, especially in Europe. Our quarries are now important
refuges and stepping-stone biotopes for certain species such as the
sand martin, the yellow-bellied toad, the eagle-owl and the tree
frog. HeidelbergCement takes part in numerous species-protection
programmes run by governmental and non-governmental institutions.
Cooperation with nature conservation organisations
We cooperate with a variety of local nature conservation organisations worldwide. Since 2012 we have also been working together
with BirdLife International. In cooperation with this international
nature conservation network — one of the largest in the world —
we have implemented biodiversity action plans at our locations and
initiated a local projects programme that greatly helps us achieve
our corporate goals. Together with the national partner organisations of BirdLife International, HeidelbergCement has co-funded
and implemented 15 projects in nine countries, encompassing a
total volume of €423,000. We have also organised biodiversity
courses for our employees.

Promotion of sustainable land use in developing countries
In 2010, Deutsche Gesellschaft für internationale Zusammenarbeit
(GIZ) GmbH — a government-owned company working in the
field of international cooperation and development — and Tanzania Portland Cement Company (TPCC) launched a joint publicprivate partnership project (PPP). The participants created a tree
nursery in order to promote sustainable land use in the quarries
owned by TPCC as well as in the surrounding areas. Although the
cooperation with GIZ officially ended in 2013, TPCC continues to
support the project. TPCC cooperates closely with local authorities,
universities, schools, NGOs and other companies in order to promote knowledge transfer and help other projects in Tanzania. Since
2011, TPCC has also been collaborating with the world-famous Jane
Goodall Institute in Tanzania.
We have also started to create a tree nursery in Tabligbo, Togo,
where a new clinker plant commenced production in spring 2015.
The nursery is being set up right next to the public Centre of Entrepreneurship, which we are currently constructing. The tree nursery
and the centre will be part of our local CSR activities.
We have developed a concept for the reforestation of an extensively deforested area next to our Lukala cement plant in the
Democratic Republic of Congo. We will also create a tree nursery
there in close cooperation with the neighbouring communities.

With the discovery of a new reactive clinker phase, HeidelbergCement has created the foundation for an alternative clinker technology. Because the new technology uses a different chemical
composition of the raw materials as well as lower firing temperatures, it reduces the CO2 emissions by around 30% compared
to conventional clinker. In addition, energy consumption is lowered
by about 10% to 15%. In 2013, this technique was used in a largescale industrial test to produce around 1,500 tonnes of clinker and
cement, which were then successfully employed for various concrete applications. The test proved the technical viability of the new
technique. In 2014, we completed the first research study and
defined the structure of a multi-year development programme. This
programme will create the preconditions for the future standardisation of products. It will be supported by the ECOBINDERS project,
which is funded by the EU.

Air pollution and noise
In addition to addressing the issues of dust and noise, HeidelbergCement faces a challenge in terms of the air pollutant emissions of
the cement business line. Whereas dust and noise are emitted from
different points in the production process, nitrogen oxides, sulphur
oxides, heavy metals and other airborne pollutants are only emitted
from kiln facilities. These pollutant emissions are regularly measured and monitored.

In 2014, the associations for ready-mixed concrete, cement and
aggregates in the Americas and Europe decided to establish the
Concrete Sustainability Council and drew up a certification system
for sustainably produced concrete. The certification of concrete in
accordance with social and environmental aspects along the value
chain aims to increase the acceptance of this construction material
and the entire industry by the green building councils and during
the awarding of public construction contracts. HeidelbergCement
is itself a member of 11 national green building councils.

In the last two years, we have made technical improvements at
many cement plants in Europe, the USA, Turkey, China, India and
Indonesia in order to reduce emissions of dust, nitrogen oxides and
sulphur oxides. In the Czech Republic, we continued our long-term
project for reducing noise at our plants in Mokra and Radotin. To

Air Pollutants (NESHAP), several of our cement plants in the USA
invested in equipment for reducing dust and mercury emissions.
In the aggregates business line, we implemented measures for
reducing noise and dust in the Czech Republic. In the concrete business line, we primarily invested in the reduction of the environmental impact (including noise) in Australia and Asia.
For the Group as a whole, SO2 emissions have declined by 15%
since 2008, NOX emissions by 15% and dust emissions by 63%.
Water management
HeidelbergCement has committed itself to the goal of mitigating
the impact of its activities on natural water resources to the greatest
extent possible. We comply with stringent environmental regulations to ensure that raw material quarrying will not damage local
bodies of surface water and ground water resources.

In 2013 and 2014, we introduced industry indicators for water reporting at all of our cement plants. We developed these indicators
in cooperation with the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI). By
2030 we also plan to introduce these indicators at all of the 742 aggregates and ready-mixed concrete facilities that suffer from water
stress. This occurs in regions where less than 1,700 m³ of water are
available per person each year. In 2014 we also conducted a global
water risk study. It supplied us with fundamental information for
the creation of a Group-wide guideline concerning sustainable
water management in the cement, aggregates and ready-mixed
concrete business lines. The study showed that 14.3% of our plants
are located in regions suffering from water scarcity, i.e. where less
than 1,000 m³ of water is available per person each year. In
response to this result, we are now aiming to gradually introduce
customised water management plans at these 337 locations
between 2016 and 2030. These plans will ensure that the scarce
water resources are sustainably used. We will begin this process at
the locations and in the regions where water scarcity is an especially urgent problem. The management plans include the implementation of concepts and measures for reducing water
consumption. In addition, the plans aim to involve external stakeholders from the local area in order to implement sustainable water
utilisation concepts that benefit the community so that local water
risks can be minimised.

it can be deposited in landfills in a controlled process. The local
operating permit at each plant specifies the allowable amount of
process-related waste products and how they are to be used.

Waste materials
Our primary focus in terms of waste management concerns the kiln
dust that is a by-product of clinker production. This dust is removed
from the kiln system in order to avoid further accumulation and the
possibility of a subsequent kiln failure. We use the kiln dust as an
alternative raw material in cement production, thereby improving
our ecological efficiency. In some exceptional cases, the composition of the dust prevents us from being able to recycle it 100%.
A second option is for us to use the kiln dust as a raw material for
the manufacture of special concrete. If no other option is available,

Employees and employment
HeidelbergCement strives to achieve outstanding corporate performance and occupy a leading position in its industry. To do this,
a solid foundation of legally and ethically correct behaviour must
be in place. That’s why the Managing Board has approved a Code
of Business Conduct that is binding throughout the Group. This
code defines our values and the ethical and legal standards that
apply at our company. Among other things, we ensure that the
working conditions at our plants are non-discriminatory, and we
conduct fair discussions with the employee representatives. Our
leadership guidelines provide binding definitions of all management-related principles, which, among other things, specify the
respectful treatment of colleagues, the maintenance of a strong
feedback culture and the professional development of our employees. The main leadership principles are embedded in standard
human resources processes and described in detail in HeidelbergCement’s Human Resources Guidelines.
Development of workforce numbers worldwide
At the end of 2014 HeidelbergCement employed a total of 44,909
men and women (2013: 45,169). The decrease by 260 employees
was mainly the result of two opposing developments. On the one
hand, more than 300 jobs were eliminated in a number of Eastern
European countries, in the Benelux countries and in Norway, India
and Malaysia. This was the result of efficiency increases in sales
and administration, as well as of facility optimisation measures.
Moreover, workforce numbers were reduced by around 1,400 employees due to a variety of portfolio optimisation measures, including the sale of the cement grinding facility in Raigad, India, the
aggregates company OAO Voronezhskoe Rudoupravlenije in Russia, another aggregates company in Indonesia and our shares of
the cement company Cimgabon S.A. in Gabon.

On the other hand, we hired around 450 new employees in growth
markets such as Indonesia, Central Asia and Africa. Due to
increases in demand, we also added almost 700 employees in the
UK, Sweden, North America and Australia. In addition, the size of
the workforce rose by more than 300 employees as a result of the
acquisition of a greater share of the Cimescaut Group (Belgium),
for which we previously used the equity method of accounting, and
of four Icelandic holdings, which we previously reported as associated companies, as well as of a majority holding in the Cindercrete
Products Group in Canada.
Employee representation and labour standards
HeidelbergCement has a long tradition of employee co-determination, which has proven its worth at our business locations in Germany. The employee committees at the individual locations form
the Central Works Council and its associated committees for the AG
and the Group Works Council. Employees are also equally represented on the Supervisory Board.

Most other European countries also have committees for employee
representation. Managers and employee representatives engage
in a continuous constructive dialogue on the European Works
Council. The council supplements the local information and consultation processes in the various European countries.
In addition, labour unions and similar organisations are active in
nearly all the countries in which HeidelbergCement operates. In our
Code of Business Conduct, we expressly commit ourselves to conducting an open and fair dialogue with the employee representatives.
HeidelbergCement is also committed to upholding the ILO’s core
labour standards, the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises and the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In 2014
we incorporated this commitment into our leadership principles.
We also expect our employees and business associates worldwide
to conform to these essential guidelines and recommendations.

Remuneration policy and working time
regulation
Our remuneration systems are based on our employees’ performance and results, in accordance with the market standards for
internationally operating companies in our sector. In addition to
their fixed salaries, which are specified by collective bargaining
agreements or individual employment contracts, our employees
also receive variable remuneration components that depend on
their individual job performance and the success of the company.
The employees of our foreign subsidiaries benefit from attractive
remuneration systems that correspond to the conditions of the
respective local labour markets. Collective regulations apply to
more than half of the Group’s employees.

Personnel costs and insurance contributions
In 2014 the Group’s expenditures for wages, salaries, social security, pension contributions and social assistance increased by 4.1%
to EUR 2,050 million (2013: EUR 1,969 million). That corresponds
to 16.3% of turnover (2013: 16.2%). Personnel costs rose as a result
of our acquisitions, the positive business development and the
increased expenditures for pensions because of interest-rate
effects.
The amount of the Group’s contribution to the pension scheme
corresponds to the accepted market level. In Germany, we have
created a matching model consisting of employer and employee
contributions to the company pension scheme. In countries that
have no statutory pension plans or national health insurance, we
support our employees in a manner that at least corresponds to
local practices.
Working time regulation
In our working time regulation practices, we conform to the legal
requirements that are in effect at our locations. We promote adherence to these regulations by means of our compliance system,
within which employees can individually report possible violations
(passive monitoring). To promote flexible working time options, we
offer models such as flexitime, working-time accounts, part-time
positions and leaves of absence to our employees in Germany.
Older employees have the option of switching to pre-retirement
part-time work.

Occupational health and safety
We have specified our principles for promoting the health of the
workforce in our corporate policy regarding occupational health
and safety. This policy was revised during the period under review.

ness of defensive driving. However, we also focused on technical
and organisational measures. These included the professional
maintenance of our vehicles as well as the implementation of prestart checks. In a number of countries, we are now also installing
360° camera systems into our vehicles. These systems especially
help drivers keep an overview of the situation in dense inner-city
traffic. All of these measures have already led to a substantial
reduction in the number of fatalities from traffic accidents.
At the end of 2013 we also introduced a Group standard regarding
the commissioning of equipment. It is closely connected to
the standard regulating protective equipment for machines, and
rounds out the range of topics relating to the work with and on
machines.
safety have a high priority for our company. That’s because occupational health and safety are key corporate values for us. In addition, we make sure that the personal protective equipment is
actually used and that our cardinal Group-wide rules are reliably
observed. The latter apply especially to work areas where accidents
were very frequent in the past. We will continue to pursue our
stated objective of minimising the risk of accidents and injuries and
the risk of occupational illnesses by means of effective prevention
measures.

Group standards
In 2013 and 2014, we continued to implement the Group standards
that we had set in previous years. These standards address issues
that coincide with those of our cardinal rules.
As mentioned in the previous Sustainability Report, one of our
main aims here in recent years was the prevention of traffic accidents during the transport of our products. To achieve this goal, we
conducted more driver training courses to increase people’s aware-

Externally certified occupational safety management systems, such
as the internationally applied OHSAS 18001 standard, have already
been introduced at 82% of our operating locations worldwide —
10% more than two years ago. The systems have recently been
introduced to locations in Russia, Togo, Bangladesh, India, Romania, Belgium, and Germany. In 2015 they are scheduled to be followed by locations in the Congo and by our new plants in
Kazakhstan and Togo. In addition to performing the management
audits required by the OHSAS 18001 standard, we began to conduct health and safety improvement reviews at selected locations
last year in order to identify and exploit additional improvement
potential.
Occupational safety is a management task
Even though we have succeeded in improving the technical and
organisational aspects of occupational health and safety for many
years now, serious accidents, and even deaths, continue to occur
at our facilities. In many cases these accidents are caused by
human error. As a result, we have continued our Group-wide Safety
Leadership Initiative, which we launched in 2012. This initiative aims

to make managers from all levels aware of their responsibility to
maintain occupational health and safety. In Canada and the USA,
for example, we conducted the Safety Leadership initiative, in
which all of the management levels were involved during the
reporting period under review.
In 2012 and 2013, we worked together very closely with HeidelbergCement’s European Works Council to conduct the project titled
Building Health & Safety Together. This project received funding
from the European Commission and aimed to increase works council members’ awareness of occupational health and safety issues
and to improve the communication between line managers and the
various works council organisations. All assessments agree that we
achieved this goal. Another result of this project was the creation
of five information brochures about occupational health and safety
issues. These brochures were translated into several different
languages and discussed with the employees during the Groupwide Safety Week. We are now continuing this close cooperation
with the European Works Council in a permanent safety committee.
The Group-wide Safety Week, which was first held in 2011, has now
become an integral part of our company’s training activities. During
the Safety Week both our employees and our subcontractors
receive occupational safety training and are made more aware of
dangerous situations. The line managers have also launched and
supported many local events that demonstrate the fact that everyone has to work together so that occupational health and safety
measures can be effective. In addition to offering various training
courses dealing with occupational safety, local units have also
taken emergency and health-related aspects into account. Families,
customers and neighbours are also involved in the measures conducted during the Safety Week.

Accident trends
In recent years, we have succeeded in further reducing the
frequency and severity of accidents at all units. In fact, accident
frequency has dropped by more than 56% since the reference year
of 2008. During the period under review, we particularly focused
on our activities in Western and Northern Europe in order to permanently reduce accident figures there. In addition to providing
managers with more intensive training regarding their occupational safety responsibilities, we focused on restructuring the H&S
organisation in these countries so that managers and employees
alike can receive more effective advice. These measures paid off,
enabling us to reduce accident rates in our Swedish units, for
example, by 85%, in Germany by 59% and in Norway by 49%
during the period under review. The accident rate also continued
to decline in other regions, such as Australia, where it dropped by
64%. Many of our local units have reported absolutely no accidents
for several years now. This demonstrates that our goal of reducing
the number of accidents to zero is a realistic one.
Thanks to a variety of measures, we managed to ensure that no
uninvolved third-parties were killed in traffic accidents outside our
plants in 2014. Unfortunately, employees from our company and
external firms were killed in accidents. Because this situation is
unacceptable, we will continue to intensify our efforts to prevent
fatal accidents in the future.
A disproportionately large number of employees from external
companies were killed in accidents. In many cases, this was
because they failed to observe safety regulations. As a result, we
will do more in the future to make sure that employees from external companies have the skills they need to work safely. We have
had good experience with training centres that have been specially
set up to teach occupational safety measures. This is especially the
case when we build new plants or alter existing ones. Workers may
only enter these construction sites after they have completed the

the risks related to these illnesses. These services are primarily
offered through our own medical stations or the medical staff of
in-house hospitals.

Occupational illnesses
For many years now, HeidelbergCement has had a low general
illness rate of around 1.8% of all hours worked.

Human resources development

Most of the acknowledged cases of occupational illness that have
occurred in the last two years have involved noise-induced hearing
loss. In addition, there have been cases of employees who suffered
from back injuries and respiratory illnesses.
To prevent job-related illnesses, we check the levels of noise and
dust at work sites and regularly monitor the employees’ health. In
countries with less well-developed statutory healthcare systems,
our subsidiaries offer comprehensive health check-ups for all employees and in some instances for their families as well. In regions
where HIV/AIDS or malaria are widespread, the local units have set
up programmes to advise the employees and inform them about

Dialogue with the employees
In order to safeguard the company’s long-term success, we need
highly qualified and motivated employees. That’s why our Groupwide human resources policy focuses on identifying talented employees and offering them opportunities for further development,
so that they can be retained for our company. To do this, we employ
the HeidelbergCement competence model, which defines the essential professional and personal skills and abilities that employees
require in our business. Moreover, the competence model allows
our supervisors to carry out systematic, uniform Group-wide
assesments of employees’ performance and potential. It also
serves as the basis of strategic executive development and effective succession planning. Supervisors and employees hold structured talks, during which they discuss the employees’ development
opportunities and prospects. In 2015 we will increase the number
of employees that are included in our assessments of performance
and potential. We are assisted by an IT system that standardises
and simplifies the process for the managers and the employees.
The system also enables us to more precisely estimate the number
of employees that will participate in the process in the future.
As in 2010, we again conducted a global management survey in
2013 in order to determine the managers’ satisfaction with their
work environments. The survey’s results demonstrate our
managers’ great motivation and strong loyalty to the company. We
received top marks in the areas of leadership, strategic focus,
corporate values and, in particular, loyalty. This is also the case in
comparison with the top companies from similar industries. The

survey also aimed to identify improvement potential. Among other
things, we learned that the managers think we still have enhancement potential with regard to customers and market development.
We have intensified our efforts in these two areas since 2014.
Among other things, we launched the Customer Excellence programme.
Besides the Group-wide management survey, we also hold
employee surveys. However, our large number of locations
requires us to conduct these surveys at the local level. In North
America, for example, we employ a rolling system, in which the
surveys are conducted at different locations each year.
Training and career development
Carrying out sustainable human resources work means systematically investing in the recruiting and training of highly qualified
young employees. In Germany, trainees account for 5% of our
employees (2013: 6%). In 2014, 84% (2013: 82%) of the trainees were
subsequently hired by the company.
Technical and vocational skills are indispensable for the flawless
management of process engineering and maintenance activities at
our plants. Besides vocational training, we therefore offer master
craftsmen’s courses every year at the Verein Deutscher Zementwerke.
In 2014, a key focus of the Group’s training and career development
programmes was once again on occupational safety, which
accounted for around 43% of all of the training measures. Other
focal areas were specialist development measures (36%) and manager development (5%). Each of the Group’s full-time employees
spent 34 hours on training measures on average.

Management training
In order to prepare our managers for their future assignments, we
offer training courses that are specially tailored to the needs of our
company.
One of the Group’s strategic initiatives aims to enhance the skills
of our senior managers. To this end, we developed the Summit programme in close cooperation with Duke Corporate Education. All
of the senior managers from 39 countries in which our Group
operates take part in the programme’s three-stage curriculum. It
focuses on general management and leadership skills and takes
global, regional and local issues into account.
Moreover, we offer workshops that specifically prepare our managers for change processes, such as those associated with the
Group programmes Continuous Improvement and Customer Excellence. Among other things, we focus here on involving employees from all levels of the company hierarchy in these processes.

Securing and promoting young talent
We offer highly motivated and qualified university graduates international trainee programmes that focus on engineering, sales,
finance, human resources, purchasing and IT. In 2014 HeidelbergCement received the trainee seal of the “Initiative for fair trainee
programmes committed to career development” in recognition of
its high-quality entry-level programmes. We are also still expanding
our management trainee programmes and continuing our intense
efforts to recruit college graduates and people with some professional experience all over the world. In 2014, we hired a total of
347 university graduates.
Around 800 employees are currently taking part in programmes
that prepare them for higher-level tasks. In 2011, we launched a special programme in Europe and Central Asia in order to prepare
highly qualified engineers in the cement sector for higher-level
engineering positions. Over a period of several years, the participants go through precisely specified training stages in engineering
at various plants in Germany and abroad. Besides engineering, the
participants receive training in management and leadership skills.

REPORT PROFILE

Since 2013, we have increasingly expanded the programme to
other Group areas.
In 2014 our in-house Aggregates Academy further expanded its
range of training and career development courses. More than 1,800
managers from our aggregates business attended 116 courses in
17 countries. The courses offered by the Aggregates Academy are
targeted at plant directors, managers and skilled employees from
quality assurance and sales. Advanced training modules provide
hands-on instruction at the plants so that the lessons can be quickly
put into practice. The Aggregates Academy has also developed
several introductory e-learning modules for new employees and
managers who have no prior knowledge of the aggregates business. All of the programmes are geared towards recruiting and
retaining talented individuals for the company and imparting
knowledge and skills that are crucial for HeidelbergCement’s
success.

Work-life balance
The challenge of demographic change
Our company is also faced with the consequences of demographic
change. About 14% of our employees are younger than 30. Most of
our employees are aged between 30 to 49, making up about 51%
of the Group’s total workforce. 35% of our employees are above 50,
and this share will continue to rise in many countries.
We are responding to this development by means of numerous
regionally adapted measures that are intended to maintain the
employees’ ability to work and to promote cooperation between
people of different generations. In Germany, for example, we have
further expanded the range of health management services we
offer, and we have consolidated them in our FIT for LIFE initiative.
Besides encompassing a preventive programme for the early

diagnosis of illnesses and risk factors, the initiative primarily helps
employees take a proactive approach to having a healthy lifestyle.
The services on offer include check-ups to detect intestinal
cancer, flu vaccinations, special “Health Days” and presentations
on health-related issues. Our health management activities will
continue to focus on the prevention of typically old-age-related
health risks and on increasing people’s awareness of these risks.
As a result, we especially promote in-house sport activities for people of all ages.
Diversity as a success factor
As part of our Group-wide human resources policy, we make sure
that employee teams consist of a balanced mixture of people with
different personalities, skills and experiences. We regard diversity
as a management concept that relies on the incorporation of various cultures, talents and experiences to create a workforce that
reflects our presence on international markets, our customer structure and our business environment. We seek to achieve these goals
through
– local country management so that our Group management
team is international in scope,
– an international workforce at the Group headquarters,
– management and employee teams whose composition reflects
that of the overall workforce (internationality, skills, experience,
age, gender etc.)
– a proportion of women in management positions that corresponds to the share of women in our German workforce.
All over the world, we are striving to recruit and promote highly
qualified, top-performing employees who utilise their various social
and professional skills to contribute to our company’s business
success.

REPORT PROFILE

The international composition of our management team enables
us to benefit from the experience gained in different cultures so
that we can flexibly and appropriately react to global challenges as
well as to the needs of local markets. Local managers continue to
hold about 80% of the senior management positions within the
Group.
We also make sure that employees from the countries in which we
operate are represented at our Group headquarters. We benefit
greatly from their knowledge of local markets, and their presence
makes it easier to cooperate with our colleagues in the various
countries. Non-Germans coming from 40 countries account for
142 of the 560 employees at the Group headquarters and the technical centres (Competence Center Materials and HeidelbergCement Technology Center) in Heidelberg and Leimen.
We have established the self-help Expatriate Network for these
employees from outside Germany who work in Heidelberg and
Leimen. The company supports this network of employees and
their families and friends in order to promote their integration into
the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Area. For example, the network
helps employees to find housing, cope with bureaucratic requirements and deal with issues related to childcare and schools.
For us, promoting diversity also means increasing the percentage
of women in management positions so that it corresponds to their
share of the workforce. In 2014 women accounted for 13% of the
total workforce and 9% of senior managers in the Group. In
Germany, 14% of the total workforce and 8% of the senior
managers were women. In 2011, HeidelbergCement and other DAXlisted companies signed a voluntary commitment to increase the
percentage of women in management positions in Germany.
Specifically, we intend to more than double this share to 15% by
2020. In order to achieve this target, we are intensifying our management trainee programmes. Women already account for 21% of
the participants in the management trainee programmes offered in

Germany. In early 2013 we signed the Diversity Charter in order to
affirm our activities to date and to publicly proclaim our appreciation of diversity.
Reconciling work and family
As we compete with other companies for the best employees, we
are adjusting ourselves worldwide to changing lifestyles. For
example, we are employing flexitime, part-time working and leaves
of absence as well as other measures to help employees reconcile
the requirements of work and family more effectively. In 2014, parttime work accounted for 11.1% of all positions at HeidelbergCement
AG. Given the small size of our locations, our cooperation with
external networks has provided many excellent solutions regarding
daycare services, summer camps for children and our employees’
ability to take care of family members who require assistance. Our
employees thus benefit from easy access to a professional and flexible network at reasonable costs. As part of our FIT for FAMILY
initiative, we have formed partnerships with daycare centres
located near our facilities in Heidelberg and Leimen. This enables
us to reserve a certain number of childcare places for children of
our employees.

TARGETS

Our corporate philosophy involves thinking globally and acting
locally. Having good relations with the communities near our
locations is the precondition for our business as well as its success
factor. In the process, we establish business contacts, capitalise on
local know-how and maintain a dialogue with our neighbours. Our
materiality analysis has confirmed that good relations to local
communities are extremely important, especially from the viewpoint of our internal stakeholders. That’s why we will take local
communities more into account in the revision of our Sustainability Ambitions and also increase their importance.
Materiality analysis: pp. 10–11

We want to create added value for our company and for the
communities in which we have facilities. Whenever possible, we
make sure that local employees manage operations at our Group’s
locations. Over the past three years, local managers held 80% of
the senior management positions at the Group. Moreover, all of
our plants work closely with local suppliers and service providers.
In fact, around 90% of our procurement volume is invested in the
immediate vicinity of our plants or within the respective countries.
By means of these measures and through the creation of jobs, we
help to create value at our company locations. The resulting wages,
investments, purchases and taxes promote economic development.

Corporate citizenship
Our corporate responsibility is not limited to our business processes and their direct impact. We are also a part of society, and we
benefit from the regional networks at our locations worldwide. As
a result, we also play an active role in tackling social issues.

REPORT PROFILE

This understanding of our role is the driving force behind our
Group-wide Corporate Citizenship Guideline, which defines the
general criteria and objectives derived from our sense of social
responsibility. In our social involvement, we deliberately focus on
our core business. In other words, we assign priority to areas where
our core competencies enable us to contribute the most and
achieve noticeable improvements:
– Construction, architecture and infrastructure: We provide practical help in construction projects by providing materials, time,
financial assistance and know-how.
– Environment, climate and biodiversity: We promote initiatives
that deal with the most significant environmental impacts
associated with our business operations.
– Education, training and culture: In this area, we tailor our
activities to the specific needs of each of our locations.
We have also laid down certain evaluation criteria in order to
ensure that these voluntary activities are transparent as well as
efficient. We support projects, initiatives and organisations that are
active at our locations or to which we have a direct link. In addition,
we make sure that the guidelines and principles of such organisations are in accordance with our own corporate philosophy.
The decisions regarding our support of projects in individual countries or at our locations are made decentrally by the country
managers within predefined budgets. These managers are also
responsible for implementing and controlling projects and for local
reporting. Group Communication & Investor Relations is responsible for reporting on Group-wide corporate citizenship activities
within the framework of our sustainability-related communication
measures.

In 2014, we created a group of CSR experts so that we can better

Tree nursery and education project in Tanzania
In 2010 we initiated another development partnership with GIZ in
Tanzania. The partnership’s main aim is to establish a tree farm that
supplies plants for the afforestation of a disused quarry of our
subsidiary Tanzania Portland Cement Company (TPCC). The tree
nursery also helps to restore devastated woods and green areas
within the port city of Dar Es Salaam. The development partnership
has been supplemented by an education project for schoolchildren
that is being run in cooperation with the Jane Goodall Institute in
Tanzania. As part of this project, numerous groups of pupils have
been formed in the neighbourhood of our cement plant since April

2012. The groups focus on protecting plant and animal species and
promoting biodiversity. Employees from the tree farm instruct the
pupils in the basics of tree cultivation, which are then passed on to
other schoolchildren.
Although the partnership with GIZ officially ceased at the end of
2013, HeidelbergCement has since then operated the tree nursery
and the associated programmes on its own. Additional tree farm
projects are currently being initiated in Togo, Ghana and Congo.

The Palestinian population also benefits economically from our
mining activities. Besides paying extraction fees to the civilian Israeli administration of the West Bank, which uses the funds for
maintenance purposes and to promote economic development, we
are also creating valuable jobs in a region that is otherwise characterised by high unemployment. More than 60% of the employees
in the quarries in the West Bank come from the occupied territories
and their wages are several times higher than the local average.
The extraction work barely affects the region’s wealth of existing
raw material reserves. The raw material reserves will last for several
centuries.

Local conflicts of interest
In recent years we were accused of violating international law in
Israel. An Israeli human rights organisation filed a petition with the
Israeli Supreme Court, demanding that Israeli operators of quarries
halt all mining activities in the occupied West Bank. On 26 December 2011, the Israeli Supreme Court rejected the human rights
organisation’s petition in the last instance and in a legally binding
manner.

From the very beginning of our quarrying work in this area, we
have been able to obtain all of the requisite permits without exception. On no occasion have we continued with our quarrying activities in the absence of the requisite permits. We intend to continue
acting on this principle also in the future.

In spite of this ruling, NGOs and interest groups continue to repeatedly ask us to provide explanations regarding various aspects of
Hanson Israel’s business activities in the West Bank. We have carefully investigated the aforementioned issue together with local
management, and are fostering a dialogue at the local level. We
also make sure that our Israeli and Palestinian employees are
treated equally and that they receive equal pay. We are promoting
cooperation within intercultural teams, which foster a dialogue
between our Israeli and Palestinian employees and thus contribute
to cross-cultural understanding in this conflict.

About this report
This is the sixth time that HeidelbergCement has published a Group Sustainability
Report. In this publication we explain how HeidelbergCement is fulfilling its
economic, environmental and social responsibilities and report on the progress we
have made in 2013 and 2014 in the implementation of our Sustainability Ambitions.
The report has been prepared for our employees, investors and analysts, customers
and contractors, as well as political players and non-governmental organisations.

KEY FIGURES

REPORT PROFILE

concerning our workforce and occupational safety. We report our key figures for
environmental and occupational safety according to the guidelines of the Cement
Sustainability Initiative (CSI) of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD).
The guidelines in their original wording: www.wbcsdcement.org/publications

A part of the key figures on environmental protection and occupational safety from
the cement business line were subject to an independent limited assurance, as
required by our membership in CSI. The review also fulfils the wish of our stakeholdG4-27
ers to have key indicators independently verified.
The results of this external assurance can be found on our website:
www.heidelbergcement.com/assurance

Report content and organisation
This sustainability report has been prepared according to the latest guidelines of
the internationally recognised Global Reporting Initiative (GRI 4). The report conforms
to the requirements of the “Core” option of the GRI G4 guidelines.
Our complete GRI Index: http://www.heidelbergcement.com/GRI-index

Our decisions concerning the most important sustainability themes for the articles in
our report were guided by the GRI principles (materiality, inclusion of stakeholders,
sustainability context, completeness). We continuously refine our reporting processes
G4-23
in line with these standards.
In accordance with this principle, we have further streamlined the reporting on target
achievement and oriented it more closely to the results of the materiality analysis.
We have eliminated targets that were immaterial or difficult to measure. This is a
preparatory measure that is part of the preparation of our new Sustainability Ambitions.
Precise definition and methodology of the report
This Sustainability Report for 2013/2014 deals with the business years 2013 and 2014
of the HeidelbergCement Group. The business years run from 1 January to
31 December. The key facts and figures included in this report correspond to those in
the consolidated financial statement and the management report of HeidelbergCement’s Annual Report for 2014. This is also the case for the facts and figures

HeidelbergCement I Sustainability Report 2013/2014

Data collection
Methods and systems that have been defined Group-wide are used to collect data at
our locations. Internal reporting and consolidation of the data take place via centralised electronic KPI data management systems at the Group; here the key figures
are checked for completeness and credibility. Uniform Group-wide definitions of all
the relevant key figures, as well as process guidelines for the reporting processes,
are available on the intranet.
Information about the editing process
This Sustainability Report is published in German and English. The editorial deadline
was 30 May 2015. The previous sustainability report was published in September
2013. In line with the two-year reporting cycle, the next report will be published in
2017. In 2016, we will make updated key figures and information available on our website.
Disclaimer of liability
We have compiled the information and key figures contained in this report with
extreme care. All of the contents of this report were examined by the employees
responsible for this task. However, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that
this report includes erroneous information. The report and the information contained
in it do not constitute a test of compliance with the current laws, legal regulations or
recognised sustainability practices in the industry.
