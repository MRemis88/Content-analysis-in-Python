About This Report
Content
Since 2012, we have reported on our full-year financial, social,
and environmental performance in one integrated report (“SAP
Integrated Report”) available at www.sapintegratedreport.com.
The SAP Integrated Report 2016 contains a comprehensive and
integrated presentation of our performance in 2016 based on
both financial and non-financial measures and is available
online.
The financial reporting presented in the SAP Integrated Report
includes our Consolidated Financial Statements, our Combined
Management Report, and certain financial measures derived
from our management reporting. The non-financial information
relates to topics derived from our materiality assessment
including business conduct, climate and energy, human and
digital rights, human capital, impact on society, and innovation.
The SAP Integrated Report is aligned with the content elements
suggested in the International Integrated Reporting Framework
of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC).

Basis of Presentation
Our Combined Management Report is prepared in accordance
with sections 315 and 315a of the German Commercial Code and
German Accounting Standards No. 17 and 20. The Combined
Management Report is also a management commentary
complying with the International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) Practice Statement Management Commentary.
Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in
accordance with IFRS. Internal control over financial reporting
ensures the reliability of the information presented in the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Our executive management
has confirmed the effectiveness of our internal controls over
financial reporting.
The social and environmental data and information included in
the SAP Integrated Report is prepared in accordance with the
core option of the G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of the
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). We apply the GRI principles for
defining report content (sustainability context, stakeholder
inclusiveness, materiality, and completeness). We consider the
principle of sustainability context in a number of ways, such as
by looking at global issues or trends including climate change
and demographic shifts. For example, we assess our
greenhouse gas emissions in the context of the emissions of the
entire information and communications technology landscape,
with particular focus on the abatement potential of the industry.
When it comes to completeness, we recognize that while we
comply with this principle in reporting on our own operations, we

4

are still developing methodologies to reliably quantify our
impact through our solutions. In addition, the non-financial
information is prepared by applying the principles of
inclusiveness, materiality, and responsiveness.
Greenhouse gas data is prepared based on the Greenhouse Gas
Protocol.

Data
All financial and non-financial data and information for the
reporting period is reported utilizing SAP software solutions and
sourced from the responsible business units.
The reporting period is fiscal year 2016. The report
encompasses SAP SE and all subsidiaries of the SAP Group. To
make this report as current as possible, we have included
relevant information available up to the auditor’s opinion and the
responsibility statement dated February 22, 2017. The report is
available in English and German.

Independent Audit and Assurance
KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft has audited our
Consolidated Financial Statements and our Combined
Management Report (see the Independent Auditor’s Report).
Additionally, KPMG has provided assurance on selected nonfinancial data and information in accordance with the
International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000
and 3410 (“Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas
Statements”), two pertinent standards for the assurance of
sustainability reporting. Where our SAP Integrated Report
makes reference to SAP’s public Web site, that Web site
information is unaudited. Both the Independent Auditor’s Report
and the Independent Assurance Report for non-financial
information are available in the Independent Auditor's Report
section and the Independent Assurance Report section.
For more information about our materiality assessment and
related stakeholder engagement, see the Materiality section and
Stakeholder Engagement section.

Concept and Realization
This report was designed by SAP and created with
SAP S/4HANA software and the SAP BusinessObjects
Disclosure Management application.

Letter from the CEO

Dear Stakeholders of SAP,
On behalf of the 84,000 employees of SAP, it is my distinct
privilege to present the SAP Integrated Report 2016. Backed by
a strong financial, social and environmental performance, we
have never been more committed to our customers, colleagues,
vision and strategy. As the platform company for digital
business, we are focused on Impact Through Innovation. As a
purpose driven company, we are focused on strengthening the
economy, society and the environment for all people. Driven by
our ambition and guided by our values, we believe that SAP’s
best days are truly yet to come.

SAP’s Results
Since 2010, we have worked hard to earn results that speak for
themselves. Our revenue, operating income, and market value
have all more than doubled. Our customer count has tripled. We
have progressed from a nascent cloud business to having the
most cloud users in the business software industry. And most

8

significantly, we have scaled a once-in-a-generation new data
architecture with SAP HANA.
We continued our momentum in 2016. We again delivered a
trifecta of strong software sales, fast cloud growth and
operating income expansion. Non-IFRS cloud revenue powered
to 31% growth. Cloud and software grew 8%, IFRS operating
profit was up 20%, while non-IFRS operating profit expanded to
a record 6.6 billion euros. New cloud bookings surged 31% in the
full year, which means that we have a three billion euro business
growing more than 30%. The road ahead looks equally strong,
as cloud backlog soared 47% to 5.4 billion euros, greatly
enhancing the predictability of our future cloud revenue.
Our business is healthy and our company is happy. As a truly
integrated report, we also showcase non-financial indicators and
their financial impact. For example, employee engagement is at
an all-time high. Our employees are healthier than ever based on
our Business Health Culture Index. Our colleagues are

To Our Stakeholders | Letter from the CEO

dedicating more time to serving their communities through our
social sabbatical program and month of service. We beat our
CO2 reduction target and continue to power data centers and
facilities with 100% renewable energy. These factors have led
us, for the 10th year in a row, to be the number one software
company in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. Our
commitment to diversity and inclusion has also never been
stronger, which led us to become the first global IT company to
earn EDGE certification for our focus on gender equality.
In the true spirit of our founders, especially our chairman Hasso
Plattner, SAP is never content to rest on past success. We
continue to pursue an aggressive innovation agenda and remain
confident in our long-term ability to continue delivering
profitable growth.

A Statement About Our Challenges
and Opportunities
When we introduced a new operating principle in 2014 – Run
Simple – many observers challenged us. SAP software, they
said, is not particularly simple. This is true. SAP software is the
most sophisticated software in the information technology
industry. It runs the largest enterprises in business, healthcare,
public services agencies and beyond. 76% of the world’s
financial transactions touch an SAP system and nearly one
trillion U.S. dollars in commerce is transacted across our cloud
business networks. This is truly innovation at scale on a global
basis.
So why did we make a bold move for “simple”? We did it
because reducing complexity is the defining priority of this
young century, while handling complexity is SAP’s 45-year core
competency.
Consider the following about the state of the world:
– Businesses in every industry are confronting digital
transformation. 55% of the companies listed in Fortune
magazine’s 500 list actually lost money as they faced
disruptive competition. On every topic, from customer
engagement to finance and supply chain, businesses are
immersed in a period of complex change.
– Technology is evolving faster than ever, challenging
businesses to adopt early or risk inevitable decline.
– People are nervous about the implications of a new digital
economy. As a result of this anxiety, the public debate has
become more emotionally charged and intense than ever
before.
Taken together, this is an intense maze of circumstances. The
challenge to SAP is therefore unmistakable. We must design and

To Our Stakeholders | Letter from the CEO

deliver technology that eliminates the wrath of complexity from
the experiences of end users:
– For consumers, who expect businesses to know them, to
understand their preferences, and to personalize their
experience;
– For employees, who want to understand the connection of
their work to the results of their company, and;
– For citizens, who now more than ever want transparency and
highly responsive public services.
To the customers of SAP, we enthusiastically redouble our
commitment to your success. We believe that addressing your
complexity requires heightened empathy, intellectual curiosity
and above all humility. Please measure us on our ability to
understand your business strategy and challenges. Measure us
on the clarity with which we guide your digital transformation
and your innovation road map. Measure us on our ability to
make you early adopters of machine learning, the Internet of
Things, blockchain and other breakthrough innovations.
To the stakeholders of SAP, we respectfully request that you
hold us accountable for our ability to remain a customer-driven
growth company. Measure us on the success of our SAP Cloud
Platform, our SAP S/4HANA digital ERP, our cloud business
networks, and applications. Measure us on the high quality of
our user experience and our commitment to design thinking and
innovation. Measure us on modern services and support,
hallmarks of our hard-earned reputation for customer loyalty.
Measure us on our advocacy for human rights, environmental
sustainability, and corporate social responsibility.
If our business results continue on the positive trajectory of the
past seven years, you will know that we have kept these
promises. Equally critical, if our social results such as employee
engagement, diversity and sustainability continue, you will know
that we stayed true to our vision to help the world run better and
improve people’s lives. We remain ever grateful for your
confidence, your trust, and your support.

Very truly yours,

An Up and Down Year for
International Stock Markets
International stock markets endured another rollercoaster year
in 2016, prompted, among other things, by China's faltering
economy, the UK vote to leave the EU, the presidential election
in the United States, the referendum in Italy, the Federal
Reserve's interest rate decisions, strong exchange rate
fluctuations, and low oil prices. SAP stock nevertheless held up
well, crossing the €80 mark for the first time in its history. With
an increase of 12.9% during the year, the stock outperformed
major indices for the second year in a row. In comparison, the
DAX 30 increased 6.9% and the EURO STOXX 50 increased
around 0.7%.

SAP Stock Reaches New All-Time
High
The DAX fell below 10,000 points at the beginning of the year as
a result of China’s stock market crash and declining oil prices.
SAP stock, meanwhile, reached its quarter peak of €74.25 on
January 12 following publication of our preliminary full-year
results for 2015. At the end of January, a strong euro and
uncertainty about US interest rate policies strained the market
further, pushing the DAX below 9,000 points. This in turn
caused our share price to drop to €64.90, the lowest point of the
year,on February 11.
SAP stock recovered after the announcement of our preliminary
first-quarter results on April 20, climbing to €71.09. At the
beginning of May, however, weak company results, a solid euro,
and increasing concerns about a Brexit put the stock markets
under renewed pressure and drove the DAX below the 10,000point mark again. By contrast, the price of SAP stock remained
stable. On May 13, the day after the Annual General Meeting of
Shareholders, it finished at €68.49, despite the €1.15 exdividend effect.

12

€101.7 bn
Market capitalization
at end of 2016

The share price ultimately reached €72.96 on May 31, in the
wake of a market recovery triggered by a falling euro and rising
commodity prices. On June 23, however, the markets collapsed
following Britain’s shocking vote to leave the EU – and SAP
stock tumbled, falling to €66.40 on June 28, its lowest level
since February.
Fear of the consequences of the Brexit continued to weigh on
the markets until early July, when encouraging data on the US
labor market and hopes of a further central bank stimulus
package lifted market sentiment again. After publication of
strong financial results for the second quarter on July 20, the
price of SAP stock surged 5.7% to €75.72, its highest closing
price ever at that point. Positive analyst estimates buoyed the
SAP share price even higher, propelling it past the €80 mark for
the first time ever in the Company’s history to close at €80.40
on September 2. At the end of September, the Federal Reserve’s
decision not to raise interest rates had a positive impact on the
overall market situation, pushing SAP stock to €82.36 on
September 22.
Our stock continued to hover above the €80 mark during the
first few days of October before a weak start to the reporting
season and concerns about the Chinese economy depressed the
markets anew. Publication of our strong third-quarter results on
October 21 and an upward revision in our forecast, however, saw
the SAP share price rise 3.7% to €81.98. In early November,
uncertainty over the outcome of the presidential election in the
USA determined the mood on global stock markets. SAP stock
closed at €78.52 on November 1 in a somber market
environment. Following the surprising election results on
November 8, global stock markets reacted with initial panic but
recovered quickly. At the beginning of December the decision
against constitutional reform in Italy put further pressure on
stocks. The promise of continued lose monetary policy from the
ECB, however, subsequently pushed stocks higher. During this
positive trend at the end of the year, the SAP stock closed the
year on December 30 at a new all-time high of €82.81.

To Our Stakeholders | Investor Relations

Providing transparency to investors
We are continuously engaged with the investment community
through a number of channels. Over the course of the year,
senior management at SAP and the Investor Relations (IR) team
discussed our strategy and business development with
institutional investors and analysts worldwide.
A particular highlight of our global IR program in 2016 was the
Capital Markets Day held in New York City. At this exciting event,
attended by more than 75 financial analysts and investors, the
SAP Executive Board discussed the details of the strong
strategic position of SAP in the market. The Executive Board
also discussed the future outlook of the company and shared
insights about the innovations that the company planned to
bring into the market in 2016. Two SAP customers, Swiss
Property and HP Enterprises also presented how SAP is helping
them in their digital transformation journey. In addition, we
hosted events for buy-side analysts in Walldorf. We also held
events for investors and financial analysts at the CeBIT fair in
Hanover, Germany and at the SAPPHIRE NOW conference in
Orlando, Florida. Furthermore, we maintained regular dialog
with socially responsible investors (SRI), providing them with
insights into our environmental, social, and corporate
governance policies. SAP representatives spoke at various retail
shareholder events. The Investor Relations team and the
Treasury teams also maintained regular communication with the
debt investor community.
Investors can access a wide range of information about SAP and
its shares online. Our channels of communication include our

To Our Stakeholders | Investor Relations

Twitter feed @sapinvestor, the quarterly SAP INVESTOR
magazine, and a text message service. Shareholders can reach
the IR team directly through a telephone hotline and through an
e-mail at investor@sap.com. We also publish an overview of the
latest analyst assessments in collaboration with Vara Research.
We webcast all key investor events at which members of our
Executive Board speak, and we post all relevant presentations
on the Investor Relations Web site.

Rewarding our investors –
Dividend payout of €1.25 per share
We believe our shareholders should benefit appropriately from
the profit the company made in 2016. In recent years, the
payout has always been greater than 35% of profit after tax. We
aim to continue our policy to pay a dividend totaling more than
35% of profit after tax in the future.
At the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, the Executive
Board and the Supervisory Board will recommend increasing the
total dividend for fiscal year 2016 by 9% to €1.25 per share
(2015: €1.15)

Corporate Governance
Report
We are a global company with an international shareholder base,
so we need sound governance. Good corporate governance
means managing the Company accountably and transparently
to secure long-term value. We believe our shareholders,
business partners, employees, and the financial markets reward
good corporate governance with the increased trust they place
in our Company.

Corporate Governance Principles at
SAP
SAP is an international firm with European roots, having the legal
form of a European company (Societas Europaea, or SE). Being
an SE headquartered in Germany, we are now subject to
European and German law for SEs while remaining subject to
German stock corporation law. Major characteristics of our
governance structure remain in place since the conversion,
notably our two-tier board comprising a Supervisory Board and
an Executive Board, and parity for workforce representatives on
the Supervisory Board. Because SAP SE is listed on a German
stock exchange, our corporate governance is still based on the
German Corporate Governance Code (the “Code” in this report).
Every year, as required by the German Stock Corporation Act,
section 161, the Executive Board and Supervisory Board issue a
declaration stating whether SAP has implemented and is
following the Code’s recommendations, and identifying any
recommendations that the Company has not followed – with a
full explanation of why it has not done so. Our latest section 161
declaration, published on October 29, 2016, is on the SAP Web
site along with our declarations from previous years and links to
the current and previous editions of the Code. As our 2016
declaration shows, we currently follow all but five of the 102
recommendations and all of the suggestions in the current
Code.
Since SAP is also listed in the United States, we comply with the
rules that apply to non-U.S. companies listed on the New York
Stock Exchange (NYSE). These include the requirements, as
they apply to foreign private issuers, of the NYSE Corporate
Governance Standards, the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Corporate Governance Statement
On February 21, 2017, the Executive Board published a
corporate governance statement for 2016 pursuant to sections
315 (5) and 289a of the German Commercial Code. The

16

statement is on the SAP Web site. It comprises the current
declaration pursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act,
section 161, certain details of our corporate governance
practices, and an account of how the Executive Board and the
Supervisory Board work, who serves on which Supervisory
Board committees, and how those committees work. It also sets
out the targets for the percentage of women on the Executive
Board and the two management levels below Executive Board
level.

Executive Board
The Executive Board currently has seven members. It is solely
responsible for managing the Company. It has a duty to exercise
its management powers in the interest of the Company and in
pursuit of the sustained growth of corporate value. It discusses
and agrees its strategy for the Company with the Supervisory
Board, ensures compliance with the requirements of the law
throughout the Group, and maintains effective risk management
structures and internal risk controls. There is information about
each member’s portfolio of responsibilities on the SAP Web site.

Supervisory Board
The size and composition of the Supervisory Board are
governed not by the German Codetermination Act (which does
not apply, because we are a European company) but by the
Articles of Incorporation and the SAP SE Employee Involvement
Agreement. Both documents are available on the SAP Web site.
The Supervisory Board has 18 members who, in equal numbers,
represent the shareholders and the employees. It appoints,
monitors, and advises the Executive Board. The Executive Board
involves the Supervisory Board in decisions on matters of
fundamental importance for the Company. The Supervisory
Board has reserved to itself the approval of certain transactions
of fundamental importance, as set out in the Articles of
Incorporation and detailed in the Supervisory Board’s list of
reserved categories of transactions. The Executive Board
regularly provides the Supervisory Board with full and timely
reports on all material matters of strategy, business planning,
and performance, including any deviations of actual business
performance from plan, risks, risk management, and corporate
compliance. We provide our shareholders with in-depth
information about how the Executive Board and the Supervisory
Board work, how the committees are composed, and how these
committees work, in our corporate governance statement. For
more information about the joint work of the Executive Board

To Our Stakeholders | Corporate Governance Report

and the Supervisory Board and about the work of the
Supervisory Board and its committees in 2016, see the Report
by the Supervisory Board.

Composition of the Supervisory
Board
The Supervisory Board members as a group possess the
knowledge, ability, and expert experience required to properly
perform its duties in our global IT company. At least one
independent member has financial reporting and auditing
expertise. The Supervisory Board has defined the following
objectives for its own composition:
– There should never be fewer than three people from the
international stage on the shareholder representatives’ side
of the Supervisory Board.
– No employee, consultant, or director of a significant SAP
competitor should be a Supervisory Board member.
– At least five shareholder representatives on the Supervisory
Board should be independent members in the meaning of
section 5.4.2 of the Code.
– No member of the Supervisory Board should be older than 75
years.
We believe the current composition of the Supervisory Board
fulfills all of these objectives. There is information about each
member, the committees, and who serves on which committee,
on the SAP Web site.

Independence of the Supervisory
Board
We believe a sufficient degree of independence of our
Supervisory Board members is essential for effective and
responsible corporate management and control. Our
Supervisory Board has a defined objective for its composition
regarding the minimum number of independent members on the
shareholder representative side, as recommended in the Code,
section 5.4.1, paragraph 2. The objective is five such members.
At its meeting on October 28, 2016, the Supervisory Board
determined that all of its shareholder representative members
are independent in the meaning of the Code, section 5.4.2 and
that the number of independent members is sufficient in the
meaning of that section. The Audit Committee is chaired by
Erhard Schipporeit, who for many years was the chief financial
officer of a DAX company that is also listed on a U.S. stock
exchange and therefore qualifies as an independent financial
expert in the meaning of the German Stock Corporation Act,
section 100 (5).

Diversity in the Company

for Women Act). There are currently two women on the
shareholder representatives’ side of the Supervisory Board and
two women on the employee representatives’ side. The
mandatory quota applies to future appointments to the
Supervisory Board; the mandates of the current members of the
Supervisory Board remain unaffected until the end of their term.
The Executive Board currently has seven male members.
Pursuant to the above Act, the Supervisory Board adopted by
resolution at its meeting on March 19, 2015, a target of one for
the number of Executive Board seats to be held by women by
June 30, 2017.
The first and second management levels below the Executive
Board are the Global Executive Team (GET) and the Senior
Executive Team (SET), respectively. In accordance with the
requirements of the Act, the Executive Board resolved on
September 30, 2015, that the percentage of positions held by
women on the first two management levels below the Executive
Board should remain unchanged at 23% and 17%, respectively,
to June 30, 2017.
The Executive Board continues to follow the recommendation in
the Code that executive boards should generally have regard to
diversity when appointing people to leadership positions, and in
particular to employ appropriate numbers of women in such
positions. In support of this, we maintain a diversity policy for
company leadership appointments. SAP has set itself a target of
increasing the overall percentage of positions in leadership held
by women to 25% by 2017. It goes without saying that ability is
still the primary selection criterion for any position at SAP.
Globally, the percentage of leadership positions held by women
at the end of 2016 was 24.5%.

Code of Business Conduct
SAP’s corporate governance includes our Code of Business
Conduct for employees and members of the Executive Board.
The Code of Business Conduct expresses the high standards
that we require from our employees and Executive Board
members and sets out the main principles that guide our
business conduct toward customers, business partners, and
shareholders. We see our Code of Business Conduct as the
standard for our dealings involving customers, business
partners, vendors, shareholders, and competitors. By following
our Code of Business Conduct, we demonstrate a commitment
against all forms of unfair competitive practice, corruption, and
misrepresentation. Our global compliance organization
monitors worldwide compliance with the Code of Business
Conduct and other policies applying within the Group. It
regularly reviews these internal policies, revises them if
necessary, and delivers related employee training.

Starting 2016, a mandatory gender quota of 30% applies for
new appointments to the Supervisory Board of SAP SE pursuant
to the law on the equal participation of men and women in
leadership positions (German Equal Leadership Opportunities

Applying International Corporate
Governance Standards
SAP is a NYSE-listed company and we are therefore subject to
certain U.S. financial legislation (including the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002, among others) and to the applicable SEC and NYSE
regulations. Besides implementing the requirements of the U.S.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, section 404, and other Sarbanes-Oxley Act
requirements, including conducting an annual audit of our
internal control over financial reporting, we comply with those of
the corporate governance standards codified in the NYSE Listed
Company Manual, section 303A, which bind foreign private
issuers. The section 303A standards that apply to SAP include
the requirement to have an audit committee composed of
members who are independent in the meaning of the SarbanesOxley Act, and related reporting requirements. Erhard
Schipporeit, the chairperson of the Audit Committee, is an audit
committee financial expert in the meaning of the SarbanesOxley Act.

Annual General Meeting of
Shareholders
Our shareholders exercise their rights, such as the rights to put
questions to the management and to vote, at the Annual General
Meeting of Shareholders. Shareholders and the public are able
to watch a live broadcast of the entire Annual General Meeting of
Shareholders on the Internet. They can vote their shares at the
Meeting or instruct a proxy of their choice or one of the proxies
provided for that purpose by SAP. Alternatively, they can
participate online or vote by mail. The invitation to the Annual
General Meeting of Shareholders includes full details and
instructions. Every shareholder can access all of the paperwork
on the SAP Web site in good time for the meeting.

Transparency, Communication, and
Service for Shareholders
Our shareholders can obtain full and timely information about
SAP on our Web site and can access current and historical
Company data. Among other information, we post all of our
financial reports, all relevant news about the Company’s
governing bodies and their corporate governance documentation, information requiring ad hoc (current) disclosure,
press releases, and news of notifiable directors’ dealings.

the consolidated financial statements, and the combined
management report. The SAP SE financial statements, the
consolidated financial statements, and the combined
management report are audited by KPMG AG
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, the auditor elected for that
purpose by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.
In addition to our annual financial statements, we also prepare
quarterly statements for all four quarters in accordance with the
rules and regulations of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, as well a
half-year financial report on June 30 pursuant to the legal
requirements of the German Securities Trading Act. Our
quarterly statements and half-year financial report are
submitted to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board
before they are published.
In German stock corporation and commercial law, there are
special requirements for internal risk management that apply to
SAP. To meet them, our global risk management system
supports risk planning, identification, analysis, handling, and
minimization. We maintain standard documentation of all our
internal control structures, especially those that affect financial
reporting, and continually evaluate their effectiveness. As a
company listed on the NYSE, we instruct our auditor, KPMG, to
conduct an annual audit of our internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the requirements of the U.S.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, section 404. The audit as of
December 31, 2016, confirmed that our internal control is
effective. In compliance with the reporting requirements in the
German Commercial Code, sections 289 (5) and 315 (2)(5), the
combined SAP SE and SAP Group management report contains
full information about the principal features of the internal
controls and risk management structure applying to SAP’s
consolidated financial reporting.

Executive Board and Supervisory
Board Shareholdings
Section 6.2, sentence 2, of the Code recommends that all
directors’ shareholdings be reported in a corporate governance
report, broken down by executive board and supervisory board
memberships if the entire holdings exceed 1% of the shares
issued by the Company. In fulfillment of this recommendation,
see the Compensation Report in our combined management
report for 2016, which contains the recommended information.

Financial Accounting, Risk
Management, and Internal Control
We prepare the SAP SE financial statements in accordance with
the German Commercial Code and our consolidated financial
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs). We prepare a management report, as
required by the German Commercial Code, and the Form 20-F
annual report in accordance with SEC requirements. The
Executive Board is responsible for financial accounting. The
Supervisory Board approves the SAP SE financial statements,

To Our Stakeholders | Corporate Governance Report

Report by the
Supervisory Board
Dear Shareholders,
In 2016, we dealt extensively with the status and the
development of the Company and discharged the duties
imposed on us by the law and by the Company’s Articles of
Incorporation. We were consulted by the Executive Board
throughout the year and kept the global management of the
Company under continued observation and scrutiny for legal
compliance, adherence to proper accounting principles,
business focus, and efficiency. We agreed to the Company’s
strategy with the Executive Board and regularly discussed with
the Executive Board the Company’s progress toward executing
it. We were directly involved when the Executive Board made
any decision of fundamental importance to SAP.
We regularly received full and timely reports from the Executive
Board, both from members in person and in written documents.
They kept us up to date on the Company’s strategy, plans,
business performance, risks, risk management, compliance (in
other words, adherence to laws, to the Company's Articles of
Incorporation, and to internal policies), and on transactions of
special significance for SAP. The Executive Board advised us
when business deviated from plan or target, and why.
The content and scope of the Executive Board’s reports to us
fully met our requirements for them. In addition, the Executive
Board came to Supervisory Board meetings for discussion of the
agenda items and to answer our questions. To ensure optimal
performance of its duties, the Supervisory Board also deploys
the latest SAP technologies. At our meetings, for example, we
used the SAP Digital Boardroom, an innovative, analytical
software solution that allows analysts to generate impressive
graphics for all business area metrics in real time across
multiple interactive computer screens. Thanks to this solution,
we were always able to draw on current data and in-depth
analyses during our discussions. We questioned and probed the
Executive Board to satisfy ourselves that the information it gave
to us was plausible. All transactions requiring approval by the
Supervisory Board, whether by law, the Articles of Incorporation,
or the Supervisory Board’s list of transactions requiring consent
within the meaning of the German SE Implementation Act (SEAusführungsgesetz), section 19, were carefully examined and
discussed with the Executive Board, focusing on the benefits,
potential risks, and other effects of each transaction. The
Supervisory Board agreed to all transactions for which its
consent was sought by the Executive Board.

To Our Stakeholders | Report by the Supervisory Board

The CEO informed the Supervisory Board chairperson without
delay of all important events that were significant for assessing
SAP’s position and progress or for the management and
governance of the Company. Moreover, the chairperson of the
Supervisory Board met regularly with the CEO to discuss SAP’s
strategy, planning, the Company’s business performance, risks,
risk management, compliance, and other key topics and
decisions. In this way, the chairperson of the Supervisory Board
was also kept fully informed between meetings of the
Supervisory Board and its committees.

Supervisory Board Meetings and
Resolutions
In 2016, the Supervisory Board of SAP SE held four ordinary
meetings and one extraordinary meeting at which we
deliberated and resolved on all matters of relevance to the
Company. We also adopted two resolutions by correspondence
vote. No Supervisory Board member attended only half or less
of the meetings of the Supervisory Board and of the committees
to which the member belonged in the fiscal year. The average
attendance rate for the Supervisory Board and committee
meetings was 95%. The Supervisory Board and its committees
also convened wholly or partly without the Executive Board as
necessary to deliberate on items that pertained to the Executive
Board or required internal discussion among Supervisory Board
members alone. On this basis, the Executive Board withdrew
temporarily from three of the plenary sessions, in particular. The
Supervisory Board addressed the following key topics during the
year:

Simplification of Processes, and the
Company’s 2020 Strategy
The 2020 strategy, which has the goal to make SAP the world’s
leading cloud company in terms of market share, market
capitalization, and revenue, was discussed at length with the
Executive Board at meetings of the Technology and Strategy
Committee meetings and of the full Supervisory Board. At our
meetings in February and July, the Executive Board apprised us
of the various initiatives and projects for implementing this
strategy. In July, we also heard an Executive Board report on the
total cost of ownership (TCO) in the cloud area, and gave our
constructive feedback on the plans presented. Likewise in our
line of focus was the Run Simple initiative, SAP’s project for
simplifying our internal processes and reducing complexity. We
continuously monitored progress of this initiative throughout the

19

year. When we met in July, the Executive Board reported on
some of the results achieved thus far in SAP’s controlling,
internal reporting, and other financial processes. As part of its
simplification efforts, the Company also streamlined and
optimized the process by which the SAP SE financial
statements, the consolidated financial statements, and the
integrated report are prepared, thus enabling SAP to publish our
integrated report as early as February of the new year from now
on. To accommodate this new timeline, the Supervisory Board
adjusted its meeting schedule as of the new year and brought
forward discussion of balance sheet-related topics from the
March meeting to the February meeting.

HR Topics and Executive Board
Compensation
The Supervisory Board dealt with human resources (HR)
matters and Executive Board compensation notably in its first
two meetings of 2016. All HR and compensation topics were
extensively prepared by the General and Compensation
Committee and subsequently adopted by the full Supervisory
Board.
At our ordinary meeting in February, we resolved the
appointment of Stefan Ries and Steve Singh to the Executive
Board effective April 1, 2016. The Executive Board explained its
concept to dissolve the Global Managing Board and instead have
various managers in global key roles more directly involved in
crucial management tasks in the future. We acknowledged and
endorsed this decision.
We also discussed Executive Board compensation for 2015 at
the February meeting. Exercising our discretionary powers
under the terms of the short-term incentive (STI) plan 2015, we
determined performance against the defined targets. As well, we
determined target achievement within the so-called
performance period for the 2015 tranche of the RSU Milestone
Plan 2015. Introduced in 2012, the RSU Milestone Plan 2015 is a
long-term variable compensation element for SAP SE Executive
Board members in which the members were granted a number
of virtual shares (called restricted share units, or RSUs) for a
given year (or “tranche”); the quantity of RSUs ultimately
allocable for a plan tranche depends on SAP's operating profit
performance in the year it is allocated. When we met in
February, we also deliberated on Executive Board compensation
for 2016. We identified the key performance indicators (KPIs)
and set the target numbers for each KPI in the STI 2016 plan and
their relative weightings. In addition, we decided that, as of 2016,
there should be greater differentiation in Executive Board
members' compensation based on the function and role of the
individual Executive Board member. We therefore requested
Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, the
Company’s external compensation consultants, to carry out a
benchmark analysis of the Executive Board appointment
contracts based on a peer group of companies predefined by us.
After comprehensive evaluation of this analysis, the General and

20

Compensation Committee proposed a number of measures for
consideration by the full Supervisory Board. The Supervisory
Board, in turn, resolved at its March meeting to increase certain
Executive Board members’ long-term incentive (LTI) plan based
on their roles, and to generally pay fixed compensation and STI
compensation elements in the currency of the Executive Board
member's home country. It subsequently approved the
individual Executive Board compensation packages. The
Supervisory Board, as required, evaluated the appropriateness
of the Executive Board members' compensation, and in each
case found it to be appropriate in terms of amount, structure,
objective criteria, and for each member's responsibilities and
tasks. Ahead of the meeting, we had received a certificate from
Ernst & Young on the compensation's appropriateness. For
more information about the LTI Plan 2016 and other elements of
the compensation package for Executive Board members, see
the Compensation Report.
In our opinion, the complex transition to the cloud initiated by
the Executive Board can only be successfully implemented with
the long-term commitment of the Executive Board members to
the Company. This is why we also agreed in our March meeting
to prematurely reappoint Bill McDermott, Robert Enslin, Bernd
Leukert, and Luka Mucic as members of the Executive Board for
a term of five years. In August and November, the General and
Compensation Committee prepared an amendment to the
Executive Board appointment contracts with regards to the
leaver provisions (that is, the provisions for when an Executive
Board member steps down) under the LTI plan, which we
adopted in an extraordinary telephone conference in December.
We referred in both meetings to the aforementioned
appropriateness certificate from Ernst & Young.
Other matters addressed at our meetings in 2016 included:

Meeting in February
At our February 18 meeting, the Executive Board gave us an
overview of business in 2015 and presented information on
SAP's revenue growth in the individual business areas, regions,
and product fields. It also explained SAP's current market
position. We discussed in detail the annual budget for 2016 as
presented to us by the Executive Board, and approved same. In
addition, we reviewed the results of the employee survey.

Meeting in March (Meeting to Discuss the
Financial Statements)
At its ordinary meeting on March 24, the Supervisory Board
turned its attention to SAP SE financial statements and the
consolidated financial statements for 2015, the audits
conducted by KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft
(KPMG), and the Executive Board’s proposed resolution on the
appropriation of retained earnings for 2015. The Audit
Committee comprehensively prepared all topics for which it is
responsible in connection with the financial statements and the

To Our Stakeholders | Report by the Supervisory Board

consolidated financial statements for 2015, and reported
particularly on the form and scope of its examination of the
documents relating to the financial statements, which it
recommended we approve. The auditor attended the meeting
and reported in detail on the audit and its findings for each of the
focus areas that had been agreed between the auditor and the
Audit Committee. The auditor also related the discussions on
those matters at the preceding meetings of the Audit
Committee. The auditor then discussed the results of the audit
with the Supervisory Board and answered our questions. The
Supervisory Board approved the audit. There were no findings
from our own examination, so we gave our consent to the SAP
SE and consolidated financial statements for 2015. We checked
and endorsed the Executive Board’s proposal to appropriate
retained earnings in accordance with the Audit Committee’s
recommendation. There were also a number of corporate
governance matters on the meeting agenda. We decided on the
resolutions we would propose for the agenda of the Annual
General Meeting of Shareholders in May 2016. Our
recommendation to the Annual General Meeting of
Shareholders concerning the auditor to elect for 2016 followed
the recommendation of the Audit Committee to us.
We regularly reviewed and updated the list of transactions for
which the Executive Board must obtain the Supervisory Board’s
consent in accordance with the German SE Implementation Act,
section 19. The Executive Board presented detailed information
about the investment activities of SAP’s venture capital funds.
The Supervisory Board approved the financing of two further
venture capital funds with a total volume of US$1 billion, for
investment in the respective funds by 2022 and 2023
respectively.

Meeting in July
At our ordinary meeting on July 14, we discussed the
aforementioned strategy topics as well as the directors’ and
officers’ (D&O) group liability insurance policies that we take out
from year to year. We also agreed that deliberations on the
budget process be made the subject of joint meetings between
the Financial and Investment Committee and the Audit
Committee from now on.
The Executive Board then gave us an account of business in the
second quarter of 2016 and performance in the first half-year,
reporting at our request particularly on revenue development in
the various regions, on SAP’s competitive position in its core
business and in the cloud, and on the progress in healthcare
solutions. We also received updates on the business activities in
the SAP Business Network operating segment and in the
Internet of Things space.

Meeting in October
Our October 28 meeting was held at the SAP Innovation Center
in Potsdam, SAP’s development center for new software
technologies that opened in 2014. This gave the Supervisory

To Our Stakeholders | Report by the Supervisory Board

Board members the opportunity to tour the facility, learn about
the latest development projects, and gain insight into how SAP
collaborates with its customers, other research institutes, and
universities. At the meeting, the Executive Board reported on
business and updated us on SAP's current HR strategy. In
agreement with the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board also
adopted, for regular publication in October 2016, the annual
declaration of implementation of the German Corporate
Governance Code (the “Code”) pursuant to the German Stock
Corporation Act, section 161. The Supervisory Board determined
that it has a sufficient number of independent members. We
were then given a comprehensive overview of SAP’s product
strategy in the small business and midmarket segments. Finally,
the Executive Board informed us about the organizational setup
and work performed by SAP’s internal data protection
department, explained how SAP is preparing for the new EU
General Data Projection Regulation, and reported on other legal
developments relevant for SAP in the area of data protection.

The Work of the Supervisory Board

The committees made a key contribution to the work of the
Supervisory Board and reported on their work to us, including
their preparatory work on the relevant agenda items of the full
Supervisory Board. The following committees were in place in
2016:

and their duties, see SAP's corporate governance statement
pursuant to the German Commercial Code, section 289a,
published on the SAP public Web site at www.sap.de/investor.
In 2016, the committees focused on the following topics:
– The General and Compensation Committee held six
meetings at which members attended in person (“physical
meetings”) and one meeting by telephone conference. During
its meetings, it prepared and recommended the Supervisory
Board's resolutions, notably those on Executive Board
compensation and HR decisions described above. It also
focused on the following matters: At the beginning of the
year, it deliberated on the annual report it receives from the
Company’s capital market compliance officer, including an
overview of the changes to the rules on insider trading and
directors' dealings notifications under the new EU Market
Abuse Regulation, which came into force on July 3, 2016. At
the meeting in March, the Committee received a report from
the corporate governance officer and adopted an update to
its rules of procedure. In June, the Committee approved the
conclusion of a consulting contract between the Company
and the retiring Executive Board member Gerhard Oswald. In
October, it prepared the Supervisory Board’s resolutions with
respect to the submission of the declaration of
implementation of the Code and ascertaining the
independence of Supervisory Board members. It also
discussed succession planning for the Executive Board. In the
fiscal year ended, the Committee also approved the
acceptance of outside supervisory board seats by three
Executive Board members.
– The Audit Committee held five physical meetings and four
meetings by telephone conference. The telephone
conference meetings were all ahead of the publication of
quarterly financial reports for each quarter. At these
meetings, the Committee primarily deliberated on the course
of business over the quarter concerned, the process by which
the quarterly financial reports were prepared, the quarterly
reports to be published, and insights gained from the
auditor’s quarterly review of selected revenue-generating
software agreements. The physical meetings in February and
March concentrated on the SAP SE and consolidated
financial reports for 2015 and the reporting process, the
internal control structure for financial reporting, the most
important accounting methods, and the audit. At the
February meeting, the Committee also discussed the German
Financial Reporting Enforcement Panel's criteria and the
internal audit service's report for the previous year,
organization and processes, and audit plan for 2016. At its
meeting in March, the Committee did preparatory work on
the Supervisory Board's recommendations to the Annual
General Meeting of Shareholders concerning the election of
an auditor and the appropriation of retained earnings and
discussed the Company's compliance system. When it met in
July, the Committee discussed the audit focus and fees with

22

the auditor, dealt with the internal audit service's work in the
first half of the year and audit planning for the second halfyear, and reviewed the Company's internal controls. At its
October meeting, the Committee discussed the report from
the chief compliance officer and other compliance system
matters and came to the conclusion that the compliance
system was effective. As reported in more detail below, the
Committee also held a joint meeting with the Finance and
Investment Committee on the same day, to prepare the
Supervisory Board’s February 2017 resolution concerning the
Group annual plan.
The auditor attended all physical meetings and telephone
conference meetings of the Audit Committee and reported in
depth on its audit work and on its quarterly reviews of
selected software agreements.
– The Finance and Investment Committee held five physical
meetings in 2016, of which one was a joint meeting with the
Technology and Strategy Committee and one a joint meeting
with the Audit Committee. At its February 17 meeting,
representatives from Sapphire Ventures presented detailed
information about the investment activities of the three SAP
venture capital funds. The Committee recommended that the
Supervisory Board approve the financing of two further
venture capital funds totaling US$1 billion. It also discussed
the annual report on SAP's acquisitions. When it met on July
13, the Committee focused solely on a comprehensive
evaluation of SAP by external analysts. It also held a joint
meeting with the Technology and Strategy Committee on the
same day. Matters discussed included a multiyear overview
of the development of SAP’s major acquisitions, SAP's
strategic alignment and competitive environment, and the
results of an analysis of SAP’s product portfolio. The
Committee also approved by correspondence the Executive
Board's planned financing transactions. At its October
meeting, the Committee examined the organizational
structure, business environment, and equity investments of
an SAP subsidiary that provides professional services to
national security authorities, and were given an update on
other equity investments and acquisition-related activities
carried out by SAP in 2016. The focus of the joint meeting
with the Audit Committee on October 25 was the
presentation of and discussion on the preliminary Group
annual plan for 2017, in preparation for the Supervisory
Board meeting in February 2017, at which the full Supervisory
Board resolved to approve the 2017 Group annual plan.
– The Technology and Strategy Committee held four
meetings in 2016, one of which was a joint meeting with the
Finance and Investment Committee. It discussed the key
technology trends in the software industry in the years to
come and SAP’s corporate and product strategies. At the
Committee’s February 17 meeting, the Executive Board
presented an overview of market development in 2015 and
explained what it would mean for SAP's business in 2016. Key
topics included the strategic road map, development
priorities, and market launch of our human capital
management (HCM) software. The Committee also learned

To Our Stakeholders | Report by the Supervisory Board

more about the SAP Startup Focus program, SAP’s initiative
to support startups. The focus topics of the March 23
meeting were TCO of SAP S/4HANA, SAP’s strategy for
analytics, and a status report on the Sybase acquisition.
When the Committee met on October 27, it deliberated on the
measures to position SAP Ariba products and learned more
about the road map and platform architecture for machine
learning.
– The People and Organization Committee held two meetings
in 2016. In September, it engaged in detailed discussions
about the measures to recruit top talents, and asked
management for an update on the current status of training
and personal and professional development at SAP, so that it
could see whether the Committee’s suggestions from the
year before had been implemented. To this end, the
Committee reviewed the technical learning offerings available
through SAP Development University, SAP's internal
academy for the professional training of our software
developers. The second meeting was held on December 6.
The Committee was presented with the results of the SAP
Strategy Survey, an employee survey conducted in the
summer of 2016 regarding the implementation and
employees’ understanding of the strategy. The Committee
was also given an update on SAP's collaboration with
academia to promote young talents in a digitalized working
world. Further topics at this meeting included the new
employee stock plan and the expert career path at SAP.
– The Nomination Committee is composed exclusively of
shareholder representatives. It met once, in March 2016, to
prepare the Supervisory Board's recommendation to the
Annual General Meeting of Shareholders that Gesche Joost
be elected shareholder representative on the Supervisory
Board. It also reviewed its process for seeking suitable
candidates for the Supervisory Board.
Regular reports from the committees ensured that we were kept
fully informed of all matters covered by the committees and
were able to discuss them thoroughly.

Corporate Governance
SAP’s corporate governance officer monitored our compliance
with those recommendations in the Code with which we claim to
comply in SAP SE's declaration, and reported in full to the
General and Compensation Committee. For more information
about compliance with the Code, see the Corporate Governance
Report from the Executive Board and Supervisory Board.
Members of the Executive Board and of the Supervisory Board
had no conflicts of interest that sections 4.3.4 and 5.5.2 of the
Code require to be disclosed to the Supervisory Board. Some
Supervisory Board members currently have business dealings
with SAP or hold senior positions or material equity in
companies that currently have business dealings with SAP, or
had done so in the course of the year. SAP’s business dealings
with these persons or companies are or were at arm’s length. In
our view, especially given the limited scope and materiality of

To Our Stakeholders | Report by the Supervisory Board

those dealings, they did not affect the independence of the
Supervisory Board members concerned and do not give rise to
any substantial and not merely temporary conflict of interest in
the meaning of the Code. There were a number of transactions
involving members of the Executive Board in 2015 which were all
consistent with industry standards and immaterial. These
transactions were approved by the General and Compensation
Committee during the year under review. The General and
Compensation Committee also approved a consulting contract
for Gerhard Oswald for after his retirement from the Company.
The Company made no other contracts with members of the
Executive Board or Supervisory Board that would have required
a resolution of the Supervisory Board.
The Supervisory Board closely examined the Executive Board’s
corporate governance statement pursuant to the German
Commercial Code, section 289a. We approved the statement
with the combined SAP Group and SAP SE management report.

SAP SE and Consolidated Financial
Reports for 2016
KPMG audited the SAP SE and consolidated financial reports for
2016. The Annual General Meeting of Shareholders elected
KPMG as the SAP SE and SAP Group auditor on Thursday, May
12, 2016. The Supervisory Board proposed the appointment of
KPMG on the recommendation of the Audit Committee. Before
proposing KPMG to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders
as auditor for the year, the chairperson of the Supervisory Board
and the Audit Committee obtained confirmation from KPMG
that circumstances did not exist that might prejudice or raise
any doubt concerning its independence as the Company’s
auditor. In that connection, KPMG informed us of the volume of
the services that were not part of the audit which it had either
provided to the Group in the past year or was engaged to
provide in the year to come. The Supervisory Board has agreed
with KPMG that the auditor should report to the Supervisory
Board and record in the auditor’s report any fact found during
the audit that is inconsistent with the declaration given by the
Executive Board and the Supervisory Board concerning
implementation of the German Corporate Governance Code.
KPMG examined the SAP SE financial statements prepared in
accordance with the German Commercial Code, the
consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as required
by the German Commercial Code, section 315a, and the
combined SAP Group and SAP SE management report, and
certified them without qualification. The auditor thus confirmed
that, in its opinion and based on its audit in accordance with the
applicable accounting principles, the SAP SE and consolidated
financial statements give a true and fair view of the net assets,
financial position, and results of operations of SAP SE and the
SAP Group. The auditor also confirmed that the combined SAP
SE and SAP Group management report is consistent with the
corresponding financial statements and as a whole gives a
suitable view of the position of SAP SE and the SAP Group and

23

of foreseeable opportunities and risks. KPMG had completed its
audit of SAP’s internal control over financial reporting and
certified without qualification that it complies with the applicable
U.S. standards. The auditor stated in its opinion that it considers
SAP's internal controls over financial reporting to be effective in
all material respects. All Audit Committee and Supervisory
Board members received the documents concerning the
financial statements mentioned above, the audit reports
prepared by KPMG, and the Executive Board’s proposal
concerning the appropriation of retained earnings in good time.
On February 20, 2017, the Executive Board prepared the
financial accounts of SAP SE and the Group for 2016,
comprising the SAP SE financial statements, the consolidated
financial statements, and the combined management report,
and submitted them without delay to the Supervisory Board.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee on February 21, 2017,
and at the meeting of the Supervisory Board on February 22,
2017, the Executive Board explained the financial statements of
SAP SE and the SAP Group and its proposal concerning the
appropriation of retained earnings. Members of the Executive
Board answered questions from the Audit Committee and the
Supervisory Board. At the Audit Committee meeting, they also
explained the Annual Report on Form 20-F.
After the Executive Board had explained them, the Audit
Committee and the Supervisory Board reviewed the financial
statement documents in the light of KPMG’s audit reports. The
representatives of the auditor who attended presented full
reports on the audit and the results of the audit to the Audit
Committee and Supervisory Board meetings and explained the
audit report. The auditor also reported that it had not identified
any material weaknesses in our internal control and riskmanagement systems for financial reporting. Both the Audit
Committee and the Supervisory Board asked detailed questions
about the form, scope, and results of the audit. The Audit
Committee reported to the Supervisory Board on its own review
of the financial statements of SAP SE and the SAP Group, its
discussions with the Executive Board and with the auditor, and
its supervision of the financial reporting process. It confirmed
that as part of its supervisory work, it had addressed the
effectiveness of the SAP Group internal control, risk
management, and internal auditing systems, and found the
systems to be effective.
The Committee also reported that KPMG had told it that no
circumstances had arisen that might give cause for concern
about KPMG’s impartiality, and informed us about the services
KPMG had provided that were not part of the audit. The
Committee reported that it had examined the auditor's
independence, taking the non-audit services it had rendered into
consideration, and stated that in the Committee’s opinion the
auditor possessed the required degree of independence.

24

The Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board satisfied
themselves that KPMG had conducted the audit properly. In
particular, they concluded that both the audit reports and the
audit itself fulfilled the legal requirements. On the basis of the
report and the Audit Committee’s recommendation, the
Supervisory Board approved the audit and, since there were no
findings from our own examination, we gave our consent to the
SAP SE financial statements, the consolidated financial
statements, and the combined management report (including
the Executive Board’s corporate governance statement
pursuant to the German Commercial Code, section 289a). The
financial statements and combined management report were
thus formally adopted. The Supervisory Board’s opinion of the
Company and the Group coincided with that of the Executive
Board as set out in the combined management report. The
Supervisory Board considered the proposal presented by the
Executive Board concerning the appropriation of retained
earnings. We had regard to the requirements of dividends policy,
the effects on the liquidity of the Group, and the interests of the
shareholders. We also discussed these matters with the auditor.
We then endorsed the Executive Board’s proposal concerning
the appropriation of retained earnings, in accordance with the
Audit Committee's recommendation. Finally, we approved this
present report.

Changes on the Supervisory and
Executive Boards
Stefan Ries and Steve Singh were appointed members of the
Executive Board with effect from April 1, 2016.
After 36 years at SAP – 21 of which as member of the Executive
Board – Gerhard Oswald retired from the Company and the
Executive Board on December 31, 2016. He remains associated
with SAP as a consultant so that SAP is still able to benefit from
his experience and expertise. We thank Gerhard Oswald for his
many years of valuable and constructive service to SAP.
Gesche Joost, who was initially appointed by the court as interim
member of the Supervisory Board at the end of May 2015, was
elected to the Supervisory Board as shareholder representative
on May 12, 2016, by the Annual General Meeting of
Shareholders.
The Supervisory Board thanks the Executive Board, the
managing directors of the Group companies, and all of our
employees for their hard work and dedication in 2016. We would
also like to thank our customers and partners. Without them,
our Company's success would not be possible.

Compensation Report
Compensation for Executive and
Supervisory Board Members
This compensation report outlines the criteria that we applied
for the year 2016 to determine compensation for Executive
Board and Supervisory Board members, discloses the amount
of compensation paid, and describes the compensation
systems. It also contains information about share-based
payment plans for Executive Board members and shares held by
Executive Board and Supervisory Board members.

Compensation for Executive Board
Members
Compensation System for 2016
The 2016 compensation for Executive Board members is
intended to reflect SAP’s company size and global presence as
well as our economic and financial standing. The compensation
level is internationally competitive to reward committed,
successful work in a dynamic business environment.
The compensation package for each Executive Board member is
determined based on their individual role and performance. The
package has three elements:
– A fixed annual salary element
– A variable short-term incentive (STI) element to reward
performance in the plan year
– A variable long-term incentive (LTI) element tied to the price
of SAP shares to reward performance over multiple years
The fixed annual salary and STI elements are paid in the
currency of the Executive Board member’s home country,
whereas compensation for the LTI element is paid in euros.
The Supervisory Board sets a compensation target for the sum
of the fixed and the two variable elements. It reviews, and if
appropriate, revises this compensation target every year. The
review takes into account SAP’s business performance and the
compensation paid to board members at comparable
companies on the international stage. The following charts
visualize the relation of the fixed and the variable compensation
targets for the Executive Board members for 2016:

The amount of variable compensation depends on SAP’s
performance against performance targets that the Supervisory
Board sets for each plan year. The performance targets are key
performance indicator (KPI) values aligned to the SAP budget
for the plan year.
The following criteria apply to the elements of Executive Board
compensation for 2016:
– The fixed annual salary element is paid as a monthly salary.
– The variable STI element was determined under the STI 2016
plan. Under this plan, the STI compensation depends on the
performance of the SAP Group against the predefined target
values for three KPIs: non-IFRS constant currency cloud and
software revenue growth; non-IFRS constant currency
operating margin increase; and constant currency new cloud
bookings. In addition, the STI 2016 plan provides for a
discretionary element that allows the Supervisory Board,
after the end of the fiscal year 2016, to address not only an
Executive Board member’s individual performance, but also
SAP’s performance in terms of market position, innovative
power, customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction (taking
innovative HR strategy, HR excellence, leadership
development and social partnership into consideration), and
attractiveness as an employer. A threshold of 75% for the
total target achievement level applies for the financial KPIs: if
the sum of the weighted individual target achievements for
the financial KPIs is below 75% (threshold), there is no
payout for the pro rata target bonus. A cap of 175% applies
for each financial KPI, and a cap of 200% applies for the
discretionary KPI. Moreover, if there has been any
extraordinary and unforeseeable event, the Supervisory
Board can, at its reasonable discretion, retroactively adjust
payouts up or down in the interest of SAP.

25

– On February 22, 2017, the Supervisory Board assessed SAP’s
performance against the agreed targets and determined the
amount of compensation payable under the STI 2016 plan.
The STI 2016 plan will be paid out after the Annual General
Meeting of Shareholders in May 2017.
– The variable LTI element was determined under the
LTI 2016 plan effective January 1, 2016, however, the grant
date of the tranche 2016 is March 24, 2016. The purpose of
the LTI 2016 plan is to reflect the operating profit target
achievement, to ensure long-term retention of our Executive
Board members, and to reward a share price outperformance
by SAP as compared to a group of its peers (Peer Group).

The LTI 2016 plan is an annual revolving remuneration
element that is linked to the price of the SAP share. A grant
amount determined by the Supervisory Board is converted
into virtual shares, referred to as Share Units, by dividing the
grant amount by the price of the SAP share (calculated on
the basis of a defined average value). The grant amount is
determined by the Supervisory Board in its discretion for
each financial year at a level of between 80% and 120% of
the contractual target amount; taking into account the
achievement of the operating profit targets set for the
preceding financial year.
The Share Units granted comprise 60% Performance Share
Units (PSUs) and 40% Retention Share Units (RSUs). Both

26

types of Share Units have a vesting period of (approximately)
four years. Each Share Unit that finally vests entitles its
holder to a (gross) payout corresponding to the price of one
SAP share after the end of the holding period, but capped at
three times the SAP share price applied for the conversion of
the grant amount into Share Units. The number of PSUs that
finally vests depends on the performance of the SAP share. If
the increase of price of the SAP share over the vesting period
of the PSUs exceeds the increase of a defined Peer Group
Index over the same period, the number of PSUs is increased
by a percentage equal to the outperformance expressed as
percentage points. This percentage will be doubled if, in
addition to the outperformance over the Peer Group Index,
the price of the SAP share at the end of the vesting period of
the PSUs is higher than the price at the start of this period.
The number of vested PSUs a member can attain in respect
to a plan year is capped at 150% of their initial PSU allocation
for that year. Conversely, if the increase of price of the SAP
share over the vesting period of the PSUs is below the
increase in the Peer Group Index, the number of PSUs is
reduced by a percentage equal to the difference expressed as
percentage points. All PSUs lapse if the difference exceeds
50%. If the service contract for the Executive Board member
is terminated before the end of the third year following the
year in which the Share Units were granted, both the RSUs
and PSUs are forfeited in whole or in part, depending on the
circumstances of the relevant resignation from office or
termination of the service contract, as follows:

 If the Executive Board member has resigned from office
without cause and starts working for a competitor of SAP,
whether on a free-lance basis or as an employee or
otherwise prior to the end of the initial vesting period of
the Share Units or the Supervisory Board terminates the
Executive Board member's service contract for cause, all
Share Units are forfeited.
 A portion of the RSUs and PSUs are forfeited, if the
Executive Board member has resigned from office without
cause, but does not start working for a competitor of SAP
prior to the end of the initial vesting period of the Share
Units, or the Service Contract of the Executive Board
member expires by mutual consent, is terminated by
mutual consent, is terminated by the Executive Board
member for cause or the Executive Board member retires.
Expiration by mutual consent or termination by mutual
consent occurs if the Executive Board member is not reappointed or does not accept the reappointment or an
extraordinary expiration is provided by the Service
Contract of the Executive Board member, that is, in the
case of a permanent inability to work. The portion of the
RSUs and PSUs which forfeit equal the proportion of plan
participation to the vesting period (for example, if the
Executive Board member leaves with effect from
December 31, 2016, three quarters of the Share Units
granted in 2016 would be forfeited). The remaining Share
Units will continue to be in effect. In addition, the number

To Our Stakeholders | Compensation Report

of remaining PSUs is adjusted subject to the performance
of SAP’s share price in relation to the Peer Group Index.
The same applies if the Executive Board member dies,
however the Share Units are paid out pro rata temporis
within 90 days after death on the basis of the then current
SAP share price.
 In the event of a change of control as defined in the service
contract of the Executive Board member, the following
generally applies:
The Share Units are paid out without undue delay within
90 days on a pro rata temporis basis, plus 50% of the
Share Units (which otherwise, under mere pro rata
aspects, would be forfeited), on the basis of the then
current SAP share price. In addition, the number –
reduced on a pro rata temporis basis – of PSUs paid out
may change with the relevant outperformance of the SAP
share compared to the Peer Group Index as determined on
the day the change of control event is effective. The
remaining Share Units are forfeited.
 To compensate for disadvantages resulting from leaver
rules under the LTI 2016 plan in comparison to the
previous RSU Milestone Plan, all current Executive Board
members will receive an individual equalization amount as
an amendment to the leaver rules of the LTI 2016 plan.
The equalization amount is the sum of partial amounts
applicable for the years 2016 and 2017 and, in one case,
also for the year 2018. The respective annual partial
amount is subject to a target achievement of at least 60%
of the operating profit target and an ongoing employment
relationship of the respective year. In the event of
termination, PSUs equal to this amount based on the thenapplicable reference share price will be granted. PSUs

To Our Stakeholders | Compensation Report

which would otherwise be forfeited in the event of
termination of the service contract for the Executive Board
member will not be forfeited to the extent of this
calculated amount. If the PSUs which would be forfeited in
the termination year is lower than the equalization
amount, PSUs from the preceding financial year and, if
required, from earlier years which would otherwise be
forfeited, will become non-forfeitable.

Amount of Compensation for 2016
We present the Executive Board compensation disclosures in
accordance with the recommendations of the German
Corporate Governance Code (“GCGC”). Furthermore, the table
below provides a reconciliation statement following the
requirements of sections 314 and 315 of the German
Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, or “HGB”) as specified
in the German Accounting Standards (“GAS 17”).
Pursuant to the recommendations of the GCGC, the value of
benefits granted for the year under review as well as the
allocation, that is, the amounts disbursed for the year under
review, are disclosed below based on the reference tables
recommended in the GCGC.
In contrast to the disclosure rules stipulated in the German HGB
and GAS 17, the GCGC includes the service cost according to
IAS 19 in the Executive Board compensation and requires the
additional disclosure of the target value for the one-year variable
compensation and the maximum and minimum compensation
amounts achievable for the variable compensation elements.

To Our Stakeholders | Compensation Report

End-of-Service Benefits
Regular End-of-Service Undertakings
Retirement Pension Plan
The following retirement pension agreements apply to the
individual members of the Executive Board:
– Michael Kleinemeier, Bernd Leukert, Luka Mucic, Gerhard
Oswald, and Stefan Ries receive a retirement pension when
they reach the retirement age of 60 (62 for Board members
appointed after January 1, 2012) and retire from their
Executive Board seat; or a disability pension depending on
health examination if, before reaching the regular retirement
age, they become subject to occupational disability or
permanent incapacity. A surviving dependent’s pension is
paid on the death of a former member of the Executive
Board. The disability pension is 100% of the vested
retirement pension entitlement and is payable until the
beneficiary’s 60th birthday, after which it is replaced by a
retirement pension. The surviving dependent’s pension is
60% of the retirement pension or vested disability pension
entitlement at death. Entitlements are enforceable against
SAP SE. Current pension payments are reviewed annually for
adjustments and, if applicable, increased according to the
surplus in the pension liability insurance. If service is ended
before the retirement age of 60 (62 for Board members
appointed after January 1, 2012), pension entitlement is
reduced in proportion as the actual length of service stands in
relation to the maximum possible length of service. The
applied retirement pension plan is contributory. The
contribution is 4% of applicable compensation up to the
applicable income threshold plus 14% of applicable
compensation above the applicable income threshold. For
this purpose, applicable compensation is 180% of annual

To Our Stakeholders | Compensation Report

base salary. The applicable income threshold is the statutory
annual income threshold for the state pension plan in
Germany (West), as amended from time to time.
Originally, Gerhard Oswald was under a performance-based
retirement plan. This plan was discontinued when SAP
introduced a contributory retirement pension plan in 2000.
His pension benefits are derived from any accrued
entitlements on December 31, 1999, under performancebased pension agreements and a salary-linked contribution
for the period commencing January 1, 2000. Gerhard
Oswald’s rights to retirement pension benefits increased by
further annual contributions because he remained a member
of the Executive Board after his 60th birthday until his
retirement on December 31, 2016.
– Bill McDermott has rights to future benefits under the portion
of the pension plan for SAP America classified as “NonQualified Retirement Plan” according to the U.S. Employee
Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The “NonQualified” pension plan of SAP America is a cash balance plan
that provides either monthly pension payments or a lump
sum on retirement. The pension becomes available from the
beneficiary’s 65th birthday. Subject to certain conditions, the
plan also provides earlier payment or invalidity benefits. The
“Non-Qualified” pension plan closed with effect from
January 1, 2009. Interest continues to be paid on the earned
rights to benefits within this plan.
– SAP made contributions to a third-party pension plan for Bill
McDermott (2016: €571,300; 2015: €682,400) and Robert
Enslin (2016: €34,700; 2015: €308,000). SAP’s
contributions are based on payments by Bill McDermott and
Robert Enslin into this pension plan.
– Steve Singh has no entitlements under the pension plan for
Executive Board members. SAP made no retirement pension
plan contributions to a third-party pension plan with respect
to Steve Singh in 2016.

The values shown here only reflect the pension entitlements that Michael Kleinemeier, Bernd Leukert, Luka Mucic, and Stefan Ries will receive from the
retirement pension plan for Executive Board members.

The table below shows the annual pension entitlement earned
during Executive Board membership of each member of the
Executive Board on reaching the scheduled retirement age (60
for Executive Board members initially appointed before 2012
and 62 for Executive Board members initially appointed after
January 1, 2012) based on entitlements from SAP under
performance-based and salary-linked plans vested on
December 31, 2016.

The rights shown here for Bill McDermott refer solely to rights under the
pension plan for SAP America.
2)

Due to the extension of Gerhard Oswald's contract beyond June 30, 2014,
these values represent the retirement pension entitlement that he receives
after his current Executive Board contract expired on December 31, 2016,
based on the entitlements vested on December 31, 2016 (December 31,
2015).

34

These are vested entitlements. To the extent that members
continue to serve on the Executive Board and that therefore
more contributions are made for them in the future, pensions
actually payable at the scheduled retirement age will be higher
than the amounts shown in the table.

Postcontractual Non-Compete Provisions
During the agreed 12-month postcontractual non-compete
period, each Executive Board member receives abstention
payments corresponding to 50% of the final average
contractual compensation as agreed in the respective contract
on an individual basis. Any other occupational income generated
by the Executive Board member is deducted from their
compensation in accordance with section 74c of the German
Commercial Code.
The following table presents the net present values of the
postcontractual non-compete abstention payments. The net
present values in the table reflect the discounted present value
of the amounts that would be paid in the fictitious scenario in
which the Executive Board members leave SAP at the end of
their respective current contract terms and their final average
contractual compensation prior to their departure equals the
compensation in 2016. Actual postcontractual non-compete
payments will likely differ from these amounts depending on the
time of departure and the compensation levels and target
achievements at the time of departure.

Early End-of-Service Undertakings
Severance Payments
The standard contract for all Executive Board members
provides that on termination before full term (for example,
where the member’s appointment is revoked, where the
member becomes occupationally disabled, or in connection with
a change of control), SAP SE will pay to the member the
outstanding part of the compensation target for the entire
remainder of the term, appropriately discounted for early
payment. A member has no claim to that payment if they have
not served SAP as a member of the Executive Board for at least
one year or if they leave SAP SE for reasons for which they are
responsible. Upon the appointment of Stefan Ries and Steve
Singh to the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board abstained
from the waiting period of one year.
If an Executive Board member’s appointment to the Executive
Board expires or ceases to exist because of, or as a
consequence of, change or restructuring, or due to a change of
control, SAP SE and each Executive Board member has the right
to terminate the employment contract within eight weeks of the
occurrence by giving six months’ notice. A change of control is
deemed to occur when a third party is required to make a
mandatory takeover offer to the shareholders of SAP SE under
the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act, when SAP
SE merges with another company and becomes the subsumed
entity, or when a control or profit transfer agreement is
concluded with SAP SE as the dependent company. An
Executive Board member’s contract can also be terminated
before full term if their appointment as an Executive Board

Oswald received compensation for unused leave totaling
€151,061.12.

Oswald. Based on this contract, he will be available to the
Executive Board and to the Chairman of the Supervisory
Board as a strategic advisor especially for customer-specific
topics and events for SAP customers until the end of
December 2018.

Payments to Former Executive Board
Members
In 2016, we paid pension benefits of €1,667,000 to Executive
Board members who had retired before January 1, 2016 (2015:
€1,580,000). At the end of the year, the DBO for former
Executive Board members was €33.935.000 (2015:

meet these obligations (2015: €26,716,000).

Executive Board Members’ Holdings of
Long-Term Incentives

Supervisory Board: Other
Information
We did not grant any compensation advance or credit to, or
enter into any commitment for the benefit of, any member of
our Supervisory Board in 2016 or the previous year.
Hasso Plattner, the chairperson of the Supervisory Board,
entered into a consulting contract with SAP after joining the
Supervisory Board in May 2003. The contract does not provide
for any compensation. The only cost we incurred under the
contract was the reimbursement of expenses.
As far as the law permits, we indemnify Supervisory Board
members against, and hold them harmless from, claims brought
by third parties. To this end, we maintain directors’ and officers’
(D&O) group liability insurance. The current D&O policy does
not include an individual deductible for Supervisory Board
members as envisaged in the German Corporate Governance

audit of the consolidated financial statements has not led to any
reservations with respect to the propriety of the consolidated
financial statements.

Basis for Opinion on the Consolidated
Financial Statements
We conducted our audit in accordance with Section 317 HGB
and German generally accepted standards for the audit of
financial statements promulgated by the German Institute of
Public Auditors [IDW] as well as in supplementary compliance
with International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and guidelines of

To Our Stakeholders | Independent Auditor’s Report

the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Our responsibilities under those standards and
additional guidelines are further described in the “Auditor’s
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial
Statements” section of our report. We are independent of the
Group in accordance with the requirements of German
commercial law and the rules of professional conduct, and we
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities applicable in
Germany in accordance with these requirements. We believe
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the
consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year from
January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. These matters were
addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion
thereon, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these
matters.

Recognition of software licenses revenue
Refer to Note (3b) – Relevant Accounting Policies, Note (3c) –
Management Judgments and Sources of Estimation
Uncertainty, and Note (5) – Revenue.

The Financial Statement Risk
IFRS do not provide specific guidance on recognizing revenue
for sales of software and software-related products and
services. SAP defined detailed policies, procedures and
processes to manage the accounting for its software
arrangements. SAP’s revenue generating transactions and,
consequently, SAP’s revenue recognition policies are complex.
Applying them often requires significant judgment.
Significant judgments include the allocation of revenue from
customer contracts to multiple deliverables and the application
of the revenue recognition criteria under IAS 18, e.g., assessing
whether the significant risks and rewards have been transferred
to the buyer and whether the amount of revenue can be
measured reliably.

Our Response
We evaluated the compliance of SAP’s accounting policies on
software revenue recognition with the IFRS Framework and the

43

individual applicable IFRSs. We considered the design and
tested the operating effectiveness of the key controls
implemented by SAP on the identification of multiple-element
arrangements, the identification of deliverables and separate
units of accounting, the identification of fair value for all relevant
deliverables other than on-premise software (due to the residual
method being applied). For all software arrangements we
considered to be individually substantial and for a sample of the
remaining software arrangements, we also:
– obtained an understanding of the transaction through
inspection of the underlying contractual agreements and
other related documents as well as discussions with SAP’s
accounting and/or sales representatives;
– obtained external confirmations of the key terms and
conditions from the respective customers to corroborate the
information relevant for the accounting that we received
from SAP;
– assessed whether SAP appropriately identified all separate
units of accounting and allocated the transaction price to
such units based on either the relative fair value method or
the residual method, as applicable, using the established fair
values (see next paragraph); and
– evaluated whether the revenue recognition policies
applicable to each separate unit of accounting were applied
appropriately to ensure that revenue is recognized in the
appropriate period.
We evaluated the fair value assumptions for each deliverable
that typically qualifies as a separate unit of accounting in SAP’s
multiple-element arrangements by assessing the
appropriateness of the methodology applied, testing
mathematical accuracy of the underlying calculations and
testing selections to corroborate the data underlying SAP’s
calculations. We also assessed the appropriateness of the
related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.

Our Observations
SAP has developed an adequate framework for determining the
accounting treatment for its software licenses revenue. Our
testing did not identify any significant exceptions in the
operation of controls. The disclosures appropriately describe
this framework. For the vast majority of the software
arrangements entered into during 2016, it was clear which of
SAP’s revenue policies should apply. Where there was room for
interpretation, SAP’s judgment was balanced and appropriate.
We did not identify any material errors in calculations.

Income tax exposures
Refer to note (3b) – Relevant Accounting Policies, note (3c) –
Management Judgments and Sources of Estimation Uncertainty,
and note (10) – Income Tax.

The Financial Statement Risk
SAP operates in multiple tax jurisdictions with complexities of
transfer pricing, changing tax laws, and intercompany financing

44

transactions. The determination of provisions for tax
contingencies requires SAP to make judgments on tax issues
and develop estimates regarding SAP’s exposure to tax risks.

Our Response
SAP regularly engages external experts to provide tax opinions
to support their own risk assessment. We involved our tax
specialists to evaluate these tax opinions. Our specialists also
assessed the correspondence with the relevant tax authorities
and analyzed and evaluated the assumptions used to determine
tax provisions based on our knowledge and experiences of the
current application of the relevant legislation by authorities and
courts. Through our international network we involved tax
specialists with the appropriate knowledge on the respective
local tax rules and regulations who reported the results of their
assessment to us. We also assessed the adequacy of SAP’s
disclosures about income taxes and uncertain tax positions.

Our Observations
SAP’s judgments as to the amounts recognized as tax expense
and provisions for tax contingencies as at December 31, 2016
are appropriate. The disclosures provide a balanced description
of the current status of tax claims and risks.

Goodwill impairment test for SAP Business
Network
Refer to Note (3c) – Management Judgments and Sources of
Estimation Uncertainty, Note (15) - Goodwill and Intangible
Assets

The Financial Statement Risk
SAP performed the annual goodwill impairment test at the level
of its operating segments as there are no lower levels within
SAP at which goodwill is monitored for internal management
purposes. SAP’s acquisitions led to a material goodwill in the
SAP Business Network Segment in which SAP mainly markets
and sells the cloud offering developed by SAP Ariba, SAP
Fieldglass and Concur. Goodwill allocated to the SAP Business
Network is material as of December 31, 2016 (16,8 % of
consolidated balance sheet total) and the impairment test
involves significant judgment. The key assumptions relate to the
determination of the peer group, budgeted revenue growth,
budgeted operating margins, pre-tax discount rates and
terminal growth rates.

Our Response
SAP has implanted controls designed to ensure that the
calculation of the recoverable amount (in the specific case fair
value less cost of disposal) for SAP Business Network is
appropriate. We tested the design and operating effectiveness
of these controls. We involved our valuation specialists to
assess the valuation methodologies applied and key
assumptions used in measuring the fair value less cost to
disposal and to test the mathematical accuracy of the
discounted cash flow and other valuation models. We evaluated
SAP’s assumptions by comparing the fair value estimates to our

To Our Stakeholders | Independent Auditor’s Report

own expectations and performed independent sensitivity
analysis for each key assumption.

Executive Board determines is necessary to enable the
preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Our Observations
Our testing did not identify any significant exceptions in the
operation of controls. Based on our performed sensitivity
analysis we concluded that SAP applied a balanced set of
assumptions in determining the recoverable amount (fair value
less cost of disposal). The valuation results for the goodwill of
SAP Business Network are consistent with our internal
projections. We did not identify any material errors in valuation
methodologies applied or in the calculations made.

Information Other than the Consolidated
Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report
thereon
The Executive Board of SAP SE is responsible for the
information other than the consolidated financial statements
and auditor’s report thereon (the other information). The other
information comprises the Integrated Report published on the
website of SAP SE, including the Annual Report on Form 20-F,
except for the annual and consolidated financial statements, the
combined group management report by the SAP Group and the
management report of SAP SE and our auditor's report thereon.
Our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements does
not cover the other information and we do not express, any form
of assurance conclusion thereon, except for selected qualitative
and quantitative sustainability disclosures for which we
performed an independent assurance engagement and issued
an Independent Assurance Report.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information,
and doing so, consider whether the other information is
materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise
appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we
have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to
report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of the Executive Board and
the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated
Financial Statements
The Executive Board of SAP SE is responsible for the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements which
comply with IFRS as adopted by the EU and the supplementary
requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section
315a (1) HGB as well as IFRS as adopted by the International
Accounting Standards Board and give a true and fair view of the
net assets, financial position and results of operations of the
Group in accordance with these requirements. Furthermore, the
Executive Board is responsible for such internal control as the

To Our Stakeholders | Independent Auditor’s Report

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the
Executive Board is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concern and using the going concern
basis of accounting unless the Executive Board either intends to
liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic
alternative but to do so.
The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the
Group’s financial reporting process for the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of
the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error,
and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion on the
consolidated financial statements. Reasonable assurance is a
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with Section 317 HGB and German
generally accepted standards for the audit of financial
statements promulgated by the German Institute of Public
Auditors [IDW] as well as in supplementary compliance with ISA
and guidelines of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with Section 317 HGB and
German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial
statements promulgated by the German Institute of Public
Auditors [IDW] as well as in supplementary compliance with ISA
and guidelines of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), we exercise professional judgment and
maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
– Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the
consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to
those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations,
or the override of internal control.

45

– Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the
audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances.
– Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and
the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
disclosures made by the Executive Board.
– Conclude on the appropriateness of the Executive Board’s
use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty
exists related to events or conditions that may cast
significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we
are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the
related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up
to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or
conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a
going concern.
– Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of
the consolidated financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial
statements represent the underlying transactions and events
in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a
true and fair view of the net assets and financial position as
well as the results of operations of the Group in accordance
with IFRS as adopted by the EU and the supplementary
requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section
315a (1) HGB as well as IFRS as adopted by the International
Accounting Standards Board.
– Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding
the financial information of the entities or business activities
within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. We are responsible for the direction,
supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain
solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing
of the audit and significant audit findings, including any
significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during
our audit.
We also provide the Supervisory Board with a statement that we
have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships
and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on
our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the Supervisory Board,
we determine those matters that were of most significance in
the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current
period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe
these matters in our report on the audit of the consolidated
financial statements unless law or regulation precludes public
disclosure about the matter.

Group’s financial reporting process for the preparation of the
Group Management Report.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of
the Group Management Report
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance whether the
Group Management Report as a whole provides a suitable view
of the Group’s position, as well as, in all material respects, is

Report on the System of Internal
Control over Consolidated Financial
Reporting pursuant to PCAOB
Opinion on the System of Internal Control
over Consolidated Financial Reporting
We have audited the system of internal control over
consolidated financial reporting of SAP SE, Walldorf, and its
subsidiaries in place as at December 31, 2016. This control
system is based on criteria set out in the Internal Control –
Integrated Framework of the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) (version of
2013).
In our opinion, SAP maintained effective internal control over
consolidated financial reporting as at December 31, 2016 based
on the criteria set out in the Internal Control – Integrated
Framework issued by COSO (in the version of 2013).

Executive Board’s and Supervisory Board’s
Responsibility for the System of Internal
Control over Consolidated Financial
Reporting
SAP SE’s Executive Board is responsible for maintaining an
effective system of internal control over consolidated financial
reporting and assessing its effectiveness, which is included in
the Executive Board’s report on the system of internal control
over consolidated financial reporting.
A company’s system of internal control over consolidated
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting in the
consolidated financial statements and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s system
of internal control over consolidated financial reporting includes
policies and procedures to (1) ensure an accounting system that

To Our Stakeholders | Independent Auditor’s Report

in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflects the
transactions and dispositions of the company’s assets, (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect material misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the
Group’s system of internal control over consolidated financial
reporting.

Auditor’s Responsibility for the System of
Internal Control over Consolidated
Financial Reporting
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the system of
internal control over consolidated financial reporting based on
our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over consolidated financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of
internal control over consolidated financial reporting included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk of material deficiencies in internal
control, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on this assessment, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Achieving the Vision
Supporting our customers’ digital
transformation
To execute our vision, we are helping customers meet the
challenges of today’s changing world, and at the same time,
enabling them to have a positive impact across the economy,
society, and the environment.
Technology is transforming both our society and the way we do
business. People and things are connected like never before.
Entire industries are being disrupted by innovations that seemed
unimaginable only a few years ago. Technology trends such as
cloud computing, Big Data, the Internet of Things (IoT), and
artificial intelligence go hand in hand with social trends that are
changing how we live and work.

Organizations need to digitally transform their business
processes and business models to be able to succeed in today’s
marketplace. They need to become agile organizations that are
laser focused on driving customer value. They also must
become data-driven and run their business on real-time
information to react to market and customer demands.
By providing a technology platform for innovation and
digitalization, we help our customers with the challenges of
digital transformation. Our solutions enable businesses,
governments, and non-profit organizations in more than 180
countries to become data-driven “live” businesses.
Our platform leverages existing SAP assets that are
complemented by new cloud capabilities and the real-time

Our core ERP software is the historic foundation of our strength.
To maintain our market leadership position as this market
rapidly shifts to the cloud, we will continue to innovate and offer
the agility and flexibility our customers require.

To enable sustainable success, we must prepare for the future.
We will continue to incubate disruptive technologies across a
number of initiatives. We have begun incubating new businesses
using an “open innovation” approach under the umbrella of the
SAP.io program with focus on both internal and external
startups. We are aggressively investing in making our business
applications “intelligent” with machine learning. We are
investing in delivering personalized medicine through a
connected health platform – aligned with our vision of improving
society and healthcare. At the same time, we continue to create
reliable security solutions across all of our products.
For more information about these investments, see the
Products, Research & Development, and Services section.

Recruit and retain the right talent
We cannot bring innovations to our customers without capable,
driven employees. As we strive to be the best place to work in
the enterprise software industry, we look to a diverse and
engaged workforce to drive innovation and value for our
customers. Recruiting the right talent and unleashing their
innovative power is as crucial for SAP as continuing to develop
the talent of existing employees to allow them to realize their full
potential.
For more information, see the Employees and Social
Investments section.

We will continue to deliver market-leading applications for ERP,
whether in the cloud or on premise. Further, we will continue to

Keeping a balanced focus on growth
We take a balanced approach on how to grow. We will continue
to focus on organic investments in technology and innovations
to drive our short-term and midterm growth ambitions. We will
continue to look at unleashing the full potential of our
employees’ talent as well as strategic partnerships with our
ecosystem to foster innovation.
Additionally, we may also acquire targeted “tuck-in”
technologies to add to our broad solution offerings and improve
coverage in key strategic markets. In 2016, SAP made the
following smaller tuck-in acquisitions:
– Altiscale, a company providing high-performance, scalable
Big Data-as-a-service (BDaaS) solutions, will help SAP
accelerate and operationalize the deployment of Big Data in
the enterprise.
– Fedem Technology, a forward-thinking IoT company, will
help SAP build next-generation, end-to-end IoT solutions that
not only support predictive maintenance but also Industry
4.0 scenarios.
– Hipmunk, a leader in innovative travel search, will bring a
consumer-like experience for business travelers.
– PLAT.ONE, a leading enterprise-grade IoT provider, will help
SAP enhance complex IoT capabilities in SAP Cloud Platform
(formerly called SAP HANA Cloud Platform).

in which it can help fuel growth by adding expertise,
relationships, geographic reach, and capital. It places a
particular focus on companies in Europe, Israel, and the United
States.
Additionally, we launched a new SAP.io Fund to focus on
strategic, early stage investments aligned with our SAP.io
innovation initiatives. This US$35 million fund will focus on
“catalyzing” a startup ecosystem that can leverage or enrich
SAP data sets, platform technologies, or business workflows. It
is operated in partnership with Sapphire Ventures.
For more information about our consolidated investment funds,
see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note
(34).

Financial Business Model
We derive our revenue from fees charged to our customers for:
– Support, professional services, development, training, and
other services
– Licensing of on-premise software products and solutions

Measuring Our Success
We believe the most important indicators to measure our
success comprise both financial and non-financial indicators:

Investing in the next generation of
technology leaders
For 20 years, through venture capital funds managed by
Sapphire Ventures, SAP has supported entrepreneurs that
aspire to build industry-leading businesses. Sapphire Ventures
currently has over US$2 billion under management and has

Empowering Our Customers to
Become Digital Businesses
In 2016, we continued to give top priority to supporting our
customers on their individual paths into the digital economy,
defining our strategy around the following cornerstones:
– Enabling business with a digital data foundation
– Running business with modern business applications and
business networks
– Differentiating business with a digital enterprise platform
– Steering business with real-time analytics
– Reinventing business with machine learning and the
Internet of Things
– Making companies’ digital transformations possible with SAP
Digital Business Services

SAP HANA – Enabling Business with a
Digital Data Foundation
SAP HANA is our in-memory computing platform that lets
companies accelerate business processes, deliver more
business intelligence, and simplify their IT environment.
SAP HANA removes the burden of maintaining separate legacy
systems and siloed data, so companies can run live and
business people can make better business decisions in the new
digital economy. Emphasizing our cloud-first strategy,
SAP HANA can be deployed on several public cloud
infrastructures.
With our second version of SAP HANA, we launched a truly nextgeneration platform. It enables the reduction of time-consuming
database and data management tasks and delivers intelligent

€3,044 m

R&D expense in 2016 (IFRS)

applications that leverage advanced analytic processing and
empowers all users with deeper insight into any data from
anywhere.
Our cloud-first strategy requires a very strong offering to handle
Big Data in the cloud. With SAP Cloud Platform Big Data Service,
which is powered by SAP HANA, we run multitenant-aware
Hadoop systems and provide end-to-end capabilities to
efficiently manage and scale Big Data initiatives.

Running Business with Modern Business
Applications and Business Networks
SAP S/4HANA – Reimagining the Business Suite
for the Digital Age
SAP S/4HANA, our next-generation business suite, allows our
customers to embrace the digital economy. The digital core is
the foundation for running a Live Business:
– Immediate – Empowering business users with insights to act
in the moment
– Intelligent – Going beyond automation to provide predictive
suggestions
– Integrated – Connecting not only customer functions but
also people, things, and businesses
Based on SAP HANA, SAP S/4HANA software can store and
process huge amounts of data while significantly reducing an
organization’s data footprint. This means our customers can
save time and cost.
Available in the cloud, on premise, or as a hybrid deployment, in
2016, SAP S/4HANA evolved from a finance-focused offering

Combined Management Report | Products, Research & Development, and Services

55

into a full digital-age ERP system. It enables insight and
understanding so businesses can predict outcomes and use that
data to make decisions live, which helps companies stay
competitive in the digital economy. SAP S/4HANA can replace a
traditional ERP solution across all lines of business (LoBs), such
as finance, human resources, sales, service, procurement,
manufacturing, asset management, supply chain, and research
and development (R&D).

SAP covers 25 industries grouped in six industry sectors and 12
lines of business:
Industry Sector

Consumer

SAP for Consumer Products
SAP for Life Sciences
SAP for Retail
SAP for Wholesale Distribution

Customers recognize the benefits and power of SAP S/4HANA
and, at the end of 2016, more than 5,400 customers had chosen
the suite to support their digital transformation.

SAP S/4HANA Cloud – Delivering the Power of
the Digital Core

SAP for Industrial Machinery &
Components

In addition to our on-premise suite SAP S/4HANA, we further
strengthened our SAP S/4HANA Cloud offering, delivering the
power of a digital core with the key benefits expected from a
software-as-a-service solution. It provides the scalability, ease
of management, and security required in today’s digital
economy. A quarterly release cycle helps ensure that customers
can benefit from regularly delivered innovations with minimum
disruption to their business.

Energy and natural resources SAP for Chemicals

SAP S/4HANA Cloud is comprised of various solutions targeted
to meet the specific business needs of our customers and
enable their journey to the cloud. For example, the
SAP S/4HANA Enterprise Management Cloud solution provides
a next-generation ERP suite in the cloud with integrated, end-toend processes.

Public services

SAP S/4HANA Cloud was developed to co-exist in a
heterogeneous system landscape with native integration to
other SAP solutions and open interfaces for further integration
and extensions using SAP Cloud Platform (formerly called SAP
HANA Cloud Platform). The solution also supports specific
industry and LoB requirements with preconfigured content from
SAP Best Practices packages and uses the award-winning SAP
Fiori user experience (UX) to provide simplified, role-based
usability.

Extending Our Reach Through a Broad Ecosystem
SAP’s ecosystem and partners extend our reach in the
marketplace. We work closely with more than 15,000 partners
worldwide to provide SAP solutions for our customers. Partners
continue to drive SAP S/4HANA and our solutions for small
businesses and midsize enterprises (SMEs) – SAP Business
ByDesign and SAP Business One – to prospects on behalf of
SAP, accounting for more than 88% of all new SAP customers.

Innovating for LoBs and Industries

Supply Chain

As a modular integrated suite, SAP S/4HANA is the backbone of
a company. And, at the same time, we are building functional
innovations for LoBs and industries to address our customers’
specific and evolving needs.

Sustainability

56

Combined Management Report | Products, Research & Development, and Services

In addition, we are building other functional innovations that
serve specific lines of business, for example:

Included in the business networks portfolio are SAP’s marketleading Concur, SAP Ariba, and SAP Fieldglass solutions, which
are at the center of our business network strategy.

Human Capital Management
Our human capital management (HCM) offerings, including SAP
SuccessFactors solutions, help organizations increase the value
of their total workforce by developing, managing, engaging, and
empowering their people. SAP SuccessFactors HCM Suite
addresses a full range of HR needs and encompasses the
following:
– Core human resources – SAP SuccessFactors Employee
Central and SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central Payroll
solutions cover the administrative tasks required to manage
an organization’s workforce. More specifically, this includes
HR administration, payroll, position management, global
benefits, time and attendance, shared services, and
employee and manager self-service capabilities. The
solutions act as the key source of employee and worker data
and typically integrate with hundreds of external and internal
systems, including SAP S/4HANA. At the end of 2016,
customers for SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central
numbered more than 1,580.
– Talent management – Our suite comprises solutions for all
pillars of talent management, recruiting (marketing and
management), onboarding, performance management,
development, succession planning, compensation planning
and administration, learning, and workforce analytics.
We focus on delivering a simple and intuitive UX for our HCM
suite through mobile device or desktop.

Customer Engagement and Commerce (CEC)
Today’s customers are digitally connected, socially networked,
and individually empowered, changing the rules of engagement.
Our integrated front-office suite encompasses a holistic offering
across customer experience, commerce, marketing, sales,
billing, and services.
By providing leading omnichannel customer engagement and
commerce solutions across any touch point and channel, we
enable organizations (both business-to-consumer and businessto-business) to deliver contextual, consistent, and relevant
experiences – regardless of channel or device – throughout the
customer journey.

Connecting Companies with Business Networks
Our business networks are best-in-class cloud applications that
connect a global ecosystem of customers, suppliers, and
partners. The products and services go beyond the four walls of
a business to integrate and connect systems, services, partners,
and data – creating more efficient, more powerful, and far
simpler ways to manage key business functions. They provide
the outcomes and experiences business users need through
open and connected platforms.

Ariba Network is the world’s largest business network, with
more than 2.5 million connected companies trading over
US$885 billion of commerce on the network, which has grown
its commerce volume close to 20% year-over-year. In 2016, we
unveiled innovations that help businesses achieve efficient,
intelligent connections and frictionless transactions across the
entire source-to-pay process:
– Guided buying – A new buying experience automatically
leads employees to goods and services they need to do their
jobs and execute purchases in compliance with company
policies.
– Light enablement – This interactive e-mail service eliminates
the complexity that buyers face in onboarding and
connecting suppliers, letting them send purchase orders and
receive order confirmations and invoices in just a few clicks.
– Open platform – Ariba Network offers an open applicationprogramming interface (API) capability that allows partners
to add functionality and extend solutions for all industries and
business needs.
With more than 45 million users worldwide, our acquired
company Concur is the world leader in travel and expense
management solutions. In 2016, Concur continued to deliver on
our vision of an open cloud platform for travel and expense
management that enables an effortless experience for end users
as well as finance departments. It provides total transparency
into employee travel and spending, wherever and whenever it
happens.
New innovations for travel, expense, and accounts payable
automation in Concur solutions include:
– User interface improvements and the addition of many
region-specific partners to our ecosystem
– Integration with the SAP ERP Financials and Intuit
Quickbooks solutions
– Expansion of global tax capabilities
– Additional features in the Concur Invoice solution to help
ensure a three-way match between purchase, receipt, and
invoicing
SAP Fieldglass solutions help simplify procuring and managing
external workforce services, connecting businesses in real time.
In 2016, more than 3.1 million workers in approximately 135
countries were connected using the solution.
Market changes, including globalization and access to talent,
have led many organizations to increasingly rely on contingent
workers and service providers to achieve business goals. SAP
Fieldglass cloud-based solutions also help companies engage
and optimize all forms of talent. The software dynamically

Combined Management Report | Products, Research & Development, and Services

matches business needs with the right combination of resources
while helping to ensure visibility, compliance, and cost control.
In 2016, we continued to redefine how work gets done in the
enterprise, with innovations in SAP Fieldglass solutions
including streamlined services procurement templates and
extended flexible talent-sourcing capabilities.

Our focus for SMEs, as with larger enterprises, is on cloud
technology and simplified business processes for end users and
partners. End-to-end accountability and increased investments
in these core cloud ERP, on-premise ERP, and front-office
solutions helps foster innovation and growth for the digital
economy. Customers using SME solutions include small
businesses and midsize companies in more than 100 countries.

Data Network

Keeping User Experience in Focus

Our business data network offers a comprehensive, people-first
data-as-a-service solution that provides real-time, industryspecific, and data-driven benchmarks built on the world’s
largest repository of networked business data and enriched by
key industrial and economic indicators. In 2016, we produced a
beta version of the first data-driven service based on contingent
workforce data. The highly personalized user experience helps
customers discover their standing in the market so that they can
take advantage of live recommendations and collaboration
workflows that turn insights into action. Using data strategically
in this way, customers can operate more efficiently and create
new data-driven business models.

SAP Connected Health
Building on many years of work in the healthcare and life
sciences industries, SAP has deepened its investment in these
areas. In 2016, we launched a SAP Connected Health platform
with trusted partners. The platform supports new developments
such as using very large data sets to conduct in-depth analysis
of the human genome, proteome, and other biological data. It
also enables a broad ecosystem of partners – including
developers, researchers, and healthcare organizations – to
accelerate the development and delivery of innovative, patientcentered solutions for improving health outcomes, reducing
costs, and delivering connected healthcare services.

Building Better Solutions for Small and
Midsize Enterprises
We offer a portfolio that extends the power of SAP HANA to
support SMEs with their digital transformation that includes the
followings solutions:
– SAP Anywhere: Our front-office solution for small businesses
has been on the market for just over a year in China, the
United Kingdom, and the United States. Currently, more than
185 customers are running SAP Anywhere.
– SAP Business ByDesign: Our ERP cloud solution is targeted
to the midmarket and subsidiaries of large enterprises. At the
end of 2016, 99% of SAP Business ByDesign customers ran
the solution on SAP HANA.
– SAP Business One: Our integrated ERP application is
available on premise or through a partner-hosted cloud.
Today, more than 2,000 SAP Business One customers run
the application on SAP HANA.

User experience (UX) is about meeting the user’s needs in the
most effective and enjoyable way. Our understanding of how to
create true innovation manifests itself in the award-winning SAP
Fiori UX. The concept and design principles are key components
in our design-led development process, which helps ensure the
delivery of SAP Fiori innovations through all SAP applications.
With SAP Fiori 2.0, users can get their work done faster and
more effectively, with:
– Direct access to relevant information and apps
– Transparency on items needing attention and timely
notifications
– Support in deciding what needs to be done next
– Ability to perform quick and informed actions
At the same time, our UX strategy focuses on empowering our
customers and partners to design their own UX journey and
execute on it – through a rich portfolio of services, educational
offerings, and tools and technologies to design, develop, and
deliver a simplified UX.

SAP Cloud Platform – Differentiating
Business with a Digital Enterprise Platform
In the digital economy, in addition to standard applications,
companies need a highly flexible platform that allows them to do
the following:
– Extend cloud and on-premise SAP applications
– Build new applications for differentiating LoB processes
– Integrate cloud and on-premise SAP applications
With SAP Cloud Platform, our in-memory platform-as-a-service,
companies can rapidly build, run, and extend modern business
applications. It offers comprehensive capabilities to help
business users and developers create better, more agile
applications in less time. Customers can apply, among other
things, mobile services, advanced analytic tools, state-of-the-art
authentication mechanisms, and social functionality. For
maximum flexibility, portability, and agility, we use open
technologies.
SAP Cloud Platform is a digital enterprise platform offering the
following:

Combined Management Report | Products, Research & Development, and Services

– Analytical capabilities
– Access to SAP applications, processes, and data
– Robust business services that customers and independent
software vendors can consume to build solutions
Furthermore, we are positioning the SAP Cloud Platform
Integration service as the default integration infrastructure for
SAP solutions, whether in the cloud or on premise. We deliver
content to support end-to-end integration scenarios. Being able
to connect and integrate all best-of-breed applications to our
digital core and to any custom-built solution makes
SAP Cloud Platform the center of gravity for a modular suite of
business applications.
Close partnerships with customers and other leading technology
companies are key to providing best-in-class solutions. In 2016,
we announced a strategic partnership with Apple Inc. to build a
SAP Cloud Platform software development kit for iOS that
enables businesses, designers, and developers to quickly and
efficiently build their own native iOS apps for iPhones and iPads.

Steering Business with Real-Time Analytics
Business leaders need to be able to discover and communicate
meaningful and actionable insights in data so they can make
decisions in real time. Our analytics offerings help companies to
apply analytics to business data to describe, predict, and
improve business performance, recommend action, and guide
decision making.
With SAP BW/4HANA, we launched next-generation data
warehouse software, delivering a simpler and more powerful
way to achieve real-time analytics by connecting historical data
with live data stored in SAP and third-party software
environments. This integrated data warehouse solution is
optimized to fully leverage the SAP HANA platform and
simplifies development, administration, and the user interface,
resulting in enhanced business agility.

Reinventing Business with the Internet of
Things and Machine Learning
There is no topic that typifies the digital transformation more
than the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT is a network of physical
objects with embedded sensors to detect their environment and
interact with business processes and systems. This builds a
foundation for entirely new business models and completely
digitized, connected businesses. Intelligent sensors, ubiquitous
connectivity, and unlimited data storage are driving innovation
and leading to a deeper integration of people, processes, data,
and things – in one connected world.
Our IoT solutions, now marketed under the new SAP Leonardo
brand, help companies digitally transform their manufacturing,
logistics, and asset management processes and respond to the
needs of a digital business in a highly individualized, consumerdriven economy. We strive to become a trusted partner for IoT
that helps our customers link sensor data with business
processes and thereby add value. With our end-to-end SAP
Leonardo solutions for connected logistics, connected
manufacturing, and connected assets, for example, we offer a
comprehensive portfolio of standard IoT software, both crossindustry and industry specific. Furthermore, in November 2016,
we announced the SAP IoT Application Enablement toolkit,
providing services that allow our customers to build their own
IoT applications.

Research and Innovation – Innovating for Future
Growth
With businesses shifting, leading our customers through change
is more important than ever before. We do this every day by
empowering our employees and collaborating with our
customers to develop world-class software and next-generation
solutions. We further strengthened our global research and
development (R&D) efforts in 2016 by investing in our SAP Labs
network and expanding our SAP Innovation Center locations in
India, Israel, and the United States.

We consolidated analytical functionalities across our product
portfolio in one cloud analytics solution – SAP BusinessObjects
Cloud. Built on SAP Cloud Platform, it helps companies
overcome the challenge of point solutions and data silos spread
throughout the organization with enterprise-wide access to
analytics delivered through a public cloud experience.

Through the SAP Innovation Center concept, we explore
unconventional ideas and develop inspiring proofs of concept in
a startup-like environment. We strive to open up new markets
for SAP software and accelerate the integration of emerging
technologies into our core products. Some of these innovations
include:

For the SAP Digital Boardroom solution, which offers executive
decision makers ease and elegance in accessing company data
in real time, we released new industry-specific and LoB-specific
content for consumer products, chemicals, engineering,
construction, operations, and public sector, as well as HR,
finance, and marketing LoBs.

– Machine learning – Making all existing SAP solutions
intelligent, bringing machine-learning services and APIs to
our platform, and building intelligent business solutions in
new and adjacent markets. To emphasize the importance of
this topic, we have introduced the new brand SAP Clea that
represents our entire machine learning portfolio.
– Blockchain – Exploring the potential of digital finance to
radically change how business transactions are conducted in
the future and its impact on existing products and innovation
potential of blockchain across industries.

– Future enterprise applications – Enabling companies to
successfully lead the next economic revolution by developing
game-changing business applications to process intangible
assets, provide contextual user assistance, and manage new

to foster organic innovation and support the transformation of
great ideas into profitable business.

While our intellectual property is important to our success, we
believe our business as a whole is not dependent on one
particular or a combination of patents.

Through our SAP Digital Business Services unit, SAP aims to

companies and organizations reimagine their businesses in the
new economy using a digital business framework.

SAP actively seeks intellectual property protection for
innovations and proprietary information. Our software
innovations continue to strengthen our market position in
business solutions and services. Our investment in R&D has
resulted in numerous patents. As at December 31, 2016, SAP
held a total of more than 8,000 validated patents worldwide. Of
these, 841 were granted and validated in 2016.

Innovations from SAP Digital Business
Services
SAP Digital Business Services offers an entire portfolio of
services. Some of our top innovations in 2016 to help customers
transform to a digital business include:
– SAP Value Assurance service packages for SAP S/4HANA
– Latest generation of SAP Solution Manager and SAP Model
Company
– Next-generation support
– SAP Digital: Expanding the reach of SAP Store and
messaging services

SAP Value Assurance Service Packages
Our SAP Value Assurance service packages for SAP S/4HANA
cover all project phases and scenarios to help customers
migrate from SAP ERP to SAP S/4HANA. This includes:
– System conversion
– Landscape transformation
– New implementations
– On-premise, cloud, and hybrid deployment options

Combined Management Report | Products, Research & Development, and Services

The approach consolidates services and embedded support in
four distinct phases:
– Plan and safeguard – Defining the implementation strategy,
including dependencies and prerequisites for the target
architecture
– Technical implementation – Focusing on the technical
aspects of implementation, including data and system
migration, high availability, and disaster recovery
– Migrate and implement – Implementing functions with
preconfigured setup and ready-to-use business process
templates, and analyzing operational impact
– Innovate and optimize – Expanding the context of innovation
beyond the digital core to reimagine business models across
the enterprise
The packages utilize the SAP Activate methodology, an
innovation adoption framework that combines SAP Best
Practices packages, implementation methodology, and guided
configuration to help streamline deployment.
Partners also play a key role in innovation adoption. Our open
engagement approach has motivated many of our larger
services partners to focus more on establishing SAP S/4HANA
as the digital core.

Next-Generation Support
Traditional businesses are becoming digital enterprises. With
more business processes “running live,” product support must
be less reactive and much more proactive, predictive, and
available at any moment; in other words, live support.
Our product support has implemented a next-generation
support approach that includes real-time support. Named
Expert Chat, this live support channel offers direct access to our
experts, available for the majority of our solutions. Moreover, a
universal, toll-free phone number harmonizes interaction with
support across almost all of our products. We also offer
customers a way to search for answers to product-related
questions, by making knowledge located within SAP searchable
using Google. Automating tasks with intelligent, contextsensitive tools provides customers with solutions proactively.
Customers also demand a seamless, omnichannel support
experience. We plan to address this by implementing functions
such as built-in, mobile, and social media-enabled support.

Challenges

security consulting. They help our customers build security and
privacy protection capabilities into their businesses.

Every day, organizations all around the world trust SAP with
their data – either in their own premises, in the cloud, or on the
move using mobile devices. Our customers need to know that
we will keep that data safe, process it in a manner that complies
with local legislation, and protect it from malicious use.

Several of our security measures extend across all sectors of
our company and thus to all of our products and services. These
measures include, among other things, the regular training of
employees on the subject of IT security and data protection,
including the handling of confidential information and ensuring
controlled and restrictive access to customer information. In
addition, we have developed a three-pronged strategy focusing
on the security of our products, operations, and organization:

For this reason, data protection and security is of paramount
importance to us. We have implemented safeguards to help
enable the privacy rights of everyone whose data is processed
by SAP, whether they are our customers, prospects, employees,
or partners. In addition, we work towards compliance with all
relevant legal requirements for data protection. Our global
security officer and data protection and privacy officer report to
our Executive Board and regularly monitor the compliance of all
activities in these areas.

Facing Increasing Risks in IT Security
Safeguarding data is an increasingly challenging task today.
Companies are collecting and storing more data than ever
before from more and more sources. No longer is data locked
away in an on-premise mainframe requiring physical security.
Data now proliferates outside the four walls of businesses with
multiple endpoints exposed and vulnerable to attack. Moreover,
the sheer number of and the sophistication of attacks facing
businesses are at an all-time high. We are seeing the
“commercialization of hacking” while new advanced persistent
threats can bypass many traditional security protection
techniques.

Establishing a Comprehensive
Security Vision
At SAP, we want our customers and employees to be able to use
our software and services anywhere, from any device, at any
time, with confidence and trust. However, the growing risk and
occurrence of cyberattacks reinforces the need to keep critical
information systems secure.
Consequently, for SAP and for our customers, security means
more than just meeting compliance demands. To secure the
SAP software landscape, we offer a comprehensive portfolio of
security products, services, and secure support as well as

Secure Products Strategy: Champion Product Security
Businesses use SAP applications to process mission-critical
transactional data which can be highly attractive to cyber
attackers. Our secure products strategy focuses on
incorporating security features into our applications to minimize
the risk of a security breach.
Our secure software development lifecycle is at the heart of this
strategy. This provides a comprehensive methodological
approach for incorporating security features into our
applications. Before a release decision is made, our software is
validated by independent IT security experts. This team then
addresses any recommendations made before we release the
application.
This approach conforms to the ISO/IEC 27034 standard for
application security and is closely embedded into our ISO 9001certified process framework for developing standard software.

Secure Operations Strategy: Running Secure Operations
Our secure operations strategy focuses on the security
principles of “confidentiality, integrity, and availability” to ensure
overall protection of our business, as well as our customers’
businesses. Our mission is to provide a comprehensive end-toend cloud and IT operations security framework – from system
and data access and system hardening to security patch
management, security monitoring, and end-to-end incident
handling. This involves the implementation of key security
measures across all layers including physical assets as well as
process-integrated controls.
Furthermore, our secure operations approach concentrates on
the early identification of any deviations from the standards
defined in our security framework. Deviations are identified

Performed by third parties as well as by SAP colleagues, these
reviews verify compliance with international standards and SAP
global security standards.

destruction. These include, among others, the implementation
of our data protection management system in areas critical to
data protection. This system is certified on a yearly basis by the
British Standards Institute.

Industry best-practice certifications are key success factors for
our secure operations strategy. Many of our cloud solutions
undergo Service Organization Control (SOC) audits ISAE3402,
SSAE16 SOC I Type II, and SSAE16 SOC II Type II. The SOC
standards are harmonized with a number of ISO certifications
including ISO 9001, 27001, and 22301.

In 2016, SAP did not experience any significant incidents
regarding breaches of customer privacy or losses of customer
data. There were no incidents reported subject to the provisions
of the German Federal Data Protection Act.

Secure Company Strategy: Taking a Holistic Approach to
the Security of Our Business
At SAP, we take a holistic approach to the security of our
company, encompassing processes, technology, and
employees. At the heart of our secure company strategy is an
efficient information security management system and a
security governance model that brings together all of the
different aspects of security. These include the following three
main areas:
– Security culture: Awareness and compliance with our
security policy and standards are fostered through regular
mandatory training, assessments, and reporting.
– Secure environments: Comprehensive physical security
measures are in place to ensure the security of our data
centers and development sites so that we can protect
buildings and facilities effectively.
– Business continuity: A corporate continuity framework
aimed at having robust governance in place at all times is
reviewed on an annual basis to adapt to new or changed
business needs.

Complying with Data Protection and
Privacy Legislation
When processing data about employees, applicants, customers,
suppliers, and partners, SAP respects and protects their right to
data protection and privacy while implementing appropriate
security measures. We develop and support our data protection
and privacy strategy in accordance with our business strategy.
To comply with applicable data protection laws, SAP has
adopted a global data protection and privacy policy. It outlines a
Group-wide minimum standard for handling personal data in
compliance with data protection and privacy laws. The policy
defines requirements for all operational processes that affect
the processing of or access to personal data, as well as
providing clear responsibilities and organizational structures.
We actively monitor changes to applicable laws and regulations
so that we can update our standards on an ongoing basis.
We have also implemented a wide range of measures to protect
data controlled by SAP and SAP customers from unauthorized
access and processing, as well as from accidental loss or

Customer Net Promoter Score 2016

Continuing to Build Strong Customer
Relationships
Customer loyalty is one of our four corporate objectives, along
with growth, profitability, and employee engagement. In 2016,
our combined on-premise and cloud Customer Net Promoter
Score (Customer NPS) was 19.2% (2015: 22.4%). As we further
harmonize processes in acquired entities, the customer
segments used for customer surveys has not yet been
completely harmonized across the SAP Group. Specifically, due
to the nature of the business, the Concur customer sample
includes a higher proportion of general business customers in
comparison to other Group entities. As a result, Concur
responses make up a large proportion of the total customer
sample.
While we continue to have a positive Customer NPS, we did not
reach our target of 25% in 2016. As a response to the feedback
received from our customers throughout 2016, we have focused
on improving the quality of our follow-up process to ensure a
timely resolution of customer issues. We have provided more
insight into how customers can migrate to our innovations
without disrupting their business processes. With a sustained
emphasis on follow-up, we are targeting a combined Customer
NPS of 21% to 23% in 2017, with our medium-term goal of
reaching a combined Customer NPS of 35% to 40% by 2020.
For more information about the Customer NPS, see the
Performance Management System section.

Continuing Strong Customer
Demand
We help companies transform into digital businesses. In 2016,
we saw customers do so by licensing or subscribing to the full
range of SAP software, from comprehensive solutions for large
enterprises to the latest mobile apps.

Performance
Management System
We use various performance measures to help manage our
performance with regard to our primary financial objectives,
which are growth and profitability, and our primary non-financial
objectives, which are customer loyalty and employee
engagement. We view growth and profitability as indicators for
our current performance, while customer loyalty and employee
engagement are indicators for our future performance.

after the software sale. Support contracts cover standardized
support services that comprise unspecified future software
updates and enhancements. Software licenses revenue as well
as cloud subscriptions and support revenue also tend to
stimulate services revenue earned from providing customers
with professional services, premium engagement services,
training services, messaging services, and payment services.

Measures We Use to Manage Our
Financial Performance

Total revenue (non-IFRS): We use nominal total revenue (nonIFRS) and constant currency total revenue (non-IFRS) to
measure our growth. The total of cloud subscriptions and
support revenue and software support revenue divided by total
revenue is the share of more predictable revenue. This measure
provides additional insight into our sustained business success.

Measures We Use to Manage Our Operating
Financial Performance
In 2016, we used the following key measures to manage our
operating financial performance:
Cloud subscriptions and support revenue (non-IFRS): This
revenue driver comprises the main revenues of our fast-growing
cloud business. We generate cloud subscriptions and support
revenue when we provide software functionality in a cloudbased infrastructure (software as a service, or SaaS) to our
customers; when we provide our customers with access to a
cloud-based infrastructure to develop, run, and manage
applications (platform as a service, or PaaS); and also when we
provide hosting services for software hosted by SAP
(infrastructure as a service, or IaaS). Cloud subscriptions and
support revenue are also generated when providing additional
premium cloud subscription support beyond the regular
support, which is embedded in the basic cloud subscription fees
as well as business network services to our customers. We use
the cloud subscriptions and support revenue (non-IFRS)
measure both at actual currency and at constant currency.
Cloud and software revenue (non-IFRS): We use cloud and
software revenue (non-IFRS) and constant currency cloud and
software revenue (non-IFRS) to measure our revenue growth.
Our cloud and software revenue includes cloud subscriptions
and support revenue plus software licenses and support
revenue. Cloud subscriptions and support revenue and software
revenue are our key revenue drivers because they tend to affect
our other revenue streams. Generally, customers that buy
software licenses also enter into related support contracts, and
these generate recurring revenue in the form of support revenue

New cloud bookings: For our cloud activities, we also look at
new cloud bookings. This measure reflects the committed order
entry from new customers and from incremental purchases by
existing customers for offerings that generate cloud
subscriptions and support revenue. In this way, it is an indicator
for cloud-related sales success in a given period and for secured
future cloud subscriptions and support revenue. We focus
primarily on the average contract value variant of the new cloud
bookings measure that takes into account annualized amounts
for multiyear contracts. Additionally, we internally monitor the
total contract value variant of the new cloud bookings measure
that takes into account the total committed order entry
amounts regardless of contract durations. There are no
comparable IFRS measures for these bookings metrics. In
addition to new cloud bookings, we use the measure “cloud
backlog” to evaluate our sales success in the cloud business. We
define cloud backlog as a measure that represents the volume of
business that, as of period end, is contracted but not yet billed.
Operating profit (non-IFRS): We use operating profit (nonIFRS) and constant currency operating profit (non-IFRS) to
measure our overall operational process efficiency and overall
business performance. See below for more information on the
IFRS and non-IFRS measures we use.
Cloud subscriptions and support gross margin (non-IFRS):
We use our cloud subscriptions and support gross margin (nonIFRS) to measure our process efficiency in our cloud business.
Cloud subscriptions and support gross margin (non-IFRS) is the

Measures We Use to Manage Our
Non-Financial Performance

Measures We Use to Manage Our NonOperating Financial Performance

In 2016, we used the following key measures to manage our nonfinancial performance in the areas of employee engagement,
customer loyalty, and leadership trust:

We use the following measures to manage our non-operating
financial performance.
Financial income, net: This measure provides insight into the
return on liquid assets and capital investments and the cost of
borrowed funds. To manage our financial income, net, we focus
on cash flow, the composition of our liquid assets and capital
investment portfolio, and the average rate of interest at which
assets are invested. We also monitor average outstanding
borrowings and associated finance costs.
Days Sales Outstanding (DSO): We manage working capital by
controlling the days sales outstanding (DSO) for operating
receivables (defined as the average number of days from the
raised invoice to cash receipt from the customer).

Measures We Use to Manage Overall
Financial Performance
We use the following measures to manage our overall financial
performance:
Earnings per share (EPS) (IFRS and non-IFRS): EPS measures
our overall performance because it captures all operating and
non-operating elements of profit as well as income tax expense.
It represents the portion of profit after tax allocable to each SAP
share outstanding. EPS is influenced not only by our operating
and non-operating business as well as income taxes but also by
the number of shares outstanding.
Effective tax rate (IFRS and non-IFRS): We define our effective
tax rate as the ratio of income tax expense to profit before tax,
expressed as a percentage.
Operating, investing, and financing cash flows and free cash
flow: Our consolidated statement of cash flows provides insight
as to how we generated and used cash and cash equivalents.
When applied in conjunction with the other primary financial
statements, it provides information that helps us evaluate the
changes of our net assets, our financial structure (including our
liquidity and solvency), and our ability to affect the amounts and
timing of cash flows to adapt to changing circumstances and
opportunities. We use our free cash flow measure to determine
the cash flow remaining after all expenditures required to
maintain or expand our organic business have been paid off.
This measure provides management with supplemental
information to assess our liquidity needs. We calculate free cash
flow as net cash from operating activities minus purchases
(other than purchases made in connection with business

68

Employee Engagement Index: We use this index to measure the
motivation and loyalty of our employees, how proud they are of
our company, and how strongly they identify with SAP. The
index is derived from surveys conducted among our employees.
Applying this measure is recognition that our growth strategy
depends on engaged employees.
Customer Net Promoter Score (NPS): This score measures the
willingness of our customers to recommend or promote SAP to
others. It is derived from our annual customer survey that
identifies, on a scale of 0–10, whether a customer is loyal and
likely to recommend SAP to friends or colleagues, is neutral, or
is unhappy. We introduced this measure in 2012, as we are
convinced that we can achieve our financial goals only when our
customers are loyal to, and satisfied with, SAP and our
solutions. To derive the Customer NPS, we start with the
percentage of “promoters” of SAP – those who give us a score
of 9 or 10 on a scale of 0–10. We then subtract the percentage of
“detractors” – those who give us a score of 0 to 6. The method
ignores “passives,” who give us a score of 7 or 8.
Leadership Trust Score: We use this score to further enhance
accountability and to measure our collective effort to foster a
work environment based on trust. It is derived from a question in
our annual global employee survey that gauges employees’ trust
in our leaders. We measure leadership trust by using the same
methodology as we do determining the Net Promoter Score
(NPS).

Value-Based Management
Our holistic view of the performance measures described above,
together with our associated analyses, comprises the
information we use for value-based management. We use
planning and control processes to manage the compilation of
these key measures and their availability to our decision makers
across various management levels.
SAP’s long-term strategic plans, including a multiyear financial
plan through 2020, are the point of reference for our short-term
and midterm planning and controlling processes. We initially
identify future growth and profitability drivers at a highly
aggregated level. In a first step, the resulting financial plan is
broken down to (i) our deployment models “On Premise,”
“Software as a Service/Platform as a Service,” “Infrastructure
as a Service,” and “Business Networks”, and (ii) functions such
as development, sales, or administration. In a second step, the

Combined Management Report | Performance Management System

planned total revenues and total expenses are allocated to the
individual board areas. Budget administration and control,
including budget adjustments applied during the year to reflect
changes in priorities, to achieve efficiency targets and to reflect
endogenous and exogenous factors, are handled at board area
level. It is then the individual board member’s responsibility to
break down, in their board area, the allocated budgets and
budget adjustments. The Executive Board’s efforts to assess the
performance of the company and components thereof is also
done on the level of the board areas. Based on an integrated
portfolio process running in parallel to the budgeting process we
ensure aligned investment behavior across board areas with
regards to specific solutions or solution areas. In a final step,
customer-facing revenue targets and cost of sales and
marketing targets are broken down into sales regions.
Based on our detailed annual plans, we determine the budget for
the respective year. We also have processes in place to forecast
revenue and profit on a quarterly basis, to quantify whether we
expect to realize our financial goals, and to identify any
deviations from plan. We continuously monitor the concerned
units in the Group to analyze these developments and define any

appropriate actions. Our entire network of planning, control, and
reporting processes is implemented in integrated planning and
information systems, based on SAP software, across all
organizational units so that we can conduct the evaluations and
analyses needed to make informed decisions.

Share-based payments (SBP)

We disclose certain financial measures, such as revenue (nonIFRS), operating expenses (non-IFRS), operating profit (nonIFRS), operating margin (non-IFRS), and earnings per share
(non-IFRS), as well as constant currency revenue, expense, and
profit that are not prepared in accordance with IFRS and are
therefore considered non-IFRS financial measures. Our nonIFRS financial measures may not correspond to non-IFRS
financial measures that other companies report. The non-IFRS
financial measures that we report should only be considered in
addition to, and not as substitutes for, or superior to, our IFRS
financial measures.

– All forecast and performance reviews with all senior
managers globally are based on these non-IFRS measures,
rather than the respective IFRS financial measures.
– Both our internal performance targets and the guidance we
provided to the capital markets are based on revenue (nonIFRS) and profit (non-IFRS) measures rather than the
respective IFRS financial measures.

We believe that the disclosed supplemental historical and
prospective non-IFRS financial information provides useful
information to investors because management uses this
information, in addition to financial data prepared in accordance
with IFRS, to attain a more transparent understanding of our
past performance and our anticipated future results. We use the
revenue (non-IFRS) and profit (non-IFRS) measures
consistently in our internal planning and forecasting, reporting,
and compensation, as well as in our external communications,
as follows:

Revenue (Non-IFRS)

– Our management primarily uses these non-IFRS measures
rather than IFRS measures as the basis for making financial,
strategic, and operating decisions.
– The variable components of our Executive Board members’
and employees’ remuneration are based on revenue (nonIFRS), operating profit (non-IFRS), as well as new cloud
bookings measures rather than the respective IFRS
measures.
– The annual budgeting process for all management units is
based on revenue (non-IFRS) and operating profit (non-IFRS)
numbers rather than the respective IFRS financial measures.

Our non-IFRS financial measures reflect adjustments based on
the items below, as well as adjustments for the related income
tax effects.

Revenue items identified as revenue (non-IFRS) have been
adjusted from the respective IFRS financial measures by
including the full amount of software support revenue, cloud
subscriptions and support revenue, and other similarly recurring
revenue that we are not permitted to record as revenue under
IFRS due to fair value accounting for the contracts in effect at
the time of the respective acquisitions.
Under IFRS, we record at fair value the contracts in effect at the
time entities were acquired. Consequently, our IFRS software
support revenue, IFRS cloud subscriptions and support revenue,
IFRS cloud and software revenue, and IFRS total revenue for
periods subsequent to acquisitions do not reflect the full amount
of revenue that would have been recorded by entities acquired
by SAP had they remained stand-alone entities. Adjusting
revenue numbers for this revenue impact provides additional
insight into the comparability of our ongoing performance
across periods.

Combined Management Report | Performance Management System

71

Operating Expense (Non-IFRS)

present information about our revenue and various values and
components relating to operating profit that are adjusted for
foreign currency effects.

Operating expense numbers that are identified as operating
expenses (non-IFRS) have been adjusted by excluding the
following expenses:
– Acquisition-related charges
 Amortization expense/impairment charges of intangibles
acquired in business combinations and certain standalone acquisitions of intellectual property (including
purchased in-process research and development)
 Settlements of preexisting business relationships in
connection with a business combination
 Acquisition-related third-party expenses
– Share-based payment expenses
– Restructuring expenses, that is, expenses resulting from
measures which comply with the definition of restructuring
according to IFRS
We exclude certain acquisition-related expenses for the purpose
of calculating operating profit (non-IFRS), operating margin
(non-IFRS), and earnings per share (non-IFRS) when evaluating
SAP’s continuing operational performance because these
expenses generally cannot be changed or influenced by
management after the relevant acquisition other than by
disposing of the acquired assets. Since management at levels
below the Executive Board does not influence these expenses,
we generally do not consider these expenses for the purpose of
evaluating the performance of management units. For similar
reasons we eliminate share-based payment expenses as these
costs are impacted by share price developments and other
factors outside our control. We also eliminate restructuring
expenses because they are volatile and mostly cannot be
influenced by management at levels below the Executive Board.

Operating Profit (Non-IFRS), Operating Margin
(Non-IFRS), Effective Tax Rate (Non-IFRS), and
Earnings per Share (Non-IFRS)
Operating profit, operating margin, effective tax rate, and
earnings per share identified as operating profit (non-IFRS),
operating margin (non-IFRS), effective tax rate (non-IFRS), and
earnings per share (non-IFRS) have been adjusted from the
respective IFRS measures by adjusting for the aforementioned
revenue (non-IFRS) and operating expenses (non-IFRS) and the
income tax effects thereon.

Constant Currency Information
We believe it is important for investors to have information that
provides insight into our sales. Revenue measures determined
under IFRS provide information that is useful in this regard.
However, both sales volume and currency effects impact periodover-period changes in sales revenue. We do not sell
standardized units of products and services, so we cannot
provide relevant information on sales volume by providing data
on the changes in product and service units sold. To provide
additional information that may be useful to investors in
breaking down and evaluating changes in sales volume, we

72

We calculate constant currency revenue and operating profit
measures by translating foreign currencies using the average
exchange rates from the comparative period instead of the
current period.

Free Cash Flow
Among others we use the measure free cash flow to manage our
overall financial performance.

Usefulness of Non-IFRS Measures
We believe that our non-IFRS measures are useful to investors
for the following reasons:
– Our revenue (non-IFRS), expense (non-IFRS), and profit
(non-IFRS) measures as well as the measures “new cloud
bookings” and “cloud backlog” (see above) provide investors
with insight into management’s decision making because
management uses these measures to run our business and
make financial, strategic, and operating decisions. We include
the revenue adjustments outlined above and exclude the
expense adjustments outlined above when making decisions
to allocate resources. In addition, we use these non-IFRS
measures to facilitate comparisons of SAP’s operating
performance from period to period.
– The non-IFRS measures provide investors with additional
information that enables a comparison of year-over-year
operating performance by eliminating certain direct effects of
acquisitions, share-based compensation plans, and
restructuring plans.
– Non-IFRS and non-GAAP measures are widely used in the
software industry. In many cases, inclusion of our non-IFRS
measures may facilitate comparison with our competitors’
corresponding non-IFRS and non-GAAP measures.

Limitations of Non-IFRS Measures
We believe that our non-IFRS financial measures described
above have limitations, including but not limited to, the
following:

Combined Management Report | Performance Management System

– The eliminated amounts could be material to us.
– Without being analyzed in conjunction with the
corresponding IFRS measures, the non-IFRS measures are
not indicative of our present and future performance,
foremost for the following reasons:
 While our profit (non-IFRS) numbers reflect the
elimination of certain acquisition-related expenses, no
eliminations are made for the additional revenue or other
income that results from the acquisitions.
 While we adjust for the fair value accounting of the
acquired entities’ recurring revenue contracts, we do not
adjust for the fair value accounting of deferred
compensation items that result from commissions paid to
the acquired company’s sales force and third parties for
closing the respective customer contracts.
 The acquisition-related amortization expense that we
eliminate in deriving our profit (non-IFRS) numbers is a
recurring expense that will impact our financial
performance in future years.
 The remaining acquisition-related charges that we
eliminate in deriving our profit (non-IFRS) numbers are
likely to recur should SAP enter into material business
combinations in the future. Similarly, the restructuring
expenses that we eliminate in deriving our profit (nonIFRS) numbers are likely to recur should SAP perform
restructurings in the future.
 The revenue adjustment for the fair value accounting of
the acquired entities’ contracts and the expense
adjustment for acquisition-related charges do not arise
from a common conceptual basis. This is because the
revenue adjustment aims to improve the comparability of
the initial post-acquisition period with future postacquisition periods, while the expense adjustment aims to
improve the comparability between post-acquisition
periods and pre-acquisition periods. This should
particularly be considered when evaluating our operating
profit (non-IFRS) and operating margin (non-IFRS)
numbers as these combine our revenue (non-IFRS) and
expenses (non-IFRS) despite the absence of a common
conceptual basis.
 Our restructuring charges resulted in significant cash
outflows in the past and could do so in the future. The
same applies to our share-based payment expense
because most of our share-based payments are settled in
cash rather than shares.
 The valuation of our cash-settled share-based payments
could vary significantly from period to period due to the
fluctuation of our share price and other parameters used
in the valuation of these plans.
 In the past, we have issued share-based payment awards
to our employees every year and we intend to continue
doing so in the future. Thus, our share-based payment
expenses are recurring although the amounts usually
change from period to period.

We believe that constant currency measures have limitations,
particularly as the currency effects that are eliminated
constitute a significant element of our revenue and expenses
and could materially impact our performance. Therefore, we
limit our use of constant currency measures to the analysis of
changes in volume as one element of the full change in a
financial measure. We do not evaluate our results and
performance without considering both constant currency and
nominal measures in revenue (non-IFRS) and operating profit
(non-IFRS) measures on the one hand, and changes in revenue,
operating expenses, operating profit, or other measures of
financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS on the
other. We caution the readers of our financial reports to follow a
similar approach by considering nominal and constant currency
non-IFRS measures only in addition to, and not as a substitute
for or superior to, changes in revenue, operating expenses,
operating profit, or other measures of financial performance
prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Despite these limitations, we believe that the presentation of our
non-IFRS measures and the corresponding IFRS measures,
together with the relevant reconciliations, provide useful
information to management and investors regarding present
and future business trends relating to our financial condition and
results of operations.

We believe that by providing an environment where our people
can engage, develop their skills, and draw on the support they
need to create and innovate, SAP can help to make the world run
better. For this reason, we are fully committed to nurturing our
people at every stage of their career at SAP.

An HR Strategy Designed Specifically for
Our People
Our human resources (HR) strategy uses cloud technology to
help us Run Simple. It helps us change the way we hire new
talent, and to transform the way we develop and retain our
employees. At the same time, it allows us to create a culture at
SAP that is able to deal with the complexity, speed, and scope of
a digital workplace. This culture inspires innovation, leads
change, and ultimately creates employee satisfaction. Our HR
team stays focused on delivering a seamless, simple employee
experience by following three guiding principles: customer
satisfaction, simplification, and standardization.

Listening to Our Employees
The People Survey 2016 results are extraordinarily positive.
Employee satisfaction went up in nearly all aspects and
questionnaire topics. This especially holds true for one of our
most important dimensions, the Employee Engagement Index

Ensuring that our employees are highly engaged remains one of
our company-wide strategic goals. For 2017 through to 2020,
we aim to reach an Employee Engagement Index between 84%
and 86%.
A change by one percentage point of the EEI would have an
impact of €45 million to €55 million on SAP’s operating profit.
For more information on how we calculate this impact, see the
Connectivity of Financial and Non-Financial Indicators section of
the SAP Integrated Report online.

Combined Management Report | Employees and Social Investments

The People Survey 2015 results revealed two focus areas for
2016: simplification and innovation. In 2016, we started a
company-wide “Run Simple at SAP” initiative to help the
business improve processes and services, as well as numerous
efforts to boost and promote innovation initiatives. Conducted
from October to November, our People Survey 2016 revealed
moderate improvements in both simplification and innovation.
We will continue with simplification and innovation as our
company-wide focus areas in 2017.
In the second half of 2016, we also conducted a strategy dialog
survey to assess the degree to which employees understand
and believe in our strategy, our culture, and our leadership, as
well as the capability to drive innovation. This survey revealed
that while we already have the right innovation mindset, many of
the internal innovation tools available are not yet widely known
within the company.
In addition, we also measure our Business Health Culture Index
(BHCI) based on our People Survey. The BHCI assesses the
degree to which our workplace culture supports people’s wellbeing, work-life balance, and organizational health.
In 2016, the positive trend of the BHCI continued with a score of
78% compared to 75% in 2015. This encouraging result shows
that a health-focused culture has impacted employees in a
positive way.

At the same time, continued recognition of SAP as an employer
of choice contributed to our success in meeting our hiring
targets in 2016. SAP won many awards across the globe in the
areas of diversity, inclusion, employer attractiveness, and
people satisfaction. For a comprehensive list of awards given to
SAP in 2016, see the Recognition section of the SAP Integrated
Report online.

Collaborating with Educational Institutions
Our collaboration with educational institutions is key to
recruiting early talent. SAP works closely with over 3,100
universities on international events such as student meet-ups
and info days. In addition, we run a number of coding events
such as SAP InnoJam, as well as a broad variety of activities and
events through our SAP University Alliances program.
SAP also runs a vocational training program that allows students
to work towards their university degree while gaining valuable
business experience at the same time. As of the end of 2016,
more than 1,000 vocational training students were enrolled in
the program. Overall, we measured a conversion rate (number
of these types of students who stayed with SAP after completing
their dual studies) for vocational training students of 82% in
2016.

As a company with employees of approximately 80 different
nationalities working in Germany alone, we are open to talented
people from all communities. As part of our “Engaging with
Refugees” program, we are working on a number of initiatives
that promote cultural integration through training and
recruitment. For example, SAP joined Germany’s “Wir
zusammen” (“We together”) initiative, which provides an
Internet platform to support the efforts of participating
companies to integrate refugees into the German labor market.
In 2016, SAP offered 100 internships and 14 vocational training
positions to refugees in Germany. In 2017, SAP will again offer
up to 100 additional internships and 10 vocational training
positions to candidates who are refugees.
In addition, 2016 saw the launch of Refugee Code Week,
empowering young people and inspiring refugee communities
with job-relevant coding skills. In collaboration with the United
Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the event introduced more
than 10,000 refugees and nationals in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon,

securing job placements.

mentoring, rotational programs, and on-the-job-guided
development experiences. This is why we are transitioning to a
continuous learning model with a strong focus on more informal
learning activities.

Investing in Talent Development
At SAP, we believe that everyone is a talent and we invest in the
professional development of all our employees. We continue to
build development offerings for specific groups such as early
talents, experts, and fast-track employees. To provide career
development support, we also introduced career counselling
sessions that are delivered either in person or virtually.
In addition, we launched SAP Talk to 8,100 early-adopter
employees in 2016. This approach provides a new, state-of-theart way of managing performance at SAP, helping foster a
continuous dialog on professional development between
managers and employees. We plan to roll out SAP Talk to all
SAP employees in 2017.
Our overall retention rate in 2016 was 93.7% compared with
91.8% in 2015. We define retention as the ratio of the average
number of employees minus voluntary attrition to the average
number of employees (in full-time equivalents, or FTEs). High
retention is something we are aiming for as reflected in all our
activities to drive high employee engagement.

Self-paced online programs that include language learning as
well as technical and soft-skills training courses are open to all
employees. In addition, the online programs enable employees
to build impactful development plans that meet their career
goals. Our innovative peer-to-peer learning portfolio includes
coaching, mentoring, job shadowing, and facilitation
opportunities. In 2016, we hosted many live and virtual “learning
culture” workshops throughout the world, as an opportunity to
foster the exchange of ideas between peers and managers.

Creating an Environment That Drives
Innovation, Performance, and
Engagement
SAP aims to create a working environment that helps drive
innovation, high performance, and employee satisfaction. We do
so by providing, among others, the following benefits and
activities:

Engaging Our People Through
Impactful and Inspirational
Leadership
Our investment in developing our leaders is delivering results
according to our People Survey. Living up to our SAP leadership
principles and building trust with employees has become a key
ingredient of successful leadership performance. By the end of
2016, 57.6% of leaders at SAP completed our flagship
leadership development program. Leaders who completed this
had higher employee engagement and leadership trust scores.
In 2016, leadership trust reached 57% (2015: 52%) and we are
committed to keep this high score moving forward.
Our Leadership Principles:
– Drive Simplicity
– Develop Amazing Talent
– Ensure Customer Success

Making Learning a Compelling
Experience for Everyone
We support employees at all levels and roles as they strive to
achieve their long-term career aspirations. Our learning strategy
is based on the principle that much of employee learning and
development happens outside formal training such as coaching,

76

To achieve this, we make high-quality learning opportunities
easily accessible to all employees through our cloud-based
learning management system (SAP SuccessFactors solution). In
2016, we provisioned 1.3 million courses to 90.7% of our
employees. We also initiated a new tuition assistance program
to help employees as they pursue additional educational and
professional certification opportunities.

– SAP Shares program: Introduced in 2016, this equity
program consists of two different plans, ensuring closer
market alignment. The “Own SAP” plan enables employees to
purchase shares with preferred conditions and build value by
becoming an SAP shareholder. The “Move SAP” plan is a
restricted stock unit plan that rewards selected employees
and executives for their contribution to the success of the
company. For more information, see the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements section, Note (27).
– Hasso Plattner Founders’ Award: In its third year, this
prestigious award provides the highest internal employee
recognition at SAP for delivering on our vision and strategy. In
2016, the award went to the “Skills for Africa” initiative, which
helps fill the skills gap in the IT sector in Africa.
– Intrapreneurship program: Open to all global employees,
this program attracted more than 830 entries from over
1,500 employees in 2016. It enables employees to act as
entrepreneurs and transform innovative ideas into profitable
businesses in new markets.
– SAP SuccessFactors solutions: To make our employees’
lives easier when dealing with HR matters, we continue to
transform and simplify our entire HR IT landscape by
implementing SAP SuccessFactors solutions. In this context,
approximately 160 HR experts supported sales teams in

Combined Management Report | Employees and Social Investments

deals related to our own human capital management
solutions. Also in 2016, we announced the Klaus Tschira
Human Resources Innovation Award, an annual program for
SAP partners and customers that have contributed a unique
and innovative solution in the field of human resources.
– People Weeks: In 2016, SAP again sponsored a two-week
event designed for employees to exchange ideas and
cultivate a greater connection across cultures, genders, and
generations. Under the motto “You in the Digital Workplace,”
the event reached over 27,000 employees in 124 locations
and 58 countries.
– “How We Run”: Launched in 2015 to showcase the
behavioral values that provide the foundation to SAP’s
corporate culture, our “How We Run” behaviors initiative has
received widespread support and adoption among SAP
employees worldwide.

Women’s Network, and the Women@SAP online community. In
addition, we offer executive sponsorships for women at SAP and
the Leadership Excellence Acceleration Program (LEAP), a
highly respected and award-winning development program that
helps prepare high-potential women for leadership roles at SAP.

Our “How We Run” Behaviors

In addition, we participate in a wide range of activities to create a
more inclusive environment throughout the organization,
including:

Promoting Inclusion, Well-Being, and
Social Innovation
An inclusive, bias-free culture inspires greater innovation and
helps us to better connect with and serve our customers. It also
fosters employee engagement, and makes SAP a more
attractive workplace.

Closing the Gender Gap
As the first multinational technology company, SAP was
awarded the Economic Dividends for Gender Equality (EDGE)
certificate in 2016. It recognizes our global commitment to
gender diversity and equality in the workplace and reinforces
SAP’s publicly stated goal to fill 25% of its management
positions with women by the end of 2017. We have made great
strides toward our goal, increasing the proportion of female
managers from 23.6% in 2015 to 24.5% in 2016.
Throughout 2016, SAP sponsored and hosted numerous events
focused on attracting, developing, and supporting women.
These included major events in China, Colombia, Germany,
Saudi Arabia, the United States and other countries. Additional
ongoing initiatives supporting women at SAP include the
Women’s Professional Growth Webinar series, the Business

Creating an Inclusive Environment
Working closely with ethnicity-based employee network groups
such as the Black Employee Network (BEN), and Latinos@SAP,
SAP launched several important initiatives in 2016 in the United
States. An example is Project Propel, a program designed to
enable U.S. educational institutions that have historically served
minorities to build the next generation of technology talent. The
program focuses on providing students with critical digital
enterprise skills that are in demand in the SAP ecosystem.

– Focus on Insight – Diversity and Inclusion curriculum: A
global learning curriculum launched for all employees in
September 2016 to ensure that everyone at SAP understands
the importance and benefits of a diverse workplace.
– Business Beyond Bias: Launched in August 2016, this
initiative includes significant investment in programs and
technology that support greater diversity. This helps
eliminate bias not only at SAP but also in customer and
partner organizations.
– White House Tech Inclusion Pledge: SAP is one of the
largest global technology companies to participate in this
pledge, announced during former President Obama’s Global
Entrepreneurship Innovation Summit 2016 in Silicon Valley.
– Autism at Work program: 107 employees with Autism
Spectrum Disorder currently work at SAP. Launched in
Argentina this year, we have implemented the Autism at
Work program in nine countries.
– Global Pride@SAP employee network: This network has
grown to more than 8,000 members, sponsoring numerous
activities and initiatives that support lesbian, gay, bisexual,
and transgender (LGBT) people and their allies.

Caring for the Health and Well-Being
of Our Employees
We believe that the way we care for our people is closely linked
to our business success. When people feel healthy, respected,
and cared for, it results in higher productivity, engagement,
innovation, and customer satisfaction.
A caring culture enables our employees to live to their full
potential and accelerates our ability to achieve our goals.
Consequently, we invest in extensive employee benefits,
programs, and services that truly make people’s lives better.
These include:

Engaging in Social Investments
As our vision to help the world run better and improve people’s
lives shows, we are passionate about making a positive impact
on people’s lives, both in our communities and in the wider
world. As SAP guides our customers through digital
transformation, our social investments focus on ensuring that
today’s young people – regardless of background – get the skills
they need to thrive and lead in this digital economy.
Our strategy is based on two main focus areas. We aim to
increase the capacity of innovative social enterprises that put
young people on the path to successful careers. In addition, we
aim to build a skilled workforce for the IT sector through training
and workforce development programs. In 2016, we donated
€22.3 million to charitable organizations.

Improving Lives, Sharing Experience
As part of our social investment commitment, SAP encourages
its employees to contribute their time and talent to support
social causes. Whether by offering individual hands-on support,
or business coaching and mentoring, we run a number of
initiatives that help make a real difference to people’s lives in the
communities in which they live and work.
An annual highlight is our “Month of Service” program. This
year, more than 22,000 employees in 42 countries volunteered
almost 142,000 hours to this program alone. While passing on
valuable skills and helping the world to run better, employees
taking part in these programs benefit from what can be an
incredibly rewarding experience. In addition to making a positive
social impact, they develop leadership skills, learn about new
markets, and grow their professional network.

Extending Code Week Initiatives
In 2016, SAP extended our successful Code Week initiatives to
bring digital literacy to thousands of young people who may not
otherwise have the opportunities to learn software coding skills.
Now in its second year, Africa Code Week saw thousands of
coding activities organized across 30 African countries and
through openSAP coursework. Africa Code Week demonstrates
the power of public-private partnerships: Hundreds of schools,
teachers, ministers, community centers, businesses, and nonprofit organizations work together towards the common goal of
ensuring Africa’s children are not left out of the digital economy.
In 2016, the program reached 426,000 children in Africa.

Supporting Our Social Sabbatical Portfolio
With four unique programs across the award-winning social
sabbatical portfolio, we offer employees at all levels the
opportunity to extend their skills, expertise, and know-how.
Participation in the program challenges employees to solve
concrete business challenges for non-profit organizations and
social enterprises in either their home or emerging markets.
By volunteering their time and talent for assignments that last
between two and six weeks, our employees strengthen their
leadership competencies, cross-industry know-how, and
intercultural sensitivity. They achieve all this while ensuring their
“client” is better able to deliver on their social mission.
Recent projects include building strategic plans for social
entrepreneurship incubators and strengthening the internal
capabilities of non-profit organizations focused on STEM
education and digital literacy. As such, we worked with the
Dreamoval Foundation in Accra, Ghana, to support the
development of a growth strategy to strengthen the IT skills of
170,000 teachers to help improve educational outcomes across
the country.
In 2016, we also extended our social sabbatical portfolio to joint
projects with SAP customers. In July, a joint team of volunteers
from SAP and GlaxoSmithKline plc designed and implemented
an integrated database for Partners in Health, a non-profit
organization based in Kigali, Rwanda. Additional social
sabbatical collaboration with customers is planned for 2017.
Through our social sabbatical portfolio, 213 SAP employees
provided 58,808 hours of pro bono service to 71 organizations in
15 countries in 2016.

Changing the Game for Underprivileged
Youths with the KickApp Cup
To ignite passion for IT, we need to be creative about how to
reach young people. We developed a creative approach,
harnessing the power of soccer to bring people together while
spreading a passion for IT.

Combined Management Report | Employees and Social Investments

The first annual KickApp Cup brought together 200 young
community leaders from disadvantaged backgrounds to work
closely with 180 SAP developers and coaches. Their aim: to
develop a prototype app that would help non-profit
organizations tackle issues such as monitoring attendance or
tracking social impact.
Regional competitions took place at SAP Labs locations
worldwide including Brazil, Germany, Hungary, India, Israel, and
the United States. The teams coded together, played soccer and
had fun, while competing to attend the finals in Lyon, France,
and Heidelberg, Germany, to present their app prototypes.
The event was organized in collaboration with
streetfootballworld, a non-governmental organization (NGO)
whose mission is to use soccer as a tool to drive social change.
The best ideas from each team were then combined to create a
final app that was presented during the 16th streetfootballworld
Festival at the European soccer championships (UEFA EURO
2016).

Gaining International Recognition for
Award-Winning Programs
SAP received significant recognition in 2016 for the innovative
nature of its social investment programs. For more information,
see the Recognition section of the SAP Integrated Report online.

Headcount and Personnel Expense
On December 31, 2016, we had 84,183 full-time equivalent (FTE)
employees worldwide (December 31, 2015: 76,986). This
represents an increase in headcount of 7,197 FTEs in
comparison to 2015. The average number of employees in 2016
was 80,609 (2015: 75,180).
We define headcount in FTE as the number of people on
permanent employment contract considering their staffing
percentage. Students, individuals employed by SAP who are
currently not working due to various reasons (such as maternity
leave), and temporary employees with limited contracts of less
than six months are excluded from our figures. The number of
temporary employees is not material.
Our personnel expense per employee decreased to
approximately €127,000 in 2016 (2015: approximately
€135,000). This decrease in expense is primarily attributable to
a significant decrease of employee-related restructuring
expenses in 2016 compared to the previous year. The personnel
expense per employee is defined as the overall personnel
expense divided by the average number of employees. For more
information about employee compensation and a detailed
overview of the number of people we employ, see the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements section, Note (7).

Being a Front-Runner of a Greener
Way of Working
As a role model for sustainable business operations, SAP takes
its environmental responsibilities seriously. We believe that by
running cleaner, greener operations, we can make a difference
to our planet. In addition, we aim to enable our customers to
reduce their overall carbon footprint through our software.
One of our goals is to reduce net greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions from our operations to levels of the year 2000 by
2020. This target includes all direct emissions from running our
business as well as a selected subset of indirect emissions from
supply chains and services.
A number of initiatives harness innovative technologies to help
us run our operations in a way that minimizes our impact on the
environment. In addition, our investment in renewable electricity
certificates and carbon credits enables us to support
sustainability projects across the globe.

Total Net Emissions

renewable electricity

In addition to our long-term commitment for 2020, we have
derived annual targets for our internal operational steering. In
2016, we outperformed our annual target to reduce our
emissions to less than 400 kilotons (kt) of CO2. This result
stems primarily from updating our emission factors as well as
compensation with carbon emission offsets. Our focus on
carbon emissions has contributed to a cumulative cost
avoidance of €155 million in the past three years, compared to a
business-as-usual scenario based on 2007. We avoided €73.6
million of this cost in 2016.

Committing to 100% Renewable
Electricity
Our commitment to 100% renewable electricity is crucial to
making our operations more sustainable. While SAP produces a
small amount of renewable electricity through solar panels in
some locations, we rely primarily on the purchase of renewable
energy certificates (RECs) to achieve our target of 100%
renewable electricity. We follow robust procurement guidelines
for RECs to ensure that we only invest in environmentally
friendly schemes.

Strengthening Our “Green Cloud”
As more business moves to the cloud, data centers are a key
part of how SAP provides solutions to our customers. By using
our green cloud services, customers can significantly reduce
their carbon footprint. However, data centers represent a
significant part of our total GHG with energy consumption
increasing as a growing number of customers sign up to our
cloud services. For this reason, our data centers have become a
primary focus of our carbon reduction efforts. We have
introduced initiatives to drive efficiency and innovation around
buildings, data center operations, and infrastructure. For
example, in 2016, one of our main data centers in Rot, Germany,
had a very efficient power usage effectiveness (PUE) of 1.35. In
addition, we have tied our business strategy to our
environmental strategy by creating a completely “green cloud”
powered by 100% renewable electricity at SAP. Carbon
neutrality is achieved by purchasing renewable electricity
certificates and carbon emission offsets.

Helping Our Customers Run Greener
Operations
The vast majority of our overall emissions result from the use of
our software. When our customers run SAP software on their
hardware and on their premises, the resulting carbon footprint is
about 20 times the size of our own net carbon footprint. To
address this, we have developed a downstream emissions
strategy to help our customers, hardware providers, and others
run greener operations. One of the most important ways we help
our customers reduce their energy usage and emissions is by
managing their SAP systems through cloud services provided by
our carbon-neutral green cloud offerings. In addition, the
solutions in our portfolio help enable our customers manage
their resources, such as electricity, in an efficient manner.

82

The SAP HANA platform also plays a vital role in helping our
customers to cut their carbon emissions. By combining the
worlds of analytic and transactional data into one real-time, inmemory platform, it can help create much leaner operations,
further simplifying the system landscape and reducing energy
consumption.
SAP also works with customers to optimize their on-premise
landscapes so that they consume less energy. We achieve this
by helping them to decommission legacy systems, archive
unused data, and consolidate business applications, as well as
virtualizing their system landscape.

Driving Environmental Initiatives
Throughout SAP
We continuously pursue strategies to help us achieve our goal of
reducing emissions at a time of ongoing growth in our business.
Key initiatives for 2016 included the following:
– Sustainable programming sessions
In a new online training module, software developers and
architects learn how to make a positive contribution to SAP’s
sustainability goals in their daily programming work.
Performance and sustainability go hand in hand as
performance-optimized programming usually equates to
energy-efficient programming. It also helps improve end-toend response time and creates a great user experience for
our customers.
– Electric vehicles
As a result of our business expansion, the number of SAP
employees eligible for a company car has increased annually.
We want to ensure that the resulting growth in our car fleet
does not undo our successes in cutting emissions. To help
address this, SAP aims to increase the number of electric
vehicles in our company car fleet to 20% by 2020.
All electric company cars charged at SAP are powered with
100% renewable electricity. In addition, in Germany, we
provide employees with an incentive to switch to electric
alternatives by offering a battery subsidy that offsets the
costs of purchasing an electric vehicle.
– Internal carbon pricing for business flights
As first introduced in 2015, we continue with our program to
reduce the impact of air travel by SAP employees. In addition
to avoiding business flights, we invest in carbon emission
offsets for air travel in nine countries by charging an internal
carbon price. This offset effort resulted in a compensation of
90 kt in 2016.
– Investment in carbon credits
In 2016, we continued to realize the benefits of our
investment in the Livelihoods Fund, a unique investment fund
whose returns consist of high-quality carbon credits. Several
years ago, we made a commitment to invest €3 million
covering a 20-year participation in the fund that supports the
sustainability of agricultural and rural communities
worldwide. Livelihoods Funds have been designated the “Best

Combined Management Report | Energy and Emissions

Corporate Offsetting Program 2016” in voluntary carbon
markets by the Environmental Finance magazine. In 2016, we
received carbon credits from the fund, which helped us to
offset our carbon footprint by 21 kt.

at only a very modest pace, the ECB notes. In China, meanwhile,
economic growth continued to slow in 2016 but, according to
the ECB, eventually stabilized in the second half-year, supported
by strong consumption and infrastructure spending.

Global Economic Trends
In its latest economic bulletin, the European Central Bank (ECB)
concludes that the global economy grew steadily in 2016 at a
similar pace as the year before, with relatively stable expansion
in advanced economies and a slight improvement in emerging
market economies. According to the ECB, acute uncertainty
about the political and economic impact of the presidential
election in the United States shaped global sentiment at the end
of the year.
For the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region, the ECB
reports that economic recovery in the euro area continued
throughout 2016, supported by the ECB’s own monetary policy
measures which it finds helped revitalize domestic demand in
the euro area and reduce debt. According to its calculations, the
real gross domestic product of the euro area countries grew
1.7% in 2016. The economies of many of the Central and Eastern
Europe countries also performed well in 2016, the ECB writes.
There were even signs of an economic rebound in Russia, but
expansion there stayed slightly negative for the year as a whole.
In the North America and Latin America (Americas) region,
continued low interest rate policies and improving labor markets
stimulated the U.S. economy in 2016, the ECB reports, with
economic activity in the United States improving markedly in the
second half of 2016, following modest growth in the first half. In
Brazil, the recession is believed to have slowly bottomed out in
the second half of the year.
In the Asia Pacific Japan (APJ) region, soft foreign demand and
weak private consumption caused Japan's economy to advance

The IT Market
According to Gartner Market Databook December 2016 by
Gartner, a market research firm, “worldwide IT spending is
forecast to grow 0.5% in 2016 on a constant-currency basis.
However, currency rate changes will limit market growth to
negative 0.6%. Software is the best-performing segment, with
6.9% growth in 2016 constant currency, while Emerging
Asia/Pacific is the fastest-growing region/country, at 2.9%.”
In the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region, growth
declined year-over-year in the Western European IT market from
3.6% to –0.1% and the Eastern European IT market declined
from 15.8% to 1.8% (see table in paragraph “Expected
Developments and Opportunities”: “Trends in the IT Market – IT
spending Year-on-Year”, created by SAP on the basis of Gartner
Market Databook, 4Q16 Update, 21 December 2016). According
to the same table, software spending grew significantly faster
than all other submarkets throughout the region.
The Americas region likewise recorded lower growth rates in IT
spending than the previous year as can be seen in the table
mentioned above. According to the same table, software
spending nevertheless significantly outperformed IT spending
as a whole.
In the Asia Pacific Japan (APJ) region, software spending grew
faster than all other submarkets in the IT industry as well,
documented in the table mentioned above.

Impact on SAP
In 2016, we once again succeeded in significantly expanding our
business and outperformed the overall global economy and IT
industry in 2016 with regards to revenue growth. Our good 2016
results are further evidence that our strategy of innovating
across the core, the cloud, and business networks to help our
customers become true digital enterprises is the right way
forward.

Performance Against Our Outlook for
2016 (Non-IFRS)

Overall Financial Position

Our 2016 operating profit-related internal management goals
and published outlook were based on our non-IFRS financial
measures. For this reason, in the following section we discuss
performance against our outlook only in terms of non-IFRS
numbers derived from IFRS measures. The subsequent section
about IFRS operating results discusses numbers only in terms of
the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), so the
numbers in that section are not expressly identified as IFRS
numbers.

Executive Board’s Assessment

Outlook for 2016 (Non-IFRS)

In 2016, we delivered strong software sales, fast cloud growth,
and operating profit expansion. We saw exceptional growth in
our cloud and software business and reached above the
midpoint of the full year outlook which we raised in October.
SAP’s rapidly expanding cloud business combined with solid
growth in support revenue continued to drive the share of more
predictable revenue.

At the beginning of 2016, we projected that our 2016 non-IFRS
cloud subscriptions and support revenue would be between
€2.95 billion and €3.05 billion at constant currencies (2015:
€2.30 billion). We expected full-year 2016 non-IFRS cloud and
software revenue to increase by 6% to 8% at constant
currencies (2015: €17.23 billion). We also expected our full-year
operating profit (non-IFRS) for 2016 to end between €6.4 billion
and €6.7 billion (2015: €6.35 billion) at constant currencies. We
anticipated an effective tax rate (IFRS) of between 22.5% and
23.5% (2015: 23.4%) and an effective tax rate (non-IFRS) of
between 24.5% and 25.5% (2015: 26.1%).

In 2016, we again demonstrated that we are consistently
pursuing our strategy for innovation and growth – and that
globally, we are able to generate growth that few other IT
companies can match – in three respects: in revenue from core
business and cloud business, and in operating profit.

The strong cloud growth was driven throughout our broad cloud
portfolio. Mainly due to our strong top line result, we generated
an operating profit which was at the midpoint of our raised
guidance range.
We made substantial progress in transforming our Company by
shifting investments from non-core activities to strategic growth
areas, enabling us to capture the tremendous growth
opportunities in the market. We expanded our addressable
market, acquired best in class assets, and innovated a new
generation of ERP with SAP S/4HANA. Our strong cloud backlog
and the high software support renewal rates combined with our
robust pipeline positions us for yet another year of growth in
2017 and allowed us to confidently raise our high-level 2020
ambition.

In July 2016, we adjusted our outlook for the effective tax rate
(IFRS) to between 27.0% and 28.0% and for the effective tax
rate (non-IFRS) to between 28.0% and 29.0%. The increase in
comparison to the previous outlook mainly resulted from tax
effects relating to changes in foreign currency exchange rates in
Venezuela and the fact that the execution of the originally
planned consolidation of intellectual property rights held by SAP
Group company hybris AG at the level of SAP SE in Germany
could no longer be achieved at this point of time.
In October, based on the strong momentum in our cloud
business, we raised our outlook for 2016 non-IFRS cloud
subscriptions and support revenue to a range of €3.00 billion to
€3.05 billion at constant currencies. The upper end of this range
represents a growth rate of 33% at constant currencies. Thanks
to continued growth in our software license business, we were
also able to increase our growth outlook for full-year 2016 non-

Combined Management Report | Financial Performance: Review and Analysis

85

IFRS cloud and software revenue to 6.5% to 8.5% at constant
currencies. In view of the greater revenues expected, we also
adjusted our outlook for full-year operating profit (non-IFRS) for
2016 upward to range between €6.5 billion and €6.7 billion at
constant currencies.

Cloud subscriptions and support revenue (non-IFRS, at
constant currencies)

Despite ongoing economic uncertainty throughout 2016,
especially in Latin America, coupled with fears about the
possible effects of the Brexit vote and the presidential election in
the United States, our new and existing customers continued to
show a strong willingness to invest in our solutions.
On a constant currency basis, non-IFRS cloud subscriptions and
support revenue grew from €2.30 billion in 2015 to €3.01 billion
in 2016. That represents an increase of 31% on a constant
currency basis. We thus achieved our refined outlook range of
€3.00 billion to €3.05 billion that we predicted in October.
Our new cloud bookings, which is the main measure for our
cloud-related sales success and for future cloud subscriptions
revenue, increased 31% in 2016 to €1.15 billion (2015: €874
million). In addition to this strong growth, our cloud backlog
(unbilled future revenue based on existing customer contracts)
climbed by 47% to €5.4 billion (2015: €3.7 billion). This reflects
the unbilled committed future cloud subscriptions and support
revenue that will drive strong cloud growth in 2017 and beyond.
Besides the cloud business, our traditional on-premise business
also showed a remarkable growth in 2016. Cloud and software
revenue (non-IFRS) was €18.43 billion (2015: €17.23 billion). On
a constant currency basis, the increase was 8% and therefore
well above the midpoint of the increased outlook.
Our total revenue (non-IFRS) rose 6% in 2016 to €22.07 billion
(2015: €20.81 billion). On a constant currency basis, the
increase was 7%.

86

Operating expenses (non-IFRS) in 2016 were €15.43 billion
(2015: €14.46 billion), an increase of 7%. On a constant
currency basis, the increase was 8%.
Our expense base in 2016 continued to be impacted by the
transformation to a fast-growing cloud business. In our outlook
we expected the cloud subscriptions and support gross margin
to be at least stable or to slightly increase compared to 2015.
The cloud subscriptions gross margin for 2016 was 64.4%, a
decrease of 1.2pp on a constant currency basis and with that
below our expectations. The decrease is primarily due to the
change in the cloud subscription revenue mix; the share of our
infrastructure-as-a-service cloud offering (IaaS) that has a lower
margin than the other cloud offerings, grew at above-average
rates and thus impacted the overall gross margin. The cloud
subscriptions gross margins of our cloud offerings developed
heterogeneously in 2016:
Our cloud subscriptions gross margin (non-IFRS) in our
business network business increased by 1% and resulted in
approximately 76% for 2016, already close to our long-term
ambition of approximately 80%. This excellent result is
attributable to the continued positive gross margin development
within the Concur and SAP Ariba portfolios.
The cloud subscriptions gross margin (non-IFRS) of our
infrastructure-as-a-service cloud offering (IaaS) performed much
better in 2016 than in 2015. In 2016 our cloud subscription gross
margin is -5% which reflects an improvement of more than
104pp on a constant currency basis. In the last two quarters
break-even was already reached, we are therefore in line with
our expectations. Profitability in our software-as-aservice/platform-as-a-service cloud offering (Saas/PaaS) was

Combined Management Report | Financial Performance: Review and Analysis

approximately 62% for 2016 compared to our long-term
ambition of approximately 80%. Affected by the incremental
investments in our cloud infrastructure, cloud profitability fell by
8pp on a constant currency basis, mainly due to significant
investments in the expansion of our data center and IT
infrastructure as well as in the harmonization of our various
public cloud offerings into one platform.
Efficiency improvements in both our cloud and traditional onpremise business drove continued operating profit expansion.
Non-IFRS operating profit in 2016 was €6.61 billion on a
constant currency basis, reflecting an increase of 4%. As a
result, we were able to surpass our excellent results from 2015,
despite our continued investment in our business
transformation during the reporting year. The positive
development of our operating profit was influenced by the
effects of our global transformation program carried out in 2015
as well as by the cost-conscious hiring of highly educated young
talents in our fast growth areas and locations that enabled us to
increase our overall headcount by 7,197 full-time equivalents in
2016. With these additional resources, we continued to invest in
our innovation and growth markets. Thus, constant currency
non-IFRS operating profit amounting to €6.61 billion was at the
midpoint of our raised outlook range (€6.5 billion to €6.7
billion).
We achieved an effective tax rate (IFRS) of 25.3% and an
effective tax rate (non-IFRS) of 26.8%, which is below the
adjusted outlook of 27.0% to 28.0% (IFRS) and 28.0% to 29.0%
(non-IFRS). This mainly results from taxes for prior years and
from the regional allocation of income.

This increase reflects a 7% increase from changes in volumes
and prices and a 1% decrease from currency effects. The growth
in revenue resulted primarily from a €707 million increase in
cloud subscriptions and support revenue. Furthermore,
software support revenue rose €478 million. This growth is a
result of continuously high software license revenue, which
increased €25 million in 2016. Cloud and software revenue
climbed to €18,424 million in 2016, an increase of 7%. Cloud and
software revenue represented 84% of total revenue in 2016
(2015: 83%). Service revenue increased 2% from €3,579 million
in 2015 to €3,638 million, which was 16% of total revenue, in

Cloud and Software Revenue
Software licenses revenue results from the fees earned from
selling or licensing software to customers. Revenue from cloud
subscriptions and support refers to the income earned from
contracts that permit the customer to access specific software
solutions hosted by SAP during the term of its contract with

than €5 million (2015: 27%), while 38% resulted from deals
worth less than €1 million (2015: 40%).
Our stable customer base, continued investment in new
software licenses by customers throughout 2016 and the
previous year, and the continued interest in our support
offerings resulted in an increase in software support revenue
from €10,093 million in 2015 to €10,571 million in 2016. The SAP
Enterprise Support offering was the largest contributor to our
software support revenue. The €478 million, or 5%, growth in
software support revenue reflects a 6% increase from new
support business and a 1% decrease from currency effects. This
growth is primarily attributable to SAP Product Support for
Large Enterprises and SAP Enterprise Support. The acceptance
rate for SAP Enterprise Support among new customers reached
100% in 2016 (2015: 99%).
Software licenses and software support revenue rose €503
million, or 3%, from €14,928 million in 2015 to €15,431 million in
2016. This increase reflects a 4% increase from changes in
volumes and prices and a 1% decrease from currency effects.
We define predictable revenue as the sum of our software
support revenue and our cloud subscriptions and support
revenue. Compared to the previous year, our predictable
revenue increased 10%, from €12,379 million to €13,564 million
in 2016. Predictable revenue accounted for 61% of our total
revenue in 2016 (2015: 60%).

The record revenue generated and significantly lower
restructuring costs had a positive impact on our operating

activities around the world, and in research and development
also affected the results in 2016. The increased operating profit

Main impact on costs was an additional €291 million year-overyear to extend our cloud business in response to the sustained
strength of customer demand, with an associated increase in
the expense of delivering and operating cloud applications.
These investments contributed to revenue growth. Our margin
on cloud subscriptions and support increased 0.8pp to 56.1%

primarily through strong growth in revenue. The investments in

The increased operating expenses largely represent

As an overall result of these effects on operating profit, our
operating margin widened 2.8pp to 23.3% in 2016 (2015:
20.5%).
Changes to the individual elements in our cost of revenue were
as follows:

Cost of Cloud and Software
Cost of cloud and software consists primarily of customer
support costs, cost of developing custom solutions that address
customers’ specific business requirements, costs for deploying
and operating cloud solutions, amortization expenses relating to
intangibles, and license fees and commissions paid to third

Cost of Services
Cost of services consists primarily of the cost of consulting,
premium services and training personnel and the cost of
bought-in consulting and training resources.
As of the second quarter of 2016, we changed the way sales and
marketing expenses related to our service activities are
classified in our income statement. For more information see
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements section,
Note (3b).
Although we were able to increase our service revenue by 2%
year over year to €3,638 million in 2016 (2015: €3,579 million),
our service business continues to be greatly affected as we
trend away from classic software licensing and consulting
revenue toward more subscription revenue from cloud
solutions. In addition, we continue to invest in our ONE Service
organization and in our customer co-innovation projects. As a
result, cost of services rose 5% to €3,089 million (2015: €2,932
million). Our gross margin on services, defined as services profit
as a percentage of services revenue, narrowed to 15.1% (2015:
18.1%).

Research and Development Expense
Our research and development (R&D) expense consists
primarily of the personnel cost of our R&D employees, costs
incurred for independent contractors we retain to assist in our

software we use for our R&D activities.

increased to 28.4% year-over-year (2015: 27.8%), an increase
of 0.6pp.

Due to growing personnel costs driven by a 12% increase in our
R&D headcount by the end of the year, our R&D expense
increased by 7% to €3,044 million in 2016 from €2,845 million
in 2015. R&D expense as a percentage of total revenue thus
increased to 13.8% in 2016 (2015: 13.7%). For more information,
see the Products, Research & Development, and Services
section.

General and Administration Expense

Sales and Marketing Expense
Sales and marketing expense consists mainly of personnel
costs, direct sales costs, and the cost of marketing our products
and services.
Our sales and marketing expense rose 8% from €5,782 million
in 2015 to €6,265 million in 2016. The increase was mainly the
result of greater personnel costs as we expanded our global
sales force, and of increased expenditure for bonus payments
prompted by the strong revenue growth. The ratio of sales and
marketing expense to total revenue, expressed as a percentage,

Our general and administration expense consists mainly of
personnel costs to support our finance and administration
functions.
General and administration expense decreased 4% from €1,048
million in 2015 to €1,005 million in 2016. This decline in costs is
primarily the result of careful cost management. Consequently,
the ratio of general and administration expense to total revenue
decreased in 2016 to 4.6% (2015: 5.0%).

Segment Information
In 2016, SAP had two reportable segments: the Applications,

In 2016, the revenue increase in the Applications, Technology &

software support revenue, which increased 5% (6% at constant
currencies) to €10,464 million. As a consequence of continuous
strong demand for our human capital management, customer
engagement and commerce, and SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud
offerings, cloud subscriptions and support revenue in the
Applications, Technology & Services segment grew 45% (47%
at constant currencies) to €1,353 million.

The segment's cost of revenue during the same time period
increased 7% (8% at constant currencies) to €5,279 million
(2015: €4,954 million). This increase in expenses was primarily
the result of greater investment in expanding our cloud
infrastructure and in providing and operating our cloud
applications, as well as additional personnel expenses to
support the growth of the cloud business.

Finance income mainly consists of gains from disposal of equity
securities totaling €164 million (2015: €176 million), interest
income from loans and receivables, and other financial assets
(cash, cash equivalents, and current investments) totaling €40
million (2015: €41 million), and income from derivatives totaling

Finance costs mainly consist of interest expense on financial
liabilities amounting to €108 million (2015: €135 million) and
negative effects from derivatives amounting to €114 million
(2015: €72 million). The decrease in finance costs is mainly due
to lower average indebtedness. For more information about

Dividend
We believe our shareholders should benefit appropriately from
the profit the Company made in 2016. In recent years, the
payout has always been greater than 35% of profit after tax. We
aim to continue our policy to pay a dividend totaling more than
35% of profit after tax in the future.
The Executive Board and the Supervisory Board will recommend
to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders that the total
dividend will be increased by 9% to €1.25 per share (2015:
€1.15). Based on this recommendation, the overall dividend
payout ratio (which here means total distributed dividend as a
percentage of profit) would be 41% (2015: 45%).
If the shareholders approve this recommendation and if treasury
shares remain at the 2016 closing level, the total amount
distributed in dividends would be €1,498 million. The actual
amount distributed may be different from this total because the
number of shares held in treasury may change before the
Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. In 2016, we distributed
€1,378 million in dividends from our 2015 profit after tax. In 2016
and 2015, we did not repurchase any SAP treasury shares.

Overview
Global Financial Management
We use global centralized financial management to control liquid
assets and monitor exposure to interest rates and currencies.
The primary aim of our financial management is to maintain
liquidity in the Group at a level that is adequate to meet our
obligations. Most SAP companies have their liquidity managed
centrally by the Group, so that liquid assets across the Group
can be consolidated, monitored, and invested in accordance
with Group policy. High levels of liquid assets help keep SAP
flexible, sound, and independent. In addition, various credit
facilities are currently available for additional liquidity, if

We manage credit, liquidity, interest rate, equity price, and
foreign exchange rate risks on a Group-wide basis. We use
selected derivatives exclusively for this purpose and not for
speculation, which is defined as entering into a derivative
instrument for which we do not have corresponding underlying
transactions. The rules for the use of derivatives and other rules
and processes concerning the management of financial risks are
documented in our treasury guideline, which applies globally to
all companies in the Group. For more information about the
management of each financial risk and about our risk exposure,
see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements section,
Notes (24) to (26).

Liquidity Management
Our primary source of cash, cash equivalents, and current
investments is funds generated from our business operations.
Over the past several years, our principal use of cash has been
to support operations and our capital expenditure requirements
resulting from our growth, to quickly repay financial debt, to
acquire businesses, to pay dividends on our shares, and to buy
back SAP shares on the open market. On December 31, 2016,
our cash, cash equivalents, and current investments were
primarily held in euros and U.S. dollars. We generally invest only
in the financial assets of issuers or funds with a minimum credit
rating of BBB, and pursue a policy of cautious investment
characterized by wide portfolio diversification with a variety of
counterparties, predominantly short-term investments, and
standard investment instruments. Investments in financial
assets of issuers with a credit rating lower than BBB were not
material in 2016.

required. For more information about these facilities, see the
Credit Facilities section.

We believe that our liquid assets combined with our undrawn
credit facilities are sufficient to meet our present operating
needs and, together with expected cash flows from operations,
will support debt repayments and our currently planned capital
expenditure requirements over the near term and medium term.
It may also be necessary to enter into financing transactions
when additional funds are required that cannot be wholly
sourced from free cash flow (for example, to finance large
acquisitions).
To expand our business, we have made acquisitions of
businesses, products, and technologies. Depending on our
future cash position and future market conditions, we might
issue additional debt instruments to fund acquisitions, maintain
financial flexibility, and limit repayment risk. Therefore, we
continuously monitor funding options available in the capital
markets and trends in the availability of funds, as well as the
cost of such funding. In recent years, we were able to repay
additional debt within a short period of time due to our
persistently strong free cash flow. For more information about
the financial debt, see the Cash Flows and Liquidity section.

Capital Structure Management

6–12 months. Based on the actual acquisition volume and
liquidity development we would consider a potential share
buyback in the second half of 2017.

The primary objective of our capital structure management is to
maintain a strong financial profile for investor, creditor, and
customer confidence, and to support the growth of our
business. We seek to maintain a capital structure that will allow
us to cover our funding requirements through the capital
markets at reasonable conditions, and in so doing, ensure a high
level of independence, confidence, and financial flexibility.

Credit Facilities
Other sources of capital are available to us through various
credit facilities, if required.
We are party to a committed €2.0 billion revolving credit facility
contract which matures in November 2020. The credit facility
may be used for general corporate purposes. A possible future
utilization is not subject to any financial covenants. So far, we
have not used and do not currently foresee any need to use, this
credit facility.

For more information about the capital structure and its
analysis, see the Analysis of Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position section and Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements section, Note (21).
The long-term credit rating for SAP SE is “A2” by Moody’s with
stable outlook and “A” by Standard & Poor’s with positive
outlook. Standard & Poor’s raised the outlook from stable to
positive on August 12, 2016.

As at December 31, 2016, SAP SE had additional available credit
facilities totaling €474 million. Several of our foreign
subsidiaries have credit facilities available that allow them to
borrow funds at prevailing interest rates. As at December 31,
2016, approximately €25 million was available through such
arrangements. There were immaterial borrowings outstanding
under these credit facilities from our foreign subsidiaries as at
December 31, 2016.

Our general intention is to remain in a position to return liquidity
to our shareholders by distributing annual dividends totaling
more than 35% of our profit after tax as well as repurchasing
treasury shares in future. In absence of large acquisitions, our
strong operating cash flow will generate excess cash in the next

Group liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents (for
example, cash at banks, money market funds, and time deposits
with original maturity of three months or less) and current
investments (for example, investments with original maturities
of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less
than one year included in other financial assets) as reported in
our Consolidated Financial Statements. Net liquidity is Group

Net cash flows from
operating activities

In 2016 cash inflows from operating activities increased by
€990 million to €4,628 million (2015: €3,638 million). This
result is primarily due to our revenue increase and higher
profitability as well as €161 million lower payments to employees
related to restructuring (2015: €476 million).
In 2016, days’ sales outstanding (DSO) for receivables, defined
as the average number of days from the raised invoice to cash
receipt from the customer, increased three days to 74 days
(2015: 71 days).

Cash outflows from investment activities increased to
€1,799 million in 2016 (2015: €334 million). The increase
resulted from lower proceeds from sale of equity or debt
instruments of other entities of €793 million in 2016 (2015:
€1,880 million). Cash outflows from purchase of intangible
assets and property, plant, and equipment increased by
€365 million to €1,001 million in 2016. For more information
about current and planned capital expenditures, see the Assets
section and the Investment Goals section.
Net cash outflows from financing activities were €2,705 million
in 2016, compared to net cash outflows of €3,356 million in
2015. The 2016 cash outflows resulted from repayments of
€1,250 million bank loan that we had taken to finance the
Concur acquisition. The repayment was partly refinanced
through the issuance of a €400 million Eurobond. We also
repaid a US$600 million U.S. private placements. Cash outflows
in 2015 arose mainly from repayments of €1,270 million bank
loan that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of
Concur, €550 million Eurobonds and US$300 million U.S.
private placements. We refinanced another portion of the bank
loan through the issuance of a three-tranche Eurobond of
€1,750 million in total.
The dividend payment of €1,378 million made in 2016 exceeded
the amount of €1,316 million from the prior year resulting from
the increased dividend paid per share from €1.10 to €1.15.

Current liabilities increased by 23% to €9,674 million in 2016 as

Total current assets increased by 19% in 2016 from €9,739
million to €11,564 million. This was mainly due to an increase in
trade and other receivables to €5,924 million (2015: €5,274
million) on the one hand, which stemmed from our strong
business in the last quarter of 2016. On the other hand it was
due to investments in financial assets (2016: €1,124 million;
2015: €351 million).

Total non-current liabilities decreased by €2,023 million in 2016
to €8,205 million compared to the previous year figure of
€10,228 million, which was (beside of the aforementioned
reclassification on financial liabilities) mainly due to a repayment
of our outstanding bank loan.
For more information about financing activities in 2016, see the
Finances (IFRS) section.
Thus, the equity ratio (that is, the ratio of shareholders’ equity to
total assets) improved to 60% (prior year: 56%).

In 2016, we continued with various construction projects and
started new construction activities in several locations. The
expansion of our data centers is an important aspect of our
investments planned for 2017. We aim to extend our office
space to cover future growth. We plan to cover all of these
projects in full from operating cash flow. Our most important

Competitive Intangibles
The resources that are the basis for our current as well as future
success do not appear on the Consolidated Financial
Statements. This is apparent from a comparison of the market
capitalization of SAP SE (based on all outstanding shares),
which was €101.7 billion at the end of 2016 (2015: €90.1 billion),
with the book value of our equity on the Consolidated Financial
Statements, which was €26.4 billion (2015: €23.3 billion). This
means that the market capitalization of our equity is nearly four
times higher than the book value. The difference is mainly due to
certain internally generated intangible resources that the
applicable accounting standards do not allow to be recorded (at
all or at fair value) in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
They include customer capital (our customer base and
customer relations); employees and their knowledge and skills;
our ecosystem of partners; software we developed ourselves;
our ability to innovate; the brands we have built up, in particular,
the SAP brand itself; and our organization.
As of December 31, 2016, SAP was the most valuable company
in Germany in terms of market capitalization based on all
outstanding shares.
According to the Interbrand “Best Global Brands” annual survey,
SAP ranked as the 22nd most valued brand in the world (2015:
26th). We went from number 26 to 22 on the list in just one year.
Against other German brands, the SAP brand ranks third behind
Mercedes-Benz and BMW, and ninth globally against other IT
brands. The SAP brand grew faster than major competitors.
Interbrand determined our brand value to be US$ 21.3 billion, an
increase of 13% compared to the previous year (2015: US$18.8
billion).

The results of our current and past investment in research and
development are also a significant element in our competitive
intangibles.
Our customer capital continued to grow in 2016. At the end of
2016, we had more than 345,000 customers (2015: 300,000) in
various market segments. The U.S. magazine Forbes revealed in
its World’s Most Valuable Brands report that 98% of the 100
most valued brands, 87% of the Forbes Global 2000 companies,
and 100% of the Dow Jones top-scoring sustainability
companies are SAP customers. To help us improve insight into
our customers’ view of SAP, in 2012, we began measuring our
Customer Net Promoter Score (NPS), a metric that gives a more
complete picture of customer loyalty as it answers the question
of how likely our customers would be to recommend SAP. For
more information about our new customers and the Customer
NPS, see the Customers section.
Employee-related activities increased the value of our employee
base and our own software. For more information, see the
Employees and Social Investment section, and the Products,
Research & Development, and Services section.

Report on the Economic Position of
SAP SE
SAP SE is headquartered in Walldorf, Germany, and is the
parent company of the SAP Group, which comprises 246
companies. SAP SE is the Group holding company and employs
most of the Group’s Germany-based development and service
and support personnel.

Combined Management Report | Financial Performance: Review and Analysis

As the owner of the intellectual property in most SAP software,
SAP SE derives its revenue mainly from software license fees
paid by its subsidiaries for the right to market SAP solutions and
bears the group-wide research and development expenses for
the most part.
The SAP SE annual financial statements are prepared in
accordance with the reporting standards in the German
Commercial Code in the amended version of the Accounting
Directive Implementation Act BilRUG and the German Stock
Corporation Act. The full SAP SE annual financial report and
unqualified audit report are submitted to the operator of the
Elektronischer Bundesanzeiger (Online German Federal Gazette)
for publication and inclusion in the Unternehmensregister
(German Business Register). It is available from SAP SE on
request.
The first time adoption of changed reporting standards
according to BilRUG led to disclosure changes in our income
statement. The definition of revenues has been expanded such
that the recognition of income under revenues no longer
requires that the income results from sales of the products and
goods or from the provision of services that are typical of the
company’s line of business. So income formerly shown as other
operating income is now shown as revenue.

Intercompany royalty reimbursement claims from subsidiaries
from the years 2012 to 2015 in the amount of €153 million
reduced in the current year both, receivables from affiliated
companies and revenue, but relate to other fiscal periods.
Resulting taxes of €37 million reduced tax provisions and tax
expenses.
In order to improve the presentation of the income situation,
expenses for licenses and commissions are no longer shown as
other operating expenses. Due to the predominantly revenuegenerating nature of these expenses a separate disclosure
under cost of services and materials is applied.

Income
The income statement uses the nature of expense method and
presents amounts in millions of euros.
The following income statement shows the reconciliation of
prior-year figures shown in the financial statements 2015 to the
adjusted previous-year figures, taking into account the
disclosure changes described above. The comments to income
refers to the changes in relation to the adjusted previous-year
figures.

The total revenue of SAP SE in 2016 was €12,578 million
(2015: €10,876 million), an increase of 16%. Product revenue
increased 26% to €10,157 million (2015: €8,051 million). As in
previous years, product revenue was primarily generated from
license fees paid by subsidiaries of SAP SE.
The disproportionate rise of SAP SE product revenue compared
to SAP Group’s increase of cloud and software revenues, is

100

mainly due to license fees paid for distribution and utilization
rights of IP held by affiliated companies. In December 2015, SAP
SE concluded license agreements granting SAP SE as of January
2016 world-wide distribution and utilization rights of those IP.
This mainly concerns the IP rights of our acquisitions from the
past years: Ariba, Concur, Fieldglass, SuccessFactors, and
Sybase.

Combined Management Report | Financial Performance: Review and Analysis

Within the scope of these license agreements, SAP SE was
granted the right to further develop the existing technology, too.
As a result, the volume of IP-related SAP SE services, which had
previously been charged to the former IP distributers,
decreased, leading to a decrease of other revenues by 15% to
€1,927 million (2015: €2.280 million).
SAP SE operating profit decreased 14% to €2,215 million
(2015: €2,573 million). Other operating income decreased
€491 million to €1,218 million (2015: €1,709 million). The yearover-year decrease is primarily due to a decrease in gains from
currency effects. SAP SE cost of services and materials
increased 39% to €7,337 million (2015: €5,263 million). The
granted IP rights led to an increase in expenses for licenses and
commissions by €947 million to €2.179 million
(2015: €1,232 million) and mainly IP-related research and
development costs resulted in a rise of services received by
€1,130 million to €5,137 million (2015: €4,007 million).
SAP SE personnel expenses, mainly the labor cost of software
developers, service and support employees, and administration
staff employed by SAP SE, increased 4% to €1,838 million
(2015: €1,763 million). Other operating expenses decreased
21% to €2,143 million (2015: €2,723 million). This decrease is
mainly attributable to €402 million lower losses from currency
effects and a €247 million decrease in restructuring costs. The
effect was partly offset by a €39 million increase in costs for
maintenance and service.
Finance income was €1,155 million (2015: €929 million), an
increase of €226 million compared with the previous year. The
increase is primarily due to a €230 million higher income from
profit transfer agreements and an increase of €5 million in net
interest income. These were partly offset by an increase of
€7 million in write-downs of financial assets.
SAP SE income before taxes decreased €132 million to
€3,370 million (2015: €3,502 million). Income taxes decreased
8% to €760 million (2015: €824 million). After deducting taxes,
the resultant net income is €2,595 million
(2015: €2,664 million), a decrease of €69 million year-overyear.

Owing to investments in IT infrastructure property, plant and
equipment rose by €113 million to €1,111 million
(2015: €998 million). Financial assets increased €81 million
compared with the previous year to €25,338 million
(2015: €25,257 million), due mainly to capital contributions and
loans to subsidiaries.
The increase of €765 million in accounts receivable and other
assets was principally the result of higher receivables from
affiliated companies mainly due to higher product revenue and
higher tax receivables. Liquid assets and marketable securities
increased by €760 million to €1.120 million (2015: €360 million).
SAP SE shareholders’ equity rose 9% to €15,291 million
(2015: €14,024 million). Against outflows of €1,378 million
associated with the payment of the 2015 dividend, there was a
€2,595 million increase in net income and an inflow of

Combined Management Report | Financial Performance: Review and Analysis

101

€50 million from the issuance of shares to service the sharebased payments of employees. The equity ratio (that is, the ratio
of shareholders’ equity to total assets) increased from 45% in
2015 to 47% in 2016.
Provisions increased €92 million to €1,339 million
(2015: €1,247 million). Other provisions increased €110 million
to €953 million (2015: €843 million) primarily as a result of
additions to the other employee-related liabilities and provision
for losses from derivative forward contracts. Reserves for tax
decreased €17 million to €381 million (2015: €398 million).
Liabilities increased €390 million to €16,069 million
(2015: €15,679 million). This increase is mainly attributable to
contrasting effects: On the one hand, SAP SE issued new debt in
the amount of €400 million and liabilities to affiliated companies
increased €1.130 million, primarily due to increased cash
contributions by subsidiaries through SAP SE centralized
management of finance and liquidity; on the other hand, SAP SE
repaid €1,250 million in liabilities to banks.

Opportunities and Risks
SAP SE is subject to materially the same opportunities and risks
as the SAP Group. For more information, see the Risk
Management and Risks section as well as the Expected
Developments and Opportunities section.

Fundamentals
Corporate Governance Statement
The German Commercial Code, section 315 (5) in connection
with section 289a, requires that as a listed company, SAP SE
publish a corporate governance statement either as part of our
management report or on our Web site. The Executive Board of
SAP SE filed the corporate governance statement on February
21, 2017, and published it on our public Web site at
www.sap.com/corporate-en/investors/governance.
For more information about the corporate governance of SAP,
see the Corporate Governance Report section.

Changes in Management
The Global Managing Board was dissolved on March 31, 2016.
As of April 1, 2016, Stefan Ries and Steve Singh were appointed
to the Executive Board. Stefan Ries continued in his role as Chief
Human Resources Officer and also took on the position of SAP
Labor Relations Director. Steve Singh continued to lead the
Business Networks & Applications group. In addition, he took
over responsibility for SAP’s solutions for small-to-mediumsized businesses, the SAP Connected Health strategy and
solutions, and the Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) business.
Gerhard Oswald retired from his position as Executive Board
member upon the end of his term on December 31, 2016.

Information Concerning Takeovers
Information required under the German Commercial Code,
sections 289 (4) and 315 (4), with an explanatory report:
Composition of share capital: For information about the
composition of SAP SE share capital as at December 31, 2016,
see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note
(20). Each share entitles the bearer to one vote. American
depositary receipts (ADRs) representing our shares are listed on
the New York Stock Exchange in the United States. ADRs are
certificates representing non-U.S. shares and are traded on U.S.
stock exchanges instead of the underlying shares. One SAP ADR
corresponds to one SAP share.
Restrictions applying to share voting rights or transfers: SAP
shares are not subject to transfer restrictions except the lock-up
period under the SAP Share Matching Plan (SMP), described
below. SAP held 29,880,390 treasury shares as at December 31,

2016, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
Note (20). Treasury shares do not carry voting rights or dividend
rights or other rights. Shares issued under the employee SMP
are partly subject to contractual transfer restrictions for a threeyear lock-up period unless the plan member’s employment with
SAP is ended under certain circumstances during that period.
Until that lock-up period has expired, participating employees
are not ordinarily allowed to dispose of the shares they have
acquired under the plan. We are not aware of any other
restrictions applying to share voting rights or to share transfers.
Shareholdings that exceed 10% of the voting rights: We are
not aware of any direct or indirect SAP SE shareholdings that
exceed 10% of the voting rights.
Shares with special rights conferring powers of control: No
SAP shareholder has special rights conferring powers of control.
Type of control over voting rights applying to employee
shareholders who do not directly exercise their control rights:
As with other shareholders, employee holders of SAP shares
exercise their control rights in accordance with the law and the
Articles of Incorporation. In votes on the formal approval of their
acts at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, employee
representatives on the Supervisory Board, as all other members
of the Supervisory Board, are prohibited from exercising the
voting rights associated with their shares.
Requirements concerning appointments and dismissals of
members of the Executive Board and amendments to the
Articles of Incorporation:
Conditions for the appointment and dismissal of members of the
Executive Board and amendment to the Articles of Incorporation
reflect the relevant provisions of applicable European and
German law, including Council Regulation (EC) No. 2157/2001
on the Statute for a European Company (“SE Regulation”) and
the German Stock Corporation Act. Under the Articles of
Incorporation, the Executive Board consists of at least two
members who are appointed for a period of not more than five
years by the Supervisory Board in accordance with the SE
Regulation, articles 39 and 46. The number of members of the
Executive Board is decided by the Supervisory Board. Executive
Board members may be reappointed for, or their term of office
extended by, a maximum of five years. A simple majority of the
Supervisory Board membership is required for Executive Board

Combined Management Report | Corporate Governance Fundamentals

103

appointments. In the event of a tie, the chairperson of the
Supervisory Board has the deciding vote. The Supervisory
Board can appoint a chairperson of the Executive Board and one
or more deputy chairpersons from among the members of the
Executive Board. The Supervisory Board can revoke
appointments to the Executive Board in accordance with the SE
Regulation, article 9, and the German Stock Corporation Act,
section 84, if compelling reasons exist, such as gross negligence
on the part of the Executive Board member. If the Executive
Board is short of a required member, one may be appointed in
urgent cases by a court in accordance with the SE Regulation,
article 9, and the German Stock Corporation Act, section 85. In
accordance with the SE Regulation, article 59, and the German
Stock Corporation Act, section 179, an amendment of the
Articles of Incorporation requires a resolution of the General
Meeting of Shareholders with a majority of at least threequarters of the valid votes cast. For any amendments of the
Articles of Incorporation that require a simple majority for stock
corporations established under German law, however, the
simple majority of the valid votes cast is sufficient if at least half
of the subscribed capital is represented or, in the absence of
such quorum, the majority prescribed by law (that is, two-thirds
of the votes cast, pursuant to article 59 of the SE Regulation) is
sufficient. Section 11 (2) of the Articles of Incorporation
authorizes the Supervisory Board to amend the Articles of
Incorporation where such amendments only concern the
wording.
Power to issue and repurchase shares: The Annual General
Meeting of Shareholders on May 12, 2016, granted powers to the
Executive Board, subject to the consent of the Supervisory
Board, to issue convertible and/or warrant-linked bonds, profitsharing rights and/or income bonds (or combinations of these
instruments), and to grant conversion or option rights in respect
of SAP SE shares representing a total attributable portion of the
share capital of not more than €100 million secured by a
corresponding amount of contingent capital. These powers will
expire on May 11, 2021. The Executive Board is also authorized
until May 19, 2020, to increase the share capital by not more
than €250 million by issuing new shares against contributions in
cash and to increase the share capital by not more than €250
million by issuing new shares against contributions in cash or in
kind. For more information about the different tranches of
authorized capital and the aforementioned contingent capital,
see the Articles of Incorporation, section 4. The Annual General
Meeting of Shareholders on June 4, 2013, granted a power to
the Executive Board in accordance with the German Stock
Corporation Act, section 71 (1)(8), to buy back for treasury on or
before June 3, 2018, SAP SE shares attributable in total to not
more than €120 million of the share capital. The power is subject
to the proviso that the shares repurchased, together with any
shares that were previously acquired and are still held by SAP in
treasury and any other shares controlled by SAP, must not in
total exceed 10% of SAP’s share capital. Executive Board
powers, such as those described to issue and repurchase stock
and to grant rights of conversion and subscription to shares of

104

SAP, are widely followed common practice among German
companies such as SAP. They give the Executive Board the
flexibility it needs, in particular, the option to use SAP shares as
consideration in equity investments, raise funds on the financial
markets at short notice on favorable terms, or return value to
shareholders during the course of the year.
Material agreements with change of control provisions:
SAP SE has concluded the following material agreements with
provisions that take effect in the event of a change of control,
whether following a takeover bid or otherwise:
The terms of SAP’s syndicated €2 billion revolving credit facility
include a change-of-control clause. For more information about
this syndicated credit facility, see the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, Note (25). This clause obliges SAP SE to
notify the banks in case of a change of control. If, on receiving
the notification, banks that represent at least two-thirds of the
credit volume so require, the banks have the right to cancel the
credit facility and demand complete repayment of the
outstanding debt. If no continuation agreement is reached, the
credit facility would end and the obligation to repay would
become effective at an ascertainable time.
In agreements between SAP SE and various banks for bilateral
credit facilities that totaled €474 million as at December 31,
2016, we have agreed to termination rights of the banks in
certain cases including a change of control. We believe that in
view of our current liquidity situation, termination of these credit
facilities would not have a material adverse effect, at least in the
near term.
Of SAP’s total amount of Eurobonds of €6.15 billion outstanding
as of December 31, 2016, €5.25 billion were issued under a debt
issuance program. For more information about SAP’s
Eurobonds, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, Note (17b). Under the terms agreed with the
buyers, we are required to notify the buyers of any change of
control without delay. If there is a change of control and SAP is
consequently assigned a lower credit rating within a defined
period, buyers are entitled to demand repayment.
Under the terms of our U.S. private placements totaling US$1.75
billion, we are required to offer lenders repayment of
outstanding debt if there is a change of control and SAP is
consequently assigned a lower credit rating within a defined
period. For more information about these private placements,
see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements section,
Note (17b). Lenders would have at least 30 days to accept the
offer.
We have entered into relationships with other companies to
jointly develop and market new software products. These
relationships are governed by development and marketing
agreements with the respective companies. Some of the
agreements include provisions that, in the event of a change of

Combined Management Report | Corporate Governance Fundamentals

control over one of the parties, give the other party a right to
consent to the assignment of the agreement or to terminate it.
Change of control provisions in Executive Board
compensation agreements: Agreements have been concluded
with the members of the Executive Board concerning
compensation in the event of a change of control. These
agreements, which are customary in Germany and elsewhere,
are described in the compensation report, which is an integral
part of this management report. We have no analogous
compensation agreements with our other employees.

Risk Management and
Risks
Our Risk Management
Internal Control and Risk Management
System
As a global company, SAP is exposed to a broad range of risks
across our business operations. As a consequence, our
Executive Board has established comprehensive internal control
and risk management structures that enable us to identify and
analyze risks early and take appropriate action. Our risk
management and internal control system is designed to identify
potential events that could negatively impact the Company and
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the operating
effectiveness over our financial reporting while ensuring the
achievement of the Company objectives, specifically our ability
to achieve our financial, operational, or strategic goals as
planned.
This system comprises numerous control mechanisms and is an
important element of our corporate decision-making process; it
is therefore implemented as an integral part of SAP’s business
processes across the entire Group. We have adopted an
integrated risk management and internal control approach to
ensure that our global risk management efforts are effective
while also enabling us to aggregate risks and report on them
transparently,
Due to our public listings in both Germany and the United
States, we are subject to both German and U.S. regulatory
requirements that relate to risk management and internal
controls over financial reporting, such as provisions in the
German Stock Corporation Act, section 91 (2) and the U.S.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) of 2002, specifically sections 302
and 404. Hence, our Executive Board has established an early
warning system (risk management system) to ensure
compliance with applicable regulations and an effective
management of risks.
Our risk management system is based on three pillars, which
include a dedicated risk management policy and a standardized
risk management methodology as well as a global risk
management organization. Our internal control system consists
of the internal control and risk management system for financial
reporting (ICRMSFR) that also covers the broader business
environment. In 2016, we adjusted existing control designs to
adequately address the changed risk environment and

106

continued to automate our internal control landscape leveraging
continuous control monitoring and continuous auditing activities
in selected business areas. Using the current Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)
framework of 2013, we define and implement internal controls
along the value chain on a process and subprocess level to
ensure that sound business objectives are set in line with the
organization’s strategic, operational, financial, and compliance
goals. In addition, we have a governance model in place across
risk management and the internal control system to ensure both
systems are effective, as well as a central software solution to
store, maintain, and report all risk-relevant information.

Risk Management Policy and Framework
The risk management policy issued by our Executive Board
governs how we handle risk in line with the Company’s risk
appetite and defines a methodology that is applied uniformly
across all parts of the Group. The policy is regularly updated and
stipulates who is responsible for conducting risk management
activities and defines reporting and monitoring structures. Our
global corporate audit function conducts regular audits to
assess the effectiveness of our risk management system. Every
year, SAP’s external auditor assesses if the SAP SE early risk
identification system is adequate to identify risks that might
endanger our ability to continue as a going concern. SAP’s
enterprise risk management covers risks in the areas of
strategy, operational business, financial reporting, and
compliance. As of today, the risk management system analyzes
risks and only assesses or analyzes opportunities where it is
deemed appropriate.

Risk Management Methodology and
Reporting
The following describes the key elements of the risk
management process as part of SAP’s risk management policy:
risk planning, identification, analysis, response, monitoring, and
reporting.
Risk planning and risk identification for both internal and
external risks are conducted in cooperation between risk
managers and the business units or subsidiaries across the
Group. We use various techniques to identify risks. For example,
we have identified risk indicators and developed a
comprehensive risk catalog that includes risk mitigation
strategies for known product, solution, and project risks. Risk

Combined Management Report | Risk Management and Risks

identification takes place at various levels of our organization to
ensure that common risk trends are identified and end-to-end
risk management across organizational borders is enabled. We
apply both a qualitative and quantitative risk analysis as well as
other risk analysis methods such as sensitivity analyses and
simulation techniques.
To determine which risks pose the highest threat to the viability
of the SAP Group, we classify them as “high,” “medium,” or
“low” based on the likelihood that a risk will occur within the
assessment horizon as well as the impact the risk would have on
SAP’s business objectives if it were to occur. The scales for
measuring these two indicators are given in the following tables.
Probability/Likelihood of

20% to 39%

Unlikely

40% to 59%

60% to 79%

Highly Likely

80% to 99%

Near Certainty

In this framework, we define a remote risk as one that will occur
only under exceptional circumstances and a near certain risk as
one that can be expected to occur within the specified time
horizon. The period for analyzing our risks correlates with the

respectively associated business activities considering a
relevant forecast horizon of up to one year, and up to 2020
where applicable. The period for analyzing the risks that could
be possible threats to the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern is eight rolling quarters.

Based on the combination of the likelihood that a risk will occur
and its impact on SAP’s reputation, business, financial position,
profit, and cash flow, we classify the risks as “high,” “medium,”
or “low.”

Risk analysis is followed by risk response and risk monitoring.
The risk exposure and the risk description, as well as the
appropriateness of agreed responses, are validated by the
accountable management. Our risk managers work in close
cooperation with the business owners, ensuring that effective
strategies are implemented to address risks. Business owners
are responsible for continuously monitoring the risks and the
effectiveness of mitigation strategies, with support from the
respective risk managers. Risks might be reduced by taking
active steps based on risk approval. To provide greater risk
transparency and enable appropriate decision-making for
business owners, we have established a risk delegation of
authority (RDOA) for relevant parts of the organization as
deemed appropriate. RDOA is a risk management decision-

making hierarchy that helps business owners gain timely insight
into projects and processes with the greatest risk, so they are
better able to review the relevant information, understand the
risk profile and associated mitigation strategies, and determine
if their approval is warranted. Depending on the exposure,
approval is required at different levels of the Company, up to
and including the Executive Board.
All identified and relevant risks are reported at the local,
regional, and global levels in accordance with our risk
management policy. At local, regional, and global levels, we have
established executive risk councils that regularly discuss risks
and countermeasures and that monitor the success of risk
mitigation. In addition, the Executive Board is informed quarterly

107

about individual risks based on clearly defined qualitative
reporting criteria. Newly identified or existing significant risks
that are above a defined threshold, a qualitative criteria or with a
potential significant impact are also reported to the chairperson
of the Supervisory Board and to the Audit Committee of the
Supervisory Board. This includes any risks to the ability to
continue as a going concern.
We also have a process in place that analyzes those risks with
respect to potential effects on liquidity, excessive indebtedness,
and insolvency, which could be possible threats to the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern.

Risk Management Organization
Our global risk management organization (Global GRC) ensures
the Group-wide systematic identification, assessment,
management, and monitoring of operational, financial,
compliance, and strategic risks as well as opportunities. In
addition, the Global GRC function is responsible for the
standardized internal risk reporting to risk committees on
different levels within the Company in line with the internal GRC
Risk Reporting Standard, including the Executive Board, the
chairperson of the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee
of the Supervisory Board, along with the external risk reporting.
Furthermore, Global GRC is responsible for the regular
maintenance and implementation of our risk management
policy.
Operational, financial, and strategic risk management is
uniformly implemented at SAP. Independent GRC risk managers
are assigned to each of SAP’s important business units and
business activities and to selected strategic initiatives. All GRC
risk managers, together with assigned risk contacts in the
business units, continuously identify and assess risks
associated with material business operations using a uniform
approach and monitor the implementation and effectiveness of
the measures chosen to mitigate risks. Further financial risk
management activities are performed by our global treasury
function, and risk management of compliance risks is performed
by our Legal Compliance & Integrity Office.
During the merger and acquisition and post-merger integration
phase, newly acquired companies are subject to risk
management performed by our Corporate Development M&A
function. Furthermore, as long as they are not integrated,
existing risk management structures are maintained or
enhanced within the acquired companies for purposes of
compliance with legal requirements.
Risk managers are responsible for supporting and monitoring
the implementation of risk management across the Group that
is both effective and compliant with regulatory requirements
and SAP’s global risk management policy. Based on our risk
management policy, all risks and risk-related matters must be
reported to the Global GRC organization.

108

The head of Global GRC, who reports to the Group CFO, is
responsible for SAP’s internal control and risk management
program, and provides regular updates to the Audit Committee
of the Supervisory Board. The overall risk profile of the Group is
consolidated by the head of Global GRC,

Internal Control and Risk Management
System for Financial Reporting
The purpose of our system of internal control over financial
reporting is to provide reasonable assurance that our financial
reporting is reliable and in compliance with applicable generally
accepted accounting principles. Because of the inherent
limitations of internal control over financial reporting, it might
not prevent or bring to light all potential misstatements in our
financial statements.
SAP’s internal control and risk management system for financial
reporting (ICRMSFR) is based on our Group-wide risk
management methodology. The ICRMSFR includes
organizational, control, and monitoring structures designed to
ensure that data and information concerning our business are
collected, compiled, and analyzed in accordance with applicable
laws and properly reflected in the IFRS Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Our ICRMSFR also includes policies, procedures, and measures
designed to ensure compliance of SAP’s financial reports with
applicable laws and standards. We analyze new statutes,
standards, and other pronouncements concerning IFRS
accounting and its impact on our financial statements and
ICRMSFR. Failure to adhere to these new statutes, standards,
and other pronouncements would present a substantial risk to
the compliance of our financial reporting. Finally, the ICRMSFR
has both preventive and detective controls, including, for
example, automated and non-automated reconciliations,
segregated duties with two-person responsibility, authorization
concepts in our software systems, and corresponding
monitoring measures.
Our Corporate Financial Reporting (CFR) department codifies all
accounting policies in our global group accounting and revenue
recognition guidelines. These policies, the corporate closing
schedule, and our process handbooks together define the
closing process. Under this closing process, we prepare,
predominately through centralized and outsourced services, the
financial statements of all SAP legal entities for consolidation by
our CFR department. The CFR department and other corporate
departments assist in the efforts to comply with Group
accounting policies and monitor the accounting work. The
department also conducts reviews of our accounting processes
and books.
We have outsourced some work, such as valuing projected
benefit obligations and share-based payment obligations,
quarterly tax calculations for most entities, and purchase price

Combined Management Report | Risk Management and Risks

allocations in the context of asset acquisitions and business
combinations. We have also outsourced the preparation of the
local statutory financial statements for most of our subsidiaries.
The employees who work on SAP’s financial reporting receive
training in the respective policies and processes.
Based on an analysis of the design and operating effectiveness
of our respective internal controls over financial reporting, a
committee presents the results of the assessment on the
ICRMSFR effectiveness with respect to our IFRS Consolidated
Financial Statements as at December 31 each year to the Group
CFO. The committee meets regularly to set the annual scope for
the test of effectiveness, to evaluate any possible weaknesses in
the controls, and to determine measures to address them
adequately. During its own meetings, the Audit Committee of
the Supervisory Board regularly scrutinizes the resulting
assessments of the effectiveness of the internal controls over
financial reporting with respect to the IFRS consolidated
financial statements.

governance process. Risk managers record and address
identified risks using our risk management software to help
create transparency across all known risks that exist in the
Group, as well as to facilitate risk management and the
associated risk reporting. Our continuous controls monitoring
activities are performed utilizing our GRC software as well. This
information is available to managers through a mobile app as
well as regularly issued reports, and is consolidated and
aggregated for the quarterly risk report to the Executive Board.
The solution also supports the risk-based approach of the
ICRMSFR.

The assessment of the effectiveness of the ICRMSFR related to
our IFRS consolidated financial statements was that on
December 31, 2016, the Group had an effective internal control
system over financial reporting in place.
Additionally, and in compliance with German commercial law
requirements in Germany, SAP maintains an effective internal
control system beyond financial reporting. This is supported
through automated controls (continuous control monitoring) as
part of our business processes.

Risk Management and Internal Control
Governance
Our Executive Board is responsible for ensuring the
effectiveness of the risk management and internal control
system. The effectiveness of both systems and their
implementation in the different Executive Board areas is
monitored by each board member. We regularly provide a status
on the risk management and the internal control system to the
Audit Committee. Key risks are reported quarterly to the
chairperson of the Supervisory Board and to the Audit
Committee of the Supervisory Board. The Audit Committee of
the Supervisory Board regularly monitors the effectiveness of
SAP’s risk management and internal control system. At the
direction of our Audit Committee, the Corporate Audit
department regularly audits various aspects of the risk
management system and its effectiveness. Additional
reassurance is obtained through the external audit of the
effectiveness of our internal control system over financial
reporting and the early warning system.

Software Solution Deployed
We use our own risk management software, SAP solutions for
GRC powered by SAP HANA, to effectively support the

1) Evolution: Risk Level compared with previous year.

All described risks are applicable to a different extent to our
reportable segments (Applications, Technology & Services and
SAP Business Network) unless otherwise noted.
SAP SE is the parent company of the SAP Group. Consequently,
the risks described below also apply, directly or indirectly, to
SAP SE.

Economic, Political, Social, and Regulatory
Risk
Uncertainty in the global economy, financial markets, or
political conditions could have a negative impact on our
business, financial position, profit, as well as cash flows, and
put pressure on our operating profit.
Our business is influenced by multiple risk factors that are both
difficult to predict and beyond our influence and control. These
factors include global economic and business conditions, and
fluctuations in national currencies. Other examples are political

Combined Management Report | Risk Management and Risks

111

developments and general regulations as well as budgetary
constraints or shifts in spending priorities of national
governments.
Macroeconomic developments, such as financial market
volatility episodes, global economic crises, chronic fiscal
imbalances, slowing economic conditions, or disruptions in
emerging markets, could limit our customers’ ability and
willingness to invest in our solutions or delay purchases. In
addition, changes in the euro conversion rates for particular
currencies might have an adverse effect on business activities
with local customers and partners. Furthermore, political
instability in regions such as Africa and the Middle East, political
crises (including Brazil, Great Britain, Greece, Syria, Turkey,
Ukraine, or Venezuela), sanctions (such as those placed on
Russia), natural disasters, pandemic diseases (such as Ebola in
West Africa) and terrorist attacks (including the attacks in
Brussels, Belgium, in March 2016, or in Nice, France, in July
2016) could contribute to economic and political uncertainty.
These events could reduce the demand for SAP software and
services, and lead to:
– Delays in purchases, decreased deal size, or cancellations of
proposed investments
– Potential lawsuits from customers due to denied provision of
service as a result of sanctioned-party lists or export control
issues
– Higher credit barriers for customers, reducing their ability to
finance software purchases
– Increased number of bankruptcies among customers,
business partners, and key suppliers
– Increased default risk, which might lead to significant
impairment charges in the future
– Market disruption from aggressive competitive behavior,
acquisitions, or business practices
– Increased price competition and demand for cheaper
products and services
Any one or more of these developments could reduce our ability
to sell and deliver our software and services which could have an
adverse effect on our business, financial position, profit, and
cash flows.
SAP has established measures and conducted scenario
analyses to address and mitigate the described risks and
adverse effects to the extent possible. We offer our customers
standard software and product packages that are fast and easy
to install, as well as financially attractive financing, software
licensing, and subscription models. Our ongoing shift to a higher
share of cloud subscriptions and software support revenue
streams will lead to more predictable streams over time
providing increased stability against financial volatility.
Furthermore, we continue to apply cost discipline internally and
have a conservative financial planning policy. Additionally, SAP

112

is continuously reshaping its organizational structure and
processes to increase efficiency.
We estimate the probability of occurrence of this risk to be likely.
Therefore, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that it
will have a business-critical impact on our business, financial
position, profit, and cash flows. This could exacerbate the other
risks we describe in this report or cause a negative deviation
from our revenue and operating profit target. We classify this
risk as a high risk.
Our international business activities and processes expose us
to numerous, sometimes even conflicting laws and
regulations, policies, standards or other requirements, and to
risks that could harm our business, financial position, profit,
and cash flows.
We are a global company and currently market our products and
services in more than 180 countries and territories in the
Americas (Latin America and North America); Asia Pacific Japan
(APJ); and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) regions. Our
business in these countries is subject to numerous risks
inherent in international business operations. Among others,
these risks include:
– Data protection and privacy regulations regarding access by
government authorities to customer, partner, or employee
data
– Data residency requirements (the requirement to store
certain data only in and, in some cases, also to access such
data only from within a certain jurisdiction)
– Conflict and overlap among tax regimes
– Possible tax constraints impeding business operations in
certain countries
– Expenses associated with the localization of our products and
compliance with local regulatory requirements
– Discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies
– Operational difficulties in countries with a high corruption
perception index
– Protectionist trade policies, import and export regulations,
and trade sanctions and embargoes
– Works councils, labor unions, and immigration laws in
different countries
– Difficulties enforcing intellectual property and contractual
rights in certain jurisdictions
– Country-specific software certification requirements
– Challenges with effectively managing a large distribution
network of third-party companies
– Compliance with various industry standards (such as
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
– Market volatilities or workforce restrictions due to changing
laws and regulations resulting from political decisions (e.g.
Brexit, government elections)
As we expand into new countries and markets, these risks could
intensify. The application of the respective local laws and

Combined Management Report | Risk Management and Risks

regulations to our business is sometimes unclear, subject to
change over time, and often conflicting among jurisdictions.
Additionally, these laws and government approaches to
enforcement are continuing to change and evolve, just as our
products and services continually evolve. Compliance with these
varying laws and regulations could involve significant costs or
require changes in products or business practices. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or
cessation of orders due to alleged non-compliant activity. We do
not believe we have engaged in any activities sanctionable under
these laws and regulations, but governmental authorities could
use considerable discretion in applying these statutes and any
imposition of sanctions against us could be material. One or
more of these factors could have an adverse effect on our
operations globally or in one or more countries or regions, which
could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position,
profit, and cash flows.
We address these risks with various measures depending on the
circumstances on which SAP will not compromise, including, for
example, a strong legal and compliance office presence in the
main countries, compliance safeguards supported and
monitored by SAP legal teams and the Legal Compliance &
Integrity Office, maintaining an effective data protection and
privacy office and associated policy, receiving guidance from
external economics consultants, law firms, tax advisors, and
authorities in the concerned countries, and taking legal actions
when necessary.
Although we estimate the probability of occurrence of this risk
to be unlikely, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that
this risk could have a major impact on our business, financial
position, profit, and cash flows, or cause a negative deviation
from our revenue and operating profit target. We classify this
risk as a medium risk.
Social and political instability caused by state-based
conflicts, terrorist attacks, civil unrest, war, or international
hostilities might disrupt SAP’s business operations.
Terrorist attacks (such as in Turkey, in March, June, August, and
December 2016) as well as other acts of violence or war, civil,
religious, and political unrest (such as in Turkey, Ukraine, and
Venezuela; Israel, Libya, Syria, and in other parts of the Middle
East; and parts of Africa); natural disasters (such as hurricanes,
flooding, or similar events); or pandemic diseases (such as
Ebola in West Africa) could have a significant adverse effect on
the local economy and beyond. Such an event could lead, for
example, to the loss of a significant number of our employees, or
to the disruption or disablement of operations at our locations,
and could affect our ability to provide business services and
maintain effective business operations. Furthermore, this could
have a significant adverse effect on our partners as well as our
customers and their investment decisions, which could have an
adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial position,
profit, and cash flows.

Combined Management Report | Risk Management and Risks

Our mitigation measures have been designed and implemented
to minimize such adverse effects. In an effort to ensure
continuous operations of all business processes, we have been
implementing and operating a worldwide business continuity
management and crisis management system. To enable
effective response and minimize possible losses in case of crisis
situations, we have installed local crisis management teams at
our main locations, supplemented by regional crisis
management teams for the Americas (including Latin America
and North America), APJ (including Greater China), and EMEA
regions, and a global crisis management team.
To protect our key IT infrastructure (especially our data
centers), critical business systems, and processes from material
adverse effects in crisis situations, disaster recovery and
business continuity plans have been developed that include
implementation of data redundancies and daily data backup
strategies. To verify and improve our approach, our IT-related
organizations have been certified to the internationally
recognized ISO 22301:2013 (Business Continuity Management)
standard with regards to the Applications, Technology &
Services segment. In addition, our corporate headquarters,
which houses certain critical business functions, is located in the
German state of Baden-Württemberg. This area has historically
been free of natural disasters.
With regards to the relevance of current and anticipated political
crisis situations and acts of violence impacting SAP’s business,
we believe that the likelihood of this risk materializing is unlikely;
however, we cannot exclude the possibility of such a risk
occurring and having a business-critical impact on our
reputation, business, financial position, profit, and cash flows, or
causing a negative deviation from our revenue and operating
profit target. We classify this risk as a medium risk.

Market Risks
Our established customers might not buy additional software
solutions, subscribe to our cloud offerings, renew
maintenance agreements, purchase additional professional
services, or they might switch to other products or service
offerings (including competitive products).
In 2016, we continued to depend materially on the success of
our support portfolio and on our ability to deliver high-quality
services. Traditionally, our large installed customer base
generates additional new software, maintenance, consulting,
and training revenue. Despite the high quality and service level
of our transformed and expanded service offering in the area of
premium support services, we might be unable to meet
customer expectations with regards to delivery and value
proposition. This might lead to a potentially adverse impact on
customer experience. Existing customers might cancel or not
renew their maintenance contracts, decide not to buy additional
products and services, not subscribe to our cloud offerings, or
accept alternative offerings from other vendors. In addition, the

113

increasing volume in our cloud business as well as the
conversion of traditional on-premise licenses to cloud
subscriptions licenses and an increased complexity in our
maintenance and support cycle across our diverse solutions and
offerings could have a potential negative impact on our software
and maintenance revenue streams. This could have an adverse
effect on our business, financial position, profit, and cash flows.
Working closely with SAP user groups, we continuously
demonstrate the business value and the benefits of our solution,
service and support portfolio in terms of innovation, quality, and
high service level as well as through customer references and
success stories. Additionally, we continuously monitor the
performance and the perceived value of our services and the
satisfaction of our customers. We implement mitigating steps
where required and deliberately invest into alignments and
improvements in order to benefit our customers.
The SAP Digital Business Services organization is combining
responsibility for services and support in regards to the
Applications, Technology & Services segment. This organization
offers a wide range of support, including premium support
services (SAP MaxAttention and SAP ActiveEmbedded), and
professional services to increase business benefit for our
customers. For the SAP Business Network segment, we
continue the established service and support models.
With regards to our volume in cloud business as well as the
conversion of traditional on-premise licenses to cloud
subscriptions licenses, we estimate the probability of this risk
materializing to be unlikely. However, we cannot completely
exclude the possibility that it could have a business-critical
impact on our business, financial position, profit, and cash flows,
or cause a negative deviation from our revenue. We classify this
risk as a medium risk.
The success of our cloud computing strategy depends on
positive market perception and increasing market adoption
of our cloud solutions and managed cloud services.
Insufficient adoption of our solutions and services could lead
to a loss of SAP’s position as a leading cloud company.
The market for cloud computing is increasing and shows strong
growth relative to the market for our on-premise solutions. To
offer a broad cloud service portfolio and generate the associated
business value for our customers, we continue to invest in
innovation and acquisitions. Due to ongoing contracts and
previous substantial investments to integrate traditional onpremise enterprise software into their businesses, as well as
concerns about data protection, total cost of ownership,
functional capacities, migration, security and integration
capabilities, and reliability, customers and partners might be
reluctant or unwilling to migrate to the cloud.
Other factors that could affect the market acceptance, adoption
and extension of cloud solutions and services include:

114

– Concerns with entrusting a third-party to store and manage
critical employee or company confidential data
– Customer concerns about security capabilities and reliability
– Customer concerns about the ability to scale operations for
large enterprise customers
– Inadequate level of configurability or customizability of the
software
– Missing integration scenarios between on-premise products
and cloud-to-cloud solutions
– Failure to securely and successfully deliver cloud services by
any cloud service provider could have a negative impact on
customer trust in cloud solutions
– Strategic alliances among our competitors and / or their
growth-related efficiency gains in the cloud area could lead to
significantly increased competition in the market with
regards to pricing and ability to integrate solutions
– Failure to get the full commitment of our partners might
reduce speed and impact in market reach
– Failure to comply with increasing governance on data privacy
and data residence
– Challenge in defining adequate solution packages and scope
for all customer segments
If organizations do not perceive the benefits of cloud computing,
the market for cloud business might not develop further, or it
might develop more slowly than we expect, either of which could
have an adverse effect on our business, competitiveness,
financial position, profit, reputation and cash flows.
In addition to measures to communicate the business value of
our cloud solutions to the market, we invest significantly in
infrastructure and processes in an effort to ensure secure
operations of our cloud solutions including the adaption of cloud
service delivery to local and/or specific market requirements
(such as local or regional data centers) and compliance with all
local legal regulations regarding data protection and privacy as
well as data security.
Although we estimate the probability of occurrence of this risk
to be unlikely, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that
this risk could have a business-critical impact on our reputation,
business, financial position, profit, and cash flows, or cause a
negative deviation from our revenue and operating profit target.
We classify the risk as a medium risk.
Our market share and profit could decline due to increased
competition, market consolidation and technological
innovation as well as new business models in the software
industry.
The software industry continues to evolve rapidly and is
currently undergoing a significant shift due to innovations in the
areas of enterprise mobility, machine learning, augmented and
virtual reality, cybersecurity, Big Data, hyperconnectivity, the
Internet of Things, digitization, supercomputing, cloud
computing, and social media. While smaller innovative

Combined Management Report | Risk Management and Risks

companies tend to create new markets organically, large
traditional IT vendors tend to enter such markets mostly
through acquisitions. SAP faces increased competition in its
business environment from traditional, new and in particular
cooperating competitors. This competition could cause price
pressure, cost increases, and loss of market share, which could
have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, profit,
and cash flows.

maps. There is a risk that such uncertainties might lead
customers to wait for proof of concepts or holistic integration
scenarios through reference customers or more mature
versions first, which might result in a lower level of adoption of
our new solutions, technologies, business models, and flexible
consumption models, or no adoption at all, possibly impacting
customer satisfaction and retention. This could have an adverse
effect on our business, financial position, profit, and cash flows.

Additionally, related to our Applications, Technology & Services
segment, customers could change their buying behavior by
accelerating their acceptance of cloud solutions to reduce their
investments, which might have a temporary adverse effect on
our operating results. Furthermore, the trend in the market to
invest more in cloud solutions might lead to a risk of the
potential loss of existing on-premise customers. It might also
have a temporary adverse effect on our revenue due to the
number of conversions from on-premise licenses to cloud
subscriptions from existing SAP customers in our installed base,
as we recognize cloud subscriptions revenue over the respective
service provision, and that typically ranges from one-to-three
years with some up to five years.

To mitigate this risk, SAP is balancing the distribution of our
strategic investments by evolving and protecting our core
businesses and simultaneously developing new solutions,
technologies, and business models for markets, such as those in
analytics, applications, and database and technology.
Furthermore, we continuously demonstrate the benefits of our
solution and services portfolio through end-to-end integration
scenarios, homogeneous and compelling user interfaces,
customer references and success stories as well as the
provision of support excellence to ensure customer satisfaction
with and after the implementation of our solution.

We believe we will be able to protect our leadership in the
market by continuing to execute successfully on our customercentric innovation strategy, which is driven by a mix of organic
growth, targeted acquisitions, and attractive cloud solution
offerings. To compete successfully in the market, we
continuously enhance our global processes and adjust our
organizational structures. Furthermore, in the Application,
Technology, and Services segment, we have policies in place to
effectively manage conversions from on-premise software
arrangements to cloud arrangements.
Although we estimate the probability of this risk unlikely with
major impact, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that
this risk could have a major impact on our business, financial
position, profit, and cash flows, or cause a negative deviation
from our revenue and operating profit target. We classify this
risk as a medium risk.

Business Strategy Risks
Demand for our new solutions might not develop as planned
and our strategy on new business models and flexible
consumption models might not be successful.
Our business consists of new software licenses, software license
updates, Services and maintenance fees as well as of cloud
subscriptions. Our customers are expecting to take advantage
of technological breakthroughs from SAP without compromising
their previous IT investments. However, the introduction of new
SAP solutions, technologies, and business models as well as
delivery and consumption models is subject to uncertainties as
to whether customers will be able to perceive the additional
value and realize the expected benefits we deliver along our road

Combined Management Report | Risk Management and Risks

We estimate the probability of occurrence of this risk to be
remote, but cannot completely exclude the possibility that this
risk could have a business-critical impact on our business,
financial position, profit, and cash flows, or cause a negative
deviation from our revenue and operating profit target.
Furthermore, unsuccessful launches of flagship
products/offerings could negatively affect market perception.
We classify this risk as a medium risk.
Though downturns or upturns in cloud sales might not be
immediately reflected in our operating results, any decline in
our customer renewals would harm the future operating
results of our cloud business.
We recognize cloud subscriptions revenue as we provide the
respective services, which typically range from one-to-three
years with some up to five years. This revenue recognition and
our increasing subscription revenues could have a temporary
adverse effect on our financial position, profit, and cash flows.
To maintain or improve our operating results in the cloud
business, it is important that our customers renew their
agreements with us when the initial contract term expires and
purchase additional modules or additional capacity. Our
customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions after
the initial subscription period, and we cannot assure that
customers will renew subscriptions at the same or at a higher
level of service, or at all. Our customers’ renewal rates might
decline or fluctuate as a result of various factors, including their
satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our cloud solution and
services portfolio; our ability to efficiently provide cloud services
according to customer expectations and meeting the service
level agreements, service availability and provisioning, the
integration capabilities of our cloud solutions into their existing
IT environment (including hybrid solutions combining both cloud

115

and on-premise solutions); our customer support; concerns
regarding stable, efficient, and secure cloud operations and
compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; our pricing;
the pricing of competing products or services; mergers and
acquisitions affecting our customer base; global economic
conditions; and reductions in our customers’ spending levels.
If our customers do not renew their subscriptions, if they renew
on terms less favorable to us, or do not purchase additional
modules or users, our revenue and billings might decline, and
our operating results could be negatively impacted. This could
have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, profit,
and cash flows.
We share our overall long-term cloud strategy and our
integration road map with our customers and continuously
implement improvements to enhance our cloud solutions,
including instant provisioning, a consumer-grade user
experience, and a fast time to value, among others. To
continuously improve our services, we closely monitor all issues
and work together with customers to perform a root-cause
analysis and provide solutions to identified problems. We have a
strong focus on providing our cloud services efficiently and
according to customer expectations, including service
provisioning, quality, and security as well as data protection and
privacy.
Furthermore, we are continuously improving and adapting cloud
services delivery and license models to local and/or specific
market requirements (such as local or regional data centers,
customer expectations, and in accordance with legal and
regulatory requirements).
Although we estimate the probability of occurrence of this risk
to be remote, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that
this risk could have a business-critical impact on our business,
financial position, profit, and cash flows, or cause a negative
deviation from our revenue and operating profit target. We
classify this risk as a medium risk.
If we are unable to scale and enhance an effective partner
ecosystem, revenue might not increase as expected.
An open and vibrant partner ecosystem is a fundamental pillar
of our success and growth strategy. We have entered into
partnership agreements that drive co-innovation on our
platforms, profitably expand all our routes to market to optimize
market coverage, optimize cloud delivery, and provide highquality services capacity in all market segments. Partners play a
key role in driving market adoption of our entire solutions
portfolio, by co-innovating on our platforms, embedding our
technology, and reselling and/or implementing our software.

and target market, if partners fear direct competition by SAP or
if SAP fails to establish and enable a network of qualified
partners meeting our quality requirements and the
requirements of our customers, then, among other things,
partners might not:
– Develop a sufficient number of new solutions and content on
our platforms
– Provide high-quality products and services to meet customer
expectations
– Drive growth of references by creating customer use cases
and demo systems
– Embed our solutions sufficiently enough to profitably drive
product adoption, especially with innovations such as SAP
S/4HANA and SAP Cloud Platform (formerly called SAP
HANA Cloud Platform)
– Enable and train sufficient resources to promote, sell, and
support to scale to targeted markets
– Comply with applicable quality requirements expected by our
customers, resulting in delayed, disrupted, or terminated
sales and services
– Transform their business model in accordance with the
transformation of SAP’s business model in a timely manner
– Renew their existing agreements with us or enter into new
agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all
– Provide ability and capacity to meet customer expectations
regarding service provisioning.
If one or more of these risks materialize, this might have an
adverse effect on the demand for our products and services as
well as the partner’s loyalty and ability to deliver. As a result, we
might not be able to scale our business to compete successfully
with other software vendors, which could have an adverse effect
on our reputation, business, financial position, profit, and cash
flows.
SAP continues to invest in long-term, mutually beneficial
relationships and agreements with partners. We continue to
develop and enhance a wide range of partner programs to retain
existing and attract new partners of all types. We offer training
opportunities to a wide range of resources for our partners and
additionally provide demo solutions to enable partners to lead
business value discussions on cloud and on-premise solutions
with customers. A thorough certification process for third-party
solutions has been designed and established to ensure
consistent high-quality and seamless integration.
We estimate the probability of occurrence of this risk to be
unlikely, and we cannot exclude the possibility that this risk
could have a major impact on our reputation, business, financial
position, profit, and cash flows, or cause a negative deviation
from our revenue and operating profit target if it were to
materialize. We classify this risk as a medium risk.

If partners consider our products or services model less
strategic and/or financially less attractive compared to our
competition and/or less appropriate for their respective channel

116

Combined Management Report | Risk Management and Risks

Human Capital Risks
If we do not effectively manage our geographically dispersed
workforce, we might not be able to run our business
efficiently and successfully.
Our success is dependent on appropriate alignment of our
internal and external workforce planning processes, adequate
resource allocation and our location strategy with our general
strategy. It is critical that we manage our internationally
dispersed workforce effectively, taking short- and long-term
workforce and skill requirements into consideration. This applies
to the management of our internal as well as our external
workforce. Changes in headcount and infrastructure needs as
well as local legal or tax regulations could result in a mismatch
between our expenses and revenue. Failure to manage our
geographically dispersed workforce effectively could hinder our
ability to run our business efficiently and successfully and could
have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, profit,
and cash flows.
We focus on mitigating this risk through a range of activities
including succession management; workforce planning (which
aims to achieve diversity and the right mix of talent and to take
account of demographic changes); outsourcing; external shortterm staffing; employer branding; career management (such as
offering opportunities for short-term assignments and
opportunities to improve skills, competencies, and
qualifications); and extended benefit programs – for example, a
performance-oriented remuneration system, an employerfinanced pension plan in certain countries, and long-term
incentive plans.
We estimate this risk to be a remote possibility, but we cannot
completely exclude the possibility of this risk to have a major
impact on our business, financial position, profit, and cash flows,
or cause a negative deviation from our revenue and operating
profit target. We classify this risk as a low risk.
If we are unable to attract, develop, and retain leaders and
employees with specialized knowledge and technology skills,
or are unable to achieve internal diversity and inclusion
objectives, we might not be able to manage our operations
effectively and successfully, or develop successful new
solutions and services.
Our highly qualified workforce is the foundation for our
continued success. In certain regions and specific technology
and solution areas, we continue to set very high growth targets,
specifically in countries and regions such as Africa, China, Latin
America, and the Middle East. In the execution of SAP’s
strategic priorities, we depend on highly skilled and specialized
personnel and leaders, both male and female. Successful
maintenance and expansion of our highly skilled and specialized
workforce in the area of cloud is a key success factor for our
transition to be the leading cloud company. The availability of

Combined Management Report | Risk Management and Risks

such personnel as well as business experts is limited and, as a
result, competition in our industry is intense and could expose
us to claims by other companies seeking to prevent their
employees from working for a competitor. If we are unable to
identify, attract, develop, motivate, adequately compensate, and
retain well-qualified and engaged personnel, or if existing highly
skilled and specialized personnel leave SAP and ready
successors or adequate replacements are not available or we
cannot allocate our workforce as required due to local
regulations and associated restrictions, we might not be able to
manage our operations effectively, which could have an adverse
effect on our reputation, business, financial position, profit, and
cash flows. Furthermore, we might not be able to develop, sell,
or implement successful new solutions and services as planned.
This is particularly true as we continue to introduce new and
innovative technology offerings and expand our business in
emerging markets. The lack of appropriate or inadequately
executed benefit and compensation programs could limit SAP’s
ability to attract or retain qualified employees and lead to
financial losses. In addition, we might not be able to achieve our
internal gender diversity objectives to increase the number of
women in management from 18% in 2010 to 25% by end of
2017.
These risks notwithstanding, we continue to believe our leading
market position, employer brand, and extended benefit
programs will enable us to hire top talent internationally with the
potential to contribute to SAP’s growing business success in the
future. We address the risk of an adverse effect on our business
operations from a failure to recruit the employees we need or
from the loss of leaders and employees by seeking to build
employee and leadership strengths through a range of targeted
professional development, mentoring, and coaching programs,
a gender diversity program, in September 2016, globally
awarded with the Economic Dividends for Gender Equality
(EDGE) certificate in recognition for commitment to gender
equality in the workplace, and a special focus on accelerated
high-potential employee development that aims to develop
talent as well as leadership talent, in particular. A strong focus
on succession planning for leadership and key positions seeks to
ensure sustainable leadership and to safeguard the business
from disruption caused by staff turnover.
Although the risks related to failure to attract, develop, and
retain talent could materialize, we believe that this is unlikely
and that the impact on our reputation, business, financial
position, profit, and cash flows, or potential negative deviation
from our revenue and operating profit target would be major. We
classify this risk as a medium risk.

117

Organizational and Governance-Related
Risks
Laws and regulatory requirements in Germany, the United
States, and elsewhere continue to be very stringent.
As a European company domiciled in Germany with securities
listed in Germany and the United States, we are subject to
European, German, U.S., and other governance-related
regulatory requirements. Changes in laws and regulations and
related interpretations, including changes in accounting
standards and taxation requirements, and increased
enforcement actions, sanctions, for example United States
sanction requirements for Iran, and penalties might alter the
business environment in which we operate. Regulatory
requirements have become significantly more stringent in
recent years, and some legislation, such as the anticorruption
legislation in Germany, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,
the UK Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt
payments by employees, vendors, distributors, or agents, is
being applied more rigorously. Emerging markets are a
significant focus of our international growth strategy. The nature
of these markets presents a number of inherent risks. A failure
by SAP to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or any
related allegations of wrongdoing against us, whether merited or
not, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial
position, profit, cash flows and reputation.
It is difficult to assess the precise potential risk, because there is
a wide variety of complex legal and regulatory requirements that
apply, and therefore an equally wide variety of potential noncompliance scenarios exist.
However, we continuously monitor new and increased
regulatory requirements, updated or new enforcement trends,
and publicly available information on compliance issues in the
computer software industry, the emerging markets where we
invest our resources, and in the business environment in general
to cope with an increase in regulation enforcement efforts of
certain countries or state-driven protectionism. Based on this
information and any other available sources, we continuously
update and refresh our compliance programs to improve our
effectiveness and to ensure that our employees understand and
comply with the SAP Code of Business Conduct. This process is
coordinated by our Legal Compliance and Integrity Office, a
team of dedicated resources who are tasked with managing our
policy-related compliance measures. Our chief compliance
officer coordinates policy implementation, training, and
enforcement efforts throughout SAP. Those efforts are
monitored and tracked to allow trending and risk analysis and to
ensure consistent policy application throughout the SAP Group.
Despite our comprehensive compliance programs and
established internal controls, intentional efforts of individuals to
circumvent controls or engage in fraud for personal gains
cannot always be prevented.

118

With regards to the increase of regulation enforcement efforts
we have already experienced and continue to expect as well as
state-driven protectionism, we estimate the likelihood of this
risk to be unlikely. We cannot completely exclude the possibility
that this risk could have a major impact on our reputation,
business, financial position, profit, and cash flows, or cause a
negative deviation from our revenue and operating profit target.
We classify this risk as a medium risk.
Non-compliance with applicable data protection and privacy
laws or failure to adequately meet the requirements of SAP’s
customers with respect to our products and services could
lead to civil liabilities and fines, as well as loss of customers
and damage to SAP’s reputation.
As a global software and service provider, SAP is required to
comply with local laws wherever SAP does business.
Consequently, we must ensure that any legal requirements in
connection with the provision of products and services are
properly implemented. With regard to data protection
requirements, in May 2016, the EU enacted a “General Data
Protection Regulation” (GDPR), as a successor to the Data
Protection Directive of 1995, with the aim of further harmonizing
data protection laws across the EU. The GDPR will be directly
applicable law in all EU and EEA member states as of May 25,
2018 after a two-year transition period. Within limits, member
states can supplement the GDPR with additional national rules.
Overall, the GDPR does not introduce substantial new concepts.
It rather focuses on stronger compliance requirements and
enforces them vigorously on every business that processes
personal data of individuals in the EU/EEA, regardless of where
that business is established. Some of the new rules are subject
to further definition by the authorities, though, and others leave
room for interpretation.
Risks for SAP include:
– Violations of the GDPR might be punished with financial
penalties of up to the higher of €20 million or 4% of the
responsible company’s annual global turnover. Further
administrative measures include mandatory instructions by
the data protection supervisory authorities relating to
specific processing activities, up to their prohibition. Noncompliance might further lead to legal claims from affected
individuals and consumer protection organizations. Where
SAP processes data on behalf of its customers, violations
might lead to damage claims from customers. Noncompliance further bears the risk of reputational losses if
violations become publically known.
– Where member states can supplement the GDPR with
additional national rules, there is a risk that data protection
law will not be fully harmonized across Europe. As a
consequence, SAP would have to continue to adapt its
products and services to the individual national
requirements.

Combined Management Report | Risk Management and Risks

– The data protection concepts of the GDPR do not adequately
reflect the latest technological developments, such as big
data and machine learning. If the GDPR cannot be interpreted
in a way that allows for such technologies, or revised as
necessary, SAP might not be able to use and offer products
and services that implement such technologies in the
EU/EEA.
Overall, these laws and regulations amend and supplement
existing requirements regarding the processing of personal data
that SAP and SAP customers must fulfill and which we must
consequently address with our products and services, including
cloud delivery. Failure to comply with applicable laws or to
adequately address privacy concerns of customers, even if
unfounded, could lead to investigations by supervisory
authorities, civil liability, fines, (in the future, potentially
calculated based on the Company’s annual revenue), loss of
customers, damage to our reputation, and could have an
adverse effect on our business, financial position, profit, and
cash flows.
To mitigate risks due to legal non-compliance, SAP actively
monitors changes to applicable laws and regulations so that we
can take adequate measures and certify our existing standards
and policies on an ongoing basis. We have implemented a wide
range of measures to protect data controlled by SAP and our
customers from unauthorized access and processing, as well as
from accidental loss or destruction. This includes, among
others, a continuous enhancement of our data center operations
worldwide, also taking into account local and/or sector-specific
market and legal requirements. We have implemented a
certified data protection management system in areas critical to
data protection, such as digital business services, human
resources (HR), marketing, products and innovation, and
custom development, whereby implementation is audited
internally as well as externally by the British Standard
Institutions on an annual basis. Furthermore, customers are
provided with security certifications (such as ISO/IEC 27001),
security white papers, and reports from our independent
auditors and certification bodies.
With regard to the GDPR, the Data Protection & Privacy (DPP)
team initiated a project that established a working group across
all board areas. The aim of this project is to constructively assist
all SAP business units to ensure compliance with the GDPR. DPP
and Government Relations (GR) teams continue to work
together and actively voice our opinion through industryrecognized associations. This is in addition to DPP‘s direct
involvement with the European Commission and data protection
authorities of member states. Such actions intend to achieve a
use-oriented and forward-looking interpretation of the law while
balancing protection of personal privacy as well as aiming to
enhance European competitiveness.
We estimate this risk to be unlikely, and cannot rule out the
possibility of it having a business-critical impact on our

Combined Management Report | Risk Management and Risks

business, financial position, profit, and cash flows, and causing
damage to our reputation, or causing a negative deviation from
our revenue and operating profit target. We classify this risk as a
medium risk.
Failure to meet customer, partner, or other stakeholder
expectations or generally accepted standards on climate
change, energy constraints, and our social investment
strategy could negatively impact SAP’s business, results of
operations, and reputation.
Energy and emissions management are an integral component
of our holistic management of social, environmental, and
economic risks and opportunities. We have identified risks in
these major areas:
– Our solutions
– Our own operations  energy management and other
environmental issues such as carbon management, water
use, and waste
Because our customers, employees, and investors expect a
reliable energy and carbon strategy, we have reemphasized our
environmental policy and our previously communicated targets,
especially our 2020 target for greenhouse gas emissions. In
case these targets cannot be achieved, our customers might no
longer recognize SAP for our environmental leadership and
might buy other vendors' products and services. Consequently,
we could fail to achieve our revenue target. If we do not meet
stakeholder expectations in the areas identified, our rating in
sustainable investment indexes might decrease, which could
have an adverse effect on our reputation, profit, and share price.
In recent years, SAP has shown that it is possible to take a
proactive position on social and environmental issues while
delivering robust financial growth. As a result, we received great
recognition for our sustainability efforts. As a proof point for
SAP’s sustainability performance, we continue to be listed in the
most prominent and recognized sustainability indexes, such as
the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices and the CDP Climate
Performance and Disclosure Leadership Indices. In 2016, SAP’s
greenhouse gas emissions added up to 380 kilotons CO2, which
means we did meet our greenhouse gas emissions target of 400
kilotons by 20 kilotons. If we do not meet our greenhouse gas
emissions target for 2020, we might fail to meet expectations
regarding our energy and emission performance.
We believe that the risk of failing to meet expectations regarding
our energy and emission strategy is unlikely to occur and that if
the risk were to occur, it would only have a moderate impact on
our reputation, business, financial position, profit, and cash
flows, as well as on the achievement of our revenue and
operating profit target. We classify this risk as a low risk.
Unethical behavior and non-compliance with our integrity
standards due to intentional and fraudulent employee

119

behavior could seriously harm our business, financial
position, profit, and reputation.
SAP’s leadership position in the global market is founded on the
long-term and sustainable trust of our stakeholders worldwide.
Our heritage is one of corporate transparency, open
communication with financial markets, and adherence to
recognized standards of business integrity. The SAP Code of
Business Conduct, adopted by the Executive Board on January
29, 2003, and updated as necessary since then, memorialized
and supplemented the already existing guidelines and
expectations for the business behavior practiced at SAP.
However, we might encounter unethical behavior and noncompliance with our integrity standards due to intentional and
fraudulent behavior of individual employees, possibly in
collusion with external third parties. In addition to intentional
behavior, problems could also arise due to negligence in the
adherence to rules and regulations, especially in countries with a
high Corruption Perceptions Index and continuously increasing
business activities in profoundly regulated industries such as
public sector, healthcare, banking or insurance. Unethical
behavior and misconduct attributable to SAP could not only lead
to criminal charges, fines, and claims by injured parties, but also
to financial loss, and severe reputational damage. This could
have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, profit,
and cash flows.
To help prevent this, we instituted a comprehensive compliance
management system (CMS), which is based on the three pillars
of prevention, detection, and reaction. Our CMS program
comprises several educational, counseling, control, and
investigative instruments. The objective is to minimize and
mitigate the risk of unethical behavior, whether intentional or
negligent.
The SAP Code of Business Conduct is mandatory and applies to
every SAP employee. It provides legal compliance guidance on
how to avoid unethical behavior and solve dilemma situations.
On an annual basis, the SAP Code of Business Conduct is reconfirmed by SAP’s workforce (except where disallowed by local
legal regulations). We also rolled out and enforced various
additional compliance policies aimed at managing third parties
and preventing misuse of third-party payments for illegal
purposes; ensuring controls around travel, entertainment, gift,
and expense policies; and promoting a commitment to business
with integrity through our partner and vendor ecosystems.
These efforts are flanked by continuous education including elearning and classroom training to target audiences as identified
by compliance risk assessment. The overall CMS approach by
SAP is continuously monitored internally and externally, and
adapted accordingly, if needed.
Although we estimate the probability of occurrence of
intentional or negligent major unethical conduct to be unlikely,
we cannot exclude the possibility that this risk could materialize.

120

In that event, this risk could have a major impact on our
reputation, business, financial position, profit, and cash flows
and could cause a negative deviation from our operating profit
target. We classify this risk as a medium risk.

Communication and Information Risks
Our controls and efforts to prevent the unauthorized
disclosure of confidential information might not be effective.
Confidential information and internal information related to
topics such as our strategy, new technologies, mergers and
acquisitions, unpublished financial results, customer data or
personal data, could be prematurely or inadvertently disclosed
and subsequently lead to market misperception and volatility.
This could require us to notify multiple regulatory agencies and
comply with applicable regulatory requirements and, where
appropriate, the data owner, which could result in a loss of
reputation for SAP. For example, leaked information during a
merger or acquisition deal could cause the loss of our deal
target, or our share price could react significantly in case of
prematurely published financial results. This could have an
adverse effect on our market position and lead to fines and
penalties. In addition, this could have an adverse effect on our
business, financial position, profit, and cash flows.
We take a wide range of actions to prevent unauthorized
disclosure of information, including procedural and
organizational measures. These measures include mandatory
compliance base line trainings for all employees (including
fundamentals within security awareness, data privacy and data
protection, compliance and communication), social engineering
tests, standards for safe internal and external communication,
and technical security features in our IT hardware and
communication channels, such as mandatory encryption of
sensitive data.
Additionally, we combined organizationally all security groups
into one global security unit. This combined organization
strengthens the security capabilities and offers a wide range of
policies, guidelines and support on executing the success of
SAP’s security measures.
With the digital transformation, the increased use of cloud
solutions and social media by employees, a continual adoption
of internal security measures is meaningful to achieve and
maintain an effective and appropriate level of data protection
and privacy and to reinforce the position of SAP as a trusted
partner for its customers.
Although we estimate the likelihood of occurrence of this risk to
be remote, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that
this risk could have a business-critical impact on our reputation,
business, financial position, profit, and cash flows, or cause a
negative deviation from our operating profit target. We classify
this risk as a medium risk.

Combined Management Report | Risk Management and Risks

Financial Risks
Our sales are subject to quarterly fluctuations and our sales
forecasts might not be accurate.
Our revenue and operating results can vary and have varied in
the past, sometimes substantially, from quarter to quarter. Our
revenue in general, and our software revenue in particular, is
difficult to forecast for a number of reasons, including:
– The relatively long sales cycles for our products
– The large size, complexity, and extended timing of individual
customer transactions
– The introduction of licensing and deployment models such as
cloud subscription models
– The timing of the introduction of new products and services
or product and service enhancements by SAP or our
competitors
– Changes in customer budgets
– Decreased software sales that could have an adverse effect
on related maintenance and services revenue
– The timing, size, and length of customers' services projects
– Deployment models that require the recognition of revenue
over an extended period of time
– Adoption of, and conversion to, new business models leading
to changed or delayed payment terms
– Seasonality of a customers' technology purchases
– Limited visibility during the ongoing integration of acquired
companies into their ability to accurately predict their sales
pipelines and the likelihood that the projected pipeline will
convert favorably into sales
– Other general economic, social, environmental, and market
conditions, such as a global economic crisis and difficulties
for countries with large debt
Since many of our customers make their IT purchasing
decisions near the end of calendar quarters, and with a
significant percentage of those decisions being made during our
fourth quarter, even a small delay in purchasing decisions for
our on-premise software could have an adverse effect on our
revenue results for a given year. Our dependence on large
transactions has decreased in recent years with a trend towards
an increased number of transactions while the average deal size
is more or less constant.
However, the loss or delay of one or a few large opportunities
could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position,
profit, and cash flows.
We use a “pipeline” system for forecasting sales and trends in
our business. Pipeline analysis informs and guides our business
planning, budgeting, and forecasting, but pipeline estimates do
not necessarily consistently correlate to revenue in a particular
quarter, potentially due to one or more of the reasons outlined
above. The reliability of our plans, budgets, and forecasts might
therefore be compromised. Because our operating expenses are

Combined Management Report | Risk Management and Risks

based upon anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of
our expenses are relatively fixed in the near term, any shortfall in
anticipated revenue or delay in revenue recognition could result
in significant variations in our operating results from quarter to
quarter or year to year. Continued deterioration in global
economic conditions would make it increasingly difficult for us
to accurately forecast demand for our products and services,
and could cause our revenue, operating results, and cash flows
to fall short of our expectations and public forecasts. This could
have an adverse effect on our stock price. To the extent any
future expenditure fails to generate the anticipated increase in
revenue, our quarterly or annual operating results might be
subject to an adverse effect and might vary significantly
compared to preceding or subsequent periods. As we recognize
cloud subscriptions and support revenue over the respective
service period that typically ranges from one-to-three years with
some up to five years, the relevance and impact of sales
fluctuations decrease along with the growing importance of
these revenues.
Although we estimate the probability of occurrence of this risk
to be unlikely, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that
this risk could have a moderate impact on our business, financial
position, profit, and cash flows, or cause a negative deviation
from our revenue and operating profit target. We classify this
risk as a low risk.
External factors could impact our liquidity and increase the
default risk associated with, and the valuation of, our
financial assets.
Macroeconomic factors such as an economic downturn could
have an adverse effect on our future liquidity. We use a globally
centralized financial management to control financial risk, such
as liquidity, exchange rate, interest rate, counterparty, and
equity price risks. The primary aim is to maintain liquidity in the
SAP Group at a level that is adequate to meet our obligations at
any time. Our total Group liquidity is supported by our strong
operating cash flows, of which a large part is recurring, and by
credit facilities from which we can draw if necessary. However,
adverse macroeconomic factors could increase the default risk
associated with the investment of our total Group liquidity
including possible liquidity shortages limiting SAP’s ability to
repay financial debt. This could have an impact on the value of
our financial assets, which could have an adverse effect on our
business, financial position, profit, and cash flows.
SAP’s investment policy with regards to total Group liquidity is
set out in our internal treasury guideline, which is a collection of
uniform rules that apply globally to all companies in the SAP
Group. Amongst others, it requires that we invest, with limited
exceptions, only in assets and funds rated BBB flat or better.
The weighted average rating of the investments of our total
Group liquidity is in the area of A–. We continue to pursue a
policy of cautious investment characterized by wide portfolio

121

diversification with a variety of counterparties, predominantly
short-term investments, and standard investment instruments.
Although we estimate the probability of occurrence of this risk
to be remote, there can be no assurance that the prescribed
measures will be successful or that uncertainty in global
economic conditions could not have a major impact on our
business, financial position, profit, cash flows, or operating profit
target. We classify this decreased risk as a low risk.
Management use of estimates could negatively affect our
business, financial position, profit, and cash flows.
To comply with IFRS, management is required to make
numerous judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect
the reported financial figures. The facts and circumstances, as
well as assumptions on which management bases these
estimates and judgments and management’s judgment
regarding the facts and circumstances, might change over time
and this could result in significant changes in the estimates and
judgments and, consequently, in the reported financials. There
is a risk that such changes could have an adverse effect on our
business, financial position, profit and cash flows.
We have a number of control procedures in place to make sure
that our estimates and judgments are adequate. For example,
we apply two-person verification to significant estimating.
Although we estimate the probability of occurrence of the risk to
be unlikely, we cannot completely exclude the possibility of a
moderate impact on our business, financial position, profit, and
cash flows, or a negative deviation from our revenue and
operating profit target. We classify this risk as a low risk.
Current and future accounting pronouncements and other
financial reporting standards, especially but not only
concerning revenue recognition, might negatively impact our
financial results.
We regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial
reporting standards and review new pronouncements and drafts
thereof that are relevant to us. As a result of new standards,
changes to existing standards (including the new IFRS 15 on
revenue from contracts with customers that we will need to
adopt in 2018) and changes in their interpretation, we might be
required to change our accounting policies, particularly
concerning revenue recognition, to alter our operational policies
so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting
standards, or to restate our published financial statements.
Such changes might have an adverse effect on our reputation,
business, financial position, and profit, or cause an adverse
deviation from our revenue and operating profit target.
Although we estimate the probability of occurrence of the risk to
be unlikely, we cannot completely exclude the possibility of a
major impact. We classify this risk as a medium risk.

122

As a globally operating company, SAP is subject to various
financial risks, which could negatively impact our business,
financial position, profit, and cash flows.
Because we are operating throughout the world, a significant
portion of our business is conducted in foreign currencies. In
2016, approximately 73% of our revenue was attributable to
operations in foreign currencies and therefore gets translated
into our reporting currency, the euro. Consequently, periodover-period fluctuations can significantly impact our financial
results. In general, an appreciation of the euro has an adverse
effect while a depreciation has a positive effect. In addition to
exchange rate risks, we are exposed to interest rate and share
price fluctuations due to variable interest bearing assets and
liabilities and share-based compensation plans for our
employees and executives.
We continuously monitor our exposure to all of these financial
risks and have implemented adequate procedures to mitigate
them. For example, we pursue a group-wide foreign exchange
risk management strategy to hedge balance sheet items and
expected cash flows in foreign currencies by using derivative
financial instruments as appropriate. We have a balanced
maturity profile and mixture of fixed and floating interest rate
arrangements in place to hedge against interest rate risk and
use derivative instruments to reduce the impact of our sharebased compensation plans on our income statement and cash
flow.
Nevertheless, financial risks could negatively impact our
business, financial position, profit, and cash flows. We believe
the likelihood of such a risk with a material adverse effect on our
financial results is remote and if the risk were to occur, its
impact on our business, financial position, profit, and cash flows
could be major. We classify this risk as a low risk
For more information about risks arising from financial
instruments, including our currency and interest rate risks and
our related hedging activity, see the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements section, Notes (24) to (25).

Project Risks
Implementation of SAP software and cloud-based service
deliveries often involves a significant commitment of
resources by our customers and is subject to a number of
significant risks over which we often have no control.
A core element of our business is the successful implementation
of software and service solutions to enable our customers to
master complexity and help our customers’ business run at their
best. The implementation of SAP software and cloud-based
service deliveries is led by SAP, by partners, by customers, or by
a combination thereof. Depending on various factors, such as
the complexity of solutions, the customer’s implementation,
integration and migration needs, or the resources required, SAP

Combined Management Report | Risk Management and Risks

faces a number of different risks. For example, functional
requirement changes, delays in timeline, or deviation from
recommended best practices might occur during the course of a
project. These scenarios have a direct impact on the project
resource model and on securing adequate internal personnel or
consultants in a timely manner and could therefore prove
challenging.
Other aspects that could potentially affect our projects and
deliveries, especially during the transition to the Cloud are
security breaches or unauthorized access to confidential data,
operational data center and infrastructure disruptions as well as
local legislation with regards to data privacy.
As a result of these and other risks, SAP and/or some of our
customers have incurred significant implementation costs in
connection with the purchase and installation of SAP software
products and solutions. Some customer implementations have
taken longer than planned and failed to generate the profit
originally expected. We cannot guarantee that we can reduce or
eliminate protracted installation or significant third-party
consulting costs, for example, that trained consultants will be
readily available, that our costs will not exceed the fees agreed in
fixed-price contracts, or that customers will be satisfied with the
implementation of our software and solutions. Unsuccessful,
lengthy, or costly customer implementation and integration
projects could result in claims from customers, harm SAP’s
reputation, and could have an adverse effect on our business,
financial position, profit, and cash flows. Additionally, potentially
new contracting models based on subscription models for
services, support, and application management might lead to
challenges from a financial position perspective including profit
and cash flow.
Our customers continue to follow project approaches to
optimize their IT solutions in a non-disruptive manner. Our
projects also include risk management processes that are
integrated into SAP project management methods intended to
safeguard implementations with coordinated risk and quality
management programs. As part of our processes, we make
adequate financial planning provisions for the remaining
individual risks.
We estimate the probability of this risk to be unlikely, but we
cannot completely exclude the possibility that this risk could
have a major negative impact on our reputation, business,
financial position, profit, and cash flows, or cause a negative
deviation from our revenue and operating profit target. We
classify this risk as a medium risk.

Product and Technology Risks
Undetected security vulnerabilities shipped and deployed
within our products might cause damage to SAP and our
customers, and partners.

Combined Management Report | Risk Management and Risks

Customer systems or systems operated by SAP itself to provide
services could potentially be compromised by vulnerabilities if
they are exploited by hackers. This could lead to theft,
destruction, or abuse of data, or systems could be rendered
unusable (for example, due to distributed denial of service
attacks). The detection of security vulnerabilities in our
software, our customers’ systems, or SAP systems used in the
provision of services, especially in case of exploitation, could
prevent us from meeting our contractual obligations and
subsequently might lead to customer claims and reputational
damage, which might have an adverse effect on our business,
financial position, profit, and cash flows.
We have implemented a software security development lifecycle
as a mandatory integral part of our software development
process. For the Applications, Technology & Services segment
we systematically align our software security development
lifecycle to the recommendations of ISO/IEC 27034, applying
methods to develop secure software in all development phases
starting early in the design phase. This includes industry best
practices such as security risk identification, threat modeling, a
comprehensive security testing strategy, mandatory security
training for all developers, and security validation of our
products, patches, and services before shipment.
SAP has a software security response process in place to rapidly
react to detected vulnerabilities and provide fixes. We have also
improved the roll-out procedures for security-relevant notes,
patches, and service packs to ensure easy and fast consumption
on the customer side. However, with regards to the Applications,
Technology & Services segment, there is a risk that customers
do not upgrade or patch their business systems on a timely
basis according to SAP’s recommendations.
We cannot completely exclude the possibility of a negative
impact on our customers’ and partners’ or our own operations
globally or in one or more countries or regions. We estimate the
probability of occurrence of the risk of severe damages to
customers and SAP to be unlikely. If such an occurrence
happens, it could have a business-critical impact on our
reputation, business, financial position, profit, and cash flows as
well as on the achievement of our revenue and operating profit
target. We classify this risk as a medium risk.
Undetected defects in the introduction of new products,
product enhancements and cloud offerings could increase
our costs, and reduce customer demand.
Our development investment, including new product launches
and enhancements, is subject to risks. For example, software
products and services might not completely meet our highquality standards, including security standards; might not fulfill
market needs or customer expectations; or might not comply
with local standards and requirements. Furthermore, this risk
also exists with respect to acquired companies’ technologies
and products where we might not be able to manage these as

123

quickly and successfully as expected. Therefore, market
launches, entering new markets, or the introduction of new
innovations could be delayed or not be successful.
In addition, new products and cloud offerings, including thirdparty technologies we have licensed and open source software
components we use in those products, could contain
undetected defects or they are detected, or not be mature
enough from the customer’s point of view for business-critical
solutions after shipment in spite of all due diligence SAP puts
into quality and security. The detection and correction of any
defects especially after delivery could be expensive and timeconsuming and in some cases we might not be able to meet the
expectations of customers regarding time and quality in the
defect resolution process. In some circumstances, we might not
be in a position to rectify such defects or entirely meet the
expectations of customers, specifically as we are expanding our
product portfolio into additional markets. As a result, we might
have to fix defects in our software after shipment (so called
security response) or in some cases even face customer claims
for cash refunds, damages, replacement software, or other
concessions. The risk of defects and their adverse
consequences could increase as we seek to introduce a variety
of new software products and product enhancements at a
higher innovation rate. This is especially relevant for cloud
products as delivery cycles are even shorter (up to daily
deliveries) and our complete cloud product customer base could
receive undetected defects simultaneously. Furthermore, for
products that use third-party (not SAP) cloud services, we might
not always be able to detect defects in advance. Significant
undetected defects or delays in introducing new products or
product enhancements could affect market acceptance of SAP
software products and could have an adverse effect on our
reputation, business, financial position, profit, and cash flows.
The use of existing SAP software products by customers in
business-critical solutions and processes and the relative
complexity and technical interdependency of our software
products and services create a risk that customers or third
parties might pursue warranty, performance, or other claims
against us for actual or alleged defects in SAP software
products, in our provision of services, or in our application
hosting services. We have in the past been, and might in the
future be, subject to warranty, performance, or other similar
claims.
Although our contracts generally contain provisions designed to
limit our exposure due to actual or alleged defects in SAP
software products or in our provision of services, these
provisions might not cover every eventuality or be effective
under the applicable law. Regardless of its merits, any claim
could entail substantial expense and require the devotion of
significant time and attention by key management personnel.
Publicity surrounding such claims could affect our reputation
and the demand for our software.

124

We counter these risks using a broad range of techniques,
including project management, project monitoring, product
standards and governance, and rigid and regular quality
assurance measures certified to ISO 9001:2008, applicable to
the Applications, Technology & Services segment. Additionally,
we are introducing a new and improved risk-based secure
software development lifecycle with all the trainings, tools, and
processes in place to develop secure software. This spans from
specific security training curriculums for our developers, threat
modelling at the beginning of every development project to
identify potential risks early on to centrally provided security
tools (for example, static and dynamic analysis tools), a holistic
security testing strategy to validate the state of security for
every product before market introduction. In addition, direct
customer feedback is considered in the market release decision
process. Delivering high-quality software products is a priority
and part of our core business. Our strong investment and
permanent efforts lead to a generally high level of quality of our
products, which is made transparent in the defined quality
perception and support index and confirmed by our constantly
high customer satisfaction ratings as measured by customer
quality perception reporting.
With regards to the increased volume of open source software
components used in our software products and services as well
as in the products and services of our acquired companies, we
see a probability of this risk to materialize but rate the
probability as unlikely. We cannot completely exclude the
possibility that this risk, if it were to occur, could have a
business-critical impact on our reputation, business, financial
position, profit, and cash flows, or cause a negative deviation
from our revenue and operating profit target. We classify this
risk as a medium risk.
Changes in our rights to use software, cloud services, and
technologies we license from third parties that are an integral
part of SAP’s products and services could slow down time to
market and influence our license pricing and therefore the
competitiveness with other software vendors. Furthermore, it
could diminish our software’s or cloud functional capabilities
and therefore could jeopardize the stability of our solution
portfolio offering.
The numerous third-party solutions we have licensed and
certain open source software components we use have become
an integral part of our product and service portfolio. We depend
on those solutions for the functionality of our software and cloud
services. Changes to, or the loss of, third-party licenses as well
as open source licenses being construed could significantly
increase the cost of these licenses and significantly reduce
software or cloud functionality and/or usability or availability of
SAP’s software or cloud offerings. As a result, we might incur
additional development or license costs to ensure the continued
functionality of our products, experience delays in our ability to
offer or have to stop offering our products for sale, which could
have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, profit,

Combined Management Report | Risk Management and Risks

and cash flows. This risk increases with each of our acquisitions
of a company or a company’s intellectual property assets that
had been subject to third-party solution licensing, open source
software and product standards less rigorous than our own.
We strive to execute appropriate due diligence and contract
management processes and to continuously monitor
development projects through our product implementation
lifecycle process and monitoring as part of our cloud
deployment.
We believe that the probability of occurrence of this risk is likely
and we cannot exclude the possibility of a major impact on our
business, financial position, profit, and cash flows, or the
possibility of a negative deviation from our revenue and
operating profit target. We classify this risk as a medium risk.
If we are unable to keep up with rapid technological, process
and service innovations, and new business models as well as
changing market expectations, we might not be able to
compete effectively.
Our future success depends upon our ability to keep pace with
technological and process innovations and new business
models, as well as our ability to develop new products and
services, enhance and expand our existing products and
services portfolio, and integrate products and services we obtain
through acquisitions. To be successful, we are required to adapt
our products and our go-to-market approach to a cloud-based
delivery and consumption model to satisfy changing customer
demand and to ensure an appropriate level of adoption,
customer satisfaction and retention.
We might not be successful in bringing new business models,
solutions, solution enhancements, and/or services to market
before our competitors or at equally favorable conditions. We
might also face increasing competition from open source
software initiatives, or comparable models in which competitors
might provide software and intellectual property free and/or
under terms and conditions unfavorable for SAP. In addition, we
might not be able to generate enough revenue to offset the
significant research and development costs we incur to deliver
technological innovations or to offset the required infrastructure
costs to deliver our solutions and services as part of our new
business models. Moreover, we might not anticipate and
develop technological improvements or succeed in adapting our
products, services, processes, and business models to
technological change, changing regulatory requirements,
emerging industry standards, and changing requirements of our
customers and partners. Finally, we might not succeed in
producing high-quality products, enhancements, and releases in
a timely and cost-effective manner to compete with our
competitors, which could have an adverse effect on our
reputation, business, financial position, profit, and cash flows.

Combined Management Report | Risk Management and Risks

We will continue to align our organization, processes, products,
delivery and consumption models, and services to changing
markets and customer and partner demands. We develop new
technology and new solutions such as the next-generation suite
SAP S/4HANA or the next-generation business warehouse
BW/4HANA. Furthermore, we explore future trends as well as
the latest technologies e.g. through our network of innovation
centers under the leadership of our chief innovation officer and
adopt it if there is a clear business opportunity for SAP and if it
provides value to our customers. To ensure that we remain
competitive in the future, we conduct wide-ranging market and
technology analyses and research projects, often in close
cooperation with our customers and partners. We strive for
strategic acquisitions with the potential to drive innovation and
contribute to achieving our growth target.
We believe that the likelihood of this risk materializing is remote;
however, we cannot exclude the business-critical impact this
risk would have on our reputation, business, financial position,
profit, and cash flows, or the potential negative deviation from
our revenue and operating profit target if it were to materialize.
We classify this risk as a medium risk.
Our technology and/or product strategy might not be
successful or our customers and partners might not adopt
our technology platforms and other innovations as expected.
We might not be successful in integrating our platforms and
solutions, enabling the complete product and cloud service
portfolio, harmonizing our user interface design and technology,
integrating acquired technologies, or bringing new solutions
based on the SAP HANA platform as well as SAP HANA Cloud
Platform to the market as fast as expected, in particular,
innovative applications such as SAP S/4HANA or new
technologies such as Internet of Things or machine learning. In
addition, we might not be able to compete or partner effectively
in the area of cloud services and our new applications and
services might not meet customer expectations possibly
impacting customer satisfaction and retention. As a result, our
partner organizations and customers might not adopt our
technology platforms, applications, or cloud services quickly
enough or they might consider other competitive solutions in
the market. This could have an adverse effect on our reputation,
business, financial position, profit, and cash flows.
We believe that we will be able to deliver additional business
value with minimum disruption to our customers if we can
successfully drive the integration and convergence of our
technology platform offerings, SAP S/4HANA, as well as
acquired technologies, enable our current product portfolio for
SAP HANA, develop new solutions based on SAP HANA, and
offer comprehensive cloud-based services, extendable with SAP
HANA Cloud Platform. We enable and encourage partners to
leverage SAP technology by providing guidance about business
opportunities, architecture, and technology, as well as a

125

comprehensive certification program designed to ensure that
relevant third-party solutions are of consistently high quality.
We believe that the likelihood of this risk materializing is unlikely.
If this risk were to occur, its impact on our reputation, business,
financial position, profit, cash flows, and revenue and operating
profit target would be business-critical. We classify this risk as a
medium risk.
Our cloud offerings and related infrastructure might be
subject to a security attack, become unavailable, or fail to
perform properly.
The software used in our cloud portfolio is inherently complex
and any defects in product functionality, data center operations,
or system stability that cause interruptions in the availability of
our application portfolio could result in the following:
– Lost or delayed market acceptance and sales
– Breach of warranty or other contract breach or
misrepresentation claims
– Sales credits or refunds to our customers or partners
– Loss of customers and/or partners
– Diversion of development and customer service resources
– Breach of data protection and privacy laws and regulations
– Customers considering competitive cloud offerings
– Loss of customer satisfaction and brand reputation
The costs incurred in correcting any defects or errors might be
substantial and could have an adverse effect on our reputation,
business, financial position, profit, and cash flows. The
availability of our cloud applications could be interrupted by a
number of factors, resulting in customers’ inability to access
their cloud applications or receive their service level, system
outages or downtimes, failure of our network due to human or
other errors, security breaches, or variability in user traffic for
our cloud applications. Because of the large amount of data that
we collect and manage, hardware failures, defects in our
software, or errors in our systems could result in data loss or
corruption, or cause the information that we collect to be
incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our customers regard
as significant. Additionally, any loss of the right to use hardware
purchased or leased from third parties could result in delays in
our ability to provide our cloud applications until equivalent
technology is either developed by us or, if available, identified.
Furthermore, our cooperation with partners in the area of cloud
includes the co-location of data centers that might expose SAP
to additional risks in the area of security and data protection, as
well as the potential for breached service-level agreements by
partners.
We have administrative, technical, and physical security
measures in place as well as contracts that require third-party
data centers to have appropriate security and data protection
and privacy measures in place. In this context, customers might
demand to use only specific and/or local data centers. However,

126

if these security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action, employee error or malfeasance, or otherwise, and
if, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to our
customers' data, which might include personally identifiable
information regarding users, our reputation could be damaged,
our business might suffer, local data protection and privacy laws
or regulations might be breached, and we could incur significant
liability.
In addition, our insurance coverage might not cover claims
against us for loss or security breach of data or other indirect or
consequential damages. Moreover, defending a suit, regardless
of its merit, could be costly and time-consuming. In addition to
potential liability, if we experience interruptions in the availability
of our cloud applications, our reputation could be harmed and
we could lose customers.
Our mitigation measures have been designed and implemented
to minimize such adverse effects. We continuously invest in
protecting the integrity and security of our products and
services as well as internal and external data that is managed
within our data centers. We are consolidating and harmonizing
our data centers and our data protection measures, including
implementing security information and event management
solutions as well as network access control enforcement and we
monitor and invest to continuously improve our disaster
recovery and business continuity capabilities, to run a
homogeneous landscape that supports the complex
infrastructure, application, and security requirements so that we
can deliver the required service level for cloud services.
Although we estimate the probability of occurrence of this risk
to be unlikely, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that
any disruption of our cloud operations could result in a businesscritical impact on our reputation, business, financial position,
profit, cash flows, and revenue and operating profit target. We
classify this risk as a medium risk.

Operational Risks
Third parties have claimed, and might claim in the future,
that we infringe their intellectual property rights, which could
lead to damages being awarded against us and limit our
ability to use certain technologies in the future.
We believe that we will continuously be subject to intellectual
property infringement claims as our solution portfolio grows; as
we acquire companies with increased use of third-party code
including open source code; as we expand into new industries
with our offerings, resulting in greater overlap in the functional
scope of offerings; and as non-practicing entities that do not
design, manufacture, or distribute products increasingly assert
intellectual property infringement claims.
Any claims, with or without merit, and negotiations or litigation
relating to such claims, could preclude us from utilizing certain

Combined Management Report | Risk Management and Risks

technologies in our products, be time-consuming, result in
costly litigation, and require us to pay damages to third parties,
stop selling or reconfigure our products and, under certain
circumstances, pay fines and indemnify our customers, which
could have an adverse effect on our business, financial profile,
profit, cash flows, and reputation. They could also require us to
enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on terms that are
not favorable to us, cause product shipment delays, subject our
products to injunctions, require a complete or partial redesign of
products, result in delays to our customers’ investment
decisions, and damage our reputation.

reporting of potential risks associated with third-party
intellectual property.

Software includes many components or modules that provide
different features and perform different functions. Some of
these features or functions might be subject to third-party
intellectual property rights. The rights of another party could
encompass technical aspects that are similar to one or more
technologies in one or more of our products. Intellectual
property rights of third parties could preclude us from using
certain technologies in our products or require us to enter into
royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable or expensive
terms.

We are named as a defendant in various legal proceedings for
alleged intellectual property infringements. For more
information and a more detailed report relating to certain of
these legal proceedings, see the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, Note (23).

The software industry is making increasing use of open source
software in its development work on solutions. We also integrate
certain open source software components from third parties
into our software. Open source licenses might require that the
software code in those components or the software into which
they are integrated be freely accessible under open source
terms. Third-party claims might require us to make freely
accessible under open source terms one of our products or
third-party (not SAP) software upon which we depend.
SAP continues to participate in standards organizations and
increases the use of such standards in its products.
Participation in standards organizations might require the
licensing of SAP’s intellectual property to contributors to the
standard and to all standards implementers, including
competitors, on a non-discriminatory basis in accordance with
licensing terms defined by standards organizations. Within the
software-related standards field, there is a trend toward
expanding the scope of licensing obligations and narrowing an
intellectual property owner’s right to revoke a license if sued by
a licensee. In certain situations, limitations on SAP’s rights to
revoke a license could reduce SAP’s ability to assert a patent
infringement claim against a third-party. Assertion of patents
inadvertently licensed through standards could expose SAP to
third-party claims.
Our Legal Compliance & Integrity Office sets and manages
internal policies related to our Code of Business Conduct
including the handling of third-party intellectual property.
Corporate Audit monitors compliance with these policies
through various investigations. Our Global GRC organization
works closely with both the Legal Compliance & Integrity Office
and Corporate Audit and is responsible for the management and

Combined Management Report | Risk Management and Risks

We consider the probability of this risk materializing to be likely,
and that any claims concerning intellectual property rights of
third parties, open source requirements, or certain standards
could have a business-critical impact on our business, financial
position, profit, cash flows and reputation, as well as on the
achievement of our revenue and operating profit target, and
could also exacerbate the other risks we describe in this report.
We classify this risk as a high risk.

Claims and lawsuits against us could have an adverse effect
on our business, financial position, profit, cash flows, and
reputation.
Claims and lawsuits are brought against us, including claims and
lawsuits involving businesses we have acquired. Adverse
outcomes to some or all of the claims and lawsuits pending
against us might result in the award of significant damages or
injunctive relief against us that could hinder our ability to
conduct our business and could have an adverse effect on our
reputation, business, financial position, profit, and cash flows.
The outcome of litigation and other claims or lawsuits is
intrinsically uncertain. Management’s view of the litigation might
also change in the future. Actual outcomes of litigation and other
claims or lawsuits could differ from the assessments made by
management in prior periods, which are the basis for our
accounting for these litigations and claims under IFRS.
We consider the probability of occurrence of this risk to be likely,
and cannot exclude its business-critical impact on our
reputation, business, financial position, profit, cash flows, and
revenue and operating profit target if it were to materialize. We
classify this risk as a high risk.
For more information and a more detailed report relating to
certain of these legal proceedings, see the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (23).
We might not acquire and integrate companies effectively or
successfully and our strategic alliances might not be
successful.
To expand our business, we acquire businesses, products, and
technologies, and we expect to continue to make acquisitions in
the future. Over time certain of these acquisitions have
increased in size and in strategic importance for SAP,
Management negotiation of potential acquisitions and alliances

127

and integration of acquired businesses, products, or
technologies demands time, focus, and resources of
management and of the workforce. Acquisitions of companies,
businesses, and technology expose us to unpredictable
operational difficulties, expenditures, and risks. These risks
include, among others:

assurance that any such products or services will be
successfully developed or that we will not incur significant
unanticipated liabilities in connection with such arrangements.
We might not be successful in overcoming these risks and we
might therefore not benefit as anticipated from acquisitions or
alliances.

– Selection of the wrong integration model for the acquired
company and/or technology
– Failure to properly evaluate the acquired business and its
different business and licensing models
– Incorrect assumptions during due diligence process leading
to negative contribution with regards to an acquired company
– Failure to successfully integrate acquired technologies or
solutions into SAP’s solution portfolio and strategy in a timely
and profitable manner
– Failure to integrate the acquired company’s operations
across SAP’s different cultures, languages, and local
protocols, all within the constraints of applicable local laws
– Failure to meet the needs of the acquired company’s
customers and partners in the combined company
– The diversion of management’s time and attention from daily
operations
– Loss of key personnel of the acquired business
– Material unknown liabilities and contingent liabilities of
acquired companies, including legal, tax, accounting,
intellectual property, or other significant liabilities that might
not be detected through the acquisition due diligence
process
– Legal and regulatory constraints (such as contract
obligations, privacy frameworks, and agreements)
– Difficulties in implementing, restoring, or maintaining internal
controls, procedures, and policies
– Practices or policies of the acquired company that might be
incompatible with our compliance requirements
– An adverse effect on relationships with existing customers,
partners, or third-party providers of technology or products
– Difficulties in integrating the acquired company’s accounting,
HR, and other administrative systems and coordination of the
acquired company’s research and development (R&D), sales,
and marketing functions
– Debt incurrence or significant cash expenditures
– Constraints in enforcing acquired companies’ compliance
with existing SAP security standards in a timely manner
– Difficulties in customer implementation projects combining
technologies and solutions from both SAP and the acquired
company

We counter these acquisition-related risks with many different
methodological and organizational measures. These include
technical, operational, financial, and legal due diligence on the
company or assets to be acquired and a holistic evaluation of
material transaction and integration risks. The methods we use
depend on the integration scenario. Our integration planning is
detailed and standardized, and carried out by a dedicated
integration team. We therefore believe we have minimized this
risk.

In addition, acquired businesses might not perform as
anticipated, resulting in charges for the impairment of goodwill
and other intangible assets on our statements of financial
position. Such charges might have an adverse effect on our
business, financial position, profit, and cash flows. We have
entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, alliance
arrangements for a variety of purposes, including the
development of new products and services. There can be no

128

Although we estimate this risk to be unlikely, we cannot
completely exclude the possibility that this risk could have a
business-critical impact on our business, financial position,
profit, cash flows, and revenue and operating profit target. We
classify this risk as a medium risk.
We might not be able to obtain adequate title to, or licenses
in, or to enforce, intellectual property.
Protecting and defending our intellectual property is crucial to
our success. We use a variety of means to identify and monitor
potential risks and to protect our intellectual property. These
include applying for patents, registering trademarks and other
marks and copyrights, implementing measures to stop
copyright and trademark infringement, entering into licensing,
confidentiality, and non-disclosure agreements, and deploying
protection technology. Despite our efforts, we might not be able
to prevent third parties from obtaining, using, or selling without
authorization what we regard as our proprietary technology and
information. All of these measures afford only limited protection,
and our proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, held
unenforceable, or otherwise affected. Some intellectual property
might be vulnerable to disclosure or misappropriation by
employees, partners, or other third parties. Third parties might
develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or
superior to our technology. Finally, third parties might reverseengineer or otherwise obtain and use technology and
information that we regard as proprietary. Accordingly, we
might not be able to protect our proprietary rights against
unauthorized third-party copying or utilization, which could have
an adverse effect on our competitive and financial positions, and
result in reduced sales. Any legal action we bring to enforce our
proprietary rights could also involve enforcement against a
partner or other third party, which might have an adverse effect
on our ability, and our customers’ ability, to use that partner’s or
other third parties’ products. In addition, the laws and courts of
certain countries might not offer effective means to enforce our
intellectual property rights. This could have an adverse effect on

Combined Management Report | Risk Management and Risks

our reputation, business, financial position, profit, and cash
flows.
We rely on a combination of the protections provided by
applicable statutory and common law rights, including trade
secret, copyright, patent, and trademark laws, license and nondisclosure agreements, and technical measures to establish and
protect our proprietary rights in our products. We have
established various internal programs, such as internal policies,
processes, and monitoring, to assess and manage the risks
associated with standards organizations, open source, and
third-party intellectual property.
We might be dependent in the aggregate on technology that we
license from third parties that is embedded in our products or
that we resell to our customers. We have licensed and will
continue to license numerous third-party software products that
we incorporate into and/or distribute with our existing products.
We endeavor to protect ourselves in the respective agreements
by obtaining certain rights in case such agreements are
terminated.
We are party to certain patent cross-license agreements with
third parties.
We estimate the probability of this risk occurring as likely, and
that it could have a business-critical impact on our reputation,
business, financial position, profit, cash flows, and revenue and
operating profit target. We classify this risk as a high risk.
SAP’s business strategy focuses on certain business models
that are highly dependent on a working cyberspace. A
cybersecurity breach could have an adverse effect on our
customers, our reputation, and our business.
The key cybersecurity risks currently applicable to us include
state-driven economic espionage as well as competitor-driven
industrial espionage, and criminal activities including, but not
limited to, cyberattacks and “mega breaches” against cloud
services and hosted on-premise software. This might result in,
for example, disclosure of confidential information and
intellectual property, defective products, production downtimes,
supply shortages, and compromised data (including personal
data). A failure of our cybersecurity measures could impact our
compliance with legal demands (for example, Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, data
privacy) and expose our business operations as well as service
delivery to the described risks, for example, virtual attack,
disruption, damage, and/or unauthorized access. Additionally,
we could be subject to recovery costs, for example, as well as
significant contractual and legal claims by customers, partners,
authorities, and third-party service providers for damages
against us, which could have an adverse effect on our
reputation, business, financial position, profit, and cash flows.

Combined Management Report | Risk Management and Risks

To address the increasing cybersecurity threats, we are
continuously adapting and modifying our security procedures.
We have multiple security measures in place, such as technical
IT security measures, identity and access management, and
mandatory security and compliance training. In addition, our
security governance model clearly defines security management
accountabilities for all security areas regarding product security
and corporate security, which enables us to respond quickly to
identified cybersecurity risks. We have a global security function
as well as an independent security audit department within the
Corporate Audit organization in place appropriately addressing
potential security threats.
Although we still consider the occurrence of this risk to be
unlikely, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that this
risk could have a business-critical impact on our business,
financial position, profit, cash flows, and reputation as well as
revenue and operating profit target. We classify this risk as a
medium risk.
We might not be able to protect our critical information and
assets or to safeguard our business operations against
disruption.
SAP is highly dependent on the exchange of a wide range of
information across our global operations and on the availability
of our infrastructure. With regards to our physical environment,
we face several key security risks such as industrial and/or
economic espionage, serious and organized crime, and other
illegal activities, as well as violent extremism and terrorism. We
might be endangered by threats including, but not limited to,
social engineering, misuse, or theft of information or assets, or
damage to assets by trespassers in our facilities or by people
who have gained unauthorized physical access to our facilities,
systems, or information. These could have an adverse effect on
our business, financial profile, profit, and cash flows.
To minimize these risks, we have implemented several technical
and organizational measures designed to safeguard our
information, IT and facility infrastructure, and other assets.
These measures include, for example, physical access control
systems at facilities, multilevel access controls, closed-circuit
television surveillance, security personnel in all critical areas,
and recurring social engineering tests for SAP premises and
data centers. Access to information and information systems is
controlled using authorization concepts. Managers and
employees are regularly sensitized to the issues and given
mandatory security and compliance training. We keep these
measures under continuous review to mitigate current threats.
Although we estimate the probability of occurrence of this risk
to be unlikely, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that
any misuse, theft, or breach of security could have a major
impact on our business, financial position, profit, and cash flows
as well as on our revenue and operating profit target. Due to our

129

strategic transformation into cloud business operations, we
classify this risk as a medium risk.

business, financial position, profit, cash flows, and operating
profit target would be minor. We classify this risk as a low risk.

Our insurance coverage might not be sufficient and we might
be subject to uninsured losses.

Consolidated Risk Profile

We maintain insurance coverage to protect us against a broad
range of risks, at levels we believe are appropriate and
consistent with current industry practice. Our objective is to
exclude or minimize risk of financial loss at reasonable cost.
However, we might incur losses that might be beyond the limits,
or outside the scope, of coverage of our insurance and that
might limit or prevent indemnification under our insurance
policies. In addition, we might not be able to maintain adequate
insurance coverage on commercially reasonable terms in the
future. Further, certain categories of risks are currently not
insurable at reasonable cost, which could have an adverse effect
on our business, financial position, profit, and cash flows. Finally,
there can be no assurance of the financial ability of the
insurance companies to meet their claim payment obligations.
In view of the scope of our insurance coverage and our selection
of insurers, and because we keep our insurance programs under
constant review, we believe that the likelihood of this risk
materializing is remote.
However, we cannot exclude the possibility of a business-critical
impact on our business, financial position, profit, cash flows, and
operating profit target if the risk were to occur. We classify this
risk as a medium risk.

SAP consolidates and aggregates all risks reported by the
different business units and functions following our risk
management policy, monitored by a Group-wide risk
management governance function.
In 2016, we recognized only minor changes in the percentages
of all reported risks categorized as “high” or “medium” in our
risk-level matrix. The number of risks categorized as “high”
accounted for 11% (2015: 11%) of all reported risks, while the
risks categorized as “medium” accounted for 67% (2015: 68%)
of all risks reported in the Risk Factors section.
In our view, considering their likelihood of occurrence and
impact level, the risks described in our aggregated Risk Report
do not individually or cumulatively threaten our ability to
continue as a going concern. Management remains confident
that the Group’s earnings strength forms a solid basis for our
future business development and provides the necessary
resource to pursue the opportunities available to the Group.
Because of our strong position in the market, our technological
leadership, our highly motivated employees, and our structured
processes for early risk identification, we are confident that we
can continue to successfully counter the challenges arising from
the risks in our risk profile in 2017.

We could incur significant losses in connection with venture
capital investments.
Through Sapphire Ventures (formerly SAP Ventures), our
consolidated venture investment funds, we plan to continue
investing in new and promising technology businesses. Many
such investments initially generate net losses and require
additional expenditures from their investors. Changes to
planned business operations have, in the past affected, and
might in the future affect, the performance of companies in
which Sapphire Ventures holds investments, and that could
have an adverse effect on the value of our investments in
Sapphire Ventures, which could have an adverse effect on our
business, financial position, profit, and cash flows. Furthermore,
tax deductibility of capital losses and impairment in connection
with equity securities are often restricted and could therefore
have an adverse effect on our effective tax rate.
To address this risk, Sapphire Ventures diversifies its portfolio
and manages our investments actively. In addition, our venture
capital activities have a limited scope.
We believe that the likelihood of this risk materializing is remote
and that if the risk were to occur, its potential impact on our

Expected Developments
and Opportunities
Future Trends in the Global Economy
In its latest economic bulletin report, the European Central Bank
(ECB) predicts that the global economy will continue to
accelerate in 2017 although remain below its pre-crisis pace. It
also expects the pace of expansion will remain relatively stable
in 2017 in the advanced economies and improve slightly in the
emerging economies. Adverse effects of low commodity prices
on the commodity-exporting countries, the sustained
realignment of the Chinese economy, and political and economic
uncertainty in the United States could, however, dampen global
prospects in 2017, the ECB warns.
Looking at the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region,
the ECB believes that the euro area economy will continue to
recover further in 2017.It suggests that increased investment by
enterprises benefiting from favorable borrowing conditions and
improved earnings could be key factors in this growth. The
experts even forecast a surge in investment activity in the
Central and Eastern European countries in 2017 and dynamic
consumer spending, both of which should help drive economic
development there. Russia’s economy should begin to expand
again in 2017, for the first time since coming out of its recession,
the ECB says.
With regards to the North America and Latin America
(Americas) region, the ECB writes that while uncertainty about
the future political and economic course of the United States
following the inauguration of the new president is currently very
high, it nevertheless anticipates a moderate increase in US
economic growth in 2017. As for Brazil, it should be able to leave
its recession behind it in 2017, the ECB says, though large fiscal
consolidation needs will continue to weigh on the country.
In the Asia Pacific Japan (APJ) region, Japan’s economy is
projected to continue to expand at the same restrained pace as
the preceding year. The ECB predicts that the underlying
economic momentum in Japan will remain weak. Lastly,
economic growth in China is likely to continue to decelerate in
2017, primarily due a renewed slowdown in investment growth
as Chinese enterprises cut back overcapacity, the ECB says.

The IT Market: The Outlook for 2017
“Worldwide IT spending is projected to total $3.5 trillion in 2017,
a 2.7 percent increase from 2016,” according to a January 2017
Gartner Press Release by Gartner, a market research firm.
“However, this growth rate is down from earlier projections of 3
percent.2017 was poised to be a rebound year in IT spending.
Some major trends have converged, including cloud, blockchain,
digital business, and artificial intelligence. Normally, this would
have pushed IT spending much higher than 2.7 percent growth.
[…] However, some of the political uncertainty in global markets
has fostered a wait-and-see approach causing many enterprises
to forestall IT investments. The range of spending growth from
the high to low is much larger in 2017 than in past years.
Normally, the economic environment causes some level of

131

division, however, in 2017 this is compounded by the increased
levels of uncertainty. […] The result of that uncertainty is a
division between individuals and corporations that will spend
more – due to opportunities arising – and those that will retract
or pause IT spending.”
Gartner data indicate software will be the best-performing
segment with software spending increasing by 7.2% (see table
below). “Buyer investments in digital business, intelligent
automation, and services optimization and innovation continue
to drive growth in the market, but buyer caution, fueled by broad
economic challenges, remains a counter-balance to faster
growth,” says Gartner.
Within the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region, the
table below shows that IT spending in Western European
countries will grow 1.5% in 2017, whereas Western European
software spending will increase considerably by 6.2%.
According to the table below, IT spending in the Americas region
will expand in 2017 by 2.6% in North America and 2.1% in Latin
America.
IT spending in the Asia Pacific Japan (APJ) region is expected to
expand by 3.0% (Mature Asia/Pacific without Japan) and 5.9%
(Emerging Asia/Pacific without China) in 2017 (see table below).
IT spending in Greater China is expected to grow 5.1% in 2017
(see table below).

Impact on SAP

billion), in line with the previous 2017 ambition which was
raised at the beginning of 2016. The upper end of this range
represents a growth rate of 34% at constant currencies.
– The Company expects full year 2017 non-IFRS cloud &
software revenue to increase by 6% − 8% at constant
currencies (2016: €18.43 billion).
– The Company expects full year 2017 non-IFRS total revenue
in a range of €23.2 billion to €23.6 billion at constant
currencies (2016: €22.07 billion). This is above the previous
2017 ambition which was raised at the beginning of 2016.
– The Company expects full-year 2017 non-IFRS operating
profit to be in a range of €6.8 billion − €7.0 billion at constant
currencies (2016: €6.63 billion). This is above the previous
2017 ambition which was raised at the beginning of 2016.
We expect our headcount to increase at a slightly lower pace
than in 2016.

SAP expects to outperform the global economy and the IT
industry again in 2017 in terms of revenue growth.

While our full-year 2017 business outlook is at constant
currencies, actual currency reported figures are expected to
continue to be impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations.

As last year, our 2016 results validate our strategy of innovating
across the core, the cloud, and business networks to help our
customers become true digital enterprises. Our innovation cycle
for SAP S/4HANA is well underway and the completeness of our
vision in the cloud continues to distinguish SAP from both legacy
players and providers of cloud-based point solutions. We
achieved all key performance indicators raised in our business
outlook in October.

We expect that non-IFRS total revenue will continue to depend
largely on the revenue from cloud and software. However, the
revenue growth we expect from this is below the outlook
provided for non-IFRS cloud subscriptions and support revenue.
We expect the software license revenue in 2017 to decline by low
to mid-single digit compared to 2016. However we will
continuing to gain market share against our main on-premise
license competitors.

On this basis, we consider ourselves well-prepared for the future
and expect profitable growth in 2017 as well. As such, we are
raising our ambitious goals for 2020. Balanced in terms of
regions as well as industries, we remain well-positioned with our
product offering to offset individual fluctuations in the global
economy and IT market.

We continuously strive for profit expansion in all our reportable
segments leading to a SAP Group profit expansion as outlined in
the given 2017 outlook. For SAP’s managed-cloud offerings, we
expect a positive gross margin result in 2017 according to
outlined long-term 2020 planning.

A comparison of our business outlook with forecasts for the
global economy and IT industry shows that we can be successful
even in a tough economic environment and increased
geopolitical uncertainty, and will further strengthen our position
as the market leader of enterprise application software.

Operational Targets for 2017 (NonIFRS)
Revenue and Operating Profit Outlook
The Company is providing the following 2017 outlook:
– Based on the continued strong momentum in SAP’s cloud
business the Company expects full year 2017 non-IFRS cloud
subscriptions and support revenue to be in a range of €3.8
billion − €4.0 billion at constant currencies (2016: €2.99

The Company expects a full-year 2017 effective tax rate (IFRS)
of 26.0% to 27.0% (2016: 25.3%) and an effective tax rate (nonIFRS) of 27.0% to 28.0% (2016: 26.8%).

Outlook for SAP SE

Goals for Liquidity and Finance
On December 31, 2016, we had a negative net liquidity. We
believe that our liquid assets combined with our undrawn credit
facilities are sufficient to meet our present operating financing
needs also in 2017 and, together with expected cash flows from
operations, will support debt repayments and our currently
planned capital expenditure requirements over the near term
and medium term.
In 2017, we expect a positive development of our operating cash
flow, which we anticipate will reach up to €5.0 billion.
We intend to repay €1 billion Eurobonds when they mature in
April 2017 as well as US$443 million U.S. private placements in
October and November 2017.
In the absence of large acquisitions, we expect our strong
operating cash flow will generate excess cash in the next 6-12
months. Based on the actual acquisition volume and liquidity
development we would consider a potential share buyback in the
second half of 2017.

Investment Goals
Our planned capital expenditures for 2017 and 2018, other than
from business combinations, mainly comprise the construction
activities described in the Assets (IFRS) section of this report.
We expect investments from these activities of approximately
€365 million in 2017 (an increase of 20% compared to the
previous year), and approximately €250 million in 2018. These
investments can be covered in full by operating cash flow.
SAP is not currently planning any significant acquisitions in 2017
and 2018 but will rather focus on organic growth, complemented
by minor acquisitions. In 2017, we intend to spend up to €1.0
billion for smaller acquisitions.

Proposed Dividend
We intend to continue our dividend policy in 2017 as well, which
is to pay a dividend totaling more than 35% of the prior year’s
profit after tax.

Premises on Which Our Outlook Is Based
In preparing our outlook, we have taken into account all events
known to us at the time we prepared this report that could
influence SAP’s business going forward.
Among the premises on which this outlook is based are those
presented concerning economic development and the

134

assumption that there will be no effects from major acquisitions
in 2017 and 2018.

The primary source of revenue for SAP SE is the license fees it
charges subsidiaries for the right to market and maintain SAP
software solutions. Consequently, the performance of SAP SE in
operating terms is closely tied to the cloud and software revenue
of the SAP Group.
We expect SAP SE product revenue to increase at constant
currencies generally in line with the 6% to 8% constantcurrency rise in non-IFRS cloud and software revenue
anticipated for the SAP Group in 2017.
Assuming there are no special effects relating to acquisitions or
internal corporate restructuring measures in 2017, we also
expect the operating profit of SAP SE to increase slightly.
Provided the SAP Group continues to hit its revenue and profit
targets, we expect SAP SE to sustain revenue and operating
income growth into the medium term.
We believe SAP SE, the parent company of the SAP Group, will
receive investment income in the form of profit transfers and
dividends again in the future. The growth we expect from the
SAP Group should have a positive effect on SAP SE investment
income.
The outlook projections for the SAP Group in respect of liquidity,
finance, investment, and dividend are equally applicable to SAP
SE.
Among the assumptions underlying this outlook are those
presented above concerning the economy and our expectations
for the performance of the SAP Group.

Medium-Term Prospects
In this section, all numbers are based exclusively on non-IFRS
measures.
We expect to grow our more predictable revenue business while
steadily increasing operating profit. Our strategic objectives are
focused primarily on the following financial and non-financial
objectives: growth, profitability, customer loyalty, and employee
engagement.
We raised our 2020 ambition to reflect the Company’s
consistent fast growth in the cloud, solid software momentum,
and operating profit expansion as well as the exchange rate
development. Assuming an exchange rate environment
comparable to 2016, SAP strives to reach the following in 2020:
– €8.0 billion to €8.5 billion cloud subscriptions and support
revenue (previously €7.5 billion to €8.0 billion)

Combined Management Report | Expected Developments and Opportunities

– €28 billion to €29 billion total revenue (previously €26 billion
to €28 billion)
– €8.5 billion to €9.0 billion operating profit (previously €8.0
billion to €9.0 billion)
We continue to expect the share of more predictable revenue
(defined as the total of cloud subscriptions & support revenue
and software support revenue) to reach 70% to 75% in 2020.
By 2020, we expect our business network and public cloud
offerings to generate approximately the same portion of cloud
subscriptions and support revenue. Both of these offerings are
expected to each generate, in 2020, cloud subscriptions and
support revenues that are significantly higher than the cloud
subscriptions and support revenue generated from our private
cloud offerings.
Our revenue growth trajectory through 2020 is expected to be
driven by continued strong growth in the cloud, low to midsingle-digit declines in software revenue and continued growth
in our software support revenue. This is all expected to drive
high single-digit growth in cloud and software revenue through
2020.
We also strive for significantly improving, over the next few
years, the profitability of our cloud business. In 2017, we will
continue the investment phase of our cloud business. As of
2018, we expect to see the benefits from those efficiency-based
investments and increasing cloud gross margin. We expect
these improvements to continue in the following years to reach
our envisioned long-term cloud subscriptions and support
margin targets in 2020. These will continue to increase at
different rates per cloud operations model: We expect the gross
margin from our public cloud to reach approximately 80%
(2016: 62.0%) in 2020. Likewise, we expect our business
network gross margin to reach approximately 80% (2016:
75.9%) in 2020. The gross margin for our private cloud is
expected to reach about 40% (2016: -5.4%) in 2020. The
combined cloud gross margin is expected to be approximately
73% in 2020.
We also aim at further improving the profitability of our onpremise software business. The gross margin for our software
licenses and support is expected to remain at least stable at
approximately 88% (2016: 87.4%) in 2020.
In addition, we expect our services gross margin to reach
approximately 20% (2016: 18.2%) in 2020.
As we look to increase our profitability through 2020, our cost
ratios (cost as a % of total revenue) are expected to develop as
follows through 2020: Research and development is expected to
decline slightly, Sales and marketing is expected to follow the
growth of the business and General and administration is
expected to remain stable.

Non-Financial Goals 2017 and
Ambitions for 2020
In addition to our financial goals, we also focus on two nonfinancial targets: customer loyalty and employee engagement.
For 2017 through to 2020, we aim to reach an Employee
Engagement Index between 84% and 86% (2016: 85%).
We measure customer loyalty using the Customer Net Promoter
Score (NPS). In 2017, we target achieving a combined Customer
NPS of 21% to 23%, with our medium-term goal of reaching a
combined Customer NPS of 35% to 40% by 2020 (2016:
19.2%).

Opportunities
Our customers rely on SAP as the trusted partner in their digital
business transformation, not only for providing in-memory
technology, standardized on-premise and cloud solutions, and
access to business networks, but also for helping them drive
new business outcomes and enabling business model
innovations. To meet these expectations, we must grow
consistently and accelerate the pace of our own business
transformation by exploiting new opportunities.
We have established a framework for opportunity management
by evaluating and analyzing four key areas: current markets,
competitive landscapes, external scenarios, and technological
trends. Additionally, we have delved into customer and product
segmentation, growth drivers, and industry-specific success
factors. Based on these combined insights, our Executive Board
defines our market strategies. Our shareholder value relies
heavily upon a fine balance of risk mitigation and value-driven
opportunities. Therefore, our strong governance model ensures
that decisions are based on return, investment required, and
risk mitigation. We rely on the talent and resources within SAP
and our entire ecosystem.
As far as opportunities are likely to occur, we have incorporated
them into our business plans, our outlook for 2017, and our
medium-term prospects outlined in this report. Therefore, the
following section focuses on future trends or events that might
result in an uplift of our outlook and medium-term prospects, if
they develop better than we have anticipated in our forecasts.
SAP SE is the parent company of the SAP Group and earns most
of its revenue from software license fees, subscriptions fees,
and dividends paid by affiliates. Consequently, the opportunities
described below also apply – directly or indirectly – to SAP SE.

Opportunities from Economic Conditions
Economic conditions have a clear influence on our business,
financial position, profit, and cash flows. Should the global
economy experience a more sustained growth than is reflected

Combined Management Report | Expected Developments and Opportunities

135

in our plans today, our revenue and profit may exceed our
current outlook and medium-term prospects.
Our midterm planning is based on unchanged market conditions
in emerging markets. Should their stability increase again, this
would be an upside to our midterm planning.
For more information about future trends in the global economy
and the IT market outlook as well as their potential influence on
SAP, see the Expected Developments and Opportunities section.

Opportunities from Research and
Development Traction
Our continued growth through innovation is based on our ability
to leverage research and development (R&D) resources
effectively. We continue to improve our development processes
through design thinking and lean methodologies. We are
accelerating innovation cycles especially in the area of cloud
solutions and engaging more closely with our customers to
ensure accuracy and success. In addition, we have generated a
new structure that enables innovations in a startup-like
environment and ecosystem.
While speed is a key strength, we also focus on ease of adoption
and providing compelling returns. This allows our customers to
easily consume technologies and software applications with
immediate benefits for their businesses. If we make innovations
available faster than currently anticipated, or if customers adopt
the innovations faster than currently expected, for example,
shifting faster to managed clouds for enterprise resource
planning, or shifting faster to our new SAP S/4HANA solutions,
this could positively impact our revenue, profit, and cash flows,
and result in their exceeding our stated outlook and mediumterm prospects.
For more information about future opportunities in research and
development for SAP, see the Products, Research and
Development, and Services section as well as the Expected
Developments and Opportunities section.

Opportunities from Our Strategy for
Profitable Growth
SAP strives to generate profitable growth across our portfolio of
products, solutions, and services to keep or improve its market
position. Our aim is to continue to expand our addressable
market to €320 billion in 2020, based on new assets in our SAP
Business Network Segment, our new technologies and
innovations, and the extension of our cloud portfolio.
We see opportunities in growing product and market areas, such
as in-memory computing, cloud, mobile, business networks,
social media, Big Data, the Internet of Things, machine learning,
artificial intelligence, predictive analytics and especially all
business developments that are targeted at the digital business

136

transformation which is key to our strategy. In addition to
organic developments and tuck-in acquisitions, large strategic
acquisitions in particular may boost our revenue and profits
significantly. Furthermore, SAP seeks to establish new business
models and leverage our expanding ecosystem of partners to
achieve scale and maximize opportunities.
Our strong assets in applications and analytics, as well as
database and technology, continue to offer solid multiyear
growth opportunities as we bring innovative technologies with
simplified consumption to our installed base and continue to
add net-new customers. Unexpected portfolio growth may
positively impact our revenue, profit, and cash flows, and result
in their exceeding our stated outlook and medium-term
prospects. Specifically, SAP HANA, cloud offerings, and
SAP S/4HANA solutions, could create even more demand than
is reflected in our stated outlook and medium-term prospects.
Further upside potential is possible by higher than expected
renewal rates of our cloud solutions.
For more information about future opportunities for SAP, see
the Strategy and Business Model section as well as the Expected
Developments and Opportunities section.

Opportunities from Our Partner Ecosystem
SAP continues to grow and develop a global partner ecosystem.
To increase market coverage, we want to enhance our portfolio
and spur innovation with the specified objective of increasing the
partner revenue contribution to SAP’s overall revenue target. In
addition to strengthening our core, we leverage our entire
ecosystem to drive adoption of SAP HANA, cloud solutions,
SAP S/4HANA, and SAP Cloud Platform (formerly called SAP
HANA Cloud Platform). This includes strategic partnerships
across all areas: third-party software vendors, systems
integrators, service providers, and infrastructure providers. As a
result, we are creating an ever-stronger setup, where SAP, along
with our customers and partners, co-innovate and develop new
innovative solutions on and with SAP HANA. Should the
business of our partners develop better than currently expected,
our indirect sales (partner revenue) could grow stronger than
reflected in our outlook and medium-term prospects. This may
positively impact our revenue, profit, and cash flows, and result
in their exceeding our stated medium-term prospects.

Opportunities from Our Employees
Our employees drive our innovation, provide the value to our
customers, and consistently promote our growth and
profitability. In 2016, we significantly increased the number of
full-time employees in key strategic areas to support our growth
ambitions. We anticipate improvements in employee
productivity as a result of our continued endeavors in designthinking principles. As described in the Employees and Social
Investment section, we continuously invest in our talents to
increase engagement, collaboration, social innovation, and
health.

Combined Management Report | Expected Developments and Opportunities

To ensure continuous innovation and sustained business
success, we need to continuously tap into the global talent pool
and bring the best and brightest talent to SAP. To do so, we aim
to further strengthen our brand perception in the market and
optimize our recruiting experience to emphasize our mission to
help the world run better and improve people’s lives.
Furthermore, we will maximize mobile channels and innovative
talent strategies to tap into new talent pools.
Our outlook and medium-term prospects are based on certain
assumptions regarding employee turnover and our Business
Health Culture Index (as defined in the Employees and Social
Investment section). Should these develop better than expected
there might be an upside to employee productivity and
engagement. In turn, this might positively impact our revenue,
profit, and cash flows, and result in their exceeding our stated
medium-term prospects.
For more information about future opportunities from our
employees, see the Employees and Social Performance section.

Opportunities from Our Customer
Engagement
SAP goes to market by region, customer segments, line of
business, and industry. We evolve and invest in our go-tomarket coverage model to effectively sell industry-specific
solutions while increasing our engagement with customers. We
focus on the dynamic and fast-changing landscape each
industry faces as technology evolves.
We offer unique services that support a significant return on
investment, and continue to actively look at new opportunities to
increase the value we deliver to our customers.
In general, our outlook and medium-term prospects are based
on certain assumptions regarding the success of our go-tomarket approaches. If the actual go-to-market success exceeds
these assumptions, this could positively impact our revenue,
profit, and cash flows, and result in their exceeding our stated
medium-term prospects.

Notes
(1) General Information About
Consolidated Financial Statements

(3) Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for 2016
of SAP SE and its subsidiaries (collectively, “we,” “us,” “our,”
“SAP,” “Group,” and “Company”) have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS).

(3a) Bases of Measurement

We have applied all standards and interpretations that were
effective on and endorsed by the European Union (EU) as at
December 31, 2016. There were no standards or interpretations
impacting our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years
ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, that were effective
but not yet endorsed. Therefore, our Consolidated Financial
Statements comply with both IFRS as issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and with IFRS
as endorsed by the EU.

Reclassifications

All amounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements
are reported in millions of euros (€ millions) except where
otherwise stated. Due to rounding, numbers presented
throughout this document may not add up precisely to the totals
we provide and percentages may not precisely reflect the
absolute figures.

Where applicable, information about the methods and
assumptions used in determining the respective measurement
bases is disclosed in the Notes specific to that asset or liability.

(3b) Relevant Accounting Policies

Our Executive Board approved the Consolidated Financial
Statements on February 22, 2017, for submission to our
Supervisory Board.

December 31, 2014

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on
the historical cost basis except for the following:
– Derivative financial instruments, available-for-sale financial
assets, and liabilities for cash-settled share-based payments
are measured at fair value.
– Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated at period-end exchange rates.
– Post-employment benefits are measured according to IAS 19
(Employee Benefits) as described in Note (18a).

Under the ONE Service approach, we combined premium
support services and professional services under one
comprehensive service offering. This combination triggered
changes in our service go-to-market methodology and setup,
resulting in an organizational separation of services sales and
services delivery. As a result of these changes, we now classify
all sales expenses relating to our services offering, which were
previously recognized as cost of services, as sales and
marketing expenses. We take the view that this policy provides
more reliable and more relevant information because it
classifies sales and marketing expenses consistently across our
product and services portfolio.
The new policy has been applied retrospectively to the prior
periods presented. The effect on the financial year 2015 was an
increase in sales and marketing expenses and a respective
decrease in cost of services totalling €381 million
(2014: €290 million).

Business Combinations and Goodwill
We decide on a transaction-by-transaction basis whether to
measure the non-controlling interest in the acquiree at fair value
or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net
assets. Acquisition-related costs are accounted as expense in
the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are
received, with the expense being classified as general and
administration expense.

Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS and Notes | Notes

Foreign Currencies
Income and expenses and operating cash flows of our foreign
subsidiaries that use a functional currency other than the euro
are translated at average rates of foreign exchange (FX)
computed on a monthly basis. Exchange differences resulting

from foreign currency transactions are recognized in other nonoperating income/expense, net.
The exchange rates of key currencies affecting the Company
were as follows:

Revenue Recognition
Classes of Revenue
We derive our revenue from fees charged to our customers for
(a) the use of our hosted cloud offerings, (b) licenses to our onpremise software products, and (c) standardized and premium
support services, consulting, customer-specific on-premise
software development agreements, training, and other services.
Cloud and software revenue, as presented in our Consolidated
Income Statements, is the sum of our cloud subscriptions and
support revenue, our software licenses revenue, and our
software support revenue.
– Revenue from cloud subscriptions and support represents
fees earned from providing customers with the following:
 Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), that is, a right to use
software functionality in a cloud-based-infrastructure
(hosting) provided by SAP, where the customer does not
have the right to terminate the hosting contract and take
possession of the software to run it on the customer’s own
IT infrastructure or by a third-party hosting provider
without significant penalty, or
 Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), that is, access to a cloudbased infrastructure to develop, run, and manage
applications, or
 Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), that is, hosting services
for software hosted by SAP, where the customer has the
right to terminate the hosting contract and take
possession of the software at any time without significant
penalty and related application management services, or
 Additional premium cloud subscription support beyond
the regular support that is embedded in the basic cloud
subscription fees, or
 Business Network Services, that is, connecting companies
in a cloud-based-environment to perform business
processes between the connected companies.

Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS and Notes | Notes

– Software licenses revenue represents fees earned from the
sale or license of software to customers for use on the
customer’s premises, in other words, where the customer
has the right to take possession of the software for
installation on the customer’s premises (on-premise
software). Software licenses revenue includes revenue from
both the sale of our standard software products and
customer-specific on-premise software development
agreements.
– Software support revenue represents fees earned from
providing customers with standardized support services
which comprise unspecified future software updates,
upgrades, enhancements, and technical product support
services for on-premise software products. We do not sell
separately technical product support or unspecified software
upgrades, updates, and enhancements. Accordingly, we do
not distinguish within software support revenue or within cost
of software support the amounts attributable to technical
support services and unspecified software upgrades,
updates, and enhancements.
Services revenue as presented in our Consolidated Income
Statements represents fees earned from providing customers
with the following:
– Professional services, that is, consulting services that
primarily relate to the installation and configuration of our
cloud subscriptions and on-premise software products
– Premium support services, that is, high-end support services
tailored to customer requirements
– Training services
– Messaging services (primarily transmission of electronic text
messages from one mobile phone provider to another)
– Payment services in connection with our travel and expense
management offerings.

147

We account for out-of-pocket expenses invoiced by SAP and
reimbursed by customers as cloud subscriptions and support,
software support, or services revenue, depending on the nature
of the service for which the out-of-pocket expenses were
incurred.

separately priced or not, is recognized ratably over the license
term unless a substantive support service renewal rate exists; if
this is the case, the amount allocated to the delivered software
is recognized as software licenses revenue based on the residual
method once the basic criteria described above have been met.

Timing of Revenue Recognition

In general, our on-premise software license agreements include
neither acceptance-testing provisions nor rights to return the
software. If an arrangement allows for customer acceptancetesting of the software, we defer revenue until the earlier of
customer acceptance or when the acceptance right lapses. If an
arrangement allows for returning the software, we defer
recognition of software revenue until the right to return expires.

We do not start recognizing revenue from customer
arrangements before evidence of an arrangement exists, the
amount of revenue and associated costs can be measured
reliably, collection of the related receivable is probable and the
delivery has occurred, respectively the services have been
rendered. If, for any of our product or service offerings, we
determine at the outset of an arrangement that the amount of
revenue cannot be measured reliably, we conclude that the
inflow of economic benefits associated with the transaction is
not probable, and we defer revenue recognition until the
arrangement fee becomes due and payable by the customer. If,
at the outset of an arrangement, we determine that collectability
is not probable, we conclude that the inflow of economic
benefits associated with the transaction is not probable, and we
defer revenue recognition until the earlier of when collectability
becomes probable or payment is received. If a customer is
specifically identified as a bad debtor at a later point in time, we
stop recognizing revenue from the customer except to the
extent of the fees that have already been collected.
In general, we invoice fees for standard software upon contract
closure and delivery. Periodical fixed fees for cloud subscription
services and software support services are mostly invoiced
yearly or quarterly in advance. Fees based on actual transaction
volumes for cloud subscriptions and fees charged for nonperiodical services are invoiced as the services are delivered.
Cloud subscriptions and support revenue is recognized as the
services are performed. Where a periodical fixed fee is agreed
for the right to continuously access and use a cloud offering for
a certain term, the fee is recognized ratably over the term
covered by the fixed fee. Fees that are based on actual
transaction volumes are recognized as the transactions occur.
In general, our cloud subscriptions and support contracts
include certain set-up activities. If these set-up activities have
stand-alone value, they are accounted for as distinct
deliverables with the respective revenue being classified as
service revenue and recognized as the set-up activity is
performed. If we conclude that such set-up activities are not
distinct deliverables, we do not account for them separately.
Revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses of our standard onpremise software products is recognized upon delivery of the
software, that is, when the customer has access to the software.
Occasionally, we license on-premise software for a specified
period of time. Revenue from short-term time-based licenses,
which usually include support services during the license period,
is recognized ratably over the license term. Revenue from multiyear time-based licenses that include support services, whether

148

We usually recognize revenue from on-premise software
arrangements involving resellers on evidence of sell-through by
the reseller to the end customer, because the inflow of the
economic benefits associated with the arrangements to us is not
probable before sell-through has occurred.
Software licenses revenue from customer-specific on-premise
software development agreements that qualify for revenue
recognition by reference to the stage of completion of the
contract activity is recognized using the percentage-ofcompletion method based on contract costs incurred to date as
a percentage of total estimated contract costs required to
complete the development work.
Under our standardized support services, our performance
obligation is to stand ready to provide technical product support
and unspecified updates, upgrades, and enhancements on a
when-and-if-available basis. Consequently, we recognize
support revenue ratably over the term of the support
arrangement.
We recognize services revenue as the services are rendered.
Usually, our professional services contracts and premium
support services contracts do not involve significant production,
modification, or customization of software, and the related
revenue is recognized as the services are provided using the
percentage-of-completion method of accounting. For
messaging services, we measure the progress of service
rendering based on the number of messages successfully
processed and delivered except for fixed-price messaging
arrangements, for which revenue is recognized ratably over the
contractual term of the arrangement. Revenue from our training
services is recognized when the customer consumes the
respective classroom training. For on-demand training services,
whereby our performance obligation is to stand ready and
provide the customer with access to the training courses and
learning content services, revenue is recognized ratably over the
contractual term of the arrangement.

Measurement of Revenue
Revenue is recognized net of returns and allowances, trade
discounts, and volume rebates.

Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS and Notes | Notes

Our contributions to resellers that allow our resellers to execute
qualified and approved marketing activities are recognized as an
offset to revenue, unless we obtain a separate identifiable
benefit for the contribution and the fair value of that benefit is
reasonably estimable.

Multiple-Element Arrangements
We combine two or more customer contracts with the same
customer and account for the contracts as a single arrangement
if the contracts are negotiated as a package or otherwise linked.
We account for the different goods and services promised under
our customer contracts as separate units of account (distinct
deliverables) unless:
– The contract involves significant production, modification, or
customization of the cloud subscription or on-premise
software; and
– The services are not available from third-party vendors and
are therefore deemed essential to the cloud subscription or
on-premise software.
Goods and services that do not qualify as distinct deliverables
are combined into one unit of account (combined deliverables).
The portion of the transaction fee allocated to one distinct
deliverable is recognized in revenue separately under the
policies applicable to the respective deliverable. For combined
deliverables consisting of cloud offerings or on-premise
software and other services, the allocated portion of the
transaction fee is recognized using the percentage-ofcompletion method, as outlined above, or over the cloud
subscription term, if applicable, depending on which service
term is longer.
We allocate the total transaction fee of a customer contract to
the distinct deliverables under the contract based on their fair
values. The allocation is done relative to the distinct
deliverables’ individual fair values unless the residual method is
applied as outlined below. Fair value is determined by companyspecific objective evidence of fair value, which is the price
charged consistently when that element is sold separately or, for
elements not yet sold separately, the price established by our
management if it is probable that the price will not change
before the element is sold separately. Where company-specific
objective evidence of fair value and third-party evidence of
selling price cannot be established due to lacking stand-alone
sales or lacking pricing consistency, we determine the fair value
of a distinct deliverable by estimating its stand-alone selling
price. Company-specific objective evidence of fair value and
estimated stand-alone selling prices (ESP) for our major
products and services are determined as follows:
– We derive the company-specific objective evidence of fair
value for our renewable support services from the rates
charged to renew the support services annually after an initial
period. Such renewal rates generally represent a fixed
percentage of the discounted software license fee charged to

Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS and Notes | Notes

the customer. The majority of our customers renew their
annual support service contracts at these rates.
– Company-specific objective evidence of fair value for our
service offerings is derived from our consistently priced
historic sales.
– Company-specific objective evidence of fair value can
generally not be established for our cloud subscriptions. ESP
for these offerings is determined based on the rates agreed
with the individual customers to apply if and when the
subscription arrangement renews. We determine ESP by
considering multiple factors which include, but are not limited
to, the following:
 Substantive renewal rates stipulated in the cloud
arrangement; and
 Gross margin expectations and expected internal costs of
the respective cloud business model.
– For our on-premise software offerings, company-specific
objective evidence of fair value can generally not be
established and representative stand-alone selling prices are
not discernible from past transactions. We therefore apply
the residual method to multiple-element arrangements that
include on-premise software. Under this method, the
transaction fee is allocated to all undelivered elements in the
amount of their respective fair values and the remaining
amount of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered
element. With this policy, we have considered the guidance
provided by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Subtopic 985-605
(Software Revenue Recognition), where applicable, as
authorized by IAS 8 (Accounting Policies, Changes in
Accounting Estimates and Errors).
We also consider FASB ASC 985-605 in our accounting for
options that entitle the customer to purchase, in the future,
additional on-premise software or services. We allocate revenue
to future incremental discounts whenever customers are
granted a material right, that is, the right to license additional
on-premise software at a higher discount than the one given
within the initial software license arrangement, or to purchase or
renew services at rates below the fair values established for
these services. We also consider whether future purchase
options included in arrangements for cloud subscription
deliverables constitute a material right.

Cost of Cloud and Software
Cost of cloud and software includes the costs incurred in
producing the goods and providing the services that generate
cloud and software revenue. Consequently, this line item
primarily includes employee expenses relating to these services,
amortization of acquired intangibles, fees for third-party
licenses, shipping, ramp-up cost, and depreciation of our
property, plant, and equipment.

Cost of Services
Cost of services includes the costs incurred in providing the
services that generate service revenue, such as consulting and

149

training activities, messaging, as well as certain forms of hosting
solutions for our customers and our partners.

For more information about our share-based payments, see
Note (27).

Research and Development

Financial Assets

Research and development includes the costs incurred by
activities related to the development of software solutions (new
products, updates, and enhancements) including resource and
hardware costs for the development systems.

Our financial assets comprise cash and cash equivalents (highly
liquid investments with original maturities of three months or
less), loans and receivables, acquired equity and debt
investments, and derivative financial instruments (derivatives)
with positive fair values. Financial assets are only classified as
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss if they are held
for trading, as we do not designate financial assets at fair value
through profit or loss. All other financial assets are classified as
loans and receivables if we do not designate them as availablefor-sale financial assets.

We have determined that the conditions for recognizing
internally generated intangible assets from our software
development activities are not met until shortly before the
products are available for sale. Development costs incurred
after the recognition criteria are met have not been material.
Consequently, research and development costs are expensed as
incurred.

Regular-way purchases and sales of financial assets are
recorded as at the trade date.

Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing includes costs incurred for the selling and
marketing activities related to our software and cloud solutions
as well as our service portfolio.

We measure current and deferred tax liabilities and assets for
uncertainties in income taxes based on our best estimate of the
most likely amount payable to or recoverable from the tax
authorities, assuming that the tax authorities will examine the
amounts reported to them and have full knowledge of all
relevant information.

Among the other impairment indicators in IAS 39 (Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement), for an investment
in an equity security, objective evidence of impairment includes
a significant (more than 20%) or prolonged (a period of more
than nine months) decline in its fair value. Impairment losses on
financial assets are recognized in financial income, net. For
available-for-sale financial assets, which are non-derivative
financial assets that are not assigned to loans and receivables or
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, impairment
losses directly reduce an asset’s carrying amount, while
impairments on loans and receivables are recorded using
allowance accounts. Such allowance accounts are always
presented together with the accounts containing the asset’s
cost in other financial assets. Account balances are charged off
against the respective allowance after all collection efforts have
been exhausted and the likelihood of recovery is considered
remote.

Share-Based Payments

Derivatives

Share-based payments cover cash-settled and equity-settled
awards issued to our employees. The respective expenses are
recognized as employee benefits expenses and classified in our
Consolidated Income Statements according to the activities that
the employees owning the awards perform.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments

General and Administration
General and administration includes costs related to finance and
administrative functions, human resources, and general
management as long as they are not directly attributable to one
of the other operating expense line items.

Accounting for Uncertainties in Income Taxes

Under certain programs, we grant our employees discounts on
purchases of SAP shares. Since those discounts are not
dependent on future services to be provided by our employees,
the discount is recognized as an expense when the discounts
are granted.
Where we hedge our exposure to cash-settled awards, changes
in the fair value of the respective hedging instruments are also
recognized as employee benefits expenses in profit or loss. The
fair values of hedging instruments are based on market data
reflecting current market expectations.

150

Many transactions constitute economic hedges, and therefore
contribute effectively to the securing of financial risks but do not
qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39. To hedge currency
risks inherent in foreign-currency denominated and recognized
monetary assets and liabilities, we do not designate our held-fortrading derivative financial instruments as accounting hedges,
because the profits and losses from the underlying transactions
are recognized in profit or loss in the same periods as the profits
or losses from the derivatives.
In addition, we occasionally have contracts that contain foreign
currency embedded derivatives that are required to be
accounted for separately.

Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments
We use derivatives to hedge foreign currency risk or interest
rate risk and designate them as cash flow or fair value hedges if

Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS and Notes | Notes

they qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39. For more
information about our hedges, see Note (25).
a) Cash Flow Hedge
In general, we apply cash flow hedge accounting to the foreign
currency risk of highly probable forecasted transactions and
interest rate risk on variable rate financial liabilities.
With regard to foreign currency risk, hedge accounting relates to
the spot price and the intrinsic values of the derivatives
designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges, while gains and
losses on the interest element and on those time values
excluded from the hedging relationship as well as the ineffective
portion of gains or losses are recognized in profit or loss as they
occur.
b) Fair Value Hedge
We apply fair value hedge accounting for certain of our fixed rate
financial liabilities.

Valuation and Testing of Effectiveness
The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is tested
prospectively and retrospectively. Prospectively, we apply the
critical terms match for our foreign currency hedges, as
currencies, maturities, and the amounts are identical for the
forecasted transactions and the spot element of the forward
exchange rate contract or intrinsic value of the currency options,
respectively. For interest rate swaps, we also apply the critical
terms match, as the notional amounts, currencies, maturities,
basis of the variable legs or fixed legs, respectively, reset dates,
and the dates of the interest and principal payments are
identical for the debt instrument and the corresponding interest
rate swaps. Therefore, over the life of the hedging instrument,
the changes in the designated components of the hedging
instrument will offset the impact of fluctuations of the
underlying hedged items.
The method of testing effectiveness retrospectively depends on
the type of the hedge as described further below:
a) Cash Flow Hedge
Retrospectively, effectiveness is tested on a cumulative basis
applying the dollar offset method by using the hypothetical
derivative method. Under this approach, the change in fair value
of a constructed hypothetical derivative with terms reflecting
the relevant terms of the hedged item is compared to the
change in the fair value of the hedging instrument employing its
relevant terms. The hedge is deemed highly effective if the
results are within the range 80% to 125%.
b) Fair Value Hedge
Retrospectively, effectiveness is tested using statistical
methods in the form of a regression analysis, by which the
validity and extent of the relationship between the change in
value of the hedged items as the independent variable and the
fair value change of the derivatives as the dependent variable is

Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS and Notes | Notes

determined. The hedge is deemed highly effective if the
determination coefficient between the hedged items and the
hedging instruments exceeds 0.8 and the slope coefficient lies
within a range of –0.8 to –1.25.

Trade and Other Receivables
Trade receivables are recorded at invoiced amounts less sales
allowances and allowances for doubtful accounts. We record
these allowances based on a specific review of all significant
outstanding invoices. When analyzing the recoverability of our
trade receivables, we consider the following factors:
– First, we consider the financial solvency of specific customers
and record an allowance for specific customer balances when
we believe it is probable that we will not collect the amount
due according to the contractual terms of the arrangement.
– Second, we evaluate homogenous portfolios of trade
receivables according to their default risk primarily based on
the age of the receivable and historical loss experience, but
also taking into consideration general market factors that
might impact our trade receivable portfolio. We record a
general bad debt allowance to record impairment losses for a
portfolio of trade receivables when we believe that the age of
the receivables indicates that it is probable that a loss has
occurred and we will not collect some or all of the amounts
due.
Account balances are written off, that is, charged off against the
allowance after all collection efforts have been exhausted and
the likelihood of recovery is considered remote.
In our Consolidated Income Statements, expenses from
recording bad debt allowances for a portfolio of trade
receivables are classified as other operating income/expense,
net, whereas expenses from recording bad debt allowances for
specific customer balances are classified as cost of cloud and
software or cost of services, depending on the transaction from
which the respective trade receivable results. Sales allowances
are recorded as an offset to the respective revenue item.
Included in trade receivables are unbilled receivables related to
fixed-fee and time-and-material consulting arrangements for
contract work performed to date.

Other Non-Financial Assets
Other non-financial assets are recorded at amortized cost. The
capitalized contract cost mainly results from the capitalization
of direct and incremental cost incurred when obtaining a
customer cloud subscription contract. We amortize these
assets on a straight-line basis over the period of providing the
cloud subscriptions to which the assets relate.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets
We classify intangible assets according to their nature and use in
our operation. Software and database licenses consist primarily
of technology for internal use, whereas acquired technology
consists primarily of purchased software to be incorporated into

151

our product offerings and in-process research and development.
Customer relationship and other intangibles consist primarily of
customer contracts and acquired trademark licenses.
All our purchased intangible assets other than goodwill have
finite useful lives. They are initially measured at acquisition cost
and subsequently amortized either based on expected
consumption of economic benefits or on a straight-line basis
over their estimated useful lives ranging from two to 20 years.
Amortization for acquired in-process research and development
project assets starts when the projects are complete and the
developed software is taken to the market. We typically
amortize these intangibles over five to seven years.
Amortization expenses of intangible assets are classified as cost
of cloud and software, cost of services, research and
development, sales and marketing, and general and
administration, depending on the use of the respective
intangible assets.
The annual goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of
our operating segments since there are no lower levels in SAP at
which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The test is performed at the same time for all operating
segments.

Property, Plant, and Equipment
Property, plant, and equipment are carried at acquisition cost
plus the fair value of related asset retirement costs if any and if
reasonably estimable, less accumulated depreciation.
Property, plant, and equipment are depreciated over their
expected useful lives, generally using the straight-line method.

Useful Lives of Property, Plant, and Equipment

Information technology
equipment
Office furniture
Automobiles

Predominantly 25 to 50 years
Based on the term of the lease
contract
3 to 5 years
4 to 20 years
4 to 5 years

Impairment of Goodwill and Non-Current Assets
Impairment losses, if any, are presented in other operating
income/expense, net in profit or loss.

Liabilities

They are classified as financial liabilities at amortized cost and at
fair value through profit or loss. The latter include only those
financial liabilities that are held for trading, as we do not
designate financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
Customer funding liabilities are funds we draw from and make
payments on behalf of our customers for customers’ employee
expense reimbursements, related credit card payments, and
vendor payments. We present these funds in cash and cash
equivalents and record our obligation to make these expense
reimbursements and payments on behalf of our customers as
customer funding liabilities.
Expenses and gains/losses on financial liabilities mainly consist
of interest expense, which is recognized based on the effective
interest method.

Provisions
The employee-related provisions include, amongst others, longterm employee benefits. They are secured by pledged
reinsurance coverage and are offset against the settlement
amount of the secured commitment.

Post-Employment Benefits
The discount rates used in measuring our post-employment
benefit assets and liabilities are derived from rates available on
high-quality corporate bonds and government bonds for which
the timing and amounts of payments match the timing and the
amounts of our projected pension payments. The assumptions
used to calculate pension liabilities and costs are disclosed in
Note (18a). Net interest expense and other expenses related to
defined benefit plans are recognized as employee benefits
expenses and classified in our Consolidated Income Statements
according to the activities that the employees owning the
awards perform.
Since our domestic defined benefit pension plans primarily
consist of an employee-financed post-retirement plan that is
fully financed with qualifying insurance policies, current service
cost may become a credit as a result of adjusting the defined
benefit liability’s carrying amount to the fair value of the
qualifying plan assets. Such adjustments are recorded in service
cost.

Deferred Income
Deferred income is recognized as cloud subscriptions and
support revenue, software licenses revenue, software support
revenue, or services revenue, depending on the reason for the
deferral, once the basic applicable revenue recognition criteria
have been met. These criteria are met, for example, when the
services are performed or when the discounts that relate to a
material right granted in a purchase option are applied.

Financial Liabilities
Financial liabilities include trade and other payables, bank loans,
issued bonds, private placements, and other financial liabilities
that comprise derivative and non-derivative financial liabilities.

Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS and Notes | Notes

(3c) Management Judgments and Sources
of Estimation Uncertainty
The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in
conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments,
estimates, and assumptions that affect the application of
accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities.
We base our judgments, estimates, and assumptions on
historical and forecast information, as well as on regional and
industry economic conditions in which we or our customers
operate, changes to which could adversely affect our estimates.
Although we believe we have made reasonable estimates about
the ultimate resolution of the underlying uncertainties, no
assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters
will be consistent with what is reflected in our assets, liabilities,
revenues, and expenses. Actual results could differ from original
estimates.
The accounting policies that most frequently require us to make
judgments, estimates, and assumptions, and therefore are
critical to understanding our results of operations, include the
following:
– Revenue recognition
– Valuation of trade receivables
– Accounting for share-based payments
– Accounting for income tax
– Accounting for business combinations
– Subsequent accounting for goodwill and intangible assets
– Accounting for legal contingencies
– Recognition of internally generated intangible assets from
development
Our management periodically discusses these critical
accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Supervisory
Board.

Revenue Recognition
As described in the Revenue Recognition section of Note (3b),
we do not recognize revenue before the amount of revenue can
be measured reliably, collection of the related receivable is
probable, and the delivery has occurred or the services have
been rendered. The determination of whether the amount of
revenue can be measured reliably or whether the fees are
collectible is inherently judgmental, as it requires estimates as
to whether and to what extent subsequent concessions may be
granted to customers and whether the customer is expected to
pay the contractual fees. The timing and amount of revenue
recognition can vary depending on what assessments have been
made.
The application of the percentage-of-completion method
requires us to make estimates about total revenue, total cost to
complete the project, and the stage of completion. The

Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS and Notes | Notes

assumptions, estimates, and uncertainties inherent in
determining the stage of completion affect the timing and
amounts of revenue recognized.
In the accounting for our multiple-element arrangements, we
have to determine the following:
– Which contracts with the same customer are to be accounted
for as one single arrangement
– Which deliverables under one contract are distinct and thus
to be accounted for separately
– How to allocate the total arrangement fee to the distinct
deliverables
The determination of whether different contracts with the same
customer are to be accounted for as one arrangement involves
the use of judgment as it requires us to evaluate whether the
contracts are negotiated together or linked in any other way.
The timing and amount of revenue recognition can vary
depending on whether two contracts are accounted for
separately or as one single arrangement.
Under a multiple-element arrangement including a cloud
subscription, or on-premise software, and other deliverables, we
do not account for the cloud subscription, or on-premise
software, and the other deliverables separately if one of the
other deliverables (such as consulting services) is deemed to be
essential to the functionality of the cloud subscription or onpremise software. The determination whether an undelivered
element is essential to the functionality of the delivered element
requires the use of judgment. The timing and amount of revenue
recognition can vary depending on how that judgment is
exercised, because revenue may be recognized over a longer
service term.
In the area of allocating the transaction fee to the different
deliverables under the respective customer contract, judgment
is required in the determination of an appropriate fair value
measurement which may impact the timing and amount of
revenue recognized depending on the following:
– Whether an appropriate measurement of fair value can be
demonstrated for undelivered elements
– The approaches used to establish fair value
Additionally, our revenue for on-premise software contracts
would be significantly different if we applied a revenue allocation
policy other than the residual method.

Valuation of Trade Receivables
As described in the Trade and Other Receivables section in
Note (3b), we account for impairments of trade receivables by
recording sales allowances and allowances for doubtful
accounts on an individual receivable basis and on a portfolio
basis. The assessment of whether a receivable is collectible
involves the use of judgment and requires the use of
assumptions about customer defaults that could change
significantly. Judgment is required when we evaluate available

153

information about a particular customer’s financial situation to
determine whether it is probable that a credit loss will occur and
the amount of such loss is reasonably estimable and thus an
allowance for that specific account is necessary. Basing the
general allowance for the remaining receivables on our historical
loss experience likewise requires the use of judgment, as history
may not be indicative of future development. Changes in our
estimates about the allowance for doubtful accounts could
materially impact reported assets and expenses, and our profit
could be adversely affected if actual credit losses exceed our
estimates.

Accounting for Share-Based Payments
We use certain assumptions in estimating the fair values for our
share-based payments, including expected share price volatility
and expected option life (which represents our estimate of the
average amount of time remaining until the options are
exercised or expire unexercised). In addition, the final payout for
plans may also depend on the achievement of performance
indicators and on our share price on the respective exercise
dates. Changes to these assumptions and outcomes that differ
from these assumptions could require material adjustments to
the carrying amount of the liabilities we have recognized for
these share-based payments.
For the purpose of determining the estimated fair value of our
share options, we believe expected volatility is the most
sensitive assumption. Regarding future payout under our cashsettled plans, the SAP share price is the most relevant factor.
Changes in these factors could significantly affect the estimated
fair values as calculated by the option-pricing model, and the
future payout. For more information, see Note (27).

Accounting for Income Tax
We are subject to changing tax laws in multiple jurisdictions
within the countries in which we operate. Our ordinary business
activities also include transactions where the ultimate tax
outcome is uncertain due to different interpretation of tax laws,
such as those involving revenue sharing and cost
reimbursement arrangements between SAP Group entities. In
addition, the amount of income tax we pay is generally subject
to ongoing audits by domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a
result, judgment is necessary in determining our worldwide
income tax provisions. We make our estimates about the
ultimate resolution of our tax uncertainties based on current tax
laws and our interpretation thereof. Changes to the assumptions
underlying these estimates and outcomes that differ from these
assumptions could require material adjustments to the carrying
amount of our income tax provisions.
The assessment whether a deferred tax asset is impaired
requires management judgment, as we need to estimate future
taxable profits to determine whether the utilization of the
deferred tax asset is probable. In evaluating our ability to utilize
our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and
negative evidence, including the level of historical taxable

154

income and projections for future taxable income over the
periods in which the deferred tax assets are recoverable. Our
judgment regarding future taxable income is based on
assumptions about future market conditions and future profits
of SAP. Changes to these assumptions and outcomes that differ
from these assumptions could require material adjustments to
the carrying amount of our deferred tax assets.
For more information about our income tax, see Note (10).

Accounting for Business Combinations
In our accounting for business combinations, judgment is
required in determining whether an intangible asset is
identifiable, and should be recorded separately from goodwill.
Additionally, estimating the acquisition date fair values of the
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves
considerable management judgment. The necessary
measurements are based on information available on the
acquisition date and are based on expectations and
assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by
management. These judgments, estimates, and assumptions
can materially affect our financial position and profit for several
reasons, including the following:
– Fair values assigned to assets subject to depreciation and
amortization affect the amounts of depreciation and
amortization to be recorded in operating profit in the periods
following the acquisition.
– Subsequent negative changes in the estimated fair values of
assets may result in additional expense from impairment
charges.
– Subsequent changes in the estimated fair values of liabilities
and provisions may result in additional expense (if increasing
the estimated fair value) or additional income (if decreasing
the estimated fair value).

Subsequent Accounting for Goodwill and
Intangible Assets
Judgment is required in determining the following:
– The useful life of an intangible asset, as this is based on our
estimates regarding the period over which the intangible
asset is expected to produce economic benefits to us
– The amortization method, as IFRS requires the straight-line
method to be used unless we can reliably determine the
pattern in which the asset’s future economic benefits are
expected to be consumed by us
Both the amortization period and the amortization method have
an impact on the amortization expense that is recorded in each
period.
In making impairment assessments for our goodwill and
intangible assets, the outcome of these tests is highly
dependent on management’s assumptions regarding future
cash flow projections and economic risks, which require
significant judgment and assumptions about future

Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS and Notes | Notes

developments. They can be affected by a variety of factors,
including:
– Changes in business strategy
– Internal forecasts
– Estimation of weighted-average cost of capital
Changes to the assumptions underlying our goodwill and
intangible assets impairment assessments could require
material adjustments to the carrying amount of our recognized
goodwill and intangible assets as well as the amounts of
impairment charges recognized in profit or loss.
The outcome of goodwill impairment tests may also depend on
the allocation of goodwill to our operating segments. This
allocation involves judgment as it is based on our estimates
regarding which operating segments are expected to benefit
from the synergies of business combinations.
For more information about goodwill and intangible assets, see
Note (15).

Accounting for Legal Contingencies
As described in Note (23), we are currently involved in various
claims and legal proceedings. We review the status of each
significant matter at least quarterly and assess our potential
financial and business exposures related to such matters.
Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether
a provision is to be recorded and what the appropriate amount
for such provision should be. Notably, judgment is required in
the following:
– Determining whether an obligation exists
– Determining the probability of outflow of economic benefits
– Determining whether the amount of an obligation is reliably
estimable
– Estimating the amount of the expenditure required to settle
the present obligation

Recognition of Internally Generated Intangible
Assets from Development
We believe that determining whether internally generated
intangible assets from development are to be recognized as
intangible assets requires significant judgment, particularly in
the following areas:
– Determining whether activities should be considered
research activities or development activities.
– Determining whether the conditions for recognizing an
intangible asset are met requires assumptions about future
market conditions, customer demand, and other developments.
– The term “technical feasibility” is not defined in IFRS, and
therefore determining whether the completion of an asset is
technically feasible requires judgment and a companyspecific approach.
– Determining the future ability to use or sell the intangible
asset arising from the development and the determination of
the probability of future benefits from sale or use.
– Determining whether a cost is directly or indirectly
attributable to an intangible asset and whether a cost is
necessary for completing a development.
These judgments impact the total amount of intangible assets
that we present in our balance sheet as well as the timing of
recognizing development expenses in profit or loss.

(3d) New Accounting Standards Adopted in
the Current Period
No new accounting standards adopted in 2016 had a material
impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We have early
adopted the amendments to IAS 7 (Statement of Cash Flows),
which are aimed at improving the information provided to users
of financial statements about an entity’s financing activities, as
well as expanding the disclosures on net debt.

Due to uncertainties relating to these matters, provisions are
based on the best information available at the time.

(3e) New Accounting Standards Not Yet
Adopted

At the end of each reporting period, we reassess the potential
obligations related to our pending claims and litigation and
adjust our respective provisions to reflect the current best
estimate. In addition, we monitor and evaluate new information
that we receive after the end of the respective reporting period
but before the Consolidated Financial Statements are
authorized for issue to determine whether this provides
additional information regarding conditions that existed at the
end of the reporting period. Changes to the estimates and
assumptions underlying our accounting for legal contingencies
and outcomes that differ from these estimates and assumptions
could require material adjustments to the carrying amounts of
the respective provisions recorded as well as additional
provisions. For more information about legal contingencies, see
Notes (18b) and (23).

The standards and interpretations (relevant to the Group) that
are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the
Group’s financial statements are disclosed below. The Group
intends to adopt these standards, if applicable, when they
become effective:

Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS and Notes | Notes

– On May 28, 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15 (Revenue from
Contracts with Customers). The new revenue recognition
standard will be effective for us starting January 1, 2018. We
do not plan to adopt IFRS 15 early. The standard permits two
possible transition methods for the adoption of the new
guidance: (1) retrospectively to each prior reporting period
presented in accordance with IAS 8 (Accounting Policies,
Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors), or (2)
retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying
the standard recognized on the date of the initial application

155

(cumulative catch-up approach). We currently plan to adopt
the new standard using the cumulative catch-up approach.
We are in the process of developing our future IFRS 15
revenue recognition policies and adjusting the relevant
business processes to adopt these new policies. We have
established a project across SAP’s operating segments. This
project covers the implementation of a new SAP-based
revenue accounting and reporting solution as well as the
development of new revenue recognition policies. Besides
this, we have established a global roll-out and training
approach for all of the relevant stakeholders within the
organization. As part of this effort, we have identified several
differences between our current accounting policies and the
future IFRS 15-based policies (as far as these have already
been developed). Based on our analyses performed so far,
these differences include:
 Currently, if for any of our product or service offerings, we
determine at the outset of an arrangement that the
amount of revenue cannot be measured reliably, we
conclude that the inflow of economic benefits associated
with the transaction is not probable, and we defer revenue
recognition until the arrangement fee becomes due and
payable by the customer. Under our draft IFRS 15-based
policies, we need to estimate, at the outset of an
arrangement, the potential impact on the transaction price
from both uncertainties in the measurement of revenue
and from collection uncertainties and recognize the
remaining revenue earlier.
 IFRS 15 requires changes to the way we allocate a
transaction price to individual performance obligations,
which can impact both the classification and the timing of
revenues. Among these differences are changes in the
application of the residual approach under IFRS 15 and the
residual method which we currently apply. While the
residual method we currently use aims at allocating the
transaction price between deliverables, the residual
approach under IFRS 15 is used for estimating the
standalone selling price of a promised good or service and
generally would not allow an allocation of little or no
portion of the transaction price to a performance
obligation. This difference may result in higher transaction
price allocations to on-premise software performance
obligations and thus in an earlier recognition of certain
portions of the transaction price.
 We expect a revised recognition pattern for on-premise
software subscription contracts, which combine the
delivery of software and support service and the obligation
to deliver, in the future, unspecified software products.
Under our current policies, we recognize the entire fee
ratably over the subscription term. In contrast, under IFRS
15-, we would recognize a portion of the transaction price
upon delivery of the initial software at the outset of the
arrangement.
 Under our current policies, we do not account for options
that allow the customer to purchase additional copies of
an already-licensed on-premise software product as a

156

separate element of an arrangement. In contrast, IFRS 15
provides that such options are accounted for as a separate
performance obligation if they represent a material right.
In such circumstancesIFRS 15 will result in allocating a
portion of the transaction price to such options giving rise
to the material right . This portion will be recognized upon
exercise or forfeiture of the options, which may be later
than the current revenue recognition timing.
 We are currently already capitalizing the cost to obtain a
contract. We expect the capitalization amount to increase
under IFRS 15 due to a broader definition of what is
capitalizable as cost to obtain a contract.
In addition to the effects on our Consolidated Statements of
Income, we expect changes to our Consolidated Statements
of Financial Position (in particular due to no separate balance
sheet items for deferred revenues being presented anymore,
the recognition of contract assets/contract liabilities, the
differentiation between contract assets and trade
receivables, and an impact in retained earnings from the
initial adoption of IFRS 15) and changes in quantitative and
qualitative disclosure to be added.The quantitative impact of
IFRS 15 on our 2018 financial statements is currently neither
known to us nor reasonably estimable, as we have not yet
done the following:
 Completed the analysis of the volume of contracts that will
be affected by the different policy changes stemming from
IFRS 15 upon adoption
 Performed estimates of the potential changes in business
practices that may result from the adoption of the new
policies
 Completed the identification of those contracts that will
not be completed by the end of 2017 and thus have to be
restated under the cumulative catch-up approach that we
intend to use for transition to the new policies
 Finalized our accounting policy regarding the cost
components to be included into the cost to fulfill a
contract under IFRS 15.
We will continue to assess all of the impacts that the
application of IFRS 15 will have on our financial statements in
the period of initial application, which will also significantly
depend on our business and go-to-market strategy in 2017.
The impacts – if material – will be disclosed, including
statements on if and how we apply any of the practical
expedients available in the standard.
– On January 13, 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 (Leases). The
standard becomes effective in fiscal year 2019, with earlier
application permitted for those companies that also apply
IFRS 15. The new standard is a major revision of lease
accounting; whereas the accounting by lessors remains
substantially unchanged, the lease accounting by lessees will
change significantly as all leases need to be recognized on a
company's balance sheet as assets and liabilities. For SAP,
the vast majority of the impact is expected to come from our
facility leases, and we are currently analyzing the effects of
adopting the standard and whether or not those effects will

Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS and Notes | Notes

be material. We are also currently evaluating to what extent
we want to make use of the practical expedients included in
the standard. The financial impact of the new standard will
depend on the lease agreements in effect at the time of
adoption. It is expected that operating profit will increase, as
costs that were treated as rental expenses in the past will
now be recorded as interest expense. It is also expected that
total assets / liabilities will increase, as right-of-use assets /
lease liabilities will have to be recorded for those items that
were previously “off balance sheet.” Based on the limited
assessment of the impact of IFRS 16 performed to date, we
currently do not know and are not able to reasonably
estimate the impact on our financial statements.
– On July 24, 2014, the IASB issued the fourth and final version
of IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments), which will be applicable in
fiscal year 2018 with earlier application permitted. We plan to
adopt the new standard on the required effective date.
Our preliminary assessment may be subject to changes, as
we have not yet finalized our analysis and thus have not
completed the determination of the impact on our
Consolidated Financial Statements.
(a) Classification of financial assets
Under our current policies, we classify most of our debt and
equity investments as available-for-sale financial assets. We
expect that the majority of our debt investments will be
measured at amortized cost under IFRS 9, as we hold them to
collect contractual cash flows which solely represent
payments of principal and interest. Equity investments can
be classified as either fair value through other comprehensive
income (FVOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL),
and we have not yet made a decision in this regard.
Consequently, we are unable to reasonably estimate the
impact of the introduction of IFRS 9 on the accounting for our
equity investments.
Loans, trade, and other financial receivables and contract
assets are held to collect contractual cash flows and are
expected to give rise to cash flows solely representing
payments of principal and interest. Thus, we expect that
these will continue to be measured at amortized cost.
Derivatives will continue to be measured at FVTPL.
However, we will continue to analyze the contractual cash
flow characteristics of all instruments approved to be used
and the related business model in more detail before
reaching a final conclusion on the classification for IFRS 9.
(b) Financial liabilities
We have never designated any financial liabilities at FVTPL
and have no current intention to do so. Thus, we believe that
we will not have a material impact with regards to financial
liabilities, considering that the only significant change that
IFRS 9 brings to the accounting for financial liabilities is that
for liabilities designated as at FVTPL, changes in the fair value
attributable to changes in the credit risk of the liability must
be presented in other comprehensive income (OCI).
(c) Impairment

Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS and Notes | Notes

We currently plan to apply the simplified impairment
approach of IFRS 9 and record lifetime expected losses on all
trade receivables and contract assets. The financial impact of
the new standard will depend on the financial instruments
recorded at the time of adoption. Based on the current status
of our analysis, we are expecting offsetting effects, that is,
increases and decreases in impairment under IFRS 9 and
thus no material impact. This assessment might change
based on the result of the more detailed analysis performed
that considers all reasonable and supportable information,
including forward-looking elements.
(d) Hedge accounting
We believe that all existing hedge relationships that we have
currently designated in effective hedging relationships will
still qualify for hedge accounting in the future, and thus we do
not expect a significant impact as a result of applying IFRS 9.
In contrast to IAS 39, where fair value changes related to the
interest element are recognized in profit or loss immediately,
IFRS 9 allows recording these costs of hedging in OCI. We
have not yet made a decision related to the accounting for
the interest element. Only after having made that decision will
we be able to reasonably estimate the impact of these new
requirements on our financial statements.

(4) Business Combinations
In 2016 and 2015, we did not conclude any significant business
combinations.

(5) Revenue
For detailed information about our revenue recognition policies,
see Note (3).
For revenue information by geographic region, see Note (28).

Restructuring provisions primarily include personnel costs that
result from severance payments for employee terminations and
onerous contract costs. Prior-year restructuring provisions
relate to restructuring activities incurred in connection with
organizational changes and the integration of employees of our
acquisitions in previous years.
If not presented separately in our income statement,
restructuring expenses would break down by functional area as
follows:

Restructuring Expenses by Functional Area

Revenue from construction contracts (contract revenue) is
mainly included in software revenue and services revenue
depending on the type of contract. In 2016, contract revenue of
€280 million was recognized for all our construction contracts
(2015: €292 million, 2014: €285 million). The status of our
construction contracts in progress at the end of the reporting
period accounted for under IAS 11 (Construction Contracts) was

We are subject to ongoing tax audits by domestic and foreign tax
authorities. Currently, we are in dispute mainly with the German
and only a few foreign tax authorities. The German dispute is in
respect of intercompany financing matters and certain secured
capital investments, while the few foreign disputes are in respect
of intercompany financing matters and the deductibility of
license fees and intercompany services. In all cases, we expect
that a favorable outcome can only be achieved through
litigation. For all of these matters, we have not recorded a
provision as we believe that the tax authorities’ claims have no
merit and that no adjustment is warranted. If, contrary to our
view, the tax authorities were to prevail in their arguments
before the court, we would expect to have an additional tax
expense (including related interest expenses and penalties) of
approximately €1,749 million (2015: €1,045 million) in total.

Available-for-Sale Financial Assets

Loans and other financial receivables mainly consist of time
deposits, investments in pension assets for which the
corresponding liability is included in employee-related
obligations (see Note (18b)), other receivables, and loans to
employees and third parties. The majority of our loans and other
financial receivables are concentrated in Germany.

Our available-for-sale financial assets consist of debt
investments in bonds of mainly financial and non-financial
corporations and municipalities and equity investments in listed
and unlisted securities, mainly held in U.S. dollars.

As at December 31, 2016, there were no loans and other
financial receivables past due but not impaired. We have no
indications of impairments of loans and other financial
receivables that are not past due and not impaired as at the
reporting date. For general information about financial risk and
the nature of risk, see Note (24).

Goodwill Impairment Testing
SAP had four operating segments in 2016, of which two are
reportable segments. For more information about our segments,
see Note (28).

The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated for
impairment testing purposes to those operating segments
expected to benefit from goodwill. Allocated goodwill to nonreportable segments is not material and disclosed under
“Other” – the carrying amount did not exceed the recoverable
amount.

The key assumptions on which management based its cash flow
projections for the period covered by the underlying business
plans are as follows:

166

Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS and Notes | Notes

Key Assumption

Basis for Determining Values Assigned to Key Assumption

Budgeted revenue growth

Revenue growth rate achieved in the current fiscal year, adjusted for an expected
increase in SAP’s addressable cloud, mobility, and database markets; expected
growth in the established software applications and analytics markets. Values
assigned reflect our past experience and our expectations regarding an increase in
the addressable markets.

Budgeted operating margin

Operating margin budgeted for a given budget period equals the operating margin
achieved in the current fiscal year, increased by expected efficiency gains. Values
assigned reflect past experience, except for efficiency gains.

Pre-tax discount rates

Our estimated cash flow projections are discounted to present value using pre-tax
discount rates. Pre-tax discount rates are based on the weighted average cost of
capital (WACC) approach.

Terminal growth rate

Our estimated cash flow projections for periods beyond the business plan were
extrapolated using segment-specific terminal growth rates. These growth rates do
not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the markets in which our
segments operate.

Applications, Technology & Services
The recoverable amount of the segment has been determined
based on a value-in-use calculation. The calculation uses cash
flow projections based on actual operating results and a groupwide four-year (2015: five-year) business plan approved by
management.
We believe that any reasonably possible change in any of the
above key assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of
our Applications, Technology & Services segment to exceed the
recoverable amount.

SAP Business Network
The recoverable amount of the segment has been determined
based on fair value less costs of disposal calculation. The fair
value measurement was categorized as a level 3 fair value based
on the inputs used in the valuation technique. The cash flow
projections are based on actual operating results and specific
estimates covering a nine-year (2015: nine-year) planning period

Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS and Notes | Notes

and the terminal growth rate thereafter. The projected results
were determined based on management’s estimates and are
consistent with the assumptions a market participant would
make. The segment operates in a relatively immature area with
significant growth rates projected for the near future. We
therefore have a longer and more detailed planning period than
one would apply in a more mature segment.
We are using a target operating margin of 34% (2015: 33%) for
the segment at the end of the budgeted period as a key
assumption, which is within the range of expectations of market
participants (for example, industry analysts).
The recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount by
€6,404 million (2015: €1,764 million).
The following table shows amounts by which the key
assumptions would need to change individually for the
recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount:

The sensitivity analysis table presented below considers change
in one actuarial assumption at a time, holding all other actuarial

assumptions constant. A reasonably possible change in
actuarial assumptions of 50 basis points in either direction,
except for the discount rate assumption, would not materially
influence the present value of all defined benefit obligations.

Our investment strategy on domestic benefit plans is to invest
all contributions in stable insurance policies.
Our investment strategies for foreign benefit plans vary
according to the conditions in the country in which the
respective benefit plans are situated. Generally, a long-term

172

Other Post-Employment
Plans

investment horizon has been adopted for all major foreign
benefit plans. Although our policy is to invest in a risk-diversified
portfolio consisting of a mix of assets, both the defined benefit
obligation and plan assets can fluctuate over time, which

Our expected contribution in 2017 to our domestic and foreign
defined benefit pension plans is immaterial. The weighted
duration of our defined benefit plans amounted to 14 years as at
December 31, 2016, and 14 years as at December 31, 2015.

Total future benefit payments from our defined benefit plans as
at December 31, 2016, are expected to be €1,583 million (2015:
€1,432 million). Eighty-two percent of this amount has
maturities of over five years.

Defined Contribution Plans/State Plans
We also maintain domestic and foreign defined contribution
plans. Amounts contributed by us under such plans are based
on a percentage of the employees’ salaries or the amount of
contributions made by employees. Furthermore, in Germany
and some other countries, we make contributions to public
pension plans that are operated by national or local government
or a similar institution.

The Articles of Incorporation authorize the Executive Board to
increase the issued capital as follows:
– By up to a total amount of €250 million by issuing new no-par
value bearer shares against contributions in cash until
May 19, 2020 (Authorized Capital I). The issuance is subject
to the statutory subscription rights of existing shareholders.
– By up to a total amount of €250 million by issuing new no-par
value bearer shares against contributions in cash or in kind
until May 19, 2020 (Authorized Capital II). Subject to the
consent of the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board is
authorized to exclude the shareholders’ statutory
subscription rights in certain cases.

Contingent Shares
SAP SE’s share capital is subject to a contingent capital increase
which may be effected only to the extent that the holders or
creditors of convertible bonds or stock options issued or
guaranteed by SAP SE or any of its directly or indirectly
controlled subsidiaries under certain share-based payments
exercise their conversion or subscription rights, and no other
methods for servicing these rights are used. As at December 31,
2016, €100 million, representing 100 million shares, was still
available for issuance (2015: €100 million).

We may redeem or resell shares held in treasury, or we may use
treasury shares for the purpose of servicing option or

(21) Additional Capital Disclosures

Dividends
The total dividend available for distribution to SAP SE
shareholders is based on the profits of SAP SE as reported in its
statutory financial statements prepared under the accounting
rules in the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch). For
the year ended December 31, 2016, the Executive Board intends
to propose that a dividend of €1.25 per share (that is, an
estimated total dividend of €1,498 million), be paid from the
profits of SAP SE.
Dividends per share for 2015 and 2014 were €1.15 and €1.10
respectively and were paid in the succeeding year.

Capital Structure Management
The primary objective of our capital structure management is to
maintain a strong financial profile for investor, creditor, and
customer confidence, and to support the growth of our
business. We seek to maintain a capital structure that will allow
us to cover our funding requirements through the capital
markets at reasonable conditions, and in so doing, ensure a high
level of independence, confidence, and financial flexibility.
SAP SE’s long-term credit rating is “A2” by Moody’s with stable
outlook, and “A” by Standard & Poor’s with positive outlook.
Standard & Poor’s raised the outlook to positive in 2016.

In 2016, we repaid €1,250 million in bank loans that we had
taken to finance the Concur acquisition. The repayment was
partly refinanced through the issuance of a €400 million
Eurobond with a maturity of two years. We also repaid a
US$600 million U.S. private placement tranche at maturity.
Thus, the ratio of total financial debt to total equity and liabilities
decreased by four percentage points to 18% at the end of 2016
(22% as at December 31, 2015).

Total financial debt consists of current and non-current bank
loans, bonds, and private placements. The changes in our

arising from financing activities below. For more information

Distribution Policy
Our general intention is to remain in a position to return liquidity
to our shareholders by distributing annual dividends totaling
more than 35% of our profit after tax as well as by repurchasing
treasury shares in future periods.
In 2016, we distributed €1,378 million in dividends from our 2015
profit (compared to €1,316 million in 2015 and €1,194 million in
2014 related to 2014 and 2013 profit, respectively), representing
€1.15 per share.
As a result of our equity-settled share-based payments
transactions (as described in Note (27)), we have commitments
to grant SAP shares to employees. We intend to meet these
commitments by reissuing treasury shares or to fulfill these

Our operating leases relate primarily to the lease of office space,
hardware, and vehicles, with remaining non-cancelable lease
terms between less than one year and 32 years. On a limited
scale, the operating lease contracts include escalation clauses
(based, for example, on the consumer price index) and renewal
options. The contractual obligations for acquisition of property,
plant, and equipment and intangible assets relate primarily to
the construction of new and existing facilities and to the
purchase of hardware, software, patents, office equipment, and
vehicles. The remaining obligations relate mainly to marketing,
consulting, maintenance, license agreements, and other thirdparty agreements. Historically, the majority of such purchase
obligations have been realized.
SAP invests and holds interests in other entities. On
December 31, 2016, total commitments to make such equity
investments amounted to €308 million (2015: €197 million), of

177

which €141 million had been drawn (2015: €86 million). By
investing in such equity investments, we are exposed to the risks
inherent in the business areas in which these entities operate.

Our maximum exposure to loss is the amount invested plus
unavoidable future capital contributions.

(23) Litigation and Claims
We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits that arise from
time to time in the ordinary course of our business, including
proceedings and claims that relate to companies we have
acquired, claims that relate to customers demanding
indemnification for proceedings initiated against them based on
their use of SAP software, and claims that relate to customers
being dissatisfied with the products and services that we have
delivered to them. We will continue to vigorously defend against
all claims and lawsuits against us. We currently believe that
resolving the claims and lawsuits pending as of December 31,
2016, will neither individually nor in the aggregate have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial position,
profit, or cash flows. Consequently, the provisions recorded for
these claims and lawsuits as of December 31, 2016, are neither
individually nor in the aggregate material to SAP.
However, the outcome of litigation and claims is intrinsically
subject to considerable uncertainty. Management’s view of the
litigation may also change in the future. Actual outcomes of
litigation and claims may differ from the assessments made by
management in prior periods, which could result in a material
impact on our business, financial position, profit, cash flows, or
reputation. Most of the lawsuits and claims are of a very
individual nature and claims are either not quantified by the
claimants or claim amounts quantified are, based on historical
evidence, not expected to be a good proxy for the expenditure
that would be required to settle the case concerned. The
specifics of the jurisdictions where most of the claims are
located further impair the predictability of the outcome of the
cases. Therefore, it is not practicable to reliably estimate the
financial effect that these lawsuits and claims would have if SAP
were to incur expenditure for these cases.

178

Among the claims and lawsuits are the following classes:

Intellectual Property-Related Litigation and
Claims
Intellectual property-related litigation and claims are cases in
which third parties have threatened or initiated litigation
claiming that SAP violates one or more intellectual property
rights that they possess. Such intellectual property rights may
include patents, copyrights, and other similar rights.
The carrying amount of the provisions recognized for intellectual
property-related litigation and claims and the change in the
carrying amount in the reporting period are disclosed in
Note (18b). The expected timing of any resulting outflows of
economic benefits from these lawsuits and claims is uncertain
and not estimable as it depends generally on the duration of the
legal proceedings and settlement negotiations required to
resolve them. Uncertainties about the amounts result primarily
from the unpredictability of the outcomes of legal disputes in
several jurisdictions. For more information, see Note (3c).
Contingent liabilities exist from intellectual property-related
litigation and claims for which no provision has been recognized.
Generally, it is not practicable to estimate the financial impact of
these contingent liabilities due to the uncertainties around the
litigation and claims, as outlined above. The total amounts
claimed by plaintiffs in those intellectual property-related
lawsuits or claims in which a claim has been quantified were not
material to us as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. Based on our
past experience, most of the intellectual property-related
litigation and claims tend to be either dismissed in court or
settled out of court for amounts significantly below the originally
claimed amounts and not material to our consolidated financial
statements.
Individual cases of intellectual property-related litigation and
claims include the following:

Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS and Notes | Notes

In February 2010, United States-based TecSec, Inc. (TecSec)
instituted legal proceedings in the United States against SAP
(including its subsidiary Sybase) and many other defendants.
TecSec alleged that SAP’s and Sybase’s products infringe one
or more of the claims in five patents held by TecSec. In its
complaint, TecSec seeks unspecified monetary damages and
permanent injunctive relief. The lawsuit is proceeding but only
with respect to one defendant. The trial for SAP (including its
subsidiary Sybase) has not yet been scheduled – the lawsuit for
SAP (including its subsidiary Sybase) remains stayed.
In April 2010, SAP instituted legal proceedings (a declaratory
judgment action) in the United States against Wellogix, Inc. and
Wellogix Technology Licensing, LLC (Wellogix). The lawsuit
sought a declaratory judgment that six patents owned by
Wellogix were invalid or not infringed by SAP. The legal
proceedings were stayed pending the outcome of six
reexaminations filed by SAP with the United States Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO). In response to SAP’s patent
Declaratory Judgment action, Wellogix re-asserted trade secret
misappropriation claims against SAP. The court granted SAP’s
motion to dismiss based on improper venue for litigating the
trade secret claims in the U.S. and Wellogix appealed that
decision. In February 2015, SAP filed a declaratory judgment
action in Frankfurt/Main, Germany, asking the German court to
rule that SAP did not misappropriate any Wellogix trade secrets.
In early 2016, the appeals court rejected Wellogix’s appeal. In
mid-2016, SAP’s patent declaratory judgment and
reexaminations resulted in a final judgment invalidating all of
Wellogix’s six asserted patents and the litigation was dismissed.
The German trade secrets litigation remains pending.

Customer-Related Litigation and Claims
Customer-related litigation and claims include cases in which we
indemnify our customers against liabilities arising from a claim
that our products infringe a third party’s patent, copyright, trade
secret, or other proprietary rights. Occasionally, consulting or
software implementation projects result in disputes with
customers. Where customers are dissatisfied with the products
and services that we have delivered to them in routine
consulting contracts or development arrangements, we may
grant functions or performance guarantees.
The carrying amount of the provisions recorded for customerrelated litigation and claims and the development of the carrying
amount in the reporting period are disclosed in Note (18b). The
expected timing or amounts of any resulting outflows of
economic benefits from these lawsuits and claims is uncertain
and not estimable as they generally depend on the duration of
the legal proceedings and settlement negotiations required to
resolve the litigation and claims and the unpredictability of the
outcomes of legal disputes in several jurisdictions. For more
information, see Note (3c).

Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS and Notes | Notes

Contingent liabilities exist from customer-related litigation and
claims for which no provision has been recognized. Generally, it
is not practicable to estimate the financial impact of these
contingent liabilities due to the uncertainties around these
lawsuits and claims outlined above.

Tax-Related Litigation and Claims
We are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and foreign tax
authorities. In respect of non-income taxes, we, like many other
companies operating in Brazil, are involved in various
proceedings with Brazilian tax authorities regarding
assessments and litigation matters on intercompany royalty
payments and intercompany services. The total potential
amount in dispute related to these matters for all applicable
years is approximately €106 million (2015: €75 million). We
have not recorded a provision for these matters, as we believe
that we will prevail.
For information about income tax-related litigation, see
Note (10).

(24) Financial Risk Factors
We are exposed to various financial risks, such as market risks
(including foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk,
and equity price risk), credit risk, and liquidity risk.

Market Risk
a) Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
As we are active worldwide, our ordinary operations are subject
to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currencies. Since
the Group’s entities mainly conduct their operating business in
their own functional currencies, our risk of exchange rate
fluctuations from ongoing ordinary operations is not considered
significant. However, we occasionally generate foreign currencydenominated receivables, payables, and other monetary items
by transacting in a currency other than the functional currency.
To mitigate the extent of the associated foreign currency
exchange rate risk, the majority of these transactions are
hedged as described in Note (25).
In rare circumstances, transacting in a currency other than the
functional currency also leads to embedded foreign currency
derivatives being separated and measured at fair value through
profit or loss.
In addition, the intellectual property (IP) holders in the SAP
Group are exposed to risks associated with forecasted
intercompany cash flows in foreign currencies. These cash flows
arise out of royalty payments from subsidiaries to the respective
IP holder. The royalties are linked to the subsidiaries’ external
revenue. This arrangement leads to a concentration of the
foreign currency exchange rate risk with the IP holders, as the
royalties are mostly denominated in the subsidiaries’ local

179

currencies, while the functional currency of the IP holders with
the highest royalty volume is the euro. The highest foreign
currency exchange rate exposure of this kind relates to the
currencies of subsidiaries with significant operations, for
example the U.S. dollar, the pound sterling, the Japanese yen,
the Swiss franc, the Brazilian real, and the Australian dollar.

financing activities, as such activities are normally conducted in
the functional currency of the investing or borrowing entity. For
more information, see Note (25).

b) Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our investing
and financing activities mainly in euros and U.S. dollars:

Generally, we are not exposed to any significant foreign
currency exchange rate risk with regard to our investing and

c) Equity Price Risk
We are exposed to equity price risk with regard to our
investments in equity securities (2016: €952 million; 2015:
€882 million) and our share-based payments (for the exposure
from these plans, see Note (27)).

Credit Risk
To reduce the credit risk in investments, we arrange to receive
rights to collateral for certain investing activities in the full
amount of the investment volume, which we would be allowed to
make use of only in the case of default of the counterparty to the
investment. In the absence of other significant agreements to
reduce our credit risk exposure, the total amounts recognized as
cash and cash equivalents, current investments, loans and other
financial receivables, trade receivables, and derivative financial
assets represent our maximum exposure to credit risks, except
for the agreements mentioned above.

Liquidity Risk
The table below is an analysis of the remaining contractual
maturities of all our financial liabilities held as at December 31,
2016. Financial liabilities for which repayment can be requested
by the contract partner at any time are assigned to the earliest
possible period. Variable interest payments were calculated
using the latest relevant interest rate fixed as at December 31,
2016. As we generally settle our derivative contracts gross, we
show the pay and receive legs separately for all our currency and
interest rate derivatives, whether or not the fair value of the
derivative is negative. The cash outflows for the currency
derivatives are translated using the applicable forward rate.
For more information about the cash flows for unrecognized but
contractually agreed financial commitments, see Note (22).

(25) Financial Risk Management
We manage market risks (including foreign currency exchange
rate risk, interest rate risk, and equity price risk), credit risk, and
liquidity risk on a Group-wide basis through our global treasury
department. Our risk management and hedging strategy is set
by our treasury guideline and other internal guidelines, and is
subject to continuous internal risk analysis. Derivative financial
instruments are only purchased to reduce risks and not for
speculation, which is defined as entering into derivative
instruments without a corresponding underlying transaction.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
Management
We continuously monitor our exposure to currency fluctuation
risks based on monetary items and forecasted transactions and
pursue a Group-wide strategy to manage foreign currency
exchange rate risk, using derivative financial instruments,
primarily foreign exchange forward contracts, as appropriate,

with the primary aim of reducing profit or loss volatility. Most of
the hedging instruments are not designated as being in a hedge
accounting relationship. For more information, see Note (3a).

Currency Hedges Designated as Hedging
Instruments (Cash Flow Hedges)
We enter into derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign
exchange forward contracts, to hedge significant forecasted
cash flows (royalties) from foreign subsidiaries denominated in
foreign currencies with a defined set of hedge ratios and a hedge
horizon of up to 12 months, which is also the maximum maturity
of the foreign exchange derivatives we use.
For all years presented, no previously highly-probable
transaction designated as a hedged item in a foreign currency
cash flow hedge relationship ceased to be probable. Therefore,
we did not discontinue any of our cash flow hedge relationships.
Also, we identified no ineffectiveness in all years reported.
Generally, the cash flows of the hedged forecasted transactions
are expected to occur and to be recognized in profit or loss

181

monthly within a time frame of 12 months from the date of the
statement of financial position.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Exposure
Our risk exposure is based on a sensitivity analysis considering
the following:
– The SAP Group’s entities generally operate in their functional
currencies. In exceptional cases and limited economic
environments, operating transactions are denominated in
currencies other than the functional currency, leading to a
foreign currency exchange rate risk for the related monetary
instruments. Where material, this foreign currency exchange
rate risk is hedged. Therefore, fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates neither have a significant impact on
profit nor on other comprehensive income with regard to our
non-derivative monetary financial instruments and related
income or expenses.
– Our free-standing derivatives designed for hedging foreign
currency exchange rate risks almost completely balance the
changes in the fair values of the hedged item attributable to
exchange rate movements in the Consolidated Income
Statements in the same period. As a consequence, the
hedged items and the hedging instruments are not exposed
to foreign currency exchange rate risks, and thereby have no
effect on profit.
Consequently, we are only exposed to significant foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations with regard to the following:
– Derivatives held within a designated cash flow hedge
relationship (excluding the interest element, which is not part
of the assigned cash flow hedge relationships) affecting other
comprehensive income
– Foreign currency embedded derivatives affecting other nonoperating expense, net.
We calculate our sensitivity on an upward/downward shift of
+/–25% of the foreign currency exchange rate between euro
and Brazilian real and +/–10% of the foreign currency exchange
rate between euro and all other major currencies (2015:
upward/downward shift of +/–25% of the foreign currency
exchange rate between euro and Brazilian real; +/–10% of the
foreign currency exchange rate between euro and all other
major currencies; 2014: upward shift for Swiss franc +20%, all
other major currencies +10%, downward shift for all major
currencies –10%). If on December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, the
foreign currency exchange rates had been higher/lower as
described above, this would not have had a material effect on
other non-operating expense, net and other comprehensive
income.
Our foreign currency exposure as at December 31 (and if yearend exposure is not representative, also our average/high/low
exposure) was as follows:

Interest Rate Risk Management
The aim of our interest rate risk management is to reduce profit
or loss volatility and optimize our interest result by creating a
balanced structure of fixed and variable cash flows. We
therefore manage interest rate risks by adding interest raterelated derivative instruments to a given portfolio of
investments and debt financing.

Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments
(Fair Value Hedges)
The majority of our investments are based on variable rates
and/or short maturities (2016: 71%; 2015: 87%) while most of
our financing transactions are based on fixed rates and long
maturities (2016: 71%; 2015: 66%). To match the interest rate
risk from our financing transactions to our investments, we use
receiver interest rate swaps to convert certain fixed-rate
financial liabilities to floating, and by this means secure the fair
value of the swapped financing transactions. The desired fixedfloating mix of our net debt is set by the Treasury Committee.
Including interest rate swaps, 42% (2015: 36%) of our total
interest-bearing financial liabilities outstanding as at December
31, 2016, had a fixed interest rate.
None of the fair value adjustment from the receiver swaps, the
basis adjustment on the underlying hedged items held in fair
value hedge relationships, and the difference between the two
recognized in financial income, net is material in any of the years
presented.

Interest Rate Exposure
A sensitivity analysis is provided to show the impact of our
interest rate risk exposure on profit or loss and equity in
accordance with IFRS 7, considering the following:
– Changes in interest rates only affect the accounting for nonderivative fixed-rate financial instruments if they are
recognized at fair value. Therefore, such interest rate
changes do not change the carrying amounts of our nonderivative fixed-rate financial liabilities as we account for
them at amortized cost. Investments in fixed-rate financial
assets classified as available-for-sale were not material at
each year-end reported. Thus, we do not consider any fixedrate instruments in the equity-related sensitivity calculation.
– Income or expenses recorded in connection with nonderivative financial instruments with variable interest rates

Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS and Notes | Notes

are subject to interest rate risk if they are not hedged items in
an effective hedge relationship. Thus, we take into
consideration interest rate changes relating to our variablerate financing and our investments in money market
instruments in the profit-related sensitivity calculation.
– The designation of interest rate receiver swaps in a fair value
hedge relationship leads to interest rate changes affecting
financial income, net. The fair value movements related to the
interest rate swaps are not reflected in the sensitivity
calculation, as they offset the fixed interest rate payments for
the bonds and private placements as hedged items. However,
changes in market interest rates affect the amount of interest
payments from the interest rate swap. As a consequence,
those effects of market interest rates on interest payments
are included in the profit-related sensitivity calculation.

Due to the different interest rate expectations for the U.S. dollar
and the euro area, we base our sensitivity analyses on a yield
curve upward shift of +100/+50 basis points (bps) for the U.S.
dollar/euro area (2015 and 2014: +100/+50 bps for the U.S.
dollar/euro area) and a yield curve downward shift of –50 bps
for both the U.S. dollar/euro area (2015: –50 bps; 2014: –50
bps).
If, on December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, interest rates had
been higher/lower as described above, this would not have had
a material effect on financial income, net for our variable interest
rate investments and would have had the following effects on
financial income, net.

Equity Price Risk Management
Our listed equity investments are monitored based on the
current market value that is affected by the fluctuations in the
volatile stock markets worldwide. Unlisted equity investments
are monitored based on detailed financial information provided
by the investees. The fair value of our listed equity investments

Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS and Notes | Notes

depends on the equity prices, while the fair value of the unlisted
equity investments is influenced by various unobservable input
factors. An assumed 10% increase (decrease) in equity prices
and respective unobservable inputs as at December 31, 2016,
would have increased (decreased) the value of our marketable
equity investments and other comprehensive income by €84

183

million (€81 million) (2015: increased by €87 million (decreased
by €84 million)).
We are exposed to equity price risk with regard to our sharebased payments. In order to reduce resulting profit or loss
volatility, we hedge certain cash flow exposures associated with
these plans through the purchase of derivative instruments, but
do not establish a designated hedge relationship. In our
sensitivity analysis, we include the underlying share-based
payments and the hedging instruments. Thus, we base the
calculation on our net exposure to equity prices, as we believe
that taking only the derivative instrument into account would not
properly reflect our equity price risk exposure. An assumed 20%
increase (decrease) in equity prices as at December 31, 2016,
would have increased (decreased) our share-based payment
expenses by €281 million (€252 million) (2015: increased by
€200 million (decreased by €198 million); 2014: increased by
€158 million (decreased by €80 million)).

Credit Risk Management
To mitigate the credit risk from our investing activities and
derivative financial assets, we conduct all our activities only with
approved major financial institutions and issuers that carry high
external ratings, as required by our internal treasury guideline.
Among its stipulations, the guideline requires that we invest only
in assets from issuers with a minimum rating of at least “BBB
flat”. We only make investments in issuers with a lower rating in
exceptional cases. Such investments were not material in 2016
and 2015. The weighted average rating of our financial assets is
in the range A- to BBB+. We pursue a policy of cautious
investments characterized by predominantly current
investments, standard investment instruments, as well as a wide
portfolio diversification by doing business with a variety of
counterparties.
To further reduce our credit risk, we require collateral for certain
investments in the full amount of the investment volume which
we would be allowed to make use of in the case of default of the
counterparty to the investment. As such collateral, we only
accept bonds with at least investment grade rating level.
In addition, the concentration of credit risk that exists when
counterparties are involved in similar activities by instrument,
sector, or geographic area is further mitigated by diversification
of counterparties throughout the world and adherence to an
internal limit system for each counterparty. This internal limit
system stipulates that the business volume with individual
counterparties is restricted to a defined limit, which depends on
the lowest official long-term credit rating available by at least
one of the major rating agencies, the Tier 1 capital of the
respective financial institution, or participation in the German
Depositors’ Guarantee Fund or similar protection schemes. We
continuously monitor strict compliance with these counterparty
limits. As the premium for credit default swaps mainly depends
on market participants’ assessments of the creditworthiness of

184

a debtor, we also closely observe the development of credit
default swap spreads in the market to evaluate probable risk
developments to timely react to changes if these should
manifest.
The default risk of our trade receivables is managed separately,
mainly based on assessing the creditworthiness of customers
through external ratings and our past experience with the
customers concerned. Outstanding receivables are continuously
monitored locally. For more information, see Note (3). The
impact of default on our trade receivables from individual
customers is mitigated by our large customer base and its
distribution across many different industries, company sizes,
and countries worldwide. For more information about our trade
receivables, see Note (13). For information about the maximum
exposure to credit risk, see Note (24).

Liquidity Risk Management
Our liquidity is managed by our global treasury department with
the primary aim of maintaining liquidity at a level that is
adequate to meet our financial obligations.
Generally, our primary source of liquidity is funds generated
from our business operations. Our global treasury department
manages liquidity centrally for all subsidiaries. Where possible,
we pool their cash surplus so that we can use liquidity centrally
for our business operation, for subsidiaries’ funding
requirements, or to invest any net surplus in the market. With
this strategy, we seek to optimize yields, while ensuring liquidity,
by investing only with counterparties and issuers of high credit
quality, as explained before. Hence, high levels of liquid assets
and marketable securities provide a strategic reserve, helping
keep SAP flexible, sound, and independent.
Apart from effective working capital and cash management, we
have reduced the liquidity risk inherent in managing our day-today operations and meeting our financing responsibilities by
arranging an adequate volume of available credit facilities with
various financial institutions on which we can draw if necessary.
In order to retain high financial flexibility, on November 13, 2013,
SAP SE entered into a €2.0 billion syndicated credit facility
agreement with an initial term of five years plus two one-year
extension options. In 2015, the original term of this facility was
extended for an additional period of one year to November
2020. The use of the facility is not restricted by any financial
covenants. Borrowings under the facility bear interest of
EURIBOR or LIBOR for the respective currency plus a margin of
22.5 basis points. We are also required to pay a commitment fee
of 7.88 basis points per annum on the unused available credit.
We have never drawn on the facility.
Additionally, as at December 31, 2016, and 2015, we had
available lines of credit totaling €499 million and €520 million,

Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS and Notes | Notes

respectively. There were immaterial borrowings outstanding
under these lines of credit in all years presented.

(27) Share-Based Payments

SAP has made cash-settled share-based payments under the
following plans: Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTI) for the Executive
Board 2015 and 2016, Stock Option Plan 2010 (SOP 2010
(2010–2015 tranches)), and Restricted Stock Unit Plan
including Move SAP Plan (RSU (2013–2016 tranches)).

SAP has granted awards under various cash-settled and equitysettled share-based payment plans to employees and
executives. Most of these awards are described in detail below.
SAP has further share-based payment plans not described

For these awards, the fair value is calculated by subtracting the net present value of expected future dividend payments, if any, until maturity of the respective
award from the prevailing share price as of the valuation date.

For SOP 2010, expected volatility of the SAP share price is
based on a blend of implied volatility from traded options with
corresponding lifetimes and exercise prices as well as historical
volatility with the same expected life as the options granted. For
LTI 2016 Plan valuation, the Peer Group Index price at year end
was US$179.57; the expected dividend yield of the index of
1.24% and the expected volatility of the index of 18%, and the
expected correlation of the SAP share price and the index price

192

of 39% are based on the historical data of SAP share price and
the index price.
Expected remaining life of the options reflects both the
contractual term and the expected, or historical, exercise
behavior. The risk-free interest rate is derived from German
government bonds with a similar duration. The SAP dividend
yield is based on expected future dividends.

a.1) Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTI 2016 Plan)
SAP implemented a new Long-Term Incentive (LTI) 2016 Plan
for members of the Executive Board in 2016. The plan is linked
to the absolute performance of the SAP share and its relative
performance as indicated by the SAP share price compared to a
group of peer companies (Peer Group Index). A grant amount

Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS and Notes | Notes

determined by the Supervisory Board is converted into virtual
shares, referred to as share units, by dividing the grant amount
by the SAP share price (calculated on the basis of a defined
average value). The grant amount is determined by the
Supervisory Board in its discretion for each financial year at a
level between 80% and 120% of the contractual target amount,

193

taking into account the achievement of the operating profit
target set for the preceding financial year.
The share units granted comprise 40% retention share units
and 60% performance share units (PSUs). Both types of share
units have a vesting period of (approximately) four years. Each
share unit that finally vests entitles its holder to a (gross) payout
corresponding to the price of one SAP share after the end of the
holding period, but capped at three times the SAP share price
applied for the conversion of the grant amount into share units.
The number of PSUs that finally vest depends on the absolute
and relative performance of the SAP share. If the increase of the
SAP share price over the vesting period of the PSUs exceeds the
increase of the Peer Group Index over the same period, the
number of PSUs increases by a percentage equal to the
outperformance expressed as percentage points. This
percentage will be doubled if, in addition to the outperformance
against the Peer Group Index, the SAP share price at the end of
the vesting period of the PSUs is higher than the price at the
start of this period. The number of vested PSUs is capped at
150% of the initial PSU allocation for that year. Conversely, if the
performance of the SAP share over the vesting period of the
PSUs is below the performance of the Peer Group Index, the
number of PSUs will be reduced by a percentage equal to the
difference expressed as percentage points. All PSUs lapse if the
difference exceeds 50%. If the service contract for the Executive
Board member is terminated before the end of the third year
following the year in which the Share Units were granted, the
share units are forfeited in whole or in part, depending on the
circumstances of the relevant resignation from office or
termination of the service contract.

a.2) Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTI 2015 Plan)
The LTI 2015 Plan is linked to the SAP share price performance
and the achievement of two financial key performance
indicators (KPIs): non-IFRS total revenue and non-IFRS
operating profit, which are derived from SAP’s 2015 financial
KPIs. Under this plan, virtual shares, referred to as share units,
were granted to participants. Participants are paid out in cash
based on the number of share units that vest. All participants in
the LTI 2015 Plan were members of our Global Managing Board.
The share unit allocation process took place at the beginning of
each year based on SAP’s share price after the publication of its
preliminary annual results for the last financial year prior to the
performance period.
At the end of a given year, the number of share units that finally
vest with plan participants depends on SAP’s actual
performance for the given year, and might be higher or lower
than the number of share units originally granted. If
performance against both KPI targets reaches at least the
defined threshold of 60% (80% for 2013 tranches), the share
units vest. Depending on performance, the vesting can reach a
maximum of 150% of the budgeted amount. If performance

194

against either or both of those KPI targets does not reach the
defined threshold of 60% (80% for 2013 tranches), no share
units vest and share units granted for that year will be forfeited.
The adjustment to the threshold of those performance
indicators was made to reflect our updated expectations due to
the accelerated shift to the cloud. For the year 2015, the RSUs
granted at the beginning of the year vested with 112.96%
achievement of the KPI targets for the LTI 2015 Plan.
The share units for members of the Global Managing Board
under the LTI 2015 Plan are subject to a three-year holding
period before payout, which started in 2016.
The LTI 2015 Plan includes a “look-back” provision, due to the
fact that this plan is based on certain KPI targets in 2015. The
number of share units vested under the 2015 tranche was
adjusted to reflect the overall achievement for 2015, which
differed from the value represented by the number of share
units vested from the 2012 to 2014 tranches. However, share
units that were already fully vested in prior years did not forfeit.
The final financial effect of each tranche of the LTI 2015 Plan will
depend on the number of vested share units and the SAP share
price, which is set directly after the announcement of the
preliminary fourth-quarter and full-year results for the last
financial year of the respective three-year holding period under
the LTI 2015 Plan, and thus may be significantly above or below
the budgeted amounts.

a.3) SAP Stock Option Plan 2010 (SOP 2010
(2010–2015 Tranches))
Under the SAP Stock Option Plan 2010, we granted members of
the Senior Leadership Team/Global Executives and employees
with an exceptional rating as well as high potentials between
2010 and 2015, and only in 2010 and 2011 members of the
Executive Board, cash-based virtual stock options, the value of
which depends on the multi-year performance of the SAP share.
The grant-base value was based on the average fair market
value of one ordinary share over the five business days prior to
the Executive Board resolution date.
The virtual stock options granted under the SOP 2010 give the
employees the right to receive a certain amount of money by
exercising the options under the terms and conditions of this
plan. After a three-year vesting period (four years for members
of the Executive Board), the plan provides for 11 predetermined
exercise dates every calendar year (one date per month except
in April) until the rights lapse six years after the grant date
(seven years for members of the Executive Board). Employees
can exercise their virtual stock options only if they are employed
by SAP; if they leave the Company, they forfeit. Executive Board
members’ options are non-forfeitable once granted – if the
service agreement ends in the grant year, the number of options
is reduced pro rata temporis. Any options not exercised at the
end of their term expire.

Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS and Notes | Notes

The exercise price is 110% of the grant base value (115% for
members of the Executive Board), which is €39.03 (€40.80) for
the 2010 tranche, €46.23 (€48.33) for the 2011 tranche, €49.28
for the 2012 tranche, €59.85 for the 2013 tranche, €60.96 for
the 2014 tranche, and €72.18 for the 2015 tranche.
Monetary benefits will be capped at 100% of the exercise price
(150% for members of the SAP Executive Board).

a.4) Restricted Stock Unit Plan Including Move
SAP Plan (RSU Plan (2013–2016 Tranches))
To retain and motivate executives and certain employees, we
granted RSUs representing a contingent right to receive a cash
payment determined by the market value of the same number of
SAP SE shares (or SAP SE American Depositary Receipts on the
New York Stock Exchange) and the number of RSUs that
ultimately vest. Granted RSUs will vest in different tranches,
either:
– Over a one-to-three-year service period only, or
– Over a one-to-three-year service period and upon meeting
certain key performance indicators (KPIs).
The number of RSUs that will vest under the 2016 tranche with
performance-based grants was mostly contingent upon
achievement of the non-IFRS operating profit performance
milestones in 2016. Depending on performance, the number of
RSUs vesting ranges between 0% and 200% of the number
initially granted. Performance against the KPI targets was
85.13% (2015: 112.96%) in 2016. The RSUs are paid out in cash
upon vesting.

b) Equity-Settled Share-Based Payments
b.1) Own SAP Plan (Own)
Under the Own SAP Plan (Own) implemented in 2016, SAP
offers its employees the opportunity to purchase, monthly, SAP

shares without any holding period. Each eligible employee’s
investment is limited to a percentage of the employee’s monthly
base salary. SAP matches the employee investment by 40% and
adds a subsidy of €20 per month for non-executives. For the
participation in 2016, employees receive a double matching
contribution as well as a double subsidy. This plan is not open to
members of the SAP Executive Board.
The number of shares purchased under this plan was 1.4 million
in 2016.

b.2) Share Matching Plan (SMP)
Under the Share Matching Plan (SMP), SAP offered its
employees the opportunity to purchase SAP shares at a
discount of 40% between 2010 and 2015. The number of SAP
shares an eligible employee could purchase through the SMP
was limited to a percentage of the employee’s annual base
salary. After a three-year holding period, the plan participants
receive, from SAP, one free matching share for every three SAP
shares acquired.
The terms for the members of the Senior Leadership Team and
Global Executives were slightly different than those for the other
employees. They did not receive a discount when purchasing the
shares. However, after a three-year holding period, they receive
two free matching SAP shares for every three SAP shares
acquired. This plan was not open to members of the SAP
Executive Board.
The weighted average remaining life of free matching shares
outstanding is 0.9 years at year end 2016. The following table
shows the parameters and assumptions used at grant date to
determine the fair value of free matching shares, as well as the
quantity of shares purchased and free matching shares:

(28) Segment and Geographic
Information
General Information
SAP has two reportable segments that are regularly reviewed by
the Executive Board, which is responsible for assessing the
performance of the Company and for making resource
allocation decisions as the Chief Operating Decision Maker
(CODM). One is the Applications, Technology & Services
segment and the other is the SAP Business Network segment.
The segments are largely organized and managed separately
according to their product and service offerings.
The Applications, Technology & Services segment derives its
revenues primarily from the sale of software licenses,
subscriptions to our cloud applications, and related services
(mainly support services and various professional services and
premium support services, as well as implementation services
for our software products and education services on the use of
our products).
The SAP Business Network segment derives its revenues mainly
from transaction fees charged for the use of SAP’s cloud-based

196

collaborative business networks and from services relating to
the SAP Business Network (including cloud applications,
professional services, and education services). Within the SAP
Business Network segment, we mainly market and sell the cloud
offerings developed by SAP Ariba, SAP Fieldglass, and Concur.
On April 1, 2016, we split the Applications, Technology &
Services segment. The solutions SAP Anywhere, SAP Business
One, and SAP Business ByDesign were combined into one
organization, as together they provide complete front-office and
back-office solutions for small and medium-sized customers.
This reallocation resulted in a new operating but non-reportable
segment since it does not exceed the quantitative thresholds in
IFRS 8.13. We have retrospectively adjusted our revenue and
results for the Applications, Technology & Services segment to
reflect this change.
In addition, we established a further operating segment
comprising SAP’s healthcare strategy and solutions, which also
does not qualify as a reportable segment due to its size. Since
this segment represents a new business area to SAP, no
significant adjustments to prior-year figures of other segments
were made. Revenue and expenses of both non-reportable
segments are included in the reconciliation of segment revenue
and results.

Segment profit

Information about assets and liabilities and additions to noncurrent assets by segment are not regularly provided to our
Executive Board. Goodwill by reportable segment is disclosed in
Note (15).

Reports based on actual currencies use the same currency rates
as are used in our financial statements. Reports based on
constant currencies report revenues and expenses using the
average exchange rates from the previous year’s corresponding
period.

Measurement and Presentation
Our management reporting system reports our intersegment
services as cost reductions and does not track them as internal
revenue. Intersegment services mainly represent utilization of
human resources of one segment by another segment on a
project-by-project basis. Intersegment services are charged
based on internal cost rates including certain indirect overhead
costs, excluding a profit margin.
Most of our depreciation and amortization expense affecting
segment profits is allocated to the segments as part of broader
infrastructure allocations and is thus not tracked separately on
the operating segment level. Depreciation and amortization
expense that is directly allocated to the operating segments is
immaterial in all segments presented.
Our management reporting system produces a variety of
reports that differ by the currency exchange rates used in the
accounting for foreign-currency transactions and operations.

198

We use an operating profit indicator to measure the
performance of our operating segments. However, the
accounting policies applied in the measurement of operating
segment revenue and profit differ as follows from the IFRS
accounting principles used to determine the operating profit
measure in our income statement:
The measurements of segment revenue and results include the
recurring revenues that would have been recorded by acquired
entities had they remained stand-alone entities but which are
not recorded as revenue under IFRS due to fair value accounting
for customer contracts in effect at the time of an acquisition.
The expenses measures exclude:
– Acquisition-related charges
 Amortization expense and impairment charges for
intangibles acquired in business combinations and certain

Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS and Notes | Notes

stand-alone acquisitions of intellectual property (including
purchased in-process research and development)
 Settlements of pre-existing relationships in connection
with a business combination
 Acquisition-related third-party costs
– Share-based payment expenses
– Restructuring expenses
– Expenses from the TomorrowNow litigation and the Versata
litigation

Revenues and expenses of our new operating but nonreportable segments are included in the reconciliation under the
positions other revenue and other expenses, respectively.
In addition, certain corporate-level activities are not allocated to
our segments, including finance, accounting, legal, human
resources, and marketing. They are disclosed in the
reconciliation under other revenue and other expenses
respectively.
The segment information for prior periods has been restated to
conform to the current year’s presentation.

Portion of total executive compensation allocated to the respective year

The share-based payment amounts disclosed above for 2016
are based on the grant date fair value of the restricted share
units (RSUs) and performance share units (PSUs), respectively,
issued to Executive Board members during the year under the
new LTI Plan 2016, effective January 1, 2016.
The Executive Board members already received, in 2012, the LTI
grants for the years 2012 to 2015 subject to continuous service
as member of the Executive Board in the respective years.
Although these grants are linked to and thus, economically,
compensation for the Executive Board members in the
respective years, section 314 of the German Commercial Code
(HGB) requires them to be included in the total compensation
number for the year of grant. Upon his appointment to the
Executive Board in 2015, Michael Kleinemeier received a grant
related to 2015. Vesting of the LTI grants is dependent on the
respective Executive Board member’s continuous service for the
Company.
The share-based payment for 2015 as defined in section 314 of
the German Commercial Code (HGB) amounts to €263,200 and
4,622 RSUs, respectively, based on the allocation for 2015 for
Michael Kleinemeier, which was granted in 2015 in line with his
appointment to the Executive Board.
Considering the grant date fair value of the RSUs allocated in
2015 instead of the economically allocated amount of sharebased payments in the table above, the sum of short-term
employee benefits and share-based payment amounts to
€15,400,400 and the total Executive Board compensation
amounts to €16,678,400.

The Supervisory Board members do not receive any sharebased payment for their services. As far as members who are
employee representatives on the Supervisory Board receive
share-based payment, such compensation is for their services
as employees only and is unrelated to their status as members
of the Supervisory Board.

Certain Supervisory Board members of SAP SE currently hold,
or held within the last year, positions of significant responsibility
with other entities. We have relationships with certain of these
entities in the ordinary course of business, whereby we buy and
sell products, assets, and services at prices believed to be
consistent with those negotiated at arm’s length between
unrelated parties.
Companies controlled by Hasso Plattner, chairman of our
Supervisory Board and Chief Software Advisor of SAP, engaged
in the following transactions with SAP: providing consulting
services to SAP, receiving sport sponsoring from SAP, making
purchases of SAP products and services.
Wilhelm Haarmann practices as a partner in the law firm
Linklaters LLP in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. SAP occasionally
purchased and purchases legal and similar services from
Linklaters.
Occasionally, members of the Executive Board of SAP SE obtain
services from SAP for which they pay a consideration consistent
with those negotiated at arm’s length between unrelated parties.
All amounts related to the abovementioned transactions were
immaterial to SAP in all periods presented.

In 2016, we entered into a consulting contract with Gerhard
Oswald which applies from 2017 onwards. Compensation
thereunder occurs if and when consulting services are rendered.
No transactions occurred in all periods presented.
In total, we sold products and services to companies controlled
by members of the Supervisory Board in the amount of
€1 million (2015: €1 million), we bought products and services
from such companies in the amount of €3 million (2015:
€7 million), and we provided sponsoring and other financial
support to such companies in the amount of €4 million (2015:
€5 million). Outstanding balances at year end from transactions
with such companies were €0 million (2015: €0 million) for
amounts owed to such companies and €0 million (2015:
€0 million) for amounts owed by such companies. All of these
balances are unsecured and interest-free and settlement is
expected to occur in cash. Commitments (the longest of which
is for two years) made by us to purchase further goods or
services from these companies and to provide further
sponsoring and other financial support amount to €6 million as
at December 31, 2016 (2015: €11 million).
In total, we sold services to members of the Executive Board and
the Supervisory Board in the amount of €0 million (2015: €2
million), and we received services from members of the
Supervisory Board (including services from employee

representatives on the Supervisory Board in their capacity as
employees of SAP) in the amount of €1 million (2015:
€1 million). Amounts owed to Supervisory Board members from
these transactions were €0 million as at December 31, 2016

of our financial statements and are not reported under audit
fees. Tax fees are fees for professional services rendered by
KPMG for tax advice on transfer pricing, restructuring, and tax
compliance on current, past, or contemplated transactions. The

(32) German Code of Corporate
Governance
The German federal government published the German Code of
Corporate Governance in February 2002 and introduced a
commission that amends the Code from time to time. The Code
contains statutory requirements and a number of
recommendations and suggestions. Only the legal requirements
are binding for German companies. With regard to the
recommendations, the German Stock Corporation Act, section
161, requires that every year listed companies publicly state the
extent to which they have implemented them. Companies can

205

deviate from the suggestions without having to make any public
statements.
In 2016 and 2015, our Executive Board and Supervisory Board
issued the required declarations of implementation. The
declaration for 2016 was issued on October 29, 2016. These
statements are available on our Web site:
www.sap.com/corporate-en/investors/governance.

(33) Events After the Reporting
Period
No events that have occurred since December 31, 2016, have a
material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Management’s
Annual Report on
Internal Control over
Financial Reporting in the
Consolidated
Financial Statements
U.S. law requires that management submit a report on the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in the
consolidated financial statements. For 2016, that report is as
follows:
The management of SAP is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as
such term is defined in Rules 13a–15(f) and 15d–15(f) under the
U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. SAP’s internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed under the
supervision of SAP’s CEO and CFO to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external reporting
purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board (IASB).

KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, our independent
registered public accounting firm, has issued its attestation
report on the effectiveness of SAP’s internal control over
financial reporting. It is included in the independent auditor’s
report on the Consolidated Financial Statements as at
December 31, 2016.

SAP’s management assessed the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as at
December 31, 2016. In making this assessment, it used the
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control –
Integrated Framework (2013).
Based on the assessment under these criteria, SAP
management has concluded that, as at December 31, 2016, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
effective.

Connectivity of Financial
and Non-Financial
1)
Indicators
Gaining a Holistic View of Our
Performance

Putting a Value on Non-Financial
Performance Indicators

Integrated reporting is based on the idea that social,
environmental, and economic performance are interrelated,
with each creating tangible impacts on the others. To achieve a
truly integrated strategy, we must understand these
connections and work to support them throughout SAP. Figure 1
below shows how different elements connect.

At SAP, we put a monetary value on how our operating profit is
affected by selected non-financial indicators that measure, for
example, how well we engage with our employees and inspire
them to commit to our vision and strategy, support a healthy
business culture, and succeed in reducing our carbon emissions.
To achieve this quantification, we created cause-and-effect
chains that show how specific actions we take at SAP lead to
shifts in behavior. This behavior impacts on our business and
has a financial consequence.
Such analysis establishes more than just a correlation between
non-financial indicators and financial impact. It also reveals why
and how something such as employee engagement ultimately
leads to gains or losses in business performance. We believe
that such insights are a prerequisite for fully modeling the
financial impact of non-financial performance.

Using Cause-and-Effect Analysis
To create and validate these chains of cause and effect, we
turned to both internal and external stakeholders. We started
with those inside SAP, meeting in small groups that rigorously
examined the impacts of activities related to each of our nonfinancial indicators.

Figure 1: Connectivity between Social, Environmental, and
Economic Performance

Next, we conferred with external stakeholders, including
academics, financial investors, and industry peers, to vet our
findings. Finally, we used real data from SAP to translate our
cause-and-effect chains into a quantified impact on operating
profit.

Documenting Financial Impact
Since 2014, SAP has used techniques such as linear regression
analysis to document the financial impact of four non-financial
indicators. We assess each indicator to see what a change of
one percentage point (or 1% for carbon emissions) would mean

Case Study: Documenting the
Financial Impact of a Healthy Work
Culture
Our Business Health Culture Index assesses the health of both
our organizational culture and our employees. Figure 2 shows
how activities that support health at SAP strengthen our
organizational culture and help our employees perform at their
best. For example, we see that flexibility improves stress
resilience and enhances the work- life balance. This leads to
greater productivity, resulting in a higher operating profit.

Figure 2: Impact Pathway of the Business Health Culture Index

Case Study: Calculating ROI for Our
“Join In – Stay Fit!” Health Initiative
As part of the “Join In – Stay Fit!” program at SAP Germany, we

balance of our staff. These include workshops that raise health
awareness and provide tips for employees on how to change
unhealthy behavior.

impact of the program on employees’ work-life balance as well
as its impact on the BHCI. In 2015, the program resulted in an
ROI of 3.9 for the year of the investment. This means that
operating profit increased €3.90 for every €1 invested during
that year.

Before and after the launch of the program, we mapped direct
and indirect costs related to this activity. We also measured the

These results reflect the quantification of a gross effect related to a change in a particular key performance
indicator. They do not allow for any net impact measurement. The evaluation of required investment to
change the non-financial indicator is excluded from the scope of analysis. The economic gross impact of a

single indicator includes interdependencies with other indicators, hence our results do not allow for a
cumulative effect across all indicators included in this report. All calculations are based on non-IFRS figures
(as shown in our Integrated Report 2016).

Promoting Sustainability Measures
as a Way to Boost Financial
Performance
Documenting the financial impact of non-financial indicators
helps us move closer to achieving our sustainability goals.
Rather than simply stating the business case for social or
environmental change, we now have the numbers to back it up.
Our findings help us to shift the conversation for business
leaders, investors, employees, and other key stakeholders, and
firmly establish non-financial indicators as playing a crucial role
in our financial success. As a result, engaging employees or
reducing our emissions is no longer seen as a nice-to-have, but
rather as essential to carrying out a successful business
strategy.
Moving forward, we are promoting the use of sustainability
measures as a way to improve financial performance, both
inside and outside of SAP. By embedding this approach into our
decision making and quarterly business reviews, our
sustainability performance steers our business along with
factors such as revenue and cost. Our goal is for all senior
business leaders at SAP to recognize – and be held accountable
for – the fact that improving such measures as employee
engagement also boosts financial performance.

Embedding Non-Financial
Performance Indicators into Our
Solutions
We continue to share our methodology with our customers to
help them win in the marketplace. We know that companies
achieve higher operating profit – resulting from both greater
cost efficiency as well as revenue growth – by addressing
economic, social, and environmental considerations. More
importantly, these companies are better equipped to lead in the
future, as they navigate the world’s most pressing challenges
and help to bring about long-term sustainable change.
Currently, our connectivity model focuses predominantly on
internal issues within SAP. However, we are working to enhance
our model to include the social, environmental, and economic
impacts of SAP software and services when they are used by our
customers.
Using the connectivity model, we have been able to embed nonfinancial key performance indicators into our solutions. We see
this in our SAP Digital Boardroom offering built on the SAP
BusinessObjects Cloud solution, for example. By incorporating
this connection into our software, the integrated approach to
financial and non-financial performance not only helps SAP but
also our customers. In this way, we can turn our vision into

performance. In: Procedia – Social and Behavioral Sciences, Vol. 133, pp. 106-115.

reality: enabling our customers to use our technology to make
the world a better place.

Details: How Our Non-Financial and
Financial Performance Indicators Are
Interconnected
Employee Engagement
Employee engagement is the level of employee commitment,
pride, and loyalty, as well as the feeling of employees of being
advocates for their company.

Capability Building > Employee Engagement
Because it is closely linked to how much a company develops its
employees and supports their careers, internal hiring to
management and expert positions positively affects employees’
commitment and loyalty. This hypothesis was confirmed by a
study by Bedarkar & Pandita (2014), which identified “career
opportunities” as the key driver of employee engagement.3

Social Investment > Employee Engagement
Mueller et al. (2012) have found that employees’ perception of a
company’s commitment to corporate social responsibility is
positively linked to their own commitment to the organization.4

Employee Engagement > Profitability
Since 2014, we have used real data from SAP to analyze and
proof the financial impact of employee engagement. Now we
can show what a change by one percentage point of employee
engagement would mean for SAP’s operating profit, as detailed
in the Documenting Financial Impact section.

Profitability > Employee Engagement
In our view, a high operating profit, as great business news, can
raise employee morale, encourage identification with our vision,
and thus drive employee engagement. On the other hand, we
believe that a high profit can also have a negative impact on
employee engagement. For example, if cost savings and budget
cuts were implemented to reach an ambitious profit target,
employees might feel constrained and dissatisfied.

Business Health Culture Index (BHCI) > Employee
Engagement
Since 2014, we have been using real data from SAP to analyze
and prove the financial impact of the BHCI. We have been able to
prove a significant positive correlation between the BHCI and
employee engagement. (The BHCI positively influences the
Leadership Trust Index, which positively influences the
Employee Engagement Index; all correlations are significant).

Employee Engagement > Employee Retention
Since 2014, we have been using real data from SAP to analyze
and prove the financial impact of employee engagement. We
have been able to prove a significant positive correlation
between employee engagement and employee retention.

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Footprint > Employee
Engagement
We believe that lowering SAP’s GHG footprint can have a
positive impact on employee engagement because loyalty
should rise as employees see their company act responsibly
towards the environment. However, because lowering emissions
also brings certain restrictions, such as on business travel, it
may also have a negative impact on employee engagement.

Employee Engagement > GHG Footprint
We believe that engaged employees are likely to want to help
SAP achieve our own target in lowering GHG emissions. Yet
another possible outcome is that a higher level of employee
engagement may lead to more business activity requiring travel
and therefore could lead to an increase in GHG emissions.

and career flexibility, can make it easier for employees to
balance work and family life.6 This leads us to conclude that the
higher our BHCI, the more attractive SAP becomes to women
who are also seeking management positions.

BHCI > Profitability
Since 2014, we have been using real data from SAP to analyze
and prove the financial impact of the BHCI. Now we can show
what a change by one percentage point of the BHCI would mean
for SAP’s operating profit, as detailed in the Documenting
Financial Impact section.

Social Investment > BHCI
We believe that by supporting our employees in engaging in
activities with a positive social impact, such as skills-based
volunteering, we are enhancing the meaning they find in work.
This sense of purpose can help create a richer and more
rewarding work environment that reduces stress and promotes
satisfaction and well-being.

BHCI > Employee Engagement

Since 2014, we have been using real data from SAP to analyze
and prove the financial impact of employee engagement. We
have been able to prove a significant positive correlation
between employee engagement and revenue.

Growth > Employee Engagement

BHCI > Growth

We believe that higher revenue has a positive impact on a
company’s work environment, thereby increasing employee
pride and loyalty. This is also stated in a study of Harter et al.
(2010), which states that improving financial performance
appears to increase general satisfaction and some specific work
perceptions.5

Since 2014, we have been using real data from SAP to analyze
and prove the financial impact of the BHCI. We have been able to
prove a significant positive correlation between the BHCI and

Employee Engagement > Growth

Business Health Culture Index (BHCI)
The BHCI is a score for readiness of employees to accept
change, in particular, their perception of affiliation and purpose,
leadership, recognition, empowerment, reward, stress level, and
life balance at SAP.

Women in Management > BHCI
We believe that a balance of men and women in management
roles helps create a more balanced working environment, one in
which diversity is valued and people feel free to express their
individual styles. It is our expectation that such an environment
will positively affect our BHCI.

GHG Footprint > BHCI
Many of SAP’s GHG emissions are caused by business travel
and commuting, which we believe can have both negative and
positive impacts on employee health. Some people may
experience greater stress from more travel because they have
less time to spend at home, suffer from jetlag, or lose valuable
working time; others may enjoy travel, enabling them to
experience other places and cultures as well as meet new
people.

BHCI > Customer Loyalty
Since 2014, we have been using real data from SAP to analyze
and prove the financial impact of the BHCI. We have been able to
prove a significant positive correlation between the BHCI and
customer loyalty.

Employee Retention
Employee retention is the ratio of the average headcount
(expressed in full-time equivalents), minus employee-initiated
terminations (turnover), divided by the average headcount,
taking into account the past 12 months.

Capability Building > Employee Retention
According to the Global Workforce Study (2012) the “chances to
advance the career” is the second-most important driver of
employee retention.7 By promoting and thus growing from
within, SAP creates career opportunities for our employees. In
turn, it is our expectation that this opportunity leads to an
increase in employee retention.

Employee Engagement > Employee Retention
Since 2014, we have been using real data from SAP to analyze
and prove the financial impact of employee engagement. We
have been able to prove a significant positive correlation
between employee engagement and employee retention.

Employee Retention > Growth
Meifert (2005) stated a clear relationship between employee
retention and a company’s revenue and margin.8

Employee Retention > Customer Loyalty
Koys (2001) has found evidence that employee turnover has a
negative impact on customer satisfaction.9 We believe this
effect stems from the fact that experienced employees work
more efficiently, have better product knowledge, and can build
trusting relationships with colleagues and customers, so
therefore have the ability to better serve customers’ needs.

assume that internal promotions will increase the percentage of
women in management positions.

Women in Management > BHCI
We believe that a balance of men and women in management
helps create a more balanced working environment, one in
which diversity is valued and people feel free to express their
individual styles. It is our expectation that such an environment
will positively affect our BHCI.

BHCI > Women in Management
McKinsey (2013) found that different elements of the BHCI,
such as flexible working hours, the ability to work from home,
and career flexibility, can make it easier for employees to
balance work and family life.10 This leads us to conclude that the
higher our BHCI, the more attractive SAP becomes to women
who are also seeking management positions.

Women in Management > Growth
Studies show that companies with a relatively high percentage
of women in upper management or as board members achieve
stronger financial performance compared to those with a
relatively low percentage (Catalyst, 2013).11 We believe that
having more women in management positions will increase our
revenue as it helps us better serve our diverse customer base.

Women in Management > Customer Loyalty
Diversity programs – including those focused on the promotion
of women to management positions – have a direct and positive
impact on customer satisfaction (Catalyst, 2013).12

Women in Management > Profitability

We have been using real data from SAP to analyze and prove the
financial impact of employee retention. Now we can show what a
change by one percentage point of employee retention would
mean for SAP’s operating profit, as detailed in the Documenting
Financial Impact section.

Studies show that companies with a high level of gender
diversity outperform companies with an average level in terms
of return on equity (11.4% versus an average 10.3%); operating
results (EBIT 11.1% versus 5.8%); and stock price increases
(64% versus 47% over the period 2005–2007) (McKinsey,
2007).13 It is therefore likely that a higher share of women in
management positions will result in a higher profit for SAP.

Women in Management

Social Investment

“Women in Management” means the share of women in
management positions (managing teams, managing managers,

Social investment reflects SAP’s activities in volunteering and

According to the Global Workforce Study (2012) the “chances to
advance the career” is the second-most important driver of
employee retention.16 By promoting and thus growing from
within, SAP creates career opportunities for our employees. In
turn, it is our expectation that this opportunity leads to an
increase in employee retention.

Capability Building > Employee Engagement
Because it is closely linked to how much a company develops its
employees and supports their careers, internal hiring to
management and expert positions positively affects employees’
commitment and loyalty. This hypothesis was confirmed by a
study by Bedarkar & Pandita (2014), which identified “career
opportunities” as the key driver of employee engagement.17

Capability Building > Women in Management
Like many of our IT industry peers, SAP has less women than
men in senior positions. Given our significant pool of talent, we

Studies show that companies with a relatively high percentage
of women in upper management ranks or as board members
achieve stronger financial performance compared to those with

revenue as it helps us to better serve our diverse customer base.

Growth > Employee Engagement

Women in Management > Profitability

We believe that a higher revenue will have a positive impact on a
company’s work environment, thereby increasing employee
pride and loyalty. This is also stated in a study of Harter et al.
(2010), stating that improving financial performance appears to
increase general satisfaction and some specific work
perceptions.22

Studies show that companies with a high level of gender
diversity outperform companies with an average level in terms
of return on equity (11.4% versus an average 10.3%); operating
results (EBIT 11.1% versus 5.8%); and stock price increases
(64% versus 47% over the period 2005–2007) (McKinsey,
2007).24 It is therefore likely that a higher share of women in
management positions will result in a higher profit for SAP.

Customer Loyalty > Growth
Reichheld (2003) found a strong correlation between
companies’ Net Promoter Score results and their revenue
growth rates.23 We support this view as we believe that loyal SAP
customers are likely to recommend SAP products to other
companies, which is likely to result in increased sales and
stronger revenue.

Growth > Profitability
Profit (or loss) is the total of income less expenses; if revenue as
the main part of total income grows at a higher rate than costs, it
will lead to greater profit.

Profitability
Profitability is one of our strategic objectives. We measure it
through operating profit. Profit (or loss) is the total of income
less expenses.

BHCI > Profitability
Since 2014, we have been using real data from SAP to analyze
and prove the financial impact of the BHCI. Now we can show
what a change by one percentage point of the BHCI would mean
for SAP’s operating profit, as detailed in the Documenting
Financial Impact section.

Employee Engagement > Profitability
Since 2014, we have been using real data from SAP to analyze
and prove the financial impact of employee engagement. Now
we can show what a change by one percentage point of
employee engagement would mean for SAP’s operating profit,
as detailed in the Documenting Financial Impact section.

Profitability > Employee Engagement
In our view, high profits, as great business news, can raise
employee morale, encourage identification with our vision, and
help increase employee engagement. On the other hand, we
believe that a high profit expectation can also have a negative
impact on employee engagement. If cost savings and budget
cuts are implemented to reach an ambitious profit target,
employees might feel constrained and dissatisfied.

Profitability > Social Investment
It is a common best practice for companies to invest a certain
percentage of their annual profits in programs and activities that
create a positive social impact. We believe that a higher profit is
therefore likely to lead SAP to make greater social investments.

Employee Retention > Profitability
We have been using real data from SAP to analyze and prove the
financial impact of employee retention. Now we can show what a
change by one percentage point of employee retention would
mean for SAP’s operating profit, as detailed in the Documenting
Financial Impact section.

Total Energy Consumed > Profitability
We have found that reduced energy consumption is strongly
correlated with a reduction in costs. Therefore, any cost
avoidance achieved has a positive impact on our profit.

Growth > Profitability
Profit (or loss) is the total of income less expenses; if revenue as
the main part of total income grows at a higher rate than costs, it
will lead to greater profit.

Customer Loyalty > Profitability
We believe that positive experiences among our customers can
significantly increase business with existing customers, as well
as help attract new customers. Both results can lower the cost
of sales, thereby increasing our profit.

GHG Footprint > Profitability
Since 2014, we have been using real data from SAP to analyze
and prove the financial impact of our GHG footprint. Now we can
show what a reduction of SAP’s carbon emissions by one
percentage point would mean for SAP’s operating profit, as
detailed in the Documenting Financial Impact section.

Customer Loyalty
Customer loyalty is measured with the Net Promoter Score:
Percentage of customers that are likely to recommend SAP to
friends or colleagues minus the percentage of customers that
are unlikely to do so.

Women in Management > Customer Loyalty
Diversity programs – including those focused on the promotion
of women to management positions – have a direct and positive
impact on customer satisfaction (Catalyst, 2013).25

Employee Retention > Customer Loyalty
Koys (2001) has found evidence that employee turnover has a
negative impact on customer satisfaction.26 We believe this
effect stems from the fact that experienced employees work
more efficiently, have better product knowledge, and can build
trusting relationships with colleagues and customers, so
therefore have the ability to better serve customers’ needs.

experience other places and cultures as well as meet new
people.

GHG Footprint > Employee Engagement
We believe that lowering SAP’s GHG footprint can have a
positive impact on employee engagement because loyalty
should rise as employees see their company act responsibly
towards the environment. However, because lowering emissions
also brings certain restrictions, such as on business travel, it
may also have a negative impact on employee engagement.

Employee Engagement > GHG Footprint

We believe that lowering SAP’s carbon emissions has a positive
reputational effect, thereby enhancing SAP’s standing with its
customers.

We believe that engaged employees are likely to want to help
SAP achieve our target in lowering GHG emissions. Yet another
possible outcome is that a higher level of employee engagement
may lead to more business activity requiring travel and therefore
could lead to an increase in GHG emissions.

Customer Loyalty > Growth

GHG Footprint > Growth

Reichheld (2003) found a strong correlation between
companies’ Net Promoter Score results and their revenue
growth rates.27 We support this view as we believe that loyal SAP

The emissions caused by SAP’s energy consumption add
directly to the corporate carbon footprint if they are not reduced

energy certificates (RECs).

GHG Footprint > Profitability

GHG Footprint
Our GHG footprint is the sum of all greenhouse gas emissions
measured and reported, including renewable energy and thirdparty reductions, for example, offsets.

GHG Footprint > BHCI
Many of SAP’s GHG emissions are caused by business travel
and commuting, which we believe can have both negative and
positive impacts on employee health. Some people may
experience greater stress from more travel because they have
less time to spend at home, suffer from jetlag, or lose valuable
working time; others may enjoy travel, enabling them to

Materiality
Defining Key Priorities for Our
Reporting
By understanding which environmental, social, and governance
issues are key priorities for our stakeholders, we are better able
to allocate time, budget, and resources accordingly within our
integrated reporting and efforts towards realizing our corporate
vision. Based on our existing material aspects, in 2016, we
completed a new materiality assessment to help identify and
validate those topics which are the most relevant to our
stakeholders such as employees, investors, and customers. The
assessment also highlights those topics which contribute most
to value creation both in our own operations and in those of our
customers.
Our new process combines the GRI G4 standards for
sustainability reporting and the International Integrated
Reporting Framework. Key stages are detailed below.

Identification
During this stage, we drew up a long list of potential topics based
on guidance from GRI G4 and the Sustainability Accounting
Standards Board (SASB), as well as our existing material
aspects. We also considered a materiality assessment for the
ICT industry by the Global E-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) as
well as the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs).
When identifying our key topics and their boundaries, we looked
first at areas related to our operations and supply chain. Second,
we looked at topics related to how our software can help our
customers contribute to the achievement of the SDGs.

Prioritization
During the prioritization stage we looked at the extent to which
each individual topic affects our ability to create value at SAP.
We assessed whether this value was financial, operational,
strategic, reputational, or regulatory. All topics that were
identified as delivering value in three or more areas were then
included on our short list of seven categories, as follows:

224

–
–
–
–
–
–
–

Business conduct
Climate and energy
Financial performance
Human and digital rights
Human capital
Innovation
Impact on society

Next, we conducted semi-structured interviews with selected
stakeholders to validate the shortlisted topics. We asked
stakeholders to rate topics on a scale from 0 to 5 (where 0 is not
important at all and 5 is very important) based on the following
questions for the first six categories:
– To what degree does this topic influence SAP's ability to
create value?
– How important is that topic for you to engage into a business
relationship with SAP?
To assess the category “impact on society,” we asked
stakeholders the following questions:
– How high is the potential of SAP to enable our customers to
achieve the SDGs?
– How important is our ability to help achieve the SDGs for you
to engage in a business relationship with SAP?
We have included in our materiality matrix all topics with
stakeholder ratings in the upper 50% for both questions.

Validation
The results of the materiality analysis were reviewed and
confirmed by our steering committee for integrated reporting
and our sustainability advisory panel. It was also reviewed by our
chief financial officer, who is the board sponsor for sustainability
and integrated reporting.

Review
Feedback on and analysis of the SAP Integrated Report 2016 will
serve as an input for future materiality assessments.

Financial Performance
Not only do we create financial value for SAP and our
shareholders, we also create wealth for a broad range of
stakeholders. We do this through employee wages and benefits,
payments to our value chain and ecosystem, and tax payments
to local governments and economies, for example.

Human and Digital Rights
For more information, see the Security and Privacy section and
the Human Rights and Labor Standards section.

Human Capital

Materiality Matrix (in Addition to Financial Performance)
Key points of our results include:
– Financial performance was seen as a mandatory part of
reporting and was often not expressly discussed as a result.
However, this category received high individual scores.
– The innovation, business conduct, and human capital
categories received the highest scores and response rates.
– In evaluating our impact on society through the SAP portfolio,
our stakeholders identified the following seven SDGs as
material:
 SDG 9 Industry, innovation, and infrastructure
 SDG 3 Good health and well-being
 SDG 8 Decent work and economic growth
 SDG 13 Climate action
 SDG 17 Global partnerships
 SDG 12 Responsible consumption and production
 SDG 4 Quality education
– The climate and energy category had the lowest response
rates. In response to this, we have reduced the volume of our
reporting on this category. We have only included a short
description of our environmental targets and our progress in
achieving them.

Understanding the Relevance of Our
Material and Other Reported Aspects
Each of our material aspects has significant impact on the
business success of SAP as described below.

Nothing has a greater impact on our long-term success than the
creativity, talent, and commitment of our people. Their ability to
innovate and understand the needs of our customers delivers
sustainable value to our company and our society. Successful
strategies to attract, retain, develop, lead, and engage our
employees are therefore critical to driving a diverse culture of
innovation, sustained growth, and profitability.

Impact on Society
We believe that digital technologies will enable companies and
organizations to tackle some of the world’s most complex,
intractable problems. These include issues that are highlighted
within the United Nations’ 17 SDGs, such as abolishing poverty
and reducing global carbon emissions. Through our solutions,
we provide customers, partners, and consumers with the tools
that help them make a difference. This may be through
empowering those disadvantaged in society through financial
services, providing personalized medicine, building
infrastructure, or combating climate change.
As well as creating positive impacts through our solutions, we
are equipping young people all over the world with the skills they
need to tackle society‘s problems and thrive in the digital
economy. By engaging talent, leveraging technology, and
building strong partnerships, we can build the workforce of the
future.

Innovation and Customer Loyalty
To realize our vision of helping the world run better and
improving people’s lives, we help our customers operate more
efficiently, protect the safety of their products, manage their
employees, and become more effective overall. Our customers
inspire everything we do, from the first spark of innovation to the

design and completion of new products, as well as to how we
serve their needs over time. Innovation throughout the company
helps us realize our vision and serve our customers’ needs.
Our future business success, specifically in the cloud business,
depends on customer loyalty. We view customer loyalty as being
so critical to our own success that we have made it one of our
four company-wide strategic goals, in addition to employee
engagement, growth, and profitability.

Stakeholder Engagement
For SAP, stakeholder engagement and collaboration are deeply
embedded into our process of innovation and the development
of our products and services. Before we can design a new
solution, we must first understand the issue we are addressing.
For this reason, design thinking and co-innovation are essential.
To be able to innovate, we regularly engage with the stakeholder
groups described in the table below, including our sustainability

advisory panel. We selected these groups as they are critical to
our value creation.
For the materiality assessment conducted in 2016, we
specifically spoke to stakeholder representatives of academia,
auditors, customers, employees, and investors. For the results

Business Conduct
Championing Excellence in Business
Conduct
In our business, trust is everything. We know that to engage with
SAP fully, our customers must first trust that our business
practices adhere to the highest standards of compliance and
integrity.
All too often we see the impact of poor business conduct in the
wider business community. Corrupt and unethical practices
irreparably damage brand reputations and lead to punitive
financial penalties for the organizations involved. Such behavior
undermines the rule of international law and is also linked to
poverty and irreversible environmental damage across the
globe.
New fraud and corruption schemes are discovered all the time
in an ever-changing business environment. Therefore, SAP
must constantly adapt our approach to compliance to
incorporate new best practices and meet new challenges.

Establishing Clear and
Comprehensive Standards
We have developed a compliance management system for
enforcing ethical business conduct. This includes detailed
policies and procedures to ensure that SAP does business the
right way.

– Prohibition of bribery and corruption in all its forms, including
facilitation or “grease payments”
– Gifts and business entertainment limits
– Full, fair, and accurate accounting
– Conflicts of interest
– Confidentiality
– Anti-competitive practices
– Data protection and privacy rights

Setting High Expectations Across All
Business Activities
SAP has established a number of policies to maintain the
highest standards of business conduct including in the following
areas:
– Regulation of the appointment and remuneration of sales
agents
– Charitable and political donations
– Global intellectual property
– Group accounting and revenue recognition
– Segregation of duty
– Export control and sanctions laws
– Data protection and privacy
Additional policies or commitments related to sustainability are
under the responsibility of the respective lines of business and
can be found at sap.com.

Audited regularly, the system encompasses all aspects of
compliance management. From the analysis of compliance risks
and defining objectives to running compliance programs as well
as ongoing monitoring, this comprehensive framework enables
us to maintain a responsible compliance organization.

Providing Comprehensive Training

Fostering a Culture of Compliance

In 2016, we introduced mandatory online training for all
employees worldwide. In total, more than 79,200 employees
(93% of SAP staff) received this training. Here is a full
breakdown of our training activities is presented in the table
below.

To help foster a corporate culture where compliance is taken
seriously, we needed to establish a common understanding of
what we mean by compliance. We did this by creating a code of
business conduct that summarizes our standards. The code
contains guidelines for all SAP employees worldwide as they
perform their daily work.
Approved by the Executive Board at SAP, the code sets the
standard for our dealings with customers, partners,
competitors, and vendors. It is adapted locally and translated
into local languages.
Key areas covered by the code of business conduct include:

A code of business conduct is only effective if everyone knows
about it. That is why we strive to make sure all of our employees
receive full training on the standards that we expect.

Our training program covers a wide range of topics around
business conduct. These include guidelines on anti-corruption,
competition law, governance for customer commitments,
intellectual property, and information security.
E-learning modules are available in nine different languages. In
addition, our legal compliance and integrity office also holds
classroom training sessions. Employees from across the SAP
organization take part, from customer-facing staff to individuals
in supporting roles such as corporate affairs and marketing. In
addition, general compliance information on relevant policies is
included in the onboarding sessions for new hired run by our HR
organization.

Communicating Our Standards
Quarterly newsletters provide employees with information on a
range of compliance-related topics. These communications
include details of cases that have recently been highlighted in
the media as well as presenting hypothetical scenarios that
provide people with opportunities for self-reflection. In addition,
the newsletters provide links to other relevant sources of
information such as our whistleblower reporting system, legal
compliance and integrity office, corporate audit department,
and SAP global policies.
We ask business ethics and compliance-related questions in our
annual People Survey. Through the SAP Corporate Portal, we
run company-wide polls on a variety of compliance-related
questions throughout the year. In addition, employees can use
the portal at any time for quick and easy access to all global
policies along with guidelines and additional information.
Colleagues within the legal compliance and integrity office carry
out ongoing programs of calls and meetings to raise awareness
of business conduct issues throughout the organization.
Meanwhile, regular e-mail communications with subsidiaries
and the availability of information in local languages help to
promote leading standards of business conduct across every
part of the SAP ecosystem.

Analyzing Compliance Risk
At SAP, we want to address issues before they become
problems. For this reason, we believe that analysis of
compliance risk is key to maintaining the highest standards of
business conduct.
On an ongoing basis, we review SAP business units for potential
bribery or corruption. For example, in 2016, we collected
quantitative data about 154 SAP entities supporting 142
countries. This data includes revenue information, number of
employees, percentage of public sector business, number of
fraud allegations or incidents, changes or updates to relevant
laws, and other quantitative information. Based on this
information and management input, we determine a risk ranking
for each country.

230

Our assessment also helps us create a general risk profile for
subsidiary locations. Through analysis of our quantitative data,
we determine which countries require our highest attention.
Our legal compliance and integrity office works closely with our
global governance, risk, and compliance organization to identify
areas where a risk assessment is needed. We then drive
compliance mitigation programs if necessary. Generally, we find
that our primary compliance risks are related to corruption,
antitrust issues, export controls, and intellectual property. For
more information, see our Risk Report section.

Enforcing Policies
SAP is committed to ensuring that our compliance policies are
strictly enforced, and that any infringements are quickly flagged
and acted upon. To achieve this, we have built an effective
global network of compliance professionals who act as our
ambassadors at country level for business conduct.
The legal compliance and integrity office oversees the
development of our code of business conduct, as well as all
other related policies and our anti-corruption program. Global
compliance officers are based at SAP headquarters and in our
most important markets, especially where there are local
language needs. In addition, compliance officers at local
subsidiaries assess issues and escalate them to the global level
if necessary.
In addition to making regular reports to the CFO and the
Executive Board, the chief global compliance officer provides at
the least annual reports to the audit committee of the
Supervisory Board. Matters of significance are brought to the
attention of the Executive Board and the audit committee of the
Supervisory Board when required.
Employees at all levels of the organization are required to
disclose conflicts of interest to the legal compliance and
integrity office. Disclosures are then followed up with guidance
or mitigation if necessary.

Facilitating Reporting and
Remediation
If employees are concerned that our code of business conduct
has been breached, or if they need advice on a compliance
issue, they can access support in a number of ways. They can:
– Call our governance hotline at +49 6227 7-40022
– E-mail the legal compliance and integrity office at globalcompliance-office@sap.com
– Contact with local compliance officers via e-mail or telephone
– Use the anonymous online whistleblower tool
Employees can find information on how to report compliance
issues in SAP Corporate Portal, and new hires are informed of
reporting channels during the new hire process. External

stakeholders without access to SAP Corporate Portal can find
the hotline number and e-mail address on SAP.com. In addition,
reporting channels are described in our codes of conduct for
partners and suppliers. Most of these reporting mechanisms are
available 24x7, and concerns are treated as confidentially as
possible in light of subsequent investigation.
All concerns are investigated, and remedial action is taken if
necessary. This may include termination of employment.

Taking a Proactive Stance Against
Corruption
SAP is proactively working in collaboration with the wider
business community to fight against corruption and the
negative impacts it creates. SAP is a member of the German
chapter of Transparency International, a non-profit, nonpartisan organization that combats corruption in government
and international business and development.
In addition, we are active in the Alliance for Integrity (AfIn). AfIn
is a business-driven, multistakeholder initiative promoting
economic integrity and compliance in business. It was initiated
by a number of multinational companies, business associations,
the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and
Development (BMZ), the Society for International Cooperation
(GIZ), the German Global Compact Network and sequa, a nonprofit development organization. The focus of the initiative is on
implementing collective action on the ground.

Sustainability
Management and Policies
Putting Sustainability at the Heart of
Our Strategy
At SAP, we strive to promote sustainability in everything we do.
We believe that it is not enough to simply have a sustainability
strategy but that, instead, our overall corporate strategy must
itself be sustainable. Only by achieving this can we fulfill our
vision to help the world run better and improve people’s lives.
To address this, we have integrated sustainability management
efforts across our entire business.
Led by our chief sustainability officer, a dedicated team
responsible for our sustainability performance works to embed
sustainability into our corporate strategy and promotes new
sustainability initiatives across the organization. Our chief
financial officer (CFO) is the sponsor for sustainability on the
Executive Board and we also have a dedicated sustainability
contact for each area of the business. These contacts are
responsible for embedding sustainability in their business
practices, for example, by setting relevant targets and
implementing related programs. They are held accountable for
their achievements in review meetings with the CFO and the
chief sustainability officer that take place twice a year.

Our chief sustainability officer and their dedicated sustainability
organization coordinate our response to climate change.
Facilities management staff design and operate our facilities
based on robust environmental standards. In addition, our IT
operations personnel are continuously looking at issues around
the working environment and the amount of energy consumed
in our data centers. We assess our environmental performance
in quarterly management reviews.
This year, we continued to roll out our global environmental
management system based on the ISO 14001 standard. We plan
that the system will cover operations affecting about 70% of
employees globally by 2018. At the end of 2016, 46 sites in 26
countries (49% of employees) have implemented ISO 14001.

Financial Performance
The Executive Board retains ultimate responsibility for revenue
growth, profitability, and the financial stability of SAP. For more
information, see the Corporate Governance Report section and
the Report by the Supervisory Board section.

Human and Digital Rights
For information about our management approach, see the
Security and Privacy section and the Human Rights section.

Managing Our Response to Our
Material and Other Reported Aspects Human Capital
SAP has dedicated personnel addressing the material aspects
identified in our materiality analysis with staff remuneration
linked to each aspect. For each topic, we look at ways that we
can manage our response, and how we can evaluate whether
our approach is effective.

Business Conduct
For information about our management approach, see the
Business Conduct section.

Climate and Energy
Our global environmental policy promotes a more productive
use of resources by providing transparency in environmental
issues, driving efficiency, and leveraging transformational
strategies. It also outlines our environmental goals that are
described in the Energy and Emissions section.

232

Overall global responsibility for our human resources strategy
lies with our chief human resources officer who is a member of
the Executive Board.
Our key policies include a global health and safety management
policy and a diversity and inclusion policy. The global health and
safety management policy is an integral part of our long-term
commitment to sustainability. It provides a framework that
supports business processes, leadership behavior, and culture
by addressing, integrating, and leveraging health, occupational
safety, well-being, and stress management topics. The objective
is to nurture our employees’ long-term employability,
engagement, and creativity in developing sustainable value for
our organization, for our customers, and for themselves.
The diversity and inclusion policy provides a framework for
diversity and inclusion at SAP. As such, it supports our business

flourish in an inclusive and authentic working environment.

customer experience. For more information about our customer
loyalty goals, see the Customers section.

For more information about our management approach, see the
Employees and Social Investment section.

As innovation happens everywhere at SAP, each Executive
Board member is responsible for innovation in their area. For
example, our Executive Board member responsible for products
and innovation oversees our software innovation efforts. We
have a team of development and solution management
professionals who create SAP solutions specifically for
sustainability. In addition, another team of experts designs and
integrates sustainability into new or existing industry or line-ofbusiness (LoB) solutions. For more information about our latest
innovations, see the Products, Research & Development, and
Services section.

Impact on Society
This aspect covers two key areas. The first is the contribution we
make towards the fulfilment of the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) through our software solutions and
our social investments. The second is our efforts to make the
world a better place through our corporate social responsibility
(CSR) programs.
Our contribution to the SDGs is coordinated by our corporate
strategy, sustainability, and marketing professionals and teams.
We have started to map our existing engagement with
customers to the SDGs in the How Our Vision Comes to Life
brochure.
Our global CSR policy offers all SAP employees the opportunity
to volunteer for up to eight working hours at a CSR event. In
2016, our goal was to impact 1.5 million lives through our global
CSR programs. We set a target of 250,000 volunteering hours,
with 40% based on skills and professional expertise. We
overachieved these targets with almost 339,000 volunteering
hours (thereof 57% skills-based) and about 3.2 million lives
impacted.
There is a global governance committee that guides the
strategic direction of our overall CSR strategy. In addition, every
SAP region has a CSR governance committee that approves all
major CSR partnerships, as well as advising the regional CSR
leadership. On a group level, we ensure that donations are made
in an appropriate manner through financial and compliance
control processes. Led by our head of global CSR, our global
CSR team is part of the Office of the CEO and corporate affairs
organization. To ensure meaningful and relevant execution of
our companywide CSR strategy, we appoint a regional CSR lead
for each of our six major SAP market units.
All of our major CSR programs are monitored for social impact.
For example, in our global SAP Social Sabbatical program, we
survey the non-profit organization or social business involved to
determine whether our team has met the agreed deliverables.
To capture long-term impact, the evaluation is also repeated six
months after our team’s departure. As with every volunteering
initiative, we adjust our CSR offerings according to the feedback
we receive. For more information, see the Engaging in Social
Investments section.

Innovation and Customer Loyalty
Our Customer Experience Council regularly reviews and
prioritizes our activities related to driving improvements in

Changing Our Behavior and Culture
In our efforts to become a more sustainable organization, SAP is
focusing on two key areas: our processes and our people. To
achieve our goals, we need to challenge behavior and find new
ways of thinking.
The engagement of our employees is essential, as their ideas
and commitment help drive change throughout SAP. SAP runs a
number of programs to help employees understand how
sustainability is connected to our vision to help the world run
better and improve people’s lives.
In 2016, we encouraged open dialog through coffee corner
sessions, virtual all-hands meetings, and social media. During
these sessions, employees also heard about specific customer
impact stories and role models within the SAP organization. In
addition, SAP now includes sustainability in its onboarding
training for new hires as well as management training.
We also keep our employees updated on global trends such as
the ratification of the SDGs in 2016. Employees can explore how
SAP contributes to the SDGs through our customers and our
own operations through the new interactive Web book SAP and
the UN Global Goals and a related iPad app, as well as the online
course “Sustainability Through Digital Transformation.”

Focusing on Transparency and Building
Awareness
Change starts with transparency and awareness. Since 2016,
our Executive and Supervisory Boards have access to our own
SAP Digital Boardroom solution. It provides access to key
financial and non-financial data, including human capital
indicators, that gives a holistic and detailed overview of our
performance.
In addition, every employee can access a dashboard detailing
our environmental and social performance. For example, data
on employee retention and women in management helps create
transparency on the social performance of our company. The
My SAP Footprint app also provides employees with statistics

Sustainability Management and Policies

233

about their personal impact through activities such as driving a
company car or using electronic equipment.
We measure the success of our initiatives through our annual
People Survey. In 2016, 92% of our employees agreed with the
statement “It is important for SAP to pursue sustainability”
compared to 90% in 2015 and 77% in 2009. Furthermore, 82%
of our employees stated, “I actively contribute to sustainability
goals at SAP.” This is up from 80% in 2015 and 46% in 2009.

Nurturing a Network of Sustainability
Champions
While sustainability requires strong leadership, it cannot be
mandated from the top. To help drive progress with
sustainability initiatives, we need the support of employees in
every part of SAP.
To address this, we have a global internal network of more than
100 sustainability champions who represent different regions
and lines of business at SAP. They dedicate 10% of their work
time to promoting sustainability. Not only do they act as role
models, but they also tailor sustainability to local and LoB needs
and interests as well as share best practices.

Human Rights and Labor
Standards
Upholding High Standards
At SAP, we believe that we have a responsibility to respect
human rights throughout all our business operations. Upholding
high labor standards supports diversity and helps us to attract
and keep top talent. Providing fair, ethical conditions for our
employees also results in greater innovation and productivity.
SAP is a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact. This is
a voluntary undertaking to align our strategies and operations
with universal principles on human rights, labor, the
environment, and anticorruption.
By integrating human rights considerations into our standard
business practices, we also support the values of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for
Multinational Enterprises, and the International Labor
Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights
at Work. To ensure that our commitment to human rights
translates into practice, we take guidance from the United
Nations “Protect, Respect and Remedy” framework.

Making a Commitment
The SAP Global Human Rights Commitment Statement details
our response to the international standards mentioned above.
Based on the SAP Code of Business Conduct and approved by
our Executive Board, the statement focuses on three main
areas: our employees, our ecosystem of partners and suppliers,
and our solutions.
Our commitment statement applies to all our operations and
subsidiaries globally and is reviewed on a regular basis. It also
contains references to our other guidelines such as health and
safety management, and data protection and privacy.

Enforcing Our Standards
Our sustainability organization is responsible for making sure
that we fulfil our human rights commitments across the
business. The team works with colleagues from human
resources (HR), procurement, and product development to
manage an integrated approach.
To assess our human rights measures, we consider external
benchmarks, performance ratings, audit results, and
stakeholder feedback. In addition, since 2012, we conduct
regular internal audits to verify that our subsidiaries adhere to

our standards and to check internal compliance with this policy.
In 2016, we conducted a labor audit at our SAP India and SAP
Labs India locations in Bangalore. There were no material
findings within the audit. However, areas for improvement were
identified and include improvement of security escorts,
comprehensive distribution of access cards, as well as
improvement in air-conditioning.

Respecting the Rights of Our
Employees
We have a long-standing policy of nondiscrimination in our
dealings with employees and provide training on human rights
issues that are most relevant to our business. These include
security, privacy, and antidiscrimination.
We encourage any employees who feel they are subjected to
conduct that violates our antidiscrimination policies to report it.
They can reach out confidentially to their managers, HR officers,
a compliance office, or colleagues who are trained to be part of
our internal mediation pool.
In addition, our global ombudsperson investigates employee
complaints and mediates fair settlements. The ombudsperson
also helps the Executive Board analyze HR-related complaints
and consider ways to address potential issues before they
occur.

Further Measures to Ensuring Fair
Labor Practices
At SAP, we strive for constructive labor relations across the
world, working within each country’s requirements. We currently
have works councils in place in Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, and the United Kingdom. In
addition, we have a European works council that represents
employees from all SAP subsidiaries in Europe.
These councils consist of both elected union members and nonunion members, and are consulted by SAP management on
topics that define the work environment and work processes.
These include HR initiatives, talent development, payment and
benefits, equal opportunities, changes in work or IT processes,
privacy protection, and health and safety protection.
Collective bargaining agreements with unions are only made in
countries where legally required. Overall, about 50% of

Additional Information on Economic, Environmental and Social Performance
Human Rights and Labor Standards

235

employees are represented by works councils, an independent
trade union, or are covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Maintaining High Standards Across
Our Supply Chain
We expect all of our business partners to respect human rights
and to avoid complicity in human rights abuses. Our codes of
conduct for suppliers and partners require them to uphold labor
rights and to provide a safe and healthy work environment for all
employees.
We work collaboratively with our suppliers and partners on the
implementation of these codes. In addition, we may carry out
on-site audits to assess performance.

Respecting Human Rights
Throughout Our Product Lifecycle
As a business software company, we are committed to
respecting and protecting human rights throughout the lifecycle
of our products – from design through development to use. We
develop innovative solutions that help customers embed human
rights standards into their business and supply chain strategies.
We also develop solutions that help to advance human rights in
areas such as healthcare, education, and public services. For
example, our healthcare solution SAP Medical Research Insights
delivers software that addresses the areas of patient care,
cancer research and cancer prevention.
When designing any solution, our development teams ensure
that the product complies with human rights standards. For
example, accessibility is a key area of focus and we follow Web
content accessibility guidelines such as Section 508 to ensure
inclusive design in all our software.
The protection of personal information is another key area of
focus for our development teams. To help ensure that our
products enable our customers to respect digital rights, we
adhere to robust privacy and security standards. These are
defined in our global product development, quality, product
standards, and data protection and privacy policies.

This year, we have looked at the way we recruit our supplier
base in order to increase opportunities for a wide range of
businesses to compete for supply of products and services to
SAP. We have also engaged with our suppliers to define higher
standards of conduct, and to encourage new thinking when it
comes to sustainability.

What We Buy and Where We Buy It

Promoting Supplier Diversity
Including more diverse businesses – that is, minority enterprises
defined by gender, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, age,
religion, and other characteristics – into our supplier base has
become a key priority for SAP. We believe that our commitment
to an inclusive, bias-free culture in our workplace should be
mirrored in our approach to our supplier base. In addition,
through their flexibility and a high innovation potential, we
believe that diverse businesses bring significant added value to
SAP.

To address this, we developed a supplier diversity program this
year. Driven by our Global Procurement Organization (GPO), the
program is an integral part of our supplier management
program. It strives to ensure that diverse businesses have a fair
chance at competing for contracts and are treated equally with
other SAP suppliers. Targeted to reach a 5% spend ratio for
diversity suppliers in selected countries by 2020, the GPO will
proactively involve diversity suppliers in selected categories in
defined countries into our sourcing process.
Demonstrating our commitment to supplier diversity, SAP
became a corporate member of the following minority supplier
organizations in 2016:
– Minority Supplier Development U.K. (MSDUK)
– WeConnect International

Upholding High Standards Across
Our Supply Chain
Today’s digital networks help us connect with an increasing
number of global suppliers, quickly and easily. However, with

Additional Information on Economic, Environmental and Social Performance
Sustainable Procurement

237

supply networks becoming more complex, companies face even
greater challenges in ensuring their suppliers uphold high ethical
standards.
To help address this, we are developing an innovative SAP Ariba
solution for supplier risk management that enables companies
to identify and manage their response to a range of supplierrelated risks. Our GPO is collaborating with the SAP Ariba
product development teams to finalize and implement this cloud
solution. With the SAP Ariba Supplier Risk Insights solution,
organizations can establish due diligence, ongoing monitoring,
and remediation processes to proactively address risks across
the source-to-pay process and the full supplier base.
This innovative solution provides buyers with a command center
that helps them monitor all relevant risk information. It also
offers daily alerts and notifications to buyers based on their
preferences. Sustainability risks covered by the solution include
unethical practice, workplace discrimination, workplace safety
neglect, the use of child labor, human trafficking, and
environmental disasters such as oil spills and radioactive
contamination.
In addition, our GPO worked on a pilot project with the SAP Ariba
team and the Made in a Free World organization to identify the
areas of greatest risk of forced and child labor in our supply
chain. As part of this project, we requested information about
our suppliers’ supply chains and analysis of this data is helping
us to pinpoint potential risk areas for further investigation.
We are also strengthening the enforceability of the code of
conduct for suppliers and it is now an integral part of our
standard contracts. It is also included in our global terms and
conditions.

Driving Innovative Sustainability
Projects
SAP works closely with suppliers to find new ways to make our
supply chain more sustainable. We have a number of ongoing
projects that minimize our impact on the environment in areas
such as enterprise mobility, catering, office supplies, and SAP
events.
Our chief procurement officer and chief sustainability officer
meet each quarter to discuss progress and challenges related to
embedding sustainability in our procurement practices.

Taking a Global Approach
Our waste and water strategy ensures that we minimize the
impact SAP has on our environment. By promoting companywide initiatives, we keep waste out of landfills and reduce the
amount of water we use in locations worldwide. A global
approach combined with local targets and initiatives ensures
that we optimize our environmental performance.
Taking steps to recycle our waste and save water also
contributes to our business performance. Through ongoing
initiatives at SAP sites, we reduce our operational costs while
engaging our employees in our efforts.

Managing Our E-Waste
Our single largest source of waste comes from the data center
servers, IT equipment, PCs, peripherals, and range of mobile
devices that we use to develop our software. Our servers and IT
equipment are either resold or recycled in an environmentally
friendly manner depending on their condition. In 2016, we
continued our engagement with one of the world’s most
sustainable companies as our e-waste disposal partner. This
partner adheres to ISO 14001 standards and ensures that we
have one uniform disposal process for e-waste. This way we
were able to recycle 160 tons of e-waste this year. We plan to
expand this recycling process for our servers to our Americas
region in 2017.
In addition, we support the reuse of “gently used” IT equipment
internally through used-equipment shops in some country
locations. A sustainable procurement program complements
our waste reduction efforts by offering sustainably produced IT
equipment. Besides e-waste, we estimate that we generated
approximately 3 kilotons (kt) of waste in our offices, cafeterias,
and product packaging worldwide in 2016. The vast decrease
compared to 2015 stems primarily from adjusting our
extrapolation factor which is used to calculate waste quantities
from sites where actual data is not available.

Composting Food Waste
SAP also runs comprehensive recycling programs for cafeterias
at its sites worldwide. For example, we process leftover food
from our headquarters in Walldorf, Germany, in an external
composting plant.
Our SAP Labs location in Bangalore, India, has installed an
“organic waste converter.” This recycles organic waste from
cafeteria operations into odor-free, homogenized compost. Our
cafeterias in Palo Alto, CA, and Newtown Square, PA, in the
United States have comprehensive composting programs in
place with the byproducts used to fertilize the on-site gardens.

Cutting Down on Landfill Waste
In 2016, we continued to roll out zero waste diversion programs
at offices across the globe as part of our ISO 14001 program
with specific targets to achieve and maintain landfill diversion at
or above 90%. This approach focuses on eliminating the need to
send waste to landfill, by changing processes or promoting the
reuse of materials.

We reduced our paper usage by almost 30% since 2009
through our global printing optimization initiative. Among other
improvements, this sets printers to produce double-sided,
black-and-white printouts as a default. This year we have also
made significant advances in paperless contracting. By using
the SAP Signature Management application from DocuSign to
enable electronic signatures, we have been able to handle
31,472 pages of contract, cutting down on paper contracts
significantly.

Changing Working Behavior
We have also successfully changed working behavior to
significantly reduce the amount of pages that our employees
print. A secure pull-printing system requires that employees
bring their ID badges to a printing device to activate a job. This
makes people think about whether the printout is really needed.
With more than 76,000 employees currently using this system,
our printing volume has reduced by 15.4 million pages in total
since 2014.
SAP employees can access a printing dashboard that shows the
company’s progress in reducing paper consumption at global,
regional, and country levels.

Using Water Efficiently
While our operations are not water-intensive, we continue to use
water as efficiently as possible. As part of our efficiency efforts,
we use rain and run-off water for irrigation and toilets in
Walldorf, Germany, and other office locations.

Public Policy
SAP has developed trusting relationships with governments
worldwide by exploring the potential for information and
communications technology (ICT) to spur economic growth,
create jobs, and address societal challenges.
SAP engages with governments around the globe on a number
of public policy issues, including the creation of reasonable
framework conditions for new technologies or business models
such as cloud computing, the Internet of Things, and Big Data.
SAP supports global best practices to ensure cybersecurity and
the protection of personal data to build trust in digital
technologies. SAP favors global policy frameworks and
international standards that enable the free flow of data across
borders and the free trade of digital products and services.
SAP believes in transparency in the political process.
Accordingly, we are registered in the European Transparency
Register for interest representatives. In the United States, our
company is registered and reports in compliance with the
Lobbying Disclosure Act.

Political Contributions
SAP does not support any political parties. Under the laws of the
United States, a number of SAP employees continue to exercise
their right to create a political action committee (PAC). The SAP
America PAC is an independent, registered, and strictly
regulated organization that allows eligible employees in the
United States to support political candidates at the state and
federal level. Consistent with U.S. law, SAP SE exercises no
control over or influence on the SAP America PAC. SAP America
PAC expenditures are transparent and available on the U.S.
Federal Election Commission Web site.

General Information About Social
Indicators
Boundaries
Our boundaries take two different perspectives: SAP as a
company, which includes all our legal entities and operations
and supply chain, and SAP as a solution provider enabling our
customers. These boundaries are listed in detail in the GRI G4
Content Index.

Social Indicators
Data for our social indicators is collected and reported on a
quarterly or annual basis and is subject to external assurance for
annual reporting.

Employee Retention
We define employee retention as a ratio that puts emphasis on
employee-initiated turnover – in other words, we seek to
measure how many employees choose to stay with SAP. We
derive our retention rate by starting with our average number of
employees expressed in full-time equivalents (FTEs) in a given
year and subtracting employee-initiated turnover. We then
divide this figure by our average number of employees in that
year to obtain our retention rate. As opposed to keeping a low
turnover rate – which companies generally seek to do – we aim
to keep our retention rate high. A higher retention rate signifies
that fewer employees are choosing to leave SAP.
We do not differentiate between gender when we analyze
retention and turnover rates.

Women in Management
We define “women in management” as the share of women in
management positions as compared to the total number of
managers.
At SAP, we differentiate between the following categories of
managers:
– Managers managing teams: Refers to managing teams of at
least one employee or vacant positions
– Managers managing managers: Refers to managing
managers that manage teams
– Board members

244

Business Health Culture Index
The Business Health Culture Index (BHCI) measures the general
cultural conditions in an organization that enable employees to
stay healthy and balanced. The index covers questions
concerning how employees rate their personal well-being and
the working conditions at SAP, including our leadership culture.
The BHCI is an indicator as to what extent SAP successfully
offers employees a working environment that promotes health
supporting their long-term employability and their active
engagement in reaching our ambitious corporate goals.
The BHCI is calculated based on the results of an employee
survey (“People Survey”) conducted annually. All employees
were invited to take part in the 2016 People Survey and 64,889
employees participated (response rate: 76%).
The BHCI score for 2014 was recalculated from 70% to 72%
based on two updated questions in the people survey
concerning work-life balance. The changes were carried out to
simplify the questionnaire and to better compare with against
external benchmarks.

Employee Engagement
We define employee engagement as a score for the level of
employee commitment, pride, and loyalty, as well as our
employees’ feeling of advocacy for SAP.
It is calculated based on the results of an employee survey that
is conducted annually (see BHCI).
In 2015, we simplified our Employee Engagement Index and
recalculated our score for 2015 from 81% to 82%. This
calculation method has been applied moving forward.

Customer Loyalty
We measure customer loyalty using the Customer Net Promoter
Score (NPS). The NPS is derived from the following survey
question “How likely would you be to recommend SAP to friends
or colleagues?” Customers choose from a range of 0 to 10.
Customers that choose a 9 or 10 are considered Promoters.
Passives answer the question with a rating of 7 or 8, and
Detractors with a rating of 6 or less.
The Customer NPS is calculated using the following formula:
NPS = % of Promoters – % of Detractors. Passives are not

Non-Financial Notes: Social Performance

included in the calculation. The NPS can range from –100% to
100%.
We aim to include at least 70% of all eligible direct customers
from all regions and industries in the annual survey. From each
company, multiple roles (decision makers, influencers, end
users) are invited to provide feedback. In 2016, approximately
29% of invited customers (accounts) participated in the survey.
In 2015, customers who purchased SAP Hybris and Concur
solutions were included for the first time; in 2016, we also added
customers of Fieldglass and Ariba to our global process. As we
further harmonize processes in acquired entities, the customer
segments used for customer surveys has not yet been
completely harmonized across the SAP Group. Specifically, due
to the nature of the business, the Concur customer sample
includes a higher proportion of general business customers in
comparison to other Group entities. As a result, Concur
responses make up a large proportion of the total customer
sample.
Our Customer NPS accounting policy helps ensure that SAP
achieves a trustworthy consolidated NPS for our on-premise
and cloud-based services.

A Detailed View of Our Emissions
We look at our energy usage and emissions throughout our
entire value chain, gaining insights to help us manage our
environmental performance and, in turn, help our customers do
the same. The activities and trends behind our results for 2016
are detailed below. This includes information about the areas in
which we consume the most purchased electricity, as well as the
impact caused by the use of our products.
Our gross carbon footprint for 2016 was 682 kilotons CO2e (704
kilotons CO2e in 2015). Our gross carbon footprint includes all
GHG emission categories in Scope 1, 2, as well as selected
categories of 3 as outlined in figure 1. Our net carbon footprint is
calculated by reducing purchased renewable energy certificates
and carbon offsets from our gross carbon footprint in the
respective reporting period.

Direct Emissions (Scope 1)
Consumption of fuel for our company cars remains the single
greatest contributor to our Scope 1 emissions. In 2016, we
continued to enhance our car policy by linking emissions caps to
efficiency improvements of the automotive industry. In addition,
we focused on greater shifts in commuting habits. We continued
the global rollout of TwoGo by SAP, our car-sharing solution,
which is now available in 110 SAP locations worldwide. To
increase the scale and attractiveness of TwoGo, we make the
solution available to the public free of charge. As part of our
initiative to increase the proportion of electric vehicles in our car
fleet to 20% by 2020, we continue to offer incentives to our
employees to purchase electrical cars. As an example of
additional transportation alternatives for our employees, we
established a company bike program in Germany, where
employees have the opportunity to select between using a
bicycle or a company car to commute to work. A further
commuting alternative to a company car in Germany is
participation in a national reduced train fare program called
“BahnCard 100.”

refer to our green cloud, we mean our cloud is carbon neutral
due to purchasing 100% renewable electricity certificates and
compensation by offsets, at SAP. We continued a wide range of
efficiency projects to reduce our energy usage, including facility
upgrades and new LEED certifications. We also expanded the
management of our environmental performance through ISO
14001.
We are one of the global corporations that have signed on to the
RE100 initiative. Led by The Climate Group in partnership with
CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project), the goal of the RE100
campaign is to have 100 of the world’s most influential
businesses committed to 100% renewable electricity.

Upstream Emissions (Scope 3)
Only selected upstream emissions such as business flights,
paper consumption, and co-locations of data centers are
directly measured and hence included in our corporate target.
The additional upstream emissions products and services or
grey energy of our buildings are based on an estimate. Together,
our upstream emissions including these estimates are
responsible for about 15% of SAP’s total carbon footprint.
As it is expected that the emissions from external data centers
(co-locations) will continue to grow in the future, SAP
committed to a green cloud strategy, to compensate the
emissions with renewable electricity certificates.

Downstream Emissions (Scope 3)
The vast majority of our overall emissions stem from the use of
our software. When SAP software runs on our customers’
hardware and on their premises, the resulting carbon footprint is
about 20 times the size of our own net carbon footprint. Given
that we cannot control our customers’ IT landscapes because
they usually contain many elements not related to SAP software,
we share this responsibility with others.

Indirect Emissions (Scope 2)
Our purchased electricity powers everything from our data
centers to our buildings throughout the world. Whenever we

246

Non-Financial Notes: Environmental Performance

Offsets
Our investment in Livelihoods Funds has provided us with 21
kilotons of high-quality carbon credits, which we used to
compensate Scope 3 emissions in 2016.
We continued offsetting carbon emissions for business flights in
2016. In addition to avoiding overall business flights, we began
to offset selected business flights in the second half of 2015.
This offset effort resulted in a compensation of 90 kilotons of
CO2e in 2016.

All numbers are based on the metric system. Whenever we state
“tons,” we mean metric tons.
The indicators greenhouse gas emissions per employee and
total energy consumed per employee are calculated on the basis
of an average number of employees. This average is calculated
by adding the FTEs at the end of each quarter and then dividing
the result by four.

Greenhouse Gas Footprint
We define the GHG footprint or carbon footprint as the sum of all
greenhouse gas emissions measured and reported for SAP,
including the compensation with renewable energy or offsets.
SAP’s preparation of the GHG footprint is based on the
Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Scope 1 and 2)
and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard of the World
Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable
Development. This approach conforms with the requirements of
GRI G4 indicators EN3, EN4, EN15, EN16, and EN17.

Reporting Principles
SAP reports our net greenhouse gas emissions according to the
GHG Protocol Scope 2 and the location-based method. The
recently introduced market-based method is an amendment to
the GHG Protocol Scope 2 and will be considered starting 2017.
For 2016 we continue to apply the location-based emissions
instead of a dual reporting (location and market based).

General Information About
Environmental Non-Financial
Indicators
Boundaries
Our boundaries take two different perspectives: SAP as a
company, which includes all our legal entities and operations
and supply chain, and SAP as a solution provider enabling our
customers. These boundaries are listed in detail in the GRI G4
Content Index.

Environmental Indicators
Data for our environmental indicators is collected and reported
on a quarterly basis and is subject to external assurance for
annual reporting.
Reporting on total energy consumed, data center energy, and
renewable energy is based on the data collected for the
calculation of our greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint. Therefore,
the same reporting principles apply as for the GHG footprint.

In 2016 we updated our emissions and extrapolation factors for
the categories stationary combustion facilities, corporate cars,
corporate jets, business flights, rental cars, train travel, business
trips with private cars, employee commuting as well as paper
consumption, leading to a 10% downward impact on SAP’s 2016
gross CO2 emissions.

Organizational Boundaries
SAP defines our organizational boundaries by applying the
operational control approach as set out in the GHG Protocol.
Operational control is established when SAP has the full
authority to introduce and implement its operating policies. The
emissions of all operations over which the company has
operational control and all owned, leased facilities, co-location
data centers, and vehicles that the company occupies or
operates are accounted for in the GHG footprint, being based on
either measurements or, where no measured data is available,
on estimations and extrapolations.
A portion of SAP’s leased facilities operates under full-service or
multitenant leases, where the building owner or manager pays
for the utilities directly and SAP does not have access to actual
energy consumption information. SAP includes these facilities in
our definition of operational control and accounts for them by
estimating related energy consumption.

247

To support the growing demand for SAP’s cloud offerings, we
subcontract computation power in local third-party data
centers. Carbon emissions are approximated and included
based on the consumed computation power.
In most instances, however, SAP has 100% ownership of our
subsidiaries. Accordingly, the difference between applying the
control versus the equity approach is about 0.6% based on SAP
revenue. If additional investments in associates were included,
the difference would be even smaller, about 0.5%.

Scope 3

Methodology
We are reporting all our GHG emissions in CO2 equivalents
(CO2e), including the impact from CH4, N2O, and HFCs in our
Scope 1 and 2 emissions. As SF6 and PFCs mainly occur in
chemical processes, they are not relevant for us.
Below you will find the different parameters contributing to our
carbon footprint:

Scope 1
– Stationary Combustion Facilities: Inclusion of CH4 and
N2O; stable values (kWh/m²) instead of actual average
consumption are used for extrapolation of buildings where no
measured data is available (60% measured data). In cases
where no specific information is available, natural gas
reported by local sites is assumed to be reported in Lower
Heating Value.
– Refrigerants Facilities: Refrigerant data is reported for
completeness of our carbon footprint, but HFC emissions are
fully estimated (0% measured data) based on the number of
server units and office space with an A/C system; all
refrigerants are assumed to be HFC134a.
– Mobile Combustion Corporate Cars: Inclusion of CH4 and
N2O; in 2016, 31 countries reported actual fuel data (90%
data coverage); for other countries stable values (liters/car)
are used for extrapolation based on the number of corporate
cars reported. The stable values for extrapolation are based
on SAP’s 2015 carbon footprint data.
– Refrigerants Corporate Cars: Refrigerant emissions are
based on a rough estimate of HFC emissions per car and are
extrapolated based on the number of corporate cars reported
(0% measured data).
– Mobile Combustion Corporate Jets: Inclusion of CH4 and
N2O (100% data coverage)

Scope 2
– Electricity Office: Updated CO2 conversion factors and
inclusion of CH4 and N2O based on country specific grid
factors; stable values (kWh/m²) instead of actual average
consumption are used for the extrapolation of buildings
where no measured data is available (70% data coverage).
The stable values are based on SAP’s 2015 carbon footprint
data.

248

– Electricity Data Centers: Updated CO2 conversion factors
and inclusion of CH4 and N2O based on country specific grid
factors; electricity consumption for internal data centers is
extrapolated based on the number of server units (80% data
coverage). The stable values are based on SAP’s 2015 carbon
footprint data.
– Purchased Chilled and Hot Water, Steam: Inclusion of CH4
and N2O based on global emission grid factors (45% data
coverage).

The following scope 3 GHG emissions are included in our
corporate GHG target:
– Business Flights: Average emission factors for business
flights are calculated based on short, medium, and long-haul
flights; extrapolation of CO2 is based on the actual distance
travelled and the net (excluding tax) costs (55% data
coverage), emission factors for business flights do not
consider the radiative forcing factors.
– Rental Cars: Average emission factors from rental cars are
calculated based on actual distance traveled and these
factors are used for extrapolation based on the costs (90%
data coverage).
– Train Travel: Average emission factors from train travel are
calculated based on an actual distance traveled and these
factors are used for extrapolation based on the costs (30%
data coverage).
– Business Trips with Private Cars: Carbon calculation is
based on distance traveled with a private car, extrapolation is
based on FTE. Train and company car trips are excluded from
this activity type (60% data coverage).
– Employee Commuting: A system-integrated commuting
survey about the distance to work and the mode of transport
is conducted annually for SAP globally. The survey responses
are the basis for carbon calculation of employee commuting
in the following year. More than 30,000 employees
responded to the survey in 2016. Commuting for nonresponding employees and quarterly updates are
extrapolated based on the number of FTEs excluding those
employees who own a company car.
– Electricity External Data Centers: Updated CO2 conversion
factors and inclusion of CH4 and N2O based on country
specific grid factors; electricity consumption for external data
centers is extrapolated based on the data center capacity, a
utilization and power usage effectiveness (PUE) factor. As
the utilization and PUE factor is not available for all external
data centers, the average of all provided factors is used as
estimate for external data centers with missing information.
– Logistics: Calculation is based on the actual number of
parcels and mail sent from our logistics center in Germany
and is extrapolated globally.
– Data Download: Carbon calculation is based on the data
volume downloaded by our customers globally (100% data
coverage).

Additional Information on Economic, Environmental and Social Performance
Non-Financial Notes: Environmental Performance

– Paper Consumption: Calculation for emissions caused by
the consumption of printing paper is based on printer tracker
data (100% data coverage).
An external data center is a local computing center with server
units running SAP software that is operated by an external
partner. Those emissions are classified as Scope 3. SAP-owned
and SAP-managed data centers, coming from acquisitions are
classified as Scope 2 GHG emissions.
Additionally, we annually measure and publish the following
Scope 3 GHG emissions based on the GHG Protocol’s Corporate
Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard.
These GHG emissions are not included in our corporate target
and are meant to be for indicative purpose only.

Upstream
Due to the link of our upstream emissions to operating
expenses, for 2016, we extrapolated our upstream figures by
multiplying our four key contributors to our upstream emissions
from 2015 with the year-over-year increase of operating
expenses between 2015 and 2016.

Downstream
– Use of Sold Products: Resource need per year is determined
using a landscape simulation. It is extrapolated globally based
on the number of productive installations and power usage
effectiveness (PUE). We use a PUE factor of 1.9, representing
a commonly used global average. Emissions are calculated
using a global electricity emission factor. Due to the special
characteristics of software products, an assessment of
resource need per year was chosen. This deviates from the
minimum boundaries as defined by the GHG Protocol’s
Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting
Standard, which requires assessment and disclosure of
“direct use-phase emissions of sold products over their
expected lifetime.” The calculation covers all of our major
solutions, including on-premise software. Cloud solutions are
not included, as they are part of our Scope 2 emissions.
Mobile solutions (e.g. SAP apps running on customer IT
equipment) are also not included. Calculation parameters will
be adapted when significant technology changes occur.
Not included: Upstream Transportation and Distribution (due to
data complexity and de minimis); Upstream Leased Assets (not
applicable); Processing of Sold Products (not applicable); Endof-Life Treatment of Sold Products (not applicable);
Downstream Leased Assets (not applicable); Franchises (not
applicable); and Investments (not applicable).

External Reduction
– Renewable Electricity: Purchased renewable electricity is
already deducted from our Scope 2 emissions in the net
carbon footprint; CO2, CH4, and N2O conversions are based
on grid specific factors from the origin of renewable

electricity; data is only valid with an official certificate or
written confirmation of the electricity supplier (100% data
coverage).
– Offsets: Purchased offsets are reported separately based on
the carbon reduction amount purchased. SAP ensures that
the GHG emission reductions from offsets are credible and
that they meet four key accounting principles:
 Real: The quantified GHG reductions will represent actual
emission reductions that have already occurred.
 Additional: The GHG reductions will be surplus to
regulation and beyond what would have happened in the
absence of the project or in a business-as-usual scenario
based on a performance standard methodology.
 Permanent: The GHG reductions will be permanent or
have guarantees to ensure that any losses are replaced in
the future.
 Verifiable: The GHG reductions will result from projects
whose performance can be readily and accurately
quantified, monitored, and verified.
A requirement for offsets is that the minimum standard
(Voluntary Carbon Standard, or VCS) is applied. In 2016, our
strategic investment in the Livelihoods Funds has provided us
with 21 kilotons of offsets which are included in our overall net
carbon footprint.

CO2 Emission Factors
The calculation of the above emissions is based on factors for
conversion and extrapolation provided, among others, by IEA,
WRI, US EPA, UK DEFRA, DEHSt, Environment Canada, GHG
Protocol, and SAP’s own measurements.
Where relevant, our CO2 emission factors consider all CO2
equivalents (CO2e) for all greenhouse gases. Global Warming
Potential factors are based on the Fifth Assessment Report of
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Comparability
SAP uses a significance threshold of 5% for structural or
organizational changes and 1% for methodology changes of
total current year emissions. A structural or organizational
change that increases or decreases the total inventory by 5% or
more will trigger an adjustment of historic years. A structural or
organizational change that increases or decreases the total
inventory by less than 5% will be considered insignificant and
thus no adjustment will be made.
Additionally, we annually measure the cumulative cost
avoidance of our carbon emissions, compared to a business-asusual scenario. In 2015, we introduced a cumulative cost
avoidance calculation based on a triennial rolling method. This
leads to additional comparability and we will continue to
calculate our cumulative cost avoidance with the triennial rolling
approach.

Error Correction
If a significant error is found in the base year inventory, it will be
corrected. If a significant error is found which does not affect the
base year but has an impact on this year’s or last year’s
emissions, it will be corrected. An error is significant if it affects
SAP’s gross carbon footprint by more than 1%. No restatement
due to error correction of historical data was necessary in 2016.

Renewable Energy
We define renewable energy as electricity coming from
renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, hydro, and
geothermal. The shares of renewable energy used by SAP are
calculated by adding the amount of renewable energy
specifically sourced, produced onsite by our own solar cells, and
covered by Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). We have
developed a quality standard that defines key criteria for the
procurement of RECs to drive change in the electricity market
and to avoid the risk caused by low-quality products. The key
characteristics of our renewable energy purchasing guidelines
are as follows:
– Type of renewable electricity: SAP considers solar, wind,
biogas, geothermal, and hydro power as renewable
electricity.
– Installation: The power plant producing the renewable
energy shall not be older than 10 years. In case of a
renovation of an old power plant, the 10-year rule applies only
to the additional electricity output due to efficiency increase.
Furthermore, SAP does not consider RECs from government
supported power plants.
– Vintage: The renewable electricity must be produced in the
same year or the year before with regard to the reporting
period it will be applied.
– Accounting: To calculate the carbon reduction achieved by
the RECs, SAP will use the grid-specific emissions factor. As
RECs are considered independently to the electricity
delivered physically to our facilities, the carbon reduction
achieved through their procurement can be allocated to any
location globally.

(location with any number of server units) that is part of our
global IT infrastructure strategy. In 2016, we continued
analyzing and reporting internal and external data center energy
consumption intensity against our non-IFRS revenue.
Data center energy consumption per euro is calculated by
dividing the electricity consumption of all internal and external
data centers measured for the calculation of our GHG footprint.
We will continuously improve data quality of energy
consumption of external data centers.

Total Energy Consumed
We define total energy consumed as the sum of all energy
consumed through SAP-own operations, including energy from
renewable sources. It is calculated based on the consumption
data obtained through our measurements for the GHG footprint
and is the sum of energy consumption from stationary
combustion facilities, mobile combustion corporate cars, mobile
combustion corporate jets, electricity offices, electricity data
centers, and purchased chilled water, purchased hot water, and
purchased steam.

Water
By water, we mean total freshwater withdrawn for our facilities.
Data is based on estimations from sites and is largely
extrapolated. Data was provided (estimated) for 60% of the
total space; remaining data is extrapolated based on square
meter footage.

Waste
By waste, we mean non-recyclable waste produced in our offices
and data centers. Data on municipal waste was provided
(estimated) for about 50% of the total space.

All energy outside the aforementioned categories falls within
conventional energy. We define conventional energy as
electricity coming from the standard electricity grid. The
electricity grid provides a country-specific energy mix including
all available sources, either fossil, nuclear, or renewable. Energy
from renewable sources as part of the local grid is calculated as
conventional energy and not displayed as part of renewable
energy.

Data Center Energy
We define data center energy as the sum of electricity
consumed to provide internal and external computation power
in SAP data centers and contracted third party data centers. A
data center is any global, regional, or local computing center

In Germany, we measure the accident rate
with a “1000-Mann-Quote” (TMQ). This is
calculated as the number of reportable
accidents × 1000 employees/number of fulltime equivalents. Reportable accidents are
work-related and include commuting
accidents that result in more than three days
of absence from work. In 2016, the TMQ was
3.6 (3.4 in 2015). We also measure the
accident rate per one million working hours.
In 2016, this value slightly increased to 2.3
reportable accidents per one million working
hours (2.2 in 2015).

Injuries, diseases, lost days,
or absenteeism are not a
material issue for SAP as
we track our Business
Health Culture Index on a
global basis.

Our learning strategy is also based on the
principle that much of employee learning
and development happens outside formal
training through peer-based interaction such
as coaching, mentoring, rotational programs
and on-the-job-guided development
experiences. As a result, we have decided to
no longer report on the number of formal
training hours per employee because it does
not provide meaningful insights.

Management’s
Acknowledgement of the
SAP Integrated Report
2016
The International Integrated Reporting (<IR>) Framework
launched by the International Integrated Reporting Council in
December 2013 has a provision that an integrated report should
include a statement in which management acknowledges its
responsibility for the report. Our respective statement for 2016
is as follows:
The SAP Integrated Report 2016 is only available online. The
Executive Board is aware of its responsibility to ensure the
integrity of our integrated report. The members of the Executive
Board have applied their collective mind to the preparation and
presentation of our integrated report.
Similar to previous reports, our SAP Integrated Report 2016 is
structured along the content elements suggested in the <IR>
Framework. We have applied the Guiding Principles of the <IR>
Framework, but we also must ensure our compliance with legal
requirements, such as the provisions regarding financial
reporting in the German Commercial Code as set out in detail in
the German Accounting Standard 20 Group Management
Report, while balancing other reporting standards such as the
G4 guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), with the
<IR> Framework.
Our Executive Board has reviewed the SAP Integrated Report
2016, including the consolidated financial statements, the
combined management report, as well as the other additional
content related to the GRI G4 Content Index.
Our Executive Board believes that the integrated report is
presented in accordance with the <IR> Framework as far as
possible given the aforementioned restrictions. Should the
aforementioned restrictions ever cease to apply, we will
continue to strive for further alignment with the <IR>
Framework in future reports.

Independent Assurance
Report
To the executive board of SAP SE,
Walldorf
We have performed an independent assurance engagement on
selected qualitative and quantitative sustainability disclosures of
the Integrated Report 2016 (further: “the Report”) of SAP SE,
Walldorf (further “SAP”), published under
http://www.sap.com/integrated-reports/2016/en.html.
For the performance indicators Business Health Culture Index,
Employee Engagement, Employee Retention, Women in
Management, Customer Net Promoter Score, Greenhouse Gas
Emissions (Scope 1 and 2 as well as selected Scope 3 emissions
including business flights and employee commuting),
Renewable Energy and Total Energy Consumed, including the
explanatory notes thereto, a reasonable assurance engagement
was performed.
For the disclosures on materiality and stakeholder engagement,
the disclosures on management approaches for the material
aspects Business Conduct, Climate and Energy, Human and
Digital Rights, Human Capital, Innovation and Customer Loyalty,
as well as for the other qualitative and quantitative sustainability
disclosures in relation to these material aspects, a limited
assurance engagement was performed.
The qualitative and quantitative sustainability disclosures
included in the scope of our assurance engagement are marked
in the GRI G4 Content Index, published online under
http://www.sap.com/integrated-reports/2016/en/about/griindex-and-united-nations-global-compact.html with the
following symbol: 
It was not part of our engagement to review product or service
related information, references to external information sources,
expert opinions and future-related statements in the Report.

Resources Institute / World Business Council for Sustainable
Development, as well as internally developed definitions, as
described in the ‘Non-Financial Notes: Social Performance’ and
the ‘Non-Financial Notes: Environmental Performance’ as
Reporting Criteria.
This responsibility includes the selection and application of
appropriate methods to prepare the Report and the use of
assumptions and estimates for individual qualitative and
quantitative sustainability disclosures which are reasonable
under the circumstances. Furthermore, this responsibility
includes designing, implementing and maintaining systems and
processes relevant for the preparation of the Report in a way
that is free of – intended or unintended – material
misstatements.

Independence and quality assurance
on the part of the auditing firm
We have complied with the independence and other ethical
requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants
issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for
Accountants (IESBA-Code), which is founded on fundamental
principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and
due care, confidentiality and professional behavior.
The quality assurance system of the KPMG AG
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft is based on the International
Standard on Quality Control 1 "Quality Control for Audit,
Assurance and Related Service Practices" (ISQC 1) and, in
addition on national statutory requirements and professional
standards, especially the Professional Code for Certified
Accountants as well as the joint statement of WPK (Chamber of
Public Accountants) and IDW (Institute of Public Auditors in
Germany): Requirements for quality assurance in the auditing
practice (VO 1/2006).

Management´s Responsibility for the Practitioner’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion based on our work
Report
The legal representatives of SAP are responsible for the
preparation of the Report in accordance with the Reporting
Criteria. SAP applies the principles and standard disclosures of
the G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of the Global
Reporting Initiative in combination with the Corporate
Accounting and Reporting Standard (Scope 1 and 2) and the
Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard of the World

performed and the evidence obtained on the qualitative and
quantitative sustainability disclosures marked in the GRI G4
Content Index with the following symbol: 

Nature and extent of the assurance
engagement
We conducted our work in accordance with the International
Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised):
“Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of
Historical Financial Information” and the International Standard
on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3410: “Assurance
Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements” of the
International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB).
These standards require that we comply with our professional
duties and plan and perform the assurance engagement to
obtain a reasonable level of assurance to conclude that the
above mentioned performance indicators are prepared, in all
material respects, in accordance with the aforementioned
Reporting Criteria respectively to obtain a limited level of
assurance to preclude that the above mentioned qualitative and
quantitative sustainability disclosures are not prepared, in all
material respects, in accordance with the aforementioned
Reporting Criteria. In a limited assurance engagement the
evidence gathering procedures are more limited than in a
reasonable assurance engagement and therefore less
assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance
engagement. The choice of audit procedures is subject to the
auditor’s own judgement. This includes the assessment of the
risk of material misstatement in the Report under consideration
of the Reporting Criteria.
Within the scope of our engagement, we performed amongst
others the following procedures when conducting the limited
assurance:
– An evaluation of the approach to determining material
sustainability topics and respective boundaries, including
results of stakeholder engagement.
– A risk analysis, including a media search, to identify relevant
information on SAP’s sustainability performance in the
reporting period.
– Reviewing the suitability of the internally developed
definitions.
– Evaluation of the design and implementation of the systems
and processes for the collection, processing and control of
the qualitative and quantitative sustainability disclosures
included in the scope of this engagement, including the
consolidation of the data.
– Inquiries of personnel on corporate level responsible for
providing the data and information, carrying out internal
control procedures and consolidating the data and
information,
– Evaluation of internal and external documentation, to
determine whether the qualitative and quantitative
sustainability disclosures are supported by sufficient
evidence.
– An analytical review of the data and trend explanations
submitted by all sites for consolidation at corporate level.

258

– Reviewing the consistency of GRI G4 in-accordance option
‘Core’ as declared by SAP with the qualitative and
quantitative sustainability disclosures presented in the
Report.
– Evaluation of the overall presentation of the selected
qualitative and quantitative sustainability disclosures in the
Report.
In addition, we conducted the following procedures to obtain
reasonable assurance:
– An evaluation of the design and implementation, and tests of
the operating effectiveness of the systems and methods used
to collect and process the data, including the aggregation of
these data into the performance indicators as presented in
the Report.
– Auditing internal and external documentation in order to
determine in detail whether the performance indicators for
the business year 2016 correspond with the underlying
sources, and whether all the relevant information contained
in such underlying sources has been included in the Report.
– Location visits to Walldorf and St. Leon Rot (both Germany)
and a remote visit to Palo Alto (USA) to assess the quality of
information management systems and the reliability of the
data as reported to corporate level.

Conclusions
Based on the procedures performed and evidence received to
obtain reasonable assurance, the performance indicators
Business Health Culture Index, Employee Engagement,
Employee Retention, Women in Management, Customer Net
Promoter Score, Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Scope 1 and 2 as
well as selected Scope 3 emissions including business flights
and employee commuting), Renewable Energy and Total Energy
Consumed, published in the SAP Integrated Report 2016,
including the explanatory notes thereto, are, in all material
respects, presented in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.
Based on the procedures performed and evidence received to
obtain limited assurance, nothing has come to our attention that
causes us to believe that the disclosures on materiality and
stakeholder engagement, the disclosures on management
approaches for the material aspects Business Conduct, Climate
and Energy, Human and Digital Rights, Customer Loyalty and
Innovation, as well as the other qualitative and quantitative
sustainability disclosures in relation to these material aspects,
published in the SAP Integrated Report 2016, are, in all material
respects, not prepared in accordance with the Reporting
Criteria.

Purpose of the assurance report
This assurance report is issued based on an assurance
engagement agreed upon with SAP. The assurance engagement
to obtain reasonable respectively limited assurance is
conducted on behalf of SAP and the assurance report is solely

for information purposes of SAP on the results of the assurance
engagement.

Limited liability
This assurance report must not be used as basis for (financial)
decision-making by third parties of any kind. We have
responsibility only towards SAP. We do not assume any
responsibility towards third parties.
