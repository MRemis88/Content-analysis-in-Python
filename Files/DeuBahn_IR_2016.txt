Deutsche Bahn Group – 2016 Integrated Report

Letter from the
Management Board

◊◊◊

Ladies and gentlemen,
2016 was a successful year for Deutsche Bahn,
as witnessed by a new record number of passengers in long-distance transport, our R AIL­
­WAY OF THE FUTURE
quality program,
which got off to a good start, the marked
improvement in our net profit, and – last but
not least – the rollout of new digital apps for
our customers.
More and more people are placing their trust
in us. In 2016, 139 million passengers traveled
on our long-distance trains. This equates to
a further increase of 7.1 million passengers,

4

or 5.4 percent, compared to 2015. This also
constitutes a new, absolute record number
of passengers on our ICE and IC/EC trains.

“139 million passengers
constitutes a new, absolute
record number of passengers
on our ICE and IC/EC trains.”
Our RAILWAY OF THE FUTURE
quality pro­
­gram, which we launched in 2016, has produced improvements in the quality of the
services and products offered to our custom­
­ers. We are already starting to see positive
changes in punctuality, passenger information services, and the cleanliness in trains
and stations. Punctuality in particularly has

L etter from the M anagement B oard

improved in both long-distance and local
transport, as well as in freight transport. For
example, DB Long-Distance recorded an im­­
provement of 4.5 percentage points in 2016,
from 74.4 to 78.9 percent. This is the biggest
increase witnessed within the space of one
year since 2011. The improvements are all the
more impressive when you consider that our
infrastructure is currently undergoing the most
extensive-ever modernization, and more construction projects than ever before are being
implemented during ongoing operations.

“Railway of the Future has
significantly improved the quality
of the services and products
offered to our customers.”
The Group restructuring, which commenced
in 2015, marked the starting point of this
upward trend. This reorganization was driven
by DB2020+ , our sustainable Group strategy,
which we defined in further detail in 2016.

Never before have we focused so unwaveringly on the quality of our products and on
assuring the future of Deutsche Bahn. We are
gradually drawing closer to our three main
objectives: PROFITABLE QUALITY LEADER ¿ ,
TOP EMPLOYER † and ECO-PIONEER ¥ .

“Our operating profit
has increased considerably, to
1.9 billion euros year-on-year.”
Our efforts are paying off. Our operating profit
in excess of 1.9 billion euros in the 2016 finan­
­cial year constitutes a result that is both above
the budget target and significantly – more
than ten percent – higher by year-on-year
comparison.
Looking ahead to 2017, the timetable change
in December will mark both the rollout of the
ICE 4, and the start of operations on the new
ICE high-speed line between Berlin and
Munich, which will herald a new era for rail
passengers throughout Germany. Passengers

5

Deutsche Bahn Group – 2016 Integrated Report

will travel even more comfortably in the future
in the ICE 4 – the new flagship in our long-distance fleet. And an ICE Sprinter will carry passengers from Berlin to Munich in under four
hours in the future – a speed that cannot be
matched by anyone or anything else.

Our extensive restructuring program in rail
freight transport is progressing. As a business,
we are doing everything we can to make
DB Cargo fit for the future. At the same time,
we are striving to ensure a fair competitive
environment.

“Our ICE 4 and the new ICE
high-speed line between Berlin
and Munich will herald a
new era for rail passengers
throughout Germany.”

We were able to generate further growth in
our international businesses. At DB Arriva,
the major projects – Northern Rail and London
Overground in Great Britain and Limburg in
the Netherlands – have got off to a good start
and are being consistently further developed.
In addition, DB Arriva is establishing a broad
presence on the European mainland and lever­
­aging its potential, particularly in the emerg­
­ing markets in Eastern Europe.

We also want to win over customers with
attractive and affordable offers in local transport in the future. We can already announce
some good news: DB Regional has won some
important tenders at the end of 2016/beginning of 2017.

6

DB Schenker will continue to put its Primus

growth and efficiency program in place in
2017, with a new structure, leaner and faster
processes, and integrated logistics solutions

L E T T E R F R O M T H E M A N AG E M E N T B OA R D

for even closer proximity to its customers.
These efforts are starting to bear fruit – yearon-year, DB Schenker improved both profits
and margins in 2016.
Satisfied and motivated employees are the
key to our sustainable business success and
the satisfaction of our customers. The findings of our latest employee survey were gratifying, revealing that employee satisfaction is
stable at a good level throughout the Group.
In light of the enormous changes both within
and outside DB Group, this is an impressive
result. Looking ahead, our ambition remains
one of continuous improvement – in the interests of both our employees and customers.

“Employee satisfaction
     is stable at a good level.”
En route to our target of becoming a top
employer, the collective bargaining agreement concluded with EVG in 2016 marks a
milestone for the Working Environment of the
future. At the same time, our training initiative is progressing: on September 1, 2017,
about 3,300 vocational trainees and 300 dual
degree students will start working at
DB Group. As such, we continue to be one of
the biggest vocational trainers in Germany.
In 2016, we achieved an important milestone
in our efforts to be an eco-pioneer: by the
year end, we refitted half of our freight car
fleet with quiet composite brake shoes. And
we will continue to make every effort in pursuit of our challenging target of halving rail
transport noise in Germany by 2020.

“All of the progress made as
part of DB2020+ points in
the same strategic direction of
significantly enhancing our
ability to compete and making
the Group fit for the future.”
All of the progress made as part of DB2020+
points in the same strategic direction of significantly enhancing our ability to compete
and making the Group fit for the future. We
are firmly committed to the principles of the
United Nations Global Compact and to the
German Sustainability Code of the Federal
Government, as evidenced, not least, by this
Integrated Report. It provides a comprehensive review of the past financial year while
also looking to the future.

So what can our customers look forward to in
2017? One thing is clear: further quality and
product improvement.
Digitalization remains a key lever and driver
of this development. Having rolled out free
WiFi in both ICE classes on January 1, 2017,
we will be launching our ICE portal in spring,
which will, for example, feature movies and
TV series for all customers.
Our operational processes are also becoming
increasingly digitalized: the first fully automatic rolling stock is currently undergoing
trials. Driverless shuttle buses are already out
on the roads, and initial tests of self-driving
truck platoons are currently in preparation.

“We are grasping the
opportunities offered
by digitalization with capital

We are grasping the opportunities offered by
digitalization in all dimensions, with capital
expenditures of about one billion euros
planned throughout DB Group between now
and 2018. At the same time, we have reserved
about 100 million euros of venture capital
until 2019 to specifically foster start-ups and
new data-based business models.

not least because our employees devote all
their strength and passion to our Group and
our customers, day in, day out.

T

he aim of our sustainability-based corporate
strategy is to bring harmony to the economic,
social and environmental dimensions in order
to ensure sustainable business success. The advanced
DB2020+
strategy focuses strongly on customer
orientation and quality. Improving quality and the
ability to compete, especially of our core business –
the railway in Germany – are some of the most
pressing challenges facing DB Group. Establishing a

make us fit for the future. Accordingly, we have set
ourselves some challenging targets: we want to be

unctual train connections are among the foremost objectives of our R AILWAY OF THE FUTURE
quality program. One central measure
for improving punctuality is the assignment of hub
coordinators – initially at the ten most heavily frequented hubs, where we already improved quality
enormously in 2016. Of all the delayed long-distance departures in 2015, 60% of the departures
originated at these stations. On-time departure of
long-distance trains from their starting stations has
a positive impact on the entire network. In summer
2016, we added a further ten stations to the remit.

Day in, day out, our 72 hub coordinators are aware of
the reasons for recurring delays. If disruptions occur,
they support the operational workflows, analyze
processes and causes, and develop long-term solutions to help the trains start on time. They either
work in the operations center, the station, the inter­
­locking or the provisioning depot. In Frankfurt am
Main, for example, we were able to improve departures on schedule from about 58% in 2015 to about
73% in 2016. By 2018, we aim to ensure that 90% of
all long-distance trains depart the stations in question on time and thus help to improve punctuality
in the overall network.

Since October 2016, the new DB Information prototype has been in place at Berlin Südkreuz
station, where it is being tested and further developed until mid-2017. Replacement
of all 82 existing DB Information services throughout Germany will commence in fall 2017.
By 2020, the new DB Information will be in place at a total of 108 railway stations.

T

he central point of contact in stations is DB
Information. This is where passengers can
obtain guidance and information. As part of
R AILWAY OF THE FUTURE
, we have developed
the new DB Information 4.0: a modern reception
combining personal advice with information
screens and digital self-service terminals. On a
large screen that is visible from a distance, it displays information on changes to scheduled departures, timetable alterations, or connections.
The first visible measures implemented as part
of R AILWAY OF THE FUTURE
included upgrading
to multiline displays. Customers can see at a glance
whether they are on the right platform and when
their train is expected to arrive. The new layout of

the destination display also provides passengers on
platforms with information about the next three de­­
­partures, as well as any delays or platform changes.

In the future, the elevators and escalators will report in before malfunctions occur:
in doing so, the availability of the technical equipment in stations will be noticeably increased.

y the end of 2016, we had equipped about
2,100 elevators and about 1,000 escalators at
about 1,000 stations throughout Germany
with the remote diagnostics program ADAM (ex­­
panded digitalization in facilities management).
Once upgraded, the elevators and escalators report
malfunctions independently and in real time to the
station operations center. Repairs can then be orga­
­nized immediately and the systems restored are
again available to the customers faster. Customers
can obtain real-time information on the elevator
avail­­ability at www.bahnhof.de or with the DB Bahn­
­hof live app.

2016 at 53 large and mid-sized stations to further
improve the comfort of our customers. Following

customer surveys, passengers at larger stations are
benefiting from this cleaning initiative. Efforts fo­­
cused on both basic cleaning and cleaning the glass

additional € 4 million was spent in 2016 for the
cleaning initiative. Moreover, additional basic clean­
­ing measures were implemented at 137 high-frequen­

ESET is one element of R AILWAY OF THE FUTURE

aimed at consistently improving the
quality of our products and services. By mid2016, about 250 of our ICEs had undergone special
treatment. We replaced 34,000 back and seat cushions in about 2,200 cars, gave everything a thorough
clean, and remedied malfunctions in bistro cars,
air­­con system or the toilets. Between September
and December 2016, we whipped into shape the IC
fleet throughout Germany – some 1,400 passenger

cars and about 200 locomotives. Our aim was to
administer one-off intensive care to improve the
condition of the long-distance fleet. The work was
performed in three-shift operation at the ICE facilities, with the teams even working on weekends
and public holidays. At each facility, as many as
three multiple units were dealt with simultaneously.
Over the coming years, we want to perpetuate the
quality ambitions defined in RESET with capital
expenditure in excess of € 30 million in total.

n 2016, we equipped our ICE fleet with a new WiFi
system offering vastly improved performance
capabilities in order to be able to offer free WiFi
to 2nd class in addition to 1st class, starting in 2017.
The system draws on the fastest data networks
(LTE, UMTS) of all mobile networks and can bundle
network operator capacities intelligently to enable
processing of much greater volumes of data. The
bandwidth available in a train is dependent on the
performance capabilities of the mobile networks.

A new WiFi logo makes the upgraded trains recognizable. In addition, we started to improve mobile
reception in our long-distance trains in 2016. In col­
­laboration with mobile network operators Deutsche
Telekom, Telefónica Germany and Vodafone, most
of our long-distance fleet has already been equip­­ped
with new repeaters. Our capital expenditures on

n April, DB Arriva took over the Northern Rail transport contract in Great Britain, which has been operated by Arriva Rail North since then. The transport
contract covers rail transport in Northern England
with annual volume produced of about 50 million train
kilometers. This equates to about one-third of all the
transport contracts put out to tender in Germany in
2015 and is more than three times larger than the
biggest German tenders to date. The contract has a
nine-­­year term with the option of a one-year ex­tension. At the start of the contract, Northern Rail with
its team of more than 5,000 employees and 333 trains
is carrying about 90 million passengers each year in
and around the Northern England cities of Manchester,

98

NEW TR AINS ARE ADDED
TO NORTHERN R AIL

Leeds, Liverpool, Newcastle and Sheffield. Our aim is
to increase the number of passengers significantly.
The acquisition of the transport contract is contingent
upon an expansion of services and ex­­tensive modernization. For example, over the next three years, Arriva
Rail North plans to increase the volume sold by 12%,
establish several new connections, invest in new vehicles and completely renovate the rest of the fleet.
Winning the Northern Rail tender increases DB Arriva’s
share of the British rail transport market from 14% to
23%, making it one of the biggest providers in the
British market.

Since the first day in December 2016, some 250 buses have been in service.
Over the coming years, DB Arriva will also gradually be putting 46 new regional trains into operation.

O

ne of the biggest providers of passenger transport in the Netherlands is DB Arriva. Some
6,000 employees work in 11 of the country’s 12
provinces, operating 1,550 buses, 147 trains and 13
water taxis. Throughout Europe, DB Arriva is active in
14 countries with about 54,000 employees, and transports more than 1.7 billion passengers each year.

A red lion is the logo identifying all buses, trains, counters
and service points that DB Arriva has been operating in the
Dutch province of Limburg since December 2016.

“This marks a further milestone for DB Arriva’s
long-term growth in Europe. The new transport concept
for Limburg is driving the integration of regional
modes of transport and encouraging interlinked mobility,
even across borders. It is good to see that Europe
functions in the regions.”

Working closely with the province’s administration, DB Arriva
plans to make the Netherlands a pioneer in terms of e-mobility.
Within the next ten years, the entire fleet of trains and buses
will be converted to electricity.

n December 11, 2016, DB Arriva took over the
regional bus and rail transport services in the
Dutch province of Limburg. The contract had
been awarded to DB Arriva in June 2015 in a public
tender. The contract has a volume in excess of € 2 billion and a term of 15 years. We are offering passengers
in Limburg an integrated transport concept for the first
time ever. The transport contract for Limburg is the
biggest ever awarded so far in the Netherlands. The
trans­­port services in and around the province’s capital
Maastricht will also link up the German and Belgian
Euregio regions. Bus connections to Aachen were ex­­
panded. In addition, passengers in Maastricht can
board the IC bus to Düsseldorf, thus gaining direct
access to the DB long-distance network. Looking
ahead, DB Arriva and DB Regional plan to operate a
non-stop rail connection from Maastricht to Aachen.

he German unification transport project no. 8 (VDE 8)
connecting Nuremberg and Berlin is close to completion. The new line cuts travel times and improves
connections. The new construction line between Erfurt
and Leipzig/Halle opened at the end of 2015. All of the
new train-paths between Nuremberg and Berlin will be
completed in 2017.
The € 10 billion project was agreed by the Federal
Government in 1991 to improve transport connections
between east and west, and between north and south.
VDE 8 is broken down into three sub-projects (VDE 8.1,

VDE 8.2 and VDE 8.3), which in turn are split into line

expansions and new construction lines. Erfurt, Halle and
Leipzig are all hubs that are being upgraded to become
central junctions and completely revamped in the process. Old track infrastructure is being completely refurbished at a total cost of about € 1 billion. In addition, the
connection is also designed for freight transport, for
example with overtaking stations. The line will offer nu­­
merous options for implementing highly modern transport concepts. Its commissioning will herald a new era
in rail travel.

39

Deutsche Bahn Group – 2016 Integrated Report

Commissioning of
the new construction
line (VDE 8.1) in 2017

The new construction line between Ebensfeld and Erfurt (VDE 8.1) is designed as a standard-gauge, two-track electrified railway
line for high-quality passenger and freight transport. It is 107 km long in total. Nearly half of the line runs across bridges or
through tunnels – 53 out of 107 km. On the stretch through the forests of Thuringia and Upper Franconia, 22 tunnels have been
built measuring a total length of 41 km, along with 29 bridges spanning a total length of 12 km.

S

ince it commenced operation in December 2015, the
new construction line Erfurt – Leipzig/Halle (VDE
8.2) has already significantly increased the speed
in east-west transport. Passengers traveling between
Dresden and Frankfurt am Main now reach their destination one hour sooner. The two-track new construction
line, which is designed for speeds of 300 km/h, is 123 km
long and runs initially through the Thuringian basin
before crossing the Finne plateau in three tunnels spanning 15.4 km in total. Behind the Querfurt plain, the
train-path splits into two toward Halle and Leipzig. The
expansion and new construction line between Nuremberg and Erfurt (VDE 8.1) through the Thuringian forest
will vastly shorten the travel time between the major
cities in the north and south – by as much as two hours.
The travel time between Leipzig/Halle and Berlin has
already been halved since VDE 8.3 was put into service
in 2006 – to about one and a quarter hours.

A fixed frequency of fast trains – that is the recipe for the success
of the Leipzig/Halle – Berlin leg (VDE 8.3), which has been operating since 2006. The line is designed for speeds of up to 200 km/h,
which has enabled the railway to compete against the road.

The high-speed link between Nuremberg and Berlin
on the new train-path creates huge opportunities for future
European integration – for both people and markets.

he new high-speed train-path also possesses a
European dimension. The line between Nuremberg
and Berlin is an important leg within the trans-­
European transport networks. By closing the gap between
Nuremberg and Berlin, cross-border travel from Southern
to Northern Europe will be possible without having to

change locomotives, stop the train or switch to different
train control systems. All of the required European standards have been complied with on the Nuremberg–Berlin
line – even to the extent of making the platforms accessible to people with mobility issues.

on the site of the former marshaling yard in CologneNippes. Plans include proprietary power generation with
a photovoltaic system measuring about 2,100 m². The
solar power generated by the PV system will supply the
entire ICE facility. Any surplus requirements will be covered solely by purchasing eco-power from regenerative
energy sources. The ICE facility will be equipped with a
state-of-the-art and energy-efficient climate control sys­

t­ em based partly on the principle of geothermal energy
and exchanging heat with the groundwater. The on-site
geothermal system is noiseless and does not produce any
waste gas. The heat exchange principle will enable all of
the buildings on-site to be heated in winter and cooled
in summer. Absolutely no fossil fuels whatsoever will be
used. Noise protection measures include adding to, or
building new, noise protection walls, and soundproofing
building facades. The total reduction in noise will be as
much as 10.5 dB(A). In future, all ICE series, including the
new ICE 4, will be serviced at the facility.

Articles of Association and its bylaws. The Supervisory
Board extensively advised and supervised the Management
Board in the management of the companies and business
operations. The Management Board reported regularly,
without delay and in detail to the Supervisory Board
re­garding corporate planning and the business, strategic
and financial development of DB AG and its subsidiaries. All
significant business events were discussed by the Super­
visory Board and the responsible committees based on
reports of the Management Board. Significant deviations in
the actual business development were explained by the
Management Board and reviewed by the Supervisory
Board. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board maintained
close contact at all times with the Chairman of the Management Board, who regularly reported on the latest business
developments at DB AG, upcoming business decisions and
risk management.

≈≈ Meetings of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board was involved in all decisions of fundamental significance for DB AG.
In the year under review, the Supervisory Board held
four ordinary meetings and two extraordinary meetings, as
well as one strategy meeting.
No Supervisory Board member fully participated in less
than half of the meetings held in the year under review. In
the year under review, three resolutions were adopted by
written ballot. Meetings of the Executive Committee, the
Personnel Committee and the Audit and Compliance Committee were held in preparation for the meetings of the
Supervisory Board of DB AG.
The main issues discussed in the plenary meetings were
the development of Deutsche Bahn Group’s (DB Group)
revenue, profit and employment situation, as well as significant capital expenditures and equity investment projects.

46

In the scheduled meetings held during the year under
review, the Supervisory Board discussed the progress of
the Railway of the Future program, which aims at achieving
a sustainable increase in the quality and performance of
the German rail system, and the progress and development
of costs of the major Stuttgart 21/Wendlingen – Ulm project
and the situation in long-distance rail passenger transport.
The Supervisory Board discussed the strategy of DB
Group and major business units at its special strategy
meeting. At this meeting, the further development of the
overarching Group strategy and the market and competitive situation of the major business units were intensively
discussed.
At an extraordinary meeting in May 2016, the Super­
visory Board approved the merger of DB Mobility Logistics
AG (DB ML AG) into DB AG and the associated changes in
the structure of DB Group. The merger of DB ML AG into
DB AG was legally carried out on August 26, 2016, with
retro­­­active effect on the balance sheet to January 1, 2016.
In a further extraordinary meeting, the Supervisory
Board dealt in detail with the results of a special expert
opinion it had commissioned on the status of costs and
deadlines of the Stuttgart 21 project.
The Supervisory Board was also informed of significant
individual items and adopted the necessary resolutions. For
example, the Supervisory Board discussed possible Brexit
effects on DB Group, with the result that the consideration
regarding a third-party equity participation in DB Arriva,
located in Great Britain, and respectively in DB Schenker,
were set aside for the moment.
In addition, in December, the Supervisory Board provided advice on mid-term planning for 2017 to 2021 for
DB Group and approved DB Group’s budget for the 2017
financial year and DB Group’s capital expenditure plan for
2017 to 2021.

≈≈ Meetings of the Supervisory
Board committees
The Supervisory Board of DB AG has established four permanent committees to facilitate its work efficiently.
The Supervisory Board’s Executive Committee met five
times in the year under review and was in regular contact
with the Management Board regarding all major business
policy issues. In its meetings, it focused in particular on
pre­­paring the focal topics for each of the Supervisory Board
meetings.
The Audit and Compliance Committee met seven times
in the year under review, addressing, in particular, the current financial situation of DB Group and of individual business units, the risk reporting, the quarterly and half-year
financial statements, and the review findings concerning
these. The Audit and Compliance Committee discussed in
detail the progress and development of costs of the major
Stuttgart 21 project in the Management Board’s quarterly
reports, each of which was accompanied by a review by the
auditors. In its December meeting, the committee also discussed in detail the budget and capital expenditure plan
submitted and the mid-term planning of DB Group. The
committee also continued to address updates in corporate
governance and the internal controlling system necessitated by the German Accounting Law Modernization Act
(Bilanzrechtsmodernisierungsgesetz; BilMoG). The Audit
and Compliance Committee also received regular information on compliance-related investigations and internal
audit findings. In addition, the committee discussed the
hiring of the auditor for the financial statements and the
progress of the auditing process for the year under review.

At a special meeting, the Audit and Compliance Committee
also established the offers in connection with the regular
invitation to tender and the awarding of audit services, and
prepared the relevant decision of the Supervisory Board.
The committee was also informed of individual items of
financial importance. For example, the planning of individual business units as well as the economic status and the
risk situation of further large infrastructure projects were
discussed in depth. The Chairman of the Audit and Compliance Committee was in regular contact with the Management Board and the external auditor, and reported
regularly and in detail on the committee’s work to the full
Supervisory Board.
In the year under review, the Personnel Committee held
four regular meetings and seven extraordinary meetings to
prepare Management Board-related matters for discussion
by the Supervisory Board. The committee dealt in particular with the Board members’ performance target attainment and the Management Board’s performance target
agreements for the year under review. The Personnel Committee also discussed the upcoming reappointments of
members of the Management Board for the appointment
periods, and prepared the Supervisory Board’s respective
resolutions, and worked on questions of the possible further development of the compensation system for the Management Board.
The Mediation Committee established in accordance
with section 27 (3) of the German Co-Determination Act
(Mit­­­bestimmungsgesetz; MitbestG) did not have occasion
to meet in the year under review.

≈≈ Corporate governance
During the year under review, the Management Board
and Supervisory Board of DB AG again considered the further development of corporate governance. In a Cabinet
decision on July 1, 2009, the German Federal Government
adopted the Public Corporate Governance Code (PCGK).
The PCGK sets out the essential provisions of applicable
law governing the management and monitoring of nonlisted companies in which the Federal Republic of Germany
holds a majority stake, while outlining the internationally
and nationally acknowledged principles of good and
responsible corporate governance. The Supervisory Board
of DB AG dealt with the application of the PCGK within
DB Group and adopted the necessary resolutions.

≈≈ Annual financial statements
The annual financial statements and management report
of DB AG, as prepared by the Management Board, and the
consolidated financial statements and Group management
report for the period ending on December 31, 2016 were
audited and awarded an unqualified audit opinion by
PricewaterhouseCoopers Aktiengesellschaft Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (P w C), the auditor appointed by
reso­lu­tion of the Annual General Meeting. The auditor also
reviewed the risk management system (RMS) as part of
the annual audit of the financial statements, noting no
objections.
The auditor’s report was reviewed by the Audit and
Compliance Committee in its meeting held on March 20,
2017 and was discussed in full at the Supervisory Board’s
financial statements meeting held on March 22, 2017, in the
presence of the auditors who signed the audit reports. The
auditors reported on the salient audit findings and were
available to answer questions. The Supervisory Board concurred with the audit findings.

TO O U R S TA K E H O L D E R S

The Supervisory Board reviewed the annual financial statements and management report of DB AG, the consolidated
financial statements and Group management report for the
year under review, and the proposal for the dis­position of
income, noting no objections. The DB AG annual financial
statements for the 2016 financial year were ap­­­proved and
thereby adopted.
The auditor additionally reviewed the report on relationships with affiliated companies prepared by the Management Board. The auditors issued an unqualified audit
opinion and reported on their audit findings.
The Supervisory Board also reviewed this report, raising
no objections concerning the Management Board’s concluding declaration contained in the report or the audit
conducted by P wC.

≈≈ Changes in the composition
of the Supervisory Board and
the Management Board
In the reporting period, the following changes were made
in the Management Board of DB AG:
Dr. Volker Kefer resigned his mandate as member of the
Management Board of DB AG as of December 31, 2016.
At its meeting on December 14, 2016, the Supervisory

Corporate governance rules are intended to ensure good,
responsible, value-focused corporate management. On July
1, 2009, the German Federal Government adopted the
Public Corporate Governance Code (PCGK) regulating the
principles of good corporate and investment management.
The PCGK sets out the essential provisions of applicable
law governing the management and monitoring of nonlisted companies in which the Federal Republic of Germany
holds a majority stake, while outlining the internationally
and nationally acknowledged principles of good and re­
sponsible corporate governance. The objective of the PCGK
is to make the corporate management and oversight of
companies more transparent and easier to understand as
well as to establish more precisely the role of the Federal
Government as a shareholder in such companies. Concurrently, the intention is to increase awareness of good corporate governance.
We are convinced that good corporate governance is
fun­damental to the success of DB Group. Our aim is to sus­
­­tainably increase the enterprise value so as to promote the
interests of customers, business partners, investors, em­­
ployees and the public, while maintaining and expand­­ing
trust in DB Group.

≈≈ Statement of compliance
The Management Board and the Supervisory Board of
DB AG hereby issue the following joint statement:
“Since the last statement of compliance was published
on March 15, 2016, DB AG has complied with the recommendations adopted by the Federal Government on July 1, 2009,
concerning the PCGK, with the exception of point 3.3.2
(the insurance deductible when taking out D&O liability
insurance for the Supervisory Board). DB AG will continue
to comply with the recommendations of the PCGK with the
exception mentioned above in the future, until a decision is
reached concerning deductibles for the Supervisory Board.”

50

≈≈ Cooperation between
the Management Board and
Supervisory Board
As a German Aktiengesellschaft (joint stock corporation),
DB AG is subject to a two-tier management and monitoring
structure in the form of the Management Board and Supervisory Board. These two bodies are strictly segregated in
terms of both their membership and their competencies.
The Management Board manages the company solely on its
own joint responsibility. The Supervisory Board monitors
the activities of the Management Board and is responsible
for appointing members to, and dismissing members from,
the Management Board.
In the interests of optimum company management, we
see it as very important for the Management Board and the
Supervisory Board to maintain continuous dialog with each
other and to work together efficiently and in an atmosphere
of mutual trust for the benefit of the company. The Manage­
ment Board provides the Supervisory Board with regular,
prompt, comprehensive information on all matters relevant
to the company, particularly those concerning planning,
business development, risk position and the risk management, as well as the internal control system.
An overview of the MEMBER S OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD
AND THE SUPERVISORY BOARD [ PAGE 261 FF.] of DB AG, including
the mandates they hold, is provided in the notes to the
consolidated financial statements.

≈≈ Management Board

The Management Board manages the company solely on
its own joint responsibility. It is required to safeguard the
interests of the company and is committed to achieving
sustainable growth of enterprise value. It specifies the corporate objectives and defines the strategies to be implement­­ed in order to attain these objectives. The Management
Board is responsible for making decisions on all matters of
fundamental and key importance for the company.

In accordance with the resolution of the Supervisory Board
of DB AG of December 14, 2016, the Infrastructure, Services
and Technology Board division of DB AG was renamed the
Infrastructure Board division as of January 1, 2017. The technical functions carried out in the former Infrastructure,
Services and Technology division Board have been consolidated in the new Technology&Quality Board division. The
Economics, Law and Regulation Board division has been
dissolved and the functions carried out by this division have
been assigned to the remaining Board divisions. Following
the resignation of Dr. Rüdiger Grube from DB Group as of
January 30, 2017, in accordance with provisions on representation of the bylaws of the Management Board, the CEO
division and the Technology&Quality division will be led
provisionally by the CFO.
The Management Board of DB AG therefore continues
to consist of six divisions. As well as the division of the CEO,
the Management Board also encompasses the following
divisions: Finance/Controlling, Human Resources, Traffic
and Transport, Infrastructure, and Technology&Quality.
The Management Board members must discuss any conflicts of interest with the Supervisory Board immediately
and must also provide their colleagues on the Management
Board with information about any such conflicts. There
were no conflicts of interest during the year under review.

≈≈ Supervisory Board

The Supervisory Board advises and monitors the Management Board in its management of the company.
In line with the requirements of the German Co-Determination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz; MitbestG), the
Supervisory Board of DB AG consists of 20 members, of
whom ten members are shareholders’ representatives and
ten members are employee representatives. Some of the
shareholders’ representatives are seconded to the Super­
visory Board and some are elected at the Annual General
Meeting. The employees’ representatives on the Super­
visory Board are elected in line with the requirements of
the Co-Determination Act.
The Chairman of the Supervisory Board of DB AG is
Prof. Dr. Dr. Utz-Hellmuth Felcht. PER SONAL OR BUSINE S S
RELATIONSHIPS [ PAGE 250 ] of the individual Supervisory Board
members with DB Group are stated in the Notes to the
consolidated financial statements.
The Supervisory Board members must immediately
disclose any conflicts of interest with the Supervisory
Board and must also provide the Supervisory Board with
information about any such conflicts. There were no conflicts of interest during the year under review.

Transactions of fundamental importance and other Manage­
­ment Board decisions with a major impact on the business
operations and on the asset, financial and profit situation
of the company require the authorization of the Supervisory
Board. The Management Board reports to the DB Su­pervisory Board on the development of business and the position
of the Group at least once every quarter. The Management
Board also reports to the Supervisory Board regularly on
all measures implemented within the company that are
intended to ensure compliance with laws and corporate
regulations. In addition the tasks of the Supervisory Board
include the auditing and approval of the company’s annual
financial statements and the auditing of the company’s
management report, the consolidated financial statements,
and the Group management report. The Supervisory Board
also monitors the accounting process, the effectiveness of
the internal control system, the risk management system,
and the internal audit system, as well as the process of au­­
diting the annual financial statements.
In addition, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board is
in regular contact with the Management Board and spe­
cifically the Chairman of the Management Board to discuss
company strategy, business development and risk man­
agement. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board receives
regular reports from the Chairman of the Management
Board on all events that are of key importance for assessing
the company’s situation and development, as well as for
its management.
There were no consultancy agreements or other comparable service agreements or contracts for services be­­
tween the members of the Supervisory Board and DB AG in
the year under review.

Supervisory Board committees

In order to enable the Supervisory Board to carry out its
monitoring activities to the best of its abilities, the Supervisory Board of DB AG has made use of the option of setting
up further committees in addition to the Mediation Commit­tee, which has to be set up in accordance with the Co­­
Determination Act. The Supervisory Board has created an
Executive Committee, an Audit and Compliance Commit­
­tee, and a Personnel Committee. A list of the MEMBER S OF
THESE COMMITTEES [ PAGE 263 ] can be found in the notes to the
consolidated financial statements. The Supervisory Board
reports on the WORK OF THE COMMITTEES [ PAGE 47 ] in the year
under review in its report. Details of the FUNCTIONS OF THE
INDIVIDUAL COMMITTEES Œ [DB.DE/LINK S _ IR 16] can be found on

Deutsche Bahn Group – 2016 Integrated Report

≈≈ Share of women on the Management
Board and Supervisory Board

There are currently five women serving on the Supervisory
Board of DB AG. A target of a 30% share of women on the
Supervisory Board of DB AG was set, with a deadline of June
30, 2017. This target had been reached until a member
resigned on January 26, 2017. At the time this report was
published, no decision had been made on the replacement
of the vacant mandate.
There are currently no women on the Management Board
of DB AG. A target of a 15% share of women on the Management Board of DB AG was set, with a deadline of June 30,
2017.
At the other management levels of DB AG, the following
medium-term targets have been set (deadline June 30,
2017): at the first management level below the Management Board a 26.1% share of women, and on the second
management level below the Management Board a 30.9%
share of women.

≈≈ Transparency
All important information regarding the consolidated and
annual financial statements, the interim report, the financial
calendar and information on reportable security transactions can be found on our WEB SITE Œ [DB.DE/LINK S _ IR 16] . In
addition, we provide regular information on current developments within the framework of our investor relations
activities and corporate communication.

≈≈ Risk management
Good corporate management also encompasses a responsible approach to the risks and opportunities arising in connection with business operations. The early identification
and limitation of business risks is therefore of paramount
importance to the Management Board and the Supervisory
Board.
The Management Board is responsible for ensuring ade­
quate risk management and monitoring it within the company, and for continuously improving both. The German
Accounting Law Modernization Act (Bilanzrechtsmoderni­
sierungsgesetz; BilMoG) precisely defines the re­­spon­­si­
bilities of the Supervisory Board with regard to monitoring
the accounting process and ensuring the effectiveness of
the internal control system, the risk management system
and the internal audit system. For the Supervisory Board to
be able to discharge this responsibility, it must be provid­­ed
with suitable information based on which it can form an
opinion on the adequacy and effectiveness of the systems.

52

TO O U R S TA K E H O L D E R S

Regular reports are made to the Audit and Compliance
Committee concerning the adequacy and effectiveness of
the internal control system. In addition, the Management
Board reports to the Audit and Compliance Committee
regarding risks of major importance to the Group companies and the handling of these risks by the Management
Board. It also controls whether the early warning system
for risks meets the requirements of section 91 (2) of the
German Stock Corporartion Act (Aktiengesetz; AktG).

≈≈ Compliance
Compliance is an integral component of the corporate and
leadership culture in DB Group. To us, compliance means
ensuring our business activities comply with the relevant
laws and regulations that apply to them.
Our compliance activities focus on preventing and consistently combating corruption and other corporate crime.
Mandatory compliance policies serve to protect DB Group,
our employees and our executives. Increasing awareness
among our employees and executives remains of great
importance, because only risk-aware employees can recognize risks and successfully avoid or, at least, minimize them.
The compliance work of DB Group includes the early
detection of compliance risks as well as the introduction of
relevant countermeasures. This work includes conducting
compliance programs, constant communication and process improvements.
Additional information on the topic of compliance can be
found in the chapter ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON SUSTAINABILITY [ PAGE 268 F.] and on our WEB SITE Œ [DB.DE/LINK S _ IR 16] .

≈≈ Accounting and auditing
On April 13, 2016, the Annual General Meeting of DB AG
appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers Aktiengesellschaft
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (P wC), Berlin, as auditor
for the 2016 financial year. The Audit and Compliance Committee prepared the proposal of the Supervisory Board
regarding the election of the auditor and, following the
election of the auditor by the Annual General Meeting,
defined the key audit aspects in conjunction with the
auditor. This financial year, it was again agreed with the
auditor that the Chairman of the Audit and Compliance
Committee will be notified of any possible reasons for
exclusion or prejudice that emerge in the course of the
audit. It was also agreed that the Chairman of the committee will be notified immediately by the auditor of any
separate findings and any irregularities in the statement of
compliance.

≈≈ Efficiency audit of the
Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board regularly monitors the efficiency of
its activities. An efficiency audit is carried out every two
years. The last efficiency audit took place in 2015.

≈≈ Compensation report
The compensation report outlines the compensation
system and lists the individual compensation of the members of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board.

≈≈ The compensation system of
the Management Board

The compensation system for the Management Board of
DB AG aims to provide appropriate compensation to the
Management Board members in accordance with their duties
and areas of responsibility, while at the same time directly
taking into account the performance of each Management
Board member and the success of the company.
The appropriate level of compensation is reviewed regularly using a comparison process. This review examines
the level of Management Board compensation both in comparison to the external market (horizontal appropriateness)
and in comparison to other levels of compensation within
the company (vertical appropriateness). If the review shows
a need to adjust the compensation system or the level of
compensation, the Personnel Committee of the Supervisory
Board submits its proposals in this regard to the Su­pervisory Board for approval. In the year under review, a review
of the appropriateness of the compensation of the members of the Management Board was conducted.

Compensation components

The total compensation for Management Board members
consists of a fixed salary, a performance-linked annual
director’s fee and a long-term bonus program based on
multi-year figures (long-term incentive program). Total
compensation also includes benefit commitments, other
commitments and ancillary benefits.
The fixed salary is cash compensation linked to the
financial year. It is based on the scope of responsibility and
the experience of each Management Board member. The
individually defined fixed income is paid out in 12 equal
installments.

The annual performance-linked director’s fee is calculated
using a factor linked to the achievement of business targets
(director’s fee factor) and the achievement of individual
targets (performance factor). There is a multiplicative link
between the director’s fee factor and the performance
factor. The director’s fee factor depends on the level of
success in attaining the business targets set out by corporate planning. The parameters for this relationship are in
equal parts operational success (operating income after
interest) and return on capital employed (ROCE).
The performance factor reflects success in meeting personal targets. The target fee corresponds to the annual
director’s fee paid to the Management Board member in
a “normal financial year” for fully meeting performance
targets (meeting targets). If the Group results do not meet
planned objectives, the director’s fee factor can, in extreme
cases, be reduced to zero, regardless of personal performance. This means that the annual director’s fee can be
zero. If planned objectives are sufficiently exceeded and
the maximum performance factor is also achieved, the
annual director’s fee can amount to 2.6 times the target
director’s fee.
The business and personal targets of the Management
Board members are decided by the Supervisory Board
each year based on recommendations from the Personnel
Committee, and are then agreed in writing with the Management Board members.
Together with the corporate planning adopted by the
Supervisory Board, the personal targets form the basis for
assessing the annual director’s fee. This means that all of
the key parameters for total compensation are established
at the beginning of the financial year.
At the end of each financial year, the director’s fee and
the personal performance factor are calculated for each
Man­­­­agement Board member based on Group results. Tar­
get income is attained if both Group and individual targets
have been met in full. The final decision on this matter is
made by the Supervisory Board and is prepared by the Personnel Committee.
The long-term incentive element is determined based on
the sustained increase in enterprise value. This basis for
calculation rewards the attainment and/or exceeding of the
operating profit targets included in the medium-term planning and their effects on the enterprise value. After the end
of each planning period, the increase in value achieved in
comparison to the company’s original planning and the pay­
­ment factor are calculated. A peer-group comparison is then
used to adjust the payout ratio of the long-term incentive to
reflect the external performance of the company compared
with a peer group. The term of each plan is four years.

Deutsche Bahn Group – 2016 Integrated Report

The payment amount for the long-term incentive plan has
an upper limit and can vary between 0 and 300%. Claims
from the long-term incentive plan are inheritable.
The Management Board members are entitled to an ap­­
pro­priate severance package if their contract is terminated
before the contractually stipulated termination date provid­
­­­ed that the Management Board member was not personally
responsible for the termination through his or her actions.
The severance package is based on the remaining term of
the contract, the agreed target salary and, where applicable, the pension benefits already owed by DB AG for the
remainder of the contract.
In accordance with the recommendations of the PCGK,
a severance fee cap is included in all contracts of DB AG
Management Board members. This cap means that payments
made to a Management Board member due to premature
termination of Management Board duties cannot, without
good cause as defined by section 626 of the German Civil
Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch; BGB), exceed the value of
two years’ salary, including variable compensation components, and must not provide compensation for more than
the remaining term of the employment agreement.
Management Board members do not receive any additional compensation for mandates exercised in control bodies
of Group companies or affiliated companies.

New Group-wide compensation system
for executives from January 1 , 2017

In the year under review, the Management Board of DB AG
decided to reorient the compensation system for the
Group’s executives. The main focus is thereby on linking
the compensation even more closely to the sustainable success of the company in the sense of the business success
of the integrated rail system and the Group as well as the
alignment of all divisions toward this objective.
The annual director’s fee for executives and employees
not subject to wage agreements in the integrated rail
system are structured as profit-sharing. Personal goals are
then agreed with executives as part of a regular process.
The achievement of the goals is then regularly included in
the assessment when making decisions on increases to the
fixed salary.
If the executives are members of bodies of DB AG subsidiaries, the respective subsidiary’s Supervisory Board is
responsible for discussing the personal goals if possible
until the end of a financial year. As a rule, the respective
decision-making will take place after the DB AG Supervisory
Board meeting in which the medium-term planning and the
targets for the Group’s Management Board are adopted.

54

TO O U R S TA K E H O L D E R S

This chronological sequence of the handling of personal
goals in the Supervisory Boards of the subsidiaries is due
to the Group structure of DB AG.
In some cases, given the regulatory requirements, DB
Netz AG is subject to separate regulatory requirements
which take even greater account of the business success of
DB Netz AG.

Pension entitlements

The Supervisory Board of DB AG has set a general retirement age of 65 for Management Board members. After
leaving the company, Management Board members are
entitled to pension payments. At the latest upon reaching
the age of 65, a Management Board member is entitled to
a lifelong pension if the term of employment ends due to
permanent invalidity, or if the contract is terminated before
the agreed termination date or is not extended, where the
Board member was not responsible for the termination, or
if the Management Board member refuses to continue the
contract under the same or more beneficial conditions.
Company pension commitments are based on a percentage of base salary depending on the length of time
that the Management Board member has been with the
company. Pension commitments include lifelong retirement
and surviving dependent benefits. There is no lump-sum
payment option.
In addition to Management Board member contracts
entered into before January 1, 2009, a reinsurance policy
was concluded to cover company pension benefits.

Contractual ancillary benefits

The contractual ancillary benefits for members of the Management Board include a company car with driver for business and personal use, a personal BahnCard 100 First free
travel card and standard insurance coverage. A housing
allowance is provided for second homes where these are
required for business purposes. Where these non-cash benefits cannot be granted on a tax-free basis, they are taxed
as non-monetary benefits for which the Management Board
members are fully responsible. Management Board members, like any other member of the Group’s executive staff,
can choose to take part in the company’s deferred compensation program.

The members of the Management Board are covered by
liability insurance against financial losses incurred due to
DB AG’s business operations (D&O insurance). In the year
under review, this insurance was designed as a Group insurance policy with the deductible provided for under law; it
provides coverage for financial losses that may occur during
the performance of Management Board activities. The
insurance cover of the existing D&O insurance policy is
valid for a period of five years after termination of activities
as a member of the Management Board.

≈≈ Compensation of the Supervisory Board
for the 2016 financial year

Compensation of the Supervisory Board of DB AG was most
recently regulated by the Annual General Meeting resolution of September 21, 2010. In addition to being reimbursed
for their cash outlays and the value-added tax due on their
compensation and cash outlays, the Supervisory Board
members each receive a fixed annual compensation of
€ 20,000, plus performance-linked annual compensation.

Deutsche Bahn Group – 2016 Integrated Report

The performance-based compensation is calculated based
on the relationship between operating profit (EBIT) as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements for the
financial year compared to the previous year’s figures, and
the attaining of specific operational performance figures.
Performance-based compensation is limited to a maximum
of € 13,000. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board receives
twice this amount, while his deputy receives one and a half
times the above figure. This compensation is increased by
a quarter for every position held on a committee by the
individual Supervisory Board member. This compensation
increases by 100% for the Chairman of the Executive Commit­
­­­­­­­­­­­­tee and the Chairman of the Audit and Compliance Committee, and by 50% for the Chairman of the Personnel Committee. This does not include membership or chairmanship
of the committee that is formed under the terms of Section
27 (3) of the MitbestG.
In addition, the members of the Supervisory Board of
DB AG receive an attendance fee of € 250 for each meeting
of the Supervisory Board and its committees at which they
are present. The members of the Supervisory Board also
have the choice between a personal BahnCard 100 First and
five free train tickets.
The members of the Supervisory Board are covered by
liability insurance against financial losses incurred due to
DB AG’s business operations (D&O insurance). This insurance is designed as a Group insurance policy with no de­
ductible and provides coverage for financial losses that
may occur during the performance of Supervisory Board
activities. There is also a Group accident insurance policy
in place for members of the Supervisory Board. The relevant company pays the premiums for these policies.
Supervisory Board members who have only been members for part of the financial year in question receive a twelfth
of the total compensation for each month or part of a
month of their membership. This rule also applies to the
increase in compensation for the Chairman of the Super­
visory Board and his or her deputy and to the increase in
compensation for membership and chairmanship of a
Supervisory Board committee.
Compensation is paid after the conclusion of the Annual
General Meeting that votes to ratify the Supervisory Board’s
activities in the previous financial year.
Taxes due on compensation received, including the
personal BahnCard 100 First and the five free train tickets,
are the individual responsibility of each Supervisory Board
member.
Supervisory Board members currently hold no shares in
the company, nor do they hold options entitling them to
purchase shares in the company.

≈≈ Our commitment to the UN
Sustainable Development Goals
On September 25, 2015, the 17 Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) were adopted. The SDGS Œ [ DB.DE/LINK S _ IR 16 ]
build on the United Nations Millennium Development
Goals and replace them. The 17 SDGs cover environmental,
social and economic objectives of sustainable development. With the SDGs, the United Nations has agreed on a
World Future Treaty that defines a common AGENDA 2030
Œ [ DB.DE/LINK S _ IRI16 ] .
DB Group is expressly committed to the ten principles
of the United Nations Global Compact. For this reason, we
feel particularly committed to the objectives of the Agenda
2030 and the SDGs. Achieving the ambitious objectives of
the Agenda 2030 will require the commitment and cooperation of all stakeholders: economy, politics, science and
civil society. For this reason, we also intend to intensify our
dialog with stakeholders on the SDGs and DB Group’s contribution. The Federal Government’s national sustainability
strategy, which was adopted on the basis of the SDGs in
early 2017, is also an important basis.
UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS

Deutsche Bahn
supports the SDG s

As an international provider of mobility and logistics services with more than 300,000 employees worldwide, DB
Group contributes to the SDGs in a variety of ways. Our
focus is on six SDGs where, we believe, we will be able to
make the greatest impact:
◊◊
As one of the largest employers in Germany, we
assume responsibility for the HEALTH [ PAGE 1 25 ]
of our employees. We offer comprehensive
social services to promote health promotion programs
and use proven systems to protect our employees in the
workplace. In our offerings we invest in the improvement of safety and environmental performance, in particular in the areas of NOISE PROTECTION [ PAGE 1 29 FF.] and
AIR QUALITY CONTROL [ PAGE 276 ] .
◊◊
As a world-leading mobility and logistics service provider, DB Group connects people and
markets. The leading role we play in many
markets contributes to economic productivity and
ensures employee-oriented EMPLOYMENT CONDITION S
[ PAGE 1 2 4 F. ] and qualification. We offer our customers
first-class solutions and set standards in climate, environmental and resource protection.
◊◊
We invest in the modernization of our facilities, stations and tracks. The aim of our pro[ PAGE 85 F.] is
gram R AILWAY OF THE FUTURE
to significantly improve the quality of rail offerings
overall. To be a driver for DIGITALIZATION [ PAGE 102 ] and
innovation, we are working on customer-friendly so­­
lutions as part of our 4.0 initiatives in the areas of​​
mobility, logistics and infrastructure. The objective of
our initiative Working Environments 4.0 and the establishment of innovation labs and accelerators is to anchor
innovation even more firmly in the organization.
◊◊
We offer our customers nationwide access
to high-performance and environmentally
friendly public transport in many European
cities. We want to take specific advantage of the opportunities offered by digitalization Δ to develop sustainable solutions for our customers. In the future, we will

57

work even more intensively to develop innovative
mobility and logistics solutions to manage the new challenges of urban spaces. We intend to take integrated
approaches to make cities more sustainable and more
livable by developing concepts that can be used to
make delivery transport more efficient; we want to
expand stations and make them even more of a hub for
increasing traffic and bring more door-to-door offerings
to the market.
◊◊
Our DB2020+ STR ATEGY [ PAGE 82 FF.] formulates
our commitment to the responsible and sustainable management of the impact of our
business operations on society and the environment. In
addition to improving our offerings for customers, we are
also focused on improving our SUPPLY CHAIN [ PAGE 65 F.] .
Our CODE OF CONDUCT FOR BUSINESS PARTNER S [ PAGE 1 79 ]
clearly and bindingly defines our expectations for cooperation with our partners. Together with our suppliers,
we want to ensure that compliance with environmental and social standards is anchored in the supply chain.

CLIMATE PROTECTION [ PAGE 1 27 FF.] is anchored in
our DB2020+ strategy as a key area of action.
Measures such as efficient vehicles, energysaving driving, increase in capacity utilization and the
purchase of renewable energies for green offers reduce
our specific CO ₂ emissions and increase the share of
eco-power in the traction current mix. We therefore
make an important contribution to the climate protection targets of the Federal Government and to in­­creas­­
­ing rail transport. At the same time, we are continually
im­­­proving our own environmental performance.

continuous progress with regard to all these topics and
have introduced specific areas of action for all of them.
In the 2016 Integrated Report, we have clustered the
top topics from the materiality analysis and the DB2020+
top targets that are not explicitly covered by the results
of the materiality analysis into nine material sustainability
topics (DB 01 to DB 09). The impact of the topics both with­

≈≈ Management approaches
to our material topics

The GR I GUIDELINE S Œ [ D B.D E /LINK S _ IR 16 ] foresee that for
material economic, environmental and social aspects so-­
called management approaches should be displayed. These
give us the opportunity to explain how the MATERIAL SUSTAINABILITY TOPICS [ PAGE 58 ] are handled in DB Group.

Product quality

There are a number of levers to improve product quality
Β , with the improvement of punctuality being the most
important starting point. Other important levers include
the use of modern vehicles, reliable and comprehensive
customer and transport information, the quality and reliability of services offered, as well as reasonable travel and
transport times. For this reason, we continuously invest in
our fleet and infrastructure, optimize cooperation with our
suppliers and our industry partners, and pursue numerous
activities to improve these areas. As part of these efforts,
we take the greatest possible advantage of the opportunities presented by digitalization. Most of the initiatives to
increase product quality and improve customer satisfaction
are bundled in R AILWAY OF THE FUTURE
. The Railway
of the Future team works on the issues across business
units under the direct leadership of the Group Management
Board.
We place customers at the center of our actions. Cus‡
G4-DMA PR to­­­­mer satisfaction is therefore the most important indicator. This provides a measure of our success from the
point of view of our customers. We gain insights from this
indicator, which we use to create specific improvement
measures. In addition to the various aspects of product
quality, continuous optimization of the price-performance
ratio (PPR) and product innovations, especially in the context of digitalization, are the main levers for increasing
customer satisfaction.
In order to increase customer satisfaction, we work
in­tensively on the high-quality delivery of our basic service.
We focus on the optimization of product and service quality Β and offer customers comprehensive and transparent
services to meet their information needs. Our goal is to
provide our mobility and logistics solutions at a reasonable
price-performance ratio in order to meet the expectations
of our customers. The focus is on measures that increase
both the quality of our services and the efficiency of our
processes. We use both direct indicators, such as revenues
and number of customers, and the results of regular surveys in order to assess the success of the measures taken
from the customer’s point of view. These surveys are carried out in each business unit and, as the cooperation with
the PASSENGER ADVISORY BOARD [ PAGE 6 4 ] , they serve to iden-

tify further areas where customers believe there is potential for improvement. The success of the business units and
DB Group is measured on the basis of targets achieved on
the development path of customer satisfaction as defined
strategy.
by the DB2020+
Key indicators for CUSTOMER SATISFACTION [ PAGE 101 ] are
customer satisfaction passenger and customer satisfaction
freight transport and logistics.
Punctuality Α is a central component of our value
proposition. During the year under review, work began
on building a new set of key figures based on “lost units”
(number of delayed trains) in order to manage punctuality.
It will be fully implemented in 2017. The figures are recorded
daily and made available online to the executives and em­­
ployees involved in punctuality management in the newly
developed quality cockpit. In addition, punctuality data,
together with the associated indicators, are prepared regularly and used by the Group Management Board to determine what currently needs to be acted upon and where
decisions are required.
PUNCTUALITY [ PAGE 101 F.] is the key indicator of product
quality at Group level within the DB2020+ strategy and is
a determining factor in calculating the amount of the variable compensation of DB Group’s executives.
Customer demand for comprehensive, understandable
and current (real-time) information plays a very important
role. For this reason, we are continually improving passen­­ger
information for our customers in passenger transport as well
as the transport information for our logistics customers.
A further component of the product quality is a high­­
performance infrastructure Ε . Capital expenditures for
maintaining and expanding a high-performance infrastructure are therefore crucial. With the PERFOR MANCE AND
FINANCING AGREEMENT (LEISTUNGS - UND FINANZIERUNGSVER­­­
EINBARUNG; LUFV) II [ PAGE 2 49 ] , the Federal Government and
DB Group have launched an extensive modernization program and agreed on a set of quality parameters for the
condition of the infrastructure, compliance with which is
monitored continuously. The results of the monitoring are
published in the annual Infrastructure Status and Development Report (Infrastrukturzustands- und -entwicklungsbericht; IZB) and reviewed by the Federal Railway Authority
(Eisenbahn-Bundesamt; EBA). In addition to maintaining
the existing infrastructure, capacity increases and the digitalization Δ of infrastructure are also very important for
the high performance of the infrastructure and for infrastructure users. Together with the Federal Government, we
are working on comprehensive new projects and expansion
projects and technical upgrades.

Interlinked mobility is the combination of different means
of transport in order to individualize the design of the
mobility and transport chain; this is made possible by the
digital information service for travel and transport planning.
For us, interconnected mobility is crucial in order to
offer our customers individualized and tailored solutions.
In this area, digitalization Δ offers new opportunities to
provide innovative services. One example of this is the
mobility platform QIX XIT Œ [ DB.DE/LINK S _ IR 16 ] , which allows
travel planning across different means of transport. We
also want to further develop existing combined offerings. For example, in the passenger transport area, we are
working on a comprehensive door-to-door mobility offer
with our products Flinkster and Call a Bike, while in the
logistics area we are optimizing our intermodal transport
offer on rail, road, water and in the air.
There are no indicators for interlinked mobility.

models. By 2019, € 100 million of venture capital will be
available for this purpose. The DIGITALIZ ATION STR ATEGY
[ PAGE 86 ] currently being developed ensures that all centralized and decentralized digitalization activities are aligned
with the strategic goals of DB Group.
Our new offers at the customer interface are intended
to make access to mobility and logistics as easy and convenient as possible in order to win more and more customers
for our interesting supplementary products. The current
focus of the process improvements is on automated railway
operations and forward-looking maintenance. By the end of
2018, we plan to invest about € 1 billion in digitalization
projects.
There are no indicators for digitalization.

Digitalization and innovation

Profitability is an essential condition for the financing of
capital expenditures in the core business, the further
development of the businesses and the exploitation of
future growth opportunities for DB Group. ENTREPRE­­NEU­R IAL LEADER SHIP [ PAGE 1 1 1 FF.] is indispensable for im­­
proving profitability.
As the overarching goal of VALUE MANAGEMENT [ PAGE 111 F.] ,
profitability ensures that an appropriate return can be
generated across economic cycles. To this end, we annually
determine the COSTS OF CAPITAL ​​[ PAGE 1 1 2 F.] on the basis of
fair value as a weighted average of risk-appropriate market
returns for equity and debt capital. We measure the actual
return, RETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED (ROCE) [ PAGE 1 1 2 F.] , as
the ratio of the operating result before interest and taxes
(adjusted EBIT) to the operating capital employed. The
ROCE target value is set above the costs of capital. The
long-term objective is to achieve a ROCE whose multi-year
average is above the target value, ensuring that costs of
capital are covered. This ROCE target value corresponds to
the minimum required rate of return (MRR) for investment
decisions.
Financial stability is an essential component for sustainable economic activity. For DB Group as an investmentintensive company, it is essential that we have access to the
capital market at all times under favorable conditions. A
major objective is therefore to achieve adequate key debt
ratios. Our key indicator for managing indebtedness is the
REDEMPTION COVER AGE [ PAGE 1 1 4 ] .

Our markets are facing an epochal transformation, as customer needs change radically and new business models
arise. But we view these changes, above all, as great opportunities. The increasing progress in the digitalization Δ of
offers, processes and businesses shows that DB Group is
well positioned to be a driving force in shaping the digital
future of mobility, logistics and rail infrastructure.
The coming digital transformation Γ means that we
will have to further develop and adapt the core business.
At the same time, the focus is on the development of new
and possibly disruptive business models by making the best
use of our existing assets.
The necessary strategic orientation and the associated
central and decentralized adjustments to our business will
be coordinated by the Competence Center for Digitalization under the leadership of the future Chief Digital Offi­
­cer (CDO) and with the participation of the Chief Executive
Officer (CEO). In this area, we have been regularly discuss­
­ing changes associated with new digital technologies since
2015. In order to promote faster and more successful innovations in the digital environment and to generate new
enterprise value, we are constantly developing our ecosys­tem for digital transformation. To this end, we create or
re­­organize the necessary internal structures and forge relationships with external partners. This new ecosystem also
consciously includes the development of new data-driven
business models – including areas beyond the railway and
DB Group’s traditional performance portfolio, but always
within that context. With the founding of Deutsche Bahn

Employee satisfaction

Contented employees mean satisfied customers and thus
sustainable business success. For this reason, we work constantly on the further development of our corporate culture. In addition to key values ​​such as approaching the
business as partners, consistent involvement, solid cooperation and exemplary leadership, the company also focuses
on having employees assume responsibility and on cooperation across business units. The objective is to improve
the performance of DB Group. In the fall of 2016, the third
Group-wide employee survey was conducted, which gave a
comprehensive picture of employee satisfaction and the
opportunity to use the information gathered to develop
specific measures for improvements and changes.
Our indicator for EMPLOYEE SATISFAC TION [ PAGE 1 2 3 ] is
calculated on the basis of the EMPLOYEE SURVEY [ PAGE 1 23 ] .
The employee satisfaction index is created every two years.
If no survey has been carried out, the performance indicator “follow-up workshop implementation rate” is used.

Employer attractiveness

We work intensively on increasing our attractiveness as an
employer. A visible and persuasive presence in the labor
market is decisive for success in the competition for specialists and executives. The close linkage of all the key
elements of talent acquisition in our holistic talent acqui­
sition approach forms the basis for a strong competitive
position in an increasingly difficult market for employers.
This approach includes: our employer branding campaign,
effective employer branding, professional and modern
recruiting, innovative social media activities and a candidate experience oriented toward the target group. But in
order to be attractive, and to remain attractive, as an em­­
ployer, even more is needed: so we offer our employees
meaningful tasks and activities, attractive employment
conditions and a corporate culture in which their efforts are
appreciated.
Our indicator for EMPLOYER AT TR ACTIVENESS [ PAGE 1 21 F.]
is calculated based on the employer rankings of trendence,
the European market leader for employer image studies.

Climate protection

We support the international goal of limiting global warm­­
­ing to less than two degrees compared to pre-industrial
times. To make our contribution to achieving this goal, we
work mainly to use as little energy as possible and to use it
efficiently. We reached our original climate protection target ahead of schedule. For this reason, in the year under
review we increased our target for the reduction of specific
CO₂ emissions (that is, those related to volume sold) from
20% to 30% from 2006 to 2020. We have also made the
climate protection target more challenging by using CO₂
equivalents (CO₂e). We are no longer only using pure CO₂
emissions in the target position but also other gases with
a strong impact on the climate, such as methane and ni­­
trous oxide, also known as laughing gas.
In order to strengthen our position as an ECO -PIONEER ¥
and to further reduce CO₂ emissions in rail transport, we
will further increase the SHARE OF RENEWABLE ENERGIES IN
THE DB TR ACTION CURRENT MIX [ PAGE 1 28 F.] . In the year under
review, we raised the target from 35% to 45% by the year
2020. In the future, the target will be related to our own rail
transport. In the year under review, we present the develop­
ment, including electricity supply to third-party train operating companies. The changeover will take place from the
2017 financial year onwards.
We are increasing energy efficiency in operations and
production and we continually update our vehicle fleet. We
want to further increase the environmental benefits of rail
transport and, in addition, create incentives to bring more
traffic to the rails.
Our indicators in climate protection are REDUC TION

Noise reduction

In order to noticeably relieve residents near railway tracks,
we plan to halve our rail transport noise by 2020, compared
to 2000. The goal is based on two pillars: noise remediation of existing railway tracks and the refitting of the exist­
­­ing fleet to quiet brake shoes and the procurement of quiet
new cars.

Safety

Safety is an important commodity and a basic requirement
of our customers and employees. Safety means reliability,
certainty and protection against dangers.
We have a great deal of responsibility for many people
and goods – around the clock.
The safety units of DB Group cooperate closely with the
security authorities. In the railway joint security center,
Group security exchanges status information with the Federal police around the clock.
In total, more than 5,000 federal police officers and
about 3,700 security staff from DB Security are deployed. In
order to further increase safety, in the year under review,
DB Security began to increase its staff by a total of 500 employees. In the future, all employees with customer contact
will be required to receive de-escalation and behavioral
training.

High performance

The transformation initiative Γ builds on the success of
R AILWAY OF THE FUTURE
and makes further changes
possible on the way to becoming a PROFITABLE QUALIT Y
LEADER ¿ . As part of this initiative, we are working hard to
create a new target culture whose impact can be seen in
the areas of customer focus, cooperation, leadership skills,
responsibility and high performance.
We will redesign performance management at the level
of business units, projects and individuals and align it with
the company’s performance.
We will increase the level and breadth of experience of
the management in the organization by changing the rotation and career rules and will continue to enhance the attractiveness of DB Group as an employer among our executives.
In addition, we will be changing the structure of meetings
to make them significantly more output-oriented and more
satisfying for participants than in the past. At the same
time, we will make the five target culture dimensions in the
training formats of DB Training and DB Academy clearer
and more tangible.
In order to ensure that R AILWAY OF THE FUTURE
becomes a permanent process of change, we have integrated measures developed within the framework of R AIL­­
­WAY OF THE FUTURE
into the procedures of the BUSINESS UNITS [ PAGE 1 32 FF.] and increased the decentralization of
responsibility. At the same time, we will continue to intensively pursue exchange across systems within DB Group and
with the entire industry. With their ambitious goals, the
internal Competence Centers are the expression of responsibility, high performance and cooperation.

Transformation Γ is supported by a Group-wide change
agenda. This involves the careful coordination of dialog,
multiple and workshop concepts in DB Group and in the
business units. Using this approach, messages regarding
R AILWAY OF THE FUTURE
at the Group level and in the
business units will not be contradictory, and employees and
executives will be motivated to achieve the objectives of
R AILWAY OF THE FUTURE
and DB2020+ .

≈≈ Sustainability organization
The Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) has overall responsibility for the issue of sustainability. The Chief Executive
Offi­­­­­­­­cer holds this office. The Sustainability Competence
Center, in which all relevant departments and central business units are represented, manages and discusses issues
and projects related to sustainability across departments
and business units. Among other things, the body sets targets for the sustainable orientation of DB Group, carries
out Group-wide projects on central sustainability topics
(for example, SUPPLIER S AS INNOVATION DRIVER S [ PAGE 65 F.]),
coordinates stakeholder dialog and advises the Group companies on the fulfillment of sustainability tasks. The responsibility for the content remains with the departments and
the business units. In the year under review, the committee
met four times. The sustainability management and future
research department, which is incorporated into the cor​​
porate strategy division, is responsible for and coordinates
overarching sustainability topics, such as sustainability ratings and active participation in sustainability networks.

≈≈ Sustainability ratings

Outside perspectives give us an important indication of
where we stand and where we can improve. Our aim is to
have top positions in key ratings and rankings.
In the year under review, DB Group was rated “A–” by
the international rating organization CDP Œ [ DB.DE/LINK S _ IR 16 ]
in its climate scoring for 2016 and was awarded “Sector
Leader Transportation” in the DACH region. This makes us
one of the two best listed companies in the industry. DB
Group’s above-average performance in combating climate
change and efforts to improve data integrity were honored.
In the year under review, ECOVADIS Œ [ DB.DE/LINK S _ IR 16 ] raised
its evaluation of DB Group once again compared with 2014,
and has awarded the entire DB Group gold status. EcoVadis
prepares supplier scores for third parties in the area of

​​sustainability. The topics of environmental and working
conditions again received positive assessments. A significant improvement was achieved in the area of sustainable
​​
purchasing.
In its corporate rating for 2016, the rating agency OEKOM
RE SE ARCH Œ [ DB.DE /LINK S _ IR 16 ] awarded DB Group a good
grade of “B–” on the basis of over 100 selected, sector-specific social and environmental criteria. We shared first place
in the transport and logistics/rail sector with two other
companies. This is reflected in the “Prime” status, which is
awarded to companies that are leaders in their industries.

≈≈ Guidelines for stakeholder dialog

The acceptance of stakeholders is an essential prerequisite
for DB Group’s sustainable success. For this reason, we
are committed to holding dialogs with stakeholders as
partners and working with all stakeholder groups in an
atmosphere of mutual trust, based on integrity, continuity
and transparency.
The basis for all dialog activities is our STAKEHOLDER
CHAR­­­­­­­­T ER Œ [ DB.DE/LINK S _ IR 16 ] , which contains principles that
apply across DB Group for responsible interaction between
us and our stakeholders. This serves as the basis for an
open discussion of our stakeholders’ expectations and for
fostering cooperation, so that we can learn from each
other and develop viable solutions.
Important stakeholders of DB Group are employees,
private and business customers, investors, policymakers
and regulators, suppliers, media as well as associations and
the specialist public.
Œ DB.DE/LINK S _ IR 16

Regular dialog with policymakers
and the public

Being one of the largest mobility and logistics service providers makes DB Group the focus of more public and political attention in Germany than virtually any other company.
This makes us a sought-after dialog partner, especially in
public discussions. DB Group establishes its own transport
policy positions at the national and international level in
the dialog with political and administrative institutions as
well as parties, associations and relevant scientific areas.
DB Group seeks to use logical arguments to contribute to
a constructive debate process. The principles of the stakeholder charter also apply to the dialog with policymakers.

TO O U R S TA K E H O L D E R S

In addition, DB Group has set strict internal standards for
participation in political processes, which are summarized
as “Group Principles Ethics Code of Conduct” and which are
binding Group-wide.

Passenger Advisory Board makes
a valuable contribution

Since its founding, the Passenger Advisory Board has made
major contributions from its 25 meetings, numerous workshops and surveys, and it has also successfully initiated
measures. The Passenger Advisory Board convenes for regular meetings twice a year, and it provides support and
advice on numerous projects related to customers. In the
year under review, the main focus of the joint work was
vehicle topics in long-distance rail passenger transport and
the further development of the DB Information in stations.
In June 2016, the inaugural meeting of the fifth term of
office of the Passenger Advisory Board took place; 2,500
customers had applied for the ten vacant seats.

≈≈ Memberships

Deutsche Bahn AG (DB AG) is a member of numerous business, industry and other associations directly or through
one of its subsidiaries. The objectives of these memberships include information, exchange and networking as well
as cooperating in the representation of interests.
DB AG is an active member of ECONSENSE Œ [ DB.DE/LINK S _
IR 16 ] , the Forum for Sustainable Development of German
Business. Together with some 30 German companies and
organizations with global operations, we are committed to
developing solutions for sustainable economic activity, initiating political decision-making processes and thus driving
innovation and strategies for future-oriented issues. Since
2015, we have also been active on the econsense Management Board.
The commitment to the entrepreneurial principles of
the United Nations Global Compact is underscored by the
annual presentation of our progress along the ten principles of the Global Compact (Communication on Progress).
As in the previous year, our Communication on Progress
2015 was rated “Advanced Level” by the UN Global Compact. In addition, we are committed to the German Global
Compact Network (Deutsches Global Compact Netzwerk;
DGCN), the forum for German companies to implement and
promote the principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC). A representative of DB Group is a member of
the steering committee of the German Global Compact

≈≈ Main activities in 2016

DB holds fifth Sustainability Day
On November 10, 2016, about 200 representatives of all
stakeholder groups took part in the fifth DB Sustainability
Day in Berlin. For a full day, they discussed topics related
[ PAGE 85 F.] and
to the program R AILWAY OF THE FUTURE
made a mid-term assessment of the DB2020+
strategy
[ PAGE 82 FF.] . Obi Felten, Director of X Foundry, was a prominent guest and ambassador for the forum. The DB Sustainability Day has enjoyed five years of success because it provides a forum for different stakeholders to discuss their
concerns, criticisms and notes directly with DB Group top
management and where further steps are jointly agreed
upon. Since the fourth DB Sustainability Day, many joint
activities have been moved forward, for example, as part of
the infrastructure dialog, the Working Environments 4.0
initiative and through innovation workshops with suppliers.

Dialog with associations
celebrates anniversary

The exchange with environmental and passenger associations is very important to us. The 20th annual Passenger,
Environment and Transport Workshop took place in Berlin.
About 100 guests attended in this anniversary year. In
keeping with the workshop’s motto “Yesterday – today –
tomorrow,” participants discussed DB Group’s path to
becoming a comprehensive ECO -PIONEER ¥ as well as the
current challenges of environmentally friendly transport.
Another focus was the results of the Climate Conference
COP21 and their importance for the transport sector as well
as a discussion on the cooperative organization DESTINATION NATURE Œ [ DB.DE/LINK S _ IR 16 ] . Destination Nature is supported by the three major German environmental organizations Friends of the Earth Germany (BUND), the Nature
and Biodiversity Conservation Union (NABU) and the environmental Transport Club Germany (VCD) and DB Group.
It also celebrated an anniversary in 2016 – its 15th.

Cooperation with suppliers

Suppliers are important partners for DB Group when it
comes to innovative approaches for our own supply chain.
In collaboration with our suppliers, we strive to continuously improve our procurement strategy. At this year’s
InnoTrans fair, the DB supplier award was granted for the
seventh time. The award honors companies that, in keeping
with our DB2020+ strategy, help us provide the best possible performance for our customers. Since innovation plays
an increasingly important role in the competitive environment, a Supplier Innovation Award was presented for the
first time in the year under review. This award recognizes
innovations that have a positive impact on the services
offered by DB Group and that are especially innovative or
provide added value, that can be easily implemented or are
very sustainable. Siemens AG, Mobility Division, won this
prize for the product ICE 4 [ PAGE 3 4 F.] .
Since 2015, we have also held innovation workshops. For
example, during the year under review, we met with suppliers of recycled gravel. Together, solutions were discussed
on how we can make the material cycle of our recycled
gravel more efficient. We are now working to incorporate
the ideas collected in our tenders. Moreover, further innovation workshops are already being planned.

As a signatory of the German Sustainability Code (Deut­scher
Nachhaltigkeitskodex; DNK), we also provide a clear
signal in Germany for the transparent presentation of our
sus­tainability performance. In the year under review, we
renewed our DECLAR ATION OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE DNK
Œ [ DB.DE/LINK S _ IR 16 ] .
As part of the fight against corruption, DB Group is a
corporate member of Transparency International. Our anti-­
­corruption efforts involve the regular exchange of ex­­­pe­­
rience regarding systems and procedures for the fight
against corruption.
DB Group is a founding member of the industry initiative R AILSPONSIBLE Œ [ DB.DE/LINK S _ IR 16 ] . This initiative aims
to create transparency regarding social, environmental and
socioeconomic effects along the entire supply chain and to
support suppliers in improving their sustainability practices. Using common tools makes evaluating sustainability
performance more efficient for all parties. Since the initiative began, there has been a positive trend in sustainability
performance and in membership.

≈≈ Continuation of responsibility
and social commitments
DB Group has been even more effective in fulfilling its social

responsibility since the Deutsche Bahn Stiftung gGmbH
(Deutsche Bahn Foundation) was established in 2013. Under
the patronage of Christina Rau, the foundation has con­
solidated the charitable projects and the DB Museum and
continues to develop them in accordance with its mission
statement: Ensuring a connection. Creating links. Setting the
course. The DEUTSCHE BAHN FOUNDATION Œ [ DB.DE/LINK S _ IR 16 ]
wants to help shape a society in which people take responsibility for themselves and others. To achieve this objective,
the foundation cooperates with partners in the areas of education, social integration and humanitarian aid.

≈≈ Responsibility for people on
the margins of society

The Deutsche Bahn Foundation campaigns for people in emergencies and
supports projects that help
bring these people back
into mainstream society.
For example, it supports

under review, the Deutsche
Bahn Foundation also provided social workers nine annual season tickets for the
German rail network, allowing them to provide support to
homeless children all over Germany.

The Deutsche Bahn Foundation supports several projects
near railway stations, such as the “mobile case workers” in
the railway station mission (Bahnhofsmission) in Berlin’s
Zoologischer Garten station and the clinic near Berlin’s central station, where people without health insurance can
receive free medical treatment all year round.
In the year under review, the Deutsche Bahn Foundation
also expanded its support for railway station missions
nationwide. Together with the conference for church
railway station missions, since April 2016 one of our focal
points has been on promoting specific projects in the total
of 104 railway station missions. One result of this was the
training of people with refugee backgrounds as volunteers
in the railway station mission in Würzburg. In the railway
station mission in Düsseldorf, new volunteers are being
trained to familiarize people, especially the elderly, with the
area around the station. Cooperation partners from the
neighborhood are involved in this program and participants
explore the area together.

≈≈ Awareness efforts and research
on depression as an illness

In the railway station mission in Berlin’s central station, the
Deutsche Bahn Foundation has established an aid network
called “Mutmacher am Bahnhof” (“courage providers at
the station”) to help people experiencing psychosocial
emergencies. Two specially trained “courage providers” are
accompanied by a senior physician from the Department of
Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at Berlin’s Charité Hospital.
The courage providers offer structured interviews, provide
unbureaucratic assistance and help people in need navigate
Berlin’s social and psychiatric assistance system.
The Deutsche Bahn Foundation also continued to support the fight against depression in the year under review.
Together with the Foundation German Depression Aid (Stiftung Deutsche Depressionshilfe; SDD), the Depression Re­
search Center in Leipzig was further expanded; the cen­ter
carries out clinical research and develops new approaches
to therapy. The expansion of the information hotline and
strengthening of regional alliances against depression has
improved the service provided to those suffering from
depression. More than 3,000 callers have received professional advice via the free Infotelefon. On the occasion of
the World Day of Mental Health on October 10, 2016, with
funds from the Deutsche Bahn Foundation, the Foundation
German Depression Aid presented iFightDepression, a free,
multilingual, and physician-assisted self-management program for patients with mild forms of depression.

The Deutsche Bahn Foundation has shown its commitment to the integration of refugees in Germany with its
project “I speak German.” Volunteers work with refugees
to help them gain a basic knowledge of German. More than
650 DB employees volunteered as part of this initiative. A
total of about 7,000 teacher and student books were distributed to nearly 300 locations across Germany.

≈≈ DB Museum – railway history,
a lively telling

Under its umbrella, the Deutsche Bahn Foundation runs
DB MUSEUM Œ [ DB.DE/LINK S _ IR 16 ] with locations in Nuremberg,
Koblenz and Halle (Saale). In 2017, the DB Museum will
celebrate its 135th anniversary. It preserves the oldest
railway history collection in the world and makes the different eras of rail transport permanently available. In
remembrance of the first German rail connection between
Nuremberg and Fürth, the Royal Bavarian Railway Museum

TO O U R S TA K E H O L D E R S

opened at Nuremberg central station in 1899. Today’s permanent exhibition shows how railway as a means of transport in the 19th century changed people’s daily lives and
the economic development of Germany and Europe. The
topic “German railways under National Socialism” has a
permanent place in this exhibition, as does the history of
the Deutsche Reichsbahn which was founded in the Weimar Republic. The history of the East German railway is
also represented and is presented in parallel to the West
German railway. At the museum locations in Koblenz and
Halle (Saale), railway history also comes alive through such
events as regular public journeys with historic trains. Many
volunteers work in their local areas to maintain railway
vehicles and offer tours and school events. In the year
under review, the DB Museum set a new record, attracting
more than 235,000 visitors from around the world.
In addition, the Deutsche Bahn Foundation has a special
responsibility to preserve railway heritage. In the year
under review, it took over the extensive and unique archives
on railway history from the estate of the renowned railway historian and internationally respected Holocaust
researcher Dr. Alfred Gottwaldt. The aim is to open up and
preserve the collections and research work for posterity.
The bequest includes rare photographs, railway documents, brochures, exhibits on railroad history, as well
as documentation on biographical research. In the future,
plans call for the bequest to be used for exhibitions and
research and it will complement the holdings of the DB
Museum in Nuremberg. By making a critical assessment
of German railway history, the Deutsche Bahn Foundation helps to keep its memory alive.

≈≈ Changes in DB Group

The reorganization of the DB holding structure that was
initiated in July 2015 was completed when the merger of
DB Mobility Logistics AG (DB ML AG) into Deutsche Bahn AG
(DB AG) became effective on August 26, 2016. The business
units, service units and Group functions that had previously
been handled at DB ML AG will now be managed directly by
DB AG . The decision was taken by the Supervisory Board
on May 4, 2016 to dissolve the two-level holding structure.
This measure, which took retroactive effect economically
from January 1, 2016, will simplify decision-making processes, reduce the complexity of corporate management
and cut costs.
DB Dienstleistungen GmbH was merged into DB ML AG
on June 1, 2016, with retroactive effect economically from
January 1, 2016, and the DB Services business unit was dissolved. The operating service providers that had until now
been combined in this business unit are now managed
directly as service units in the Board divisions. The discontinuation of the DB Services business unit simplifies the
structure, reduces costs and is intended to ensure closer
alignment with the needs of internal and external customers.
In addition, the functions of corporate management
were reorganized with effect from April 1, 2016. The administrative service functions performed in corporate management were separated from the controlling Group functions
and combined in the Board divisions as business services.

Within Deutsche Bahn Group (DB Group), because of strong
operational interconnections and dependencies, there are
service and financial relationships between the holding
companies and the individual business units, as well as
between business units.
These can be organized into four groups:
◊ ◊ Operational business relationships between two companies, which may arise through the use of infrastructure, such as when DB Regio AG uses the rail network of
DB Netz AG, for which it pays train-path usage fees.
◊ ◊ Business relationships with the corporate management:
the management holding DB AG is responsible for providing services for the operating companies such as
central purchasing, which organizes and controls the
procurement process for trains, for example.
◊ ◊ DB Group financing: the management holding company
performs and consolidates the financing function in DB
Group. In this context, DB AG obtains funds on the capital market through its subsidiary DEUTSCHE BAHN FINANCE
(DB FINANCE) [ PAGE 110 ] and transfers these funds as loans
to the Group companies.
◊ ◊ Domination and profit and loss transfer agreements: in
Germany, domination and profit and loss transfer agreements are used for the formation of a fiscal unit that
allows companies to offset tax losses against profits. In
DB Group, the company ultimately subject to tax in Germany is DB AG. This also reduces administration costs,
as only DB AG is required to complete tax returns in
Germany, meaning that the tax authorities have only
one point of contact and can conduct comprehensive
audits.
The arm’s length principle serves as the fundamental characteristic of the development of business relationships.
This means that the compensation is always based on
market prices. In DB Group, this applies to operational business relationships, service units and Group financing. For
example, intra-Group customers pay exactly the same fees
for utilization of train-paths as non-Group customers. The

73

G ROUP MANAG EMENT REPORT

≈≈ Service and financial relationships

G R O U P M A N AG E M E N T R E P O RT

prices for intra-Group purchased services are reviewed regularly on the basis of market analyses to ensure that prices
are in line with the market. The terms of financing trans­
actions are based on prevailing market conditions in the
financial and capital market.
The operational business relationships in DB Group in
which DB Arriva and DB Schenker are involved are of secondary importance.
GROUP FUNCTIONS [ PAGE 75 ] perform controlling and monitoring functions. These services are generally not charged.
In contrast, the services of the SERVICE UNITS [ PAGE 75 ] are
generally charged to the internal recipients of the service,
in relation to the service provided.
The reasons and motivation for aligning the costs of
business relationships in DB Group with market conditions
are as follows:
◊ ◊ A value-based corporate management approach can
only be achieved if it is embedded at all levels in DB
Group. This, in turn, can only be achieved through business relationships at fair market conditions. Success and
failure must be transparent in order to facilitate economic control.

The infrastructure companies are legally required to
provide their services without discrimination. The Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur; BNetz A)
assesses whether prices are in line with the market.
Prices are transparent for everyone.
◊ ◊ Alignment of business relationships with market conditions is also both necessary and required for tax reasons
or from the perspective of minority shareholders.
The effects of domination and profit and loss transfer
agreements within DB Group on profits and payments are
not qualified as business relationships, but are a consequence of DB Group’s status as a domestic contract group
and the associated rights and obligations of all the incorporated domestic companies.
◊◊

Operational business relationships

The most extensive operational business relationships arise
from the use of the rail infrastructure and the procurement
of energy from DB Netze Energy. As for non-Group customers, fees for the use of infrastructure are based on the
corresponding pricing systems (train-path pricing system,
facility pricing system and station pricing system). The procurement of energy includes purchasing of traction energy

Expenses for administrative service units are only passed
on if these result from direct service relationships with the
business units or expenditures that are directly attributable
to a specific service. This applies in particular to expenditures on the transfer of real estate, central purchasing and
technology services and for centrally consolidated insurance expenses.
The Group job market performs an important central
function. DB JobService GmbH employs staff whose jobs in

DB Group incorporates various Group and service functions

that, with a few regulatory exceptions, perform functions
for the entire DB Group. The costs for Group functions are
not transferred to the business units (no “Group charges”).
In order to prevent distortions or arbitrary demands for
payment, the costs of services rendered are borne by the
holding company itself and not passed on. This means that
Group companies pay no Group charges for these services.

aim of mediating another job for them internally. It therefore plays a key role in the functioning of the DB -inter­­­nal
labor market. DB Zeitarbeit GmbH provides companies in
DB Group with temporary employees.

Group financing

The Group Treasury at DB AG is responsible for DB Group
financing. This structure ensures that all Group companies
are able to borrow and invest funds at optimal terms and
conditions. Before obtaining funds from external sources,
we first conduct intra-Group financing transactions. When
borrowing external funds, DB AG takes out short-term loans
in its own name, whereas long-term capital is generally
obtained through the Groupʼs financing company, Deutsche
Bahn Finance B.V. (DB Finance), Amsterdam/the Netherlands. The funds are passed on to the Group companies
within the context of a treasury concept as short-term
credit lines, which can be utilized as part of cash pooling
on internal current accounts and/or through fixed shortterm credit, or in the form of long-term loans. This concept
enables us to pool risks and resources for the entire Group,
and to consolidate our know-how, realize synergy effects
and minimize refinancing costs.
The Treasury operates throughout DB Group as an
in-house bank, although it provides a service function rather
than acting as a profit center. All Group companies have

business relationships with the Treasury. It predominantly
involves the borrowing and investment of financial
resources and the pooling of liquidity. Treasury transactions are conducted at current market rates, meaning that
the agreed interest rates are in line with the rates quoted
by banks when not intended to yield a profit.
Market rates mean that credit margins are adjusted in
line with the creditworthiness. The credit margin for the
infrastructure companies is largely in line with the credit
margins of DB AG in the financial and capital market. The
credit margins for non-infrastructure companies are higher
and are based on an internal metric-based credit rating and
the credit margins quoted on the capital market.
Consolidation of the Group finance function in DB AG
gives us a standardized market presence in the financial
and capital markets, and allows us to achieve economies of
scale and cost benefits. In addition, central Group financing
enables us to adequately monitor all financial transactions
and achieve comprehensive risk management.

Domination and profit and loss
transfer agreements

Profit transfers and losses offset do not constitute business
relationships. On the contrary, the profit and loss transfer
agreement stipulates that the amount of profit distributed
or the amount required to offset losses is not reset every

year but is calculated automatically. The flow of capital is
based on the shareholders right to profits or obligation to
compensate any losses. Regardless of this, DB Group
ensures that Group companies have sufficient capital stock
despite the obligation to offset potential losses generated
by other companies within the Group.
With regard to financial relationships, it is important
to note that interest payments and profit and loss transfers
are based on economically viable decisions and are neces-

sary for funding capital expenditures. Investors are only
willing to provide capital if amortization and returns are
guaranteed. A purely debt-based financing model is not commercially viable, as it is associated with high risks. Profits
are essential for maintaining DB Group’s capital expenditure capacity. Profits generated are either retained or distributed to the Federal Government as sole shareholder.
The share of profit retained in the company increases the
Group’s capital expenditure and borrowing capacity.

≈≈ Business model stable
DB Group offers attractive, customer-focused and environ-

mentally friendly mobility, transport and logistics solutions
and networks from a single source. Our customers are individuals, business customers and contracting organizations
in local and regional transport.
The R AILWAY IN GERMANY [ PAGE 7 3 ] is an essential part of
our business activities. Since the beginning of the new millennium, we have also gradually expanded our business
portfolio in order to meet our customers’ needs more
effectively and respond to new market demands.
Our passenger transport business activities are broadly
diversified. They comprise not only bus and rail transport,
but also intelligent linkage with other modes of transport
such as the car and bicycle. We offer long-distance rail

passenger transport within Germany and into neighboring
countries. Furthermore, we have regional transport operations throughout Europe that enable us to benefit from in­­
creas­­ing market potential in bus and rail transport markets
that are opening up.
Our business activities in the freight transport and logistics market were moved to an international platform very
early on. DB Cargo and DB Schenker operate first and foremost in the business-to-business segment. We offer our
customers industry-specific solutions in European rail
freight transport and land transport, in global air and ocean
freight as well as in global contract logistics. Covering all
relevant modes of transport allows us to offer complex
combined logistics services and to make use of synergies
in our networks for the benefit of our customers.

Operating regional and global transport networks often
necessitates a high level of capital employed, long investment cycles and distinctive fixed-cost structures. In this
respect, achieving optimal capacity utilization of our networks and systematically developing, integrating and
cost-effectively operating these networks with efficient use
of resources are important to DB Group’s economic development. Ensuring and improving service quality Β for our
customers is at the center of our activities. By expanding
our customer offers, particularly digital services and customer loyalty programs, we intend to gain additional customers in order to achieve increasing volumes and economies of scale.
We use operating performance data to measure capacity
utilization in our networks and our relative market shares
in the transport markets. In order to determine a relative
return, we calculate ratios comparing this performance
data with the generated revenues (specific revenues). With
its comprehensive Group portfolio, DB Group has an effective business model. This allows DB Group to offer services
from one single source and means that it operates successfully in all segments of the transport market with its na­­
tional and international services.
In most of our business units incoming orders are not a
relevant performance indicator, and the majority of the
Group’s revenues are generated independently of long-term
contracts. DB Regional and DB Arriva are an exception to
this rule, together accounting for about one-third of Group
revenues. In these business units, the development of orders
in the form of LONG -TERM TR ANSPORT CONTR ACTS [ PAGE S 1 41
AND 16 4 F.] entered into with Germany’s Federal states and
franchisers in other European countries constitutes a key
performance metric for business development. There are
also long-term contractual relationships with customers in
the contract logistics/SCM line of business of DB Schenker,
which generates about 6% of Group revenues.
The four key success factors in the positive development
of DB Group, which are a central component in DB Group’s
business model.
Entrepreneurial approach to business: in the course of
the German rail reform, DB Group has established itself as
a commercial enterprise. Particularly worth mentioning in
this context are the establishment of a modern and efficient organization and a value-based management approach
with capital market viability as a target.

Integrated Group: as a system integrator in Germany,
DB Group optimizes the integrated rail system. In doing so,
it serves as an important driving force for technological
innovation. The integrated Group structure enables us to
achieve positive synergies and align our infrastructure to
support efficiency, market orientation and profitability.
International direction: due to our focus on Europe in
passenger transport as well as our European and global
orientation in the areas of freight transport and logistics
activities, DB Group has an excellent position in the relevant
markets. As a result, we are responding to the increasing
demand for cross-border solutions. At the same time, we are
best positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities.
Cross-modal transport solutions: we offer our customers
door-to-door mobility and logistics solutions from a single
source. We intelligently link various modes of transport in
an economical and environmentally friendly way. In addition, we offer complementary products and services in the
freight transport and logistics market.

≈≈ Relevant markets

DB Group provides national and international services. We

operate globally and have leading market positions around
the world.
◊ ◊ DB Group is first in regional rail passenger transport
and second in long-distance rail passenger transport in
Europe.
◊ ◊ DB Group occupies third position in European public
road passenger transport.
◊ ◊ DB Group is also first for track infrastructure and in oper­
­­­ating stations in Europe, as well as for European rail
freight transport and European land transport.
◊ ◊ DB Group occupies third place both for global air freight
and for global ocean freight, as well as fifth place for
contract logistics.

Passenger transport

In passenger transport, our objective is to maintain our
strong market position in the rail and bus transport market
in Germany over the long term, while growing in Europe.
Throughout Europe, transport contracts are being increasingly tendered in regional and local transport. We intend
to profit from these as well in the future. Through DB ARRIVA
[ PAGE 163 FF.] , we have successful operations in the bus and/
or rail transport business in 14 European countries. This
puts us in a good position for further growth. The liberalization of the European passenger transport markets is,
however, progressing at different speeds across Europe. In
many other countries, the national long-distance transport
market has not yet been opened to competition.

Freight transport and logistics

With DB CARGO [PAGE 1 45 FF.] and DB SCHENKER [PAGE 169 FF.] , we
are positioned in the freight transport and logistics market
as one of the leading logistics services providers globally.
The demand for international freight transport services is
rising due to the ongoing shift towards cross-border production structures and flows of goods and the continuing
trend for outsourcing of logistics services. We aim to make
use of this opportunity to maintain and/or expand our
excellent market positions. DB Cargo is Europe’s leading
rail freight service operator and has a presence in all major
markets. We use our own European production network to
do this. In this network, national and cross-border transport
is conducted efficiently and in a customer-oriented and
en­vi­­ronmentally friendly manner. DB Cargo is focused on
the automotive, building materials, industrial and consumer
goods, chemicals, iron, coal and steel (montan) and combined transport industries. DB Schenker offers European
land transport, global air and ocean freight, and comprehen­
­sive logistics solutions and global supply chain management
(SCM) in contract logistics. With a broad customer base,

we have a future-oriented position in the high-growth logistics markets. We have especially strong market positions in
the automotive, high-tech and industrial and consumer
goods sectors.

Infrastructure

In Germany, we have assumed dual responsibility for rail
transport as a result of our integrated Group structure: we
are both the operator and primary user of the rail infrastructure. The resulting greater customer and efficiency
focus in our infrastructure benefits all train operating companies (TOC) without discrimination. In addition to the
Group’s internal code of conduct, we ensure competitive
neutrality of our track infrastructure by means of regulation that is considered strict by international standards.
Our target is to continue to develop the rail transport mode
and thus strengthen the transport infrastructure that is
vital for Germany as a business location. At the same time,
we are laying the foundations for coping with the increasing
flow of traffic in Europe. We also take care of both the rail
network and passenger stations as well as the power supply
for the TOC in Germany.

≈≈ DB trend landscape stable
DB Group’s business environment is in a state of constant

change. The DB trend landscape was developed in order to
actively benefit from opportunities and counter risks at
an early stage. It includes highly cross-linked trends relat­ing
to customers, society, politics and the global economy. DB’s
trend landscape is a firmly established part of DB Group’s
strategy work. During the year under review, we again
focused on particularly dynamic change. In the process, we
looked both at the most important technological developments and at the most relevant changes in employee and
customer needs, as well as demands for new transport concepts. In order to ensure that we recognize new trends early
on, we continuously monitor our environment and communicate with internal and external experts.
Œ DB.DE/LINK S _ IR 16

≈≈ High-profile trends in 2016
Intelligent automation

More and more, customers are looking for intuitive digital
applications Δ that can simplify everyday life. Providers
are being called upon to develop customized solutions that
will satisfy customer needs in a faster, more personalized
and more cost-efficient way. In particular, easy processing
of natural speech and improved image recognition will
change our everyday lives and will facilitate more customized and more efficient interactions with machines. At the
same time, neural networks can process large quantities of
images and videos in order to self-optimize. In this way,
both at work and in people’s personal lives, machines will
increasingly be able to simplify or completely replace
people for clearly defined tasks and routine work. Intelligent automation will therefore bring noticeable changes to
every aspect of life. For DB Group, this trend offers great
opportunities, for example in preventive maintenance. In
the future, freight locomotives, switches, elevators and
escalators will automatically report any malfunctions so
that they can be repaired and maintained in a timely
manner. In the future, schedule preparation will also be
fully automated, which will increase performance quality
for customers, as well as utilization of capacity. In the area

Four Group programs cover
areas of action / p. 85

of logistics, goods will transport themselves to automated
warehouses and will use real-time tracking to provide constantly available information on location, temperature and
expected delivery time.

Consumption as an experience

For more and more customers, the product experience is
important. Younger people, especially, would rather use
their disposable income for vacation experiences and
eating out than to buy their own car or furniture. Today,
already three out of four prefer to spend their money on
experiences rather than on tangible products. Travel and
leisure-oriented companies are benefiting accordingly. The
following becomes clear: successful providers must offer
useful total packages. For DB Group, it is becoming increasingly important in passenger transport to offer an experience both before and after the trip. Here, the customer
interface is particularly critical.

Sustainable city

Increasing urbanization and the great success of e-commerce means that cities are becoming more and more burdened with traffic growth. The upshot: more noise, more
pollution and worse traffic jams. In order to make cities
livable again, it is going to be necessary to take back the
public space. The smart interlinking of mobility and logistics will play an important role in this regard. This will
require the systematic management of all modes of transport through integrated transport concepts. Services providing simple, door-to-door mobility can offer people an
attractive alternative to owning a personal car. This will
open up the potential for significantly more efficient utilization of roads. In logistics, smart scheduling and distri­
bution of flows of goods will be necessary to reduce city
traffic. With its train stations, DB Group can help to design
a stronger package of occasions for mobility and consumption. Train stations could become the ideal hub for growing
traffic volume and efficient urban logistics.

Performance-oriented society

Today’s performance-oriented society places many demands
on employees. The actual workload, perceived stress from
changes in the workplace and changes outside the workplace have all increased steadily in recent decades. As a
consequence, mental disorders have in­­creased sharply. In
Germany alone, costs from stress-related illnesses already
amount to about € 7 billion per year. As a result, nonmone­tary incentives such as sabbaticals or working from
home are becoming more important in the competition for
talented staff. Life balance is becoming a com­­petitive
factor. More and more often, employees choose part-time
positions or share their job through job-sharing schemes.
The desire for self-fulfillment outside of traditio­­nal full-time
jobs and the strong focus on the family and children are a
challenge for employers.

≈≈ Consideration in Group programs

Specific actions and consequences for DB Group must be
developed and derived for all dynamic trends. In the year
under review, we have therefore further developed our
STR ATEGIC GROUP PROGR AMS [ PAGE 85 F.] on the basis of trends,
among other things.

≈≈ Further development of the
DB2020 strategy into DB2020+
Our previous DB2020
strategy has been successfully
adopted by DB Group through broad-based communication
efforts and various tools since 2012.
Nevertheless, DB Group and, in particular, the railway in
‡
DB 09 Germany today face serious external and internal challenges
that have made it necessary to further develop DB Group’s
strategic orientation.
Externally, pressure is being intensified primarily by
increased competition in passenger and freight transport
and by higher personnel and energy costs. Internally,
quality demands urgent action. This applies especially to
punctuality, passenger information and passenger transport
services, as well as fulfilling customer promises in freight
transport. Important initial steps have been taken to lay
the groundwork for digital transformation Δ . In light of
the pace of change required, however, we need to work
faster and more forcefully. In terms of culture, we have
already achieved a lot, but now we need to turn this into
higher performance.

82

G R O U P M A N AG E M E N T R E P O RT

The resulting strategic need for adjustment applies to
DB Group’s vision, to the aspirations and targets in the previous DB2020
strategy and to addressing the most urgent
areas of action by introducing centralized processes of
change Γ in the areas of quality, digitalization and per­
formance. The measures adopted as part of the GROUP
RESTRUCTURING [ INTEGR ATED REPORT 2016, PAGE 68 F.] are aimed
primarily at increasing the competitiveness of the railway in
Germany, establishing competitive cost structures in cor­
porate management and creating the financial leeway for
necessary capital expenditures while ensuring DB Group’s
financial stability. Because of changes in the business environment, the option of partially privatizing DB Schenker
and DB Arriva is on hold for the time being. Instead, an
alternative solution was reached with the owner to increase
equity capital and reduce dividends without any restrictions
on planned capital expenditures for infrastructure.
Our sustainability approach continues to provide the
framework for our strategy, which is aimed at achieving
harmony between the economic, social and environmental
dimensions. We want our customers to benefit from firstclass and environmentally friendly mobility and logis­­tics solutions driven by dedicated employees and digital
expertise.
In the new world of this digital era, which offers a high
level of transparency about providers’ services, what counts
most is quality. Quality is the key to customer satisfaction
and thus the key to commercial success. That being said,
we have adjusted our aspiration in the economic dimenstrategy – from PROFITABLE MARKET
sion of the DB2020
LEADER
to PROFITABLE QUALIT Y LEADER ¿ . Our aspiration of being a TOP EMPLOYER † and AN ECO - PIONEER ¥
remain the same. We have also sharpened our focus on specific issues and, in doing so, reduced our TARGET SYSTEM
[ PAGE 8 4 F.] to eight top targets.
In order to reach our targets, we have three central fields
of action:
◊ ◊ establishing a new culture of quality that is striving for
operational excellence and customer focus,
◊ ◊ building digital expertise to enable both development
of innovative solutions for our core business, and generation of new business, and
◊ ◊ enhancing our own performance capabilities, with focus
on embracing responsibility and stronger performance.
Operational implementation of the central action areas
will be driven by GROUP-WIDE, BUSINESS-SPECIFIC PROGR AMS

≈≈ Adjustments to the target system

During the year under review, we made some adjustments
to our target system as part of our regular review of our
target figures and target values.

Top targets: reduced from twelve to eight

As part of the further development of DB2020+ , greater
focus was placed on the strategic target system. For
example, the previous top targets – innovation activities,
market position, demographic preparedness and efficient
use of materials/resources are no longer part of the strategic target system at Group and business unit level.
Instead, the future innovation activities will be promoted
on a decentralized basis and as part of Group-wide digitalization activities. The trend in revenues and market po­sitions is a facet of the top target RE A SONABLE R ATE OF
RETURN ¿ and therefore still represents a strategic focus.
Nevertheless, the primary strategic focus in the coming
years will not be on growth, but rather on achieving quality
leadership and a reasonable level of profitability. For this
reason, the strategic aspiration to become a profitable
market leader and the designation of profitability as the
top target have been adjusted to PROFITABLE QUALIT Y
LEADER ¿ and reasonable rate of return. Demographic preparedness and efficient use of materials/resources will still
be monitored by the HR and environmental area and are
now the responsibility of the relevant decision-making
bodies such as the HR Board and the Group’s Environment
Committee.

Economy: redemption coverage adjusted

The definition of REDEMPTION COVER AGE [ PAGE 11 4 ] as the key
debt ratio for managing DB Group’s creditworthiness has
been adjusted. To calculate the redemption coverage as the
ratio of operating cash flow to debt, the cash flow is now
adjusted for leases and tax payments. Debt now in­cludes
not only net financial debt and lease lia­bilities, but also
pension liabilities. The purpose of the adjustment is to align
the calculations better with the methodology used by the
rating agencies and to improve control over DB Group’s
debt. Adjusted for the new definition, the DB2020+ target
value for redemption coverage is now ≥ 25%.

T R E N D S A N D S T R AT EGY

The position in the EMPLOYER R ANKING [ PAGE 1 21 F.] is the
weighted average of market-research results on the following target groups: high school students, university students, individuals with non-academically experienced professionals and academically experience professionals. To
date, the weighting for the specific target groups was driven
by personnel needs for the year 2012, based on demand
forecasts. As there have been shifts throughout the target
groups since then, the weightings have now been updated
to take into account new hires in the previous year. The
values for 2012 to 2015 were adjusted retroactively based on
the respective needs. The main changes include an increase
in demand for the target group of non-academically experienced professionals and a decrease in demand for students. From now on, the weighting will be updated annually before the key figure is calculated.

Environment: additional
greenhouse gas emissions included
and target values increased

In addition to the well-known greenhouse gas carbon
dioxide (CO₂), other gases, such as methane and nitrous
oxide, also have a negative impact on climate. In the
future, these gases will be converted into so-called CO ₂
equivalents (CO₂e) and will also be included as part of the
key figure SPECIFIC CO₂E EMISSIONS (CARRIER S) [ PAGE 1 27 F.] in
our strategic target. In addition, we will further intensify
our efforts to reduce specific CO₂e emissions. As a result,
we have raised our 2020 target value to –30% compared to
2006. Our goal is for renewable energies to make up 45%
of the DB traction current mix by 2020.

Environment: categories of freight cars
included have been expanded

To illustrate our focus on ensuring that by 2020 all relevant
DB Cargo freight cars operating on the German rail network –
about 64,000 – will be refitted with so-called “whisper
brakes” to run more quietly, beginning in the year under
review, our target value for QUIET FREIGHT CAR S [ PAGE 1 30 F.]
will no longer refer only to refitted existing freight cars, but
also to newly acquired, quiet freight cars.

In summer 2015, we launched the biggest GROUP RESTRUCTURING [ 201 5 INTEGR ATED REPORT, PAGE 68 F.] since the 1994 German
rail reform. The core element is the R AILWAY OF THE FUTURE
program [ 201 5 INTEGR ATED REPORT, PAGE 69 FF.] . This program
prioritizes our customers’ needs and the quality of our pro­d­­­ucts. The first step entailed developing measures to optimize customer offerings, improve the quality of service and
ensure long-term financial viability. Since January 2016, the
program has been in the implementation phase. In addition to centralized program management, six modules (DB
Long-Distance, DB Regional, DB Sales, DB Cargo, DB Netze
Track and DB Netze Stations) and six cross-business-unit
modules (punctuality, passenger information, WiFi @ DB,
spare parts service, plants strategy and transformation initiative) have been launched.
During the year under review, the focus of the R AILWAY
[ PAGE 1 3 FF.] program was on remedying
OF THE FUTURE
the biggest customer annoyances at short notice. The
focus here was on five issues: punctuality, passenger information, vehicle quality, station quality and WiFi @ DB.
◊ ◊ During the second half of 2016 in particular, developments in PUNCTUALITY Α [ PAGE 101 F.] were positive due
to, among other things, better coordination of construction and maintenance work in the infrastructure and on
account of the PLANSTART PROJECT [ PAGE 101 ].
◊ ◊ We have improved passenger information Β , in particular by installing more than 2,000 MULTILINE DISPLAYS
[ PAGE 103 ] and by improving the way we provide information through digital media. We also managed to increase
the quality of our delay forecasts.
◊ ◊ We were able to significantly improve vehicle quality Β
through the RESET [ PAGE 1 37 ] program.
◊ ◊ In part by increasing the availability of elevators and
escalators to more than 97% by the end of 2016 and
through 960 measures aimed at intensive station clean­­

≈≈ Autonomous driving on the road

We want to use self-driving vehicles Δ for mobility and

create new customer offerings and/or make its operations
more efficient through autonomous vehicles.
In passenger transport, we intend to deploy small selfdriving buses to form sustainable, customer-oriented and
seamless mobility chains. In freight transport, our goal is
to create a network of self-driving trucks on highways as
well as with several vehicles in a convoy (platooning) to
increase efficiency.

Business and overall conditions

relevant markets / p. 90

As an operator of networks and provider of services in passenger transport, freight transport and logistics, and rail
infrastructure, our economic success is influenced by the
general economic environment and the specific development of the various RELEVANT MARKETS [ PAGE 90 FF.] .
◊ ◊ Demand for passenger transport is driven, above all, by
the size of the population, the number of people in
employment and real disposable income.
	 The competitive situation relative to automobiles is
influenced significantly by the development of fuel
prices.
	 The financial resources of the contracting organizations are also of key importance in the DB Regional and
DB Arriva business units.
◊ ◊ Our freight transport and logistics operations depend
largely on economic developments. Due to our global
networks, we monitor the development not only of
global gross domestic product (GDP) and world trade,
but also of economic growth in the regions, countries
and trade relations in which we have a high market
share or in which high growth rates in the exchange of
goods can be expected. Customary early-warning indicators of the business climate and of the expectations
of purchasing managers are an integral part of our
monitoring system.
◊ ◊ The specific market environment of DB Cargo is particularly influenced by the manufacturing industry’s
production output and the development of our core
industries. The export and import activities of the individual countries and the movement of goods within
Europe are of particular importance in cross-border
transport.
◊ ◊ The services of the Infrastructure business units cover
important elements of the value-added chains of their
customers. In this respect, the development of demand
is a factor that is largely determined by upstream passenger and freight transport markets. The area of marketing in DB Netze Stations is also important. Consumer
trends in the general public are an important factor
here, much as they are in general retail in Germany.

Numerous developments
in the political
environment / p. 95

The development of the economic and early-warning indicators, as presented above, influences how we manage our
market activities and resources. Opportunities and risks
can therefore be recognized early on, and, as a result, short-­
­term management activities and long-term positioning
can be focused accordingly. At the same time, we work
systematically on optimizing our operating value drivers.

≈≈ Assessment of the economic climate
by the Management Board

Developments in world trade are enormously important for
the international logistics activities of DB Group. The weakness in world trade, which has meanwhile been ongoing for
several years now, is therefore having an adverse effect on
the growth of these business operations. This trend is, however, being partly mitigated by the comparatively good
development of trade within Europe, which is where our
activities are focused.
The continuing economic recovery of European countries and the appreciation of the euro following the British
decision (Brexit) to leave the European Union (EU) are two
reasons behind the above-average recovery trend in trade
within Europe. At the same time, the depreciation of the

Deutsche Bahn Group – 2016 Integrated Report

British pound versus the euro had strongly negative effects
on DB Group. Growing real incomes and positive labor
market trends had a favorable effect on European passenger
transport and, as such, on DB Group. Economic growth in
DB Group’s home market of Germany, in particular, was
stronger than expected, not just due to robust private consumption, but also to increasing investments and higher
government spending.

≈≈ Global lack of investments
weighs on trade

Global economic growth slowed in 2016, primarily as a
result of weaker development in the USA . Added to which,
several of the major emerging markets – such as Brazil and
Russia – remained in recession.
One key burden that is weighing on the global economy
is the lack of momentum driving investments in numerous
countries. Their growth around the world was as weak in
2016 as has not been witnessed since the economic and
financial crisis. In addition to the continued low prices of
many raw materials that are dampening investments in this
sector, the growing uncertainty caused by political events
in several major economies (Brexit, US elections, constitutional referendum in Italy) also had a negative impact on
global investments.
Sluggish investment activities are impacting world trade
particularly strongly as capital goods are often traded at
several levels within their value-added chains. Accordingly,
growth in world trade remained feeble in 2016, after an
already weak previous year.

USA
◊ ◊ Pillar of economic development was private consumption.
◊ ◊ Low unemployment and rising wages at lower inflation
increased the real disposable income.
◊ ◊ Weaker export prospects in the wake of the recent
strengthening of the dollar, together with low energy
prices and heightened uncertainty had a seriously
dampening effect on investment growth.
◊ ◊ The central bank raised the base interest rate slightly
in December; monetary policy remains expansionary,
however.
◊ ◊ Long-lasting and tough election campaign caused
uncertainty in the run-up to the presidential election.

Asia

Despite slowing growth rates, the Chinese economy
posted record growth in absolute terms. Private consumption was one driver of this development. Government spending, however, increased by a much stronger
degree, mainly through its infrastructure expansion
program.
◊ ◊ India’s economy also continued its strong growth,
with government spending increasing while capital
expenditures declined.
◊ ◊ In contrast, capital expenditures in plant and equipment increased in Indonesia, Myanmar and Vietnam,
fueled by growing flows of inner-Asian trade.
◊ ◊ Japan’s economy only recorded minor growth in 2016
despite its expansionary monetary and fiscal policies.
As a result, the increase in consumer tax – originally
planned for October 2015 – has been deferred until
2019. This measure is placing constraints on what is
already a high national budget deficit.
◊◊

Europe

growth rates weakened in several Eastern European EU member states (Poland, Czech Republic and
Hungary).
◊ ◊ The economy in Great Britain also lost pace but remained
above average and above expectations. Exports benefited from the depreciation of the British pound following
the Brexit referendum. By the same token, however,
growing uncertainty caused a slump in investments on
plant and equipment.
◊ ◊ Economic performance in Turkey was not as strong as
in previous years. One of the main reasons for this was
the hesitation on the part of foreign investors in light
of the considered as unsafe political environment.
◊ ◊ Although the decline in economic output in Russia was
slower year on year, the low oil price and sanctions in
connection with the Ukraine conflict continued to weigh
on the economy.
◊ ◊ GDP

Eurozone

German economic growth was stronger than forecast
in 2016. Investments also increased significantly,
mainly due to much higher investments in construction. Government spending also increased in the wake
of higher expenditure for refugees.
◊ ◊ Economic growth in France remained below the average.
One main reason for this is the high level of government
debt that limits the scope for fiscal stimulus.

With the economy getting off to a weak start, plagued
by worries about the course of growth in China and
elimination of the sanctions against Iran, the price of
Brent dropped in January to its lowest level since
November 2003.
◊ ◊ With production declining in the US shale oil industry
as a result of price developments, and following un­­
scheduled shutdowns, the oil market witnessed a sur­­

­­­ed the USA to start reducing its record crude oil stocks.
Since their low at the end of May, however, drilling operations in the USA have meanwhile increased significantly, by 65%.
◊ ◊ The tug-of-war surrounding caps on OPEC production
resulted in strong price swings. In their fight for market
share, total production by both OPEC and Russia
reached record highs. Only when binding proportionate
cuts were agreed at the end of November was the
market able to look lastingly convincing, with Brent
climbing to its highest level since July 2015.

The massive expansion in renewable energy capacities
occasionally results in negative prices being quoted on

◊ ◊ At the beginning of February, the electricity futures
market dropped to new all-time lows in the wake of the
poor economic forecasts. As primary energy prices
increased, and concerns about economic growth dissipated, the base load contract for the following year
recovered and traded in a range between € 24 to € 29
per MWh for several months. Toward year-end, security
checks at French nuclear power plants and the in­­
creasing cost of European coal caused prices to rise on
the German electricity market to as much as € 35.80 per
MWh, the highest they have been since the end of 2014.
◊ ◊ After prices slipped at the beginning of the year,
France’s plans to set a floor on the price of emissions
rights caused them to climb above the € 7 mark. The
Brexit vote raised concerns about the ability of
the emissions trading system to survive, and caused
prices to slump below € 4 per t CO₂. With energy generating declining in the EU, CO₂ emissions also dropped
by 0.7%.

In the first half of 2016, the bond markets continued their
trend of declining yields that had started again in mid-2015.
At the start of the year, yields on ten-year German Federal
bonds (bunds) were still 0.60% but then dropped to
0.04%. This development was prompted by the European
Central Bank (ECB) continuing its policy of monetary
easing, and in the process expanding its bond purchase
program to include corporate bonds. In the wake of the
British referendum on the EU, yields on bunds dropped to
a historically low level of – 0.20% as investors’ aversion to
risk prompted them to start using bunds as a safe haven in
light of the uncertainty surrounding the future development of the EU. As the year progressed, yields on ten-year

bunds initially fluctuated below 0% before ultimately
returning to positive figures. Main driver of the bond markets was primarily the speculation surrounding the monetary policy that the ECB and US central bank (Fed) were
expected to adopt. In a move that had been anticipated for
a long time, the latter raised interest rates in December,
while the former decided to extend its bond purchase program, albeit with reduced scope. In addition, the election
of Donald Trump as the next US president provided strong
momentum for higher yields and pushed ten-year bund
yields to their highest level of 0.45% in the second half of
the year. Yields were 0.21% at year-end.

Figures for 2015 and 2016 are based on information and estimates available as of

therefore the total may not add up to 100.

In 2016, the German passenger transport market grew
across all segments and – as in previous years – at a faster
pace than the long-term average. Alongside socioeconomic
factors and competitive stimulus, this development was
also driven by special effects:
◊ ◊ Robust labor market with growth in employment figures,
low inflation with reduced fuel prices, and increased
real disposable incomes.
◊ ◊ Fierce price competition in long-distance public transport between long-distance bus service providers,
low-cost airlines, ride-sharing platforms and railways.

Continuing price competition in the long-distance bus
segment has resulted in consolidation among providers.
Market leader FlixBus acquired Postbus and took over
the Continental European services of megabus.com,
while DB Group discontinued its BER LINLINIENBU S

Regional bus services also recorded growth in the wake
of an increasing population and rising numbers of vocational trainees and people in employment.
DB volume sold decreased as a result of weaker demand
for local lines in rural regions and adjustments to the
business portfolio.
The market share of public road passenger transport
remained unchanged at 6.4%.

Air transport

Significant increase in volume sold.
The positive development was driven by increased competition caused by Ryanair and Transavia offers on the
main Cologne – Berlin and Munich – Berlin routes and by
fewer strike activities compared to the previous year.

incomes, although reservation behavior labored under
security concerns in the wake of more terrorist incidents.

Growth in the European passenger
transport market

The general framework for passenger transport improved
across Europe in 2016. Rising employment figures, higher
real disposable incomes and lower fuel prices prompted
stronger demand in many European countries, with further
support coming from mild weather conditions and an additional day of service due to the leap year.
Competition was intensified in numerous countries,
which also created growth:
◊ ◊ Following liberalization of its national long-distance
bus services, France witnessed a boom in demand and
fierce price competition, led by German long-distance
bus service providers FlixBus and Isilines (long-­
distance bus brand of French Transdev), together with
Ouibus (long-distance bus brand of French stateowned railway SNCF).
◊ ◊ Norway announced it would be putting rail passenger
transport contracts up for tender for the first time ever,
and carved out business operations of the Norwegian
state-owned railway (NSB) to foster future competition.
◊ ◊ Italian state-owned railway FS announced that it would
take its high-speed business, which would operate
throughout Europe in future, public in 2017.
◊ ◊ The Dutch-owned railway (NS) announced its withdrawal
from participation in national local public transport
tenders in favor of partnering local public transport
authorities more strongly.

≈≈ Freight transport and logistics

Rail passenger transport

Rail passenger transport volume in Europe increased in the
first three quarters of 2016 by about 1.5%. Countries that
witnessed the biggest increases included:
◊ ◊ Czech Republic, as a result of competition between
Czech state-owned railway CD and private providers
RegioJet and Leo Express (+7.4%).
◊ ◊ Poland, following the launch of high-speed intercity
transport services by Polish state-owned railway PKP
(+11.1%).
◊ ◊ Spain, thanks to expanded high-speed connections and
improved capacity utilization from the sale of extensive
quotas of cheap tickets by Spanish state-owned railway
RENFE (+ 5.1%).
By contrast, the following countries recorded noticeable
slumps:
◊ ◊ Denmark, due to competition from long-distance bus
transport services with Danish state-owned railway
DSB, and to lower demand caused by identity checks
and travel time extensions in cross-border rail transport
(–7.2%).
◊ ◊ France, due to lower demand for French state-owned
railway SNCF in the wake of attacks, the risk of terrorism, strikes and competition in the low-price sector
with ride-sharing platforms, long-distance bus service
providers and low-cost airlines (– 4.5%).

Public road passenger transport

Demand for long-distance bus services in Europe grew
significantly in 2016, driven by strong stimulus from the
recently liberalized French market, in particular. At the
same time the provider or brand landscape changed:
◊ ◊ FlixBus acquired the Continental European business of
British competitor megabus.com in July 2016, and
German competitor Postbus in August 2016.
◊ ◊ Hellö starting operating international connections in
July 2016 as a brand of the Austrian state-owned railway

Figures for 2015 and 2016 are based on information and estimates available
as of February 17, 2017 (including the retroactive adjustments to road freight traffic figures
from 2011 onward). The market share for each mode of transport has been rounded.

Growth in the German freight transport market in 2016 corresponded more or less with the annual average recorded
since the economic crisis in 2008/2009. After getting off
to a weak start, development stabilized over the further
course of the year with volume increasing by about 1.5%
to 2%. Growth was supported by stimulus from the economic environment, which was positive overall, al­though
some industry sectors fell far short of the levels witnessed
during the previous year. These differences in development
were reflected in the results of the modes of transport.
Demand from the consumer goods sector – which typically
uses road transport – and the construction industry proved
to be strong, and trucks benefited additionally from their
improved ability to compete in the wake of a renewed sharp
drop in diesel prices, whereas weak development in the
intermediate goods sector had a dampening effect on rail
and inland waterway transport.

Rail

Volume in 2016 was not able to match the level witnessed
during the previous year.
◊ ◊ Positive development, especially in combined transport,
was not sufficient to offset the – in some cases marked –
declines in areas such as agriculture/forestry, ores,
iron/steel, chemicals, mineral products and vehicles.
◊ ◊ It was not possible to defend rail market share, which
decreased.
◊ ◊ Decline in DB volume sold mainly due to weak devel­op­
­ment in key industries, such as coal, steel and chemicals
where DB Cargo holds a big market share, and to shifts
in intermodal and intramodal transport. Combined
transport volume was virtually on a par with the previous
year’s level.
◊◊

B usiness and ov era l l conditions

share of the intramodal market fell further, to
about 59%, and of the intermodal market to 10.4%.
◊ ◊ Performance by non-Group railways was again above
average, with volume sold increasing due, not least, to
smaller shares of coal and steel transport volumes and
to shifts in modes of transport.
◊ ◊ Non-Group railways posted their strongest growth in
combined transport.

Road

Above average development in volume sold. According
to the toll statistics issued by the German Federal
Agency for Freight Transport, foreign-registered vehicles – especially from Central and Eastern Europe –
continued to be the main contributors to growth.
◊ ◊ Alongside strong momentum from the construction
industry, growth was also driven by good consumer
sentiment. Road benefits from increased demand for
commercial and industrial goods, and from consignment sizes that are getting smaller while quality
requirements in terms of duration and punctuality are
becoming more stringent.
◊ ◊ Trucks became increasingly competitive in the wake of
low diesel prices, and benefited from shifts from other
modes of transport.
◊ ◊ Market position was further expanded for the third
consecutive year.
◊◊

Inland waterways

With largely weak stimulus coming from the bulk segment and further restrictions caused by low water
levels, especially toward the end of 2016, volume was
again much lower by year-on-year comparison than had
been expected at the start of the year.
◊ ◊ Performance development was weak in virtually all
areas. Agricultural/forestry, coal and coke/mineral oil
volumes were much lower year on year.
◊ ◊ Market share decreased for the third consecutive year.
◊◊

European rail freight transport market
shrank below previous year’s level

Volume sold in European rail freight transport (EU 28,­
Switzerland and Norway) decreased in 2016. Reasons
included weaker stimulus from industries that traditionally
use rail transport – such as coal and steel. The continued
positive development in combined transport helped per­
formance. 2016 was a year of volatility. A weak first quarter
was followed by slight stabilization over the further course
of the year, before volume sold declined again toward the
end of the year.
In a fiercely competitive market environment, performance continued to differ significantly from one region to
the next. Based on current information, scarcely any of the
top railway operators in Europe were able to increase
volume sold. Volume sold in the European network operated by DB Cargo was also lower year on year (–3.8%), due
mainly to weak performance in its key markets of Germany
and Great Britain.
Regional performance compared to the previous year is
discussed below.

Great Britain

Significant decrease of about 10% in volume sold.
◊ ◊ Strong decrease especially in coal and steel. Over the
past two years, coal transport volumes have declined by
about 75%. Growth in intermodal volumes was unable
to compensate for the negative development.
◊ ◊ Although DB Cargo UK was hit particularly hard by
the decrease in steel and coal transport volumes, the
company nevertheless managed to defend its leading
position in the market.
◊◊

Poland

Volume sold in 2016 decreased slightly year on year.
This weak performance was mainly due to declining
demand for coal in the wake of the growing impact
of the energy transition and to decreasing volumes of
construction materials. Intermodal transport volumes
helped performance.
◊ ◊ Market leader PKP Cargo was particularly affected by
the declining coal and construction material volumes.
Volume sold decreased significantly, by about 8%.
◊ ◊ DB Cargo Polska managed to increase its volume sold
slightly, and expanded its market share.
◊◊

Deutsche Bahn Group – 2016 Integrated Report

France

Volume sold in France declined significantly, by about
5% in 2016, marking the end of the positive market
trend witnessed over the past two years.
◊ ◊ This development was driven, in particular, by severe
strike action in response to the French government’s
plans to reform the labor market.
◊ ◊ Volume sold by Fret SNCF was slightly down year on
year, although it still defended its leading position in
the market.
◊ ◊ Volume sold by our subsidiary Euro Cargo Rail also
declined, mainly as a result of strikes. Its market position,
however, was also defended.
◊◊

Moderate growth in European land transport

The European land transport market witnessed solid
growth in demand compared to the previous year. Continuing fierce competition and much lower diesel prices by
year-on-year comparison meant that the increased volume
was only partially reflected by revenue growth.
Although some competitors were strongly present in
the market, DB Schenker was able to defend its position in
European land transport, and generated moderate revenue
growth.

Slight growth in air freight

Compared to the previous year, the international air freight
market stagnated in 2016, and only managed to record
slight growth (+2.0%) for the year as a whole when business picked up in the second half of the year. The lack of
growth in the first six months was due to the special effect
of a strike by seaport workers on the West Coast of the USA
in 2015.
In 2016, volumes were driven by perishable goods,
industrial intermediates, chemicals and consumer goods,
with virtually all sectors recording stagnating or declining
development.

94

G R O U P M A N AG E M E N T R E P O RT

The special effect from 2015 resulted in a strong decline on
the transpacific trade route in particular, whereas volumes
increased further between Asia and Europe. A particular
increase was witnessed on the trade route from the Near/
Middle East – Europe.
Transport capacities increased in 2016 following further
deliveries of aircraft and the launch of new flight routes. As
a result, freight rates were below the already low level of
the previous year, but trended upward from September
2016 onward.
DB Schenker increased its air freight volume by 4.5%
year on year.

Slight growth in ocean freight

Demand for global ocean freight increased slightly in 2016,
by 1.3%, driven mainly by raw materials, industrial intermediates, semi-finished products and perishable goods. The
intra-Asia route, which was the strongest in terms of volumes, recorded growth of about 4%, while the Asia – Europe
route grew by about 3%.
Continued overcapacity in the market for container ships
resulted in generally low freight rates. The insolvency of the
Hanjin shipping company resulted in market adjustments
and increased demand for the remaining shipping com­pa­
nies, especially on the transpacific and Far East – Europe
trade routes. Although freight rates recently recovered on
these routes, the effect may only be temporary as the former
Hanjin capacities may well return to the shipping market.
Year on year, DB Schenker increased its ocean freight
volume by 3.3%.

Persisting momentum in contract logistics

The positive performance of the global contract logistics
market also continued in 2016. As before, the dominant
driver remained, above all, the persisting strong trend
toward outsourcing in the key industries (especially electronics, consumer, healthcare and industrials). Growing
e-commerce business requires much more warehousing
capacity than conventional retail and is stimulating the
market for warehousing space, especially in the USA and
China, or the Asia/Pacific region. From a regional perspective, growth rates were high in Asia/Pacific, the Middle
East and Africa. Although growth remained high in China,
it was nevertheless slightly down year on year.
In a fiercely competitive environment, DB Schenker
achieved an increase in revenues of more than 5%.

Non-Group railways

The number of infrastructure customers rose further in the
year under review. No other country in the EU has such a
high level of competition in rail transport as Germany.
Demand for train-paths increased in 2016 as demand in
passenger transport rose. In keeping with the long-term
trend, non-Group customers were able to gain shares in the
market while demand from DB Group customers declined.
The growth rate was higher as a result of special effects,
such as the strikes in 2015, and the additional day of service
due to the leap year.
Growth in local rail passenger transport was partly due
to new transport contracts awarded, including the metro
network in central Germany and the South-West diesel network. Tender wins drove up the share on non-Group railways further.
Volume produced in local rail passenger transport
increased following the commissioning of the GER MAN
­U N I F I C AT I O N T R A N S P O R T P R O J E C T ( V E R K E H R S P R O J E K T E

between Erfurt and
Berlin.
Demand from freight transport declined slightly. Unlike
2015, demand from non-Group customers did not more
than compensate for the decline in demand from DB Group
customers.
The number of station stops in local rail passenger
transport increased overall in the year under review, due
partly to the additional day of service (leap year) and to
higher frequencies in some transport authorities’ regions.
Non-Group railways further increased their share by winning regional tenders.
Real retail revenues in Germany (excluding motor vehicles and gas stations), which are of relevance for DB Netze
Stations, increased by 2.8% in the year under review.

Review of the station pricing system

The BNetzA launched an in-depth investigation into station
fees in February 2016. Its examinations are focusing particularly on whether the level of the cost-oriented fees was
appropriate, based on the costs used to calculate the fees
in the 2014 station price list, and the generated return.
Overhead cost allocations and distinctions between the
costs of regulated and non-regulated areas are also being
analyzed. We expect the procedure to be finalized in 2017.

Investigation of train-path pricing
system concluded

In August 2015 the BNetz A issued a ruling regarding the
train-path pricing system. The audit had focused on the
level of fees charged in 2011. BNetzA conclusively decided
that DB Netz AG had complied with legal regulations, and
therefore saw no cause for objection to the levels of fees.
BNetz A issued orders and published findings related to
its ruling. DB Netz AG has filed formal objection to the
ruling in order to clarify some of BNetz A’s findings that
were disputed in preliminary proceedings. After numerous
hearings, the proceedings were terminated in August
2016. BN etz A confirmed adequate implementation of
the disputed points in its ruling, and in return DB Netz AG
withdrew its objection.

Further development of the train-path
pricing system

In light of changes in fee regulations, DB Netz AG has been
working closely with BN etz A to improve the train-path
pricing system. Customers were also actively involved in
the process of reshaping the system. Following the enactment of the Railway Regulation Act (Eisenbahnregulie­
rungsgesetzes; ERegG) in September 2016, the fee policies
and list of fees under the new pricing system were submitted for approval to the regulatory authorities in October
2016. They are scheduled for implementation at the next
possible timetable change (December 2017).

Civil proceedings on infrastructure usage fees

According to a ruling by the Federal Court of Justice (Bun­
desgerichtshof; BGH) from 2011, fees for the use of railway
infrastructure can be reviewed for fairness under prevailing
legislation by the civil courts according to the standard set
out in Section 315 of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches
Gesetzbuch; BGB), even if BNetzA has not objected to the
fees and they are effective according to regulatory law.
In this connection, a large number of legal disputes are
currently pending before the civil courts between DB Netz
AG and DB Station&Service AG (DB S&S AG) on the one
hand and train operating companies and/or transport
authorities or Federal states on the other. The subject of
the proceedings is the review of fairness of the usage fees.
Some claims are also being asserted under antitrust law.
The majority of these legal disputes relate to fees that were
charged by DB Netz AG as regional factors or by DB S&S AG
in accordance with the 2005 station pricing system.
In September 2015, the Regional Court of Berlin suspended an ongoing civil action and appealed to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to issue a preliminary ruling on
the applicability of fairness reviews under civil law. In addition, the German Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht; BVerfG) admitted several constitutional
complaints filed by DB Netz AG and DB S&S AG contesting
the BGH’s refusal in 2012 to admit appeals against rulings
by various Higher Regional Courts. The BVerfG ruled that
these decisions infringed the rights of both companies to
be heard in court, and referred the matter back to the BGH.
The BGH has also asked the ECJ for a preliminary ruling in
an action investigating the fairness of station fees. Virtually
all proceedings in this matter before the regional and
higher regional courts have been suspended pending a
decision by the ECJ.

96

G R O U P M A N AG E M E N T R E P O RT

The decisions by the BVerfG and BGH, and the referrals to
the ECJ, are important steps toward clarifying whether the
civil courts may apply the provisions of Section 315 BGB
alongside the regulations under railway law, as has been
assumed so far in most of the proceedings. A hearing
relating to the proceedings for preliminary ruling by the ECJ
took place in July 2016. The Advocate General published its
opinions on November 24, 2016. Experience has shown that
the ECJ’s ruling can be expected about six months after the
opinions of the Advocate General, which are not binding
for the court.
The ERegG, which came into force in September 2016,
increases future legal certainty enormously now that it has
introduced a procedure for approval of train-path and station fees by BNetz A . In future, parallel investigation of
legally approved fees by civil courts based on actions
brought under Section 315 BGB is excluded by law.

Lawsuit by the Federal state of Saxony-Anhalt

In the year under review, the Federal state of Saxony-Anhalt filed a lawsuit against DB Netz AG, DB Regio AG and
DB AG claiming compensation for cartel damages due to
allegedly illegal train-path pricing by DB Netz AG through
the levying of regional factors between 2005 and 2011. The
lawsuit was extended to include action demanding the confirmation of corresponding claims against DB Regio AG for
2003 and 2004. DB Group is defending itself against the
lawsuit. For its part, DB Regio AG is suing the Federal state
of Saxony-Anhalt for reimbursement of outstanding transport contract-related receivables relating to increased
infrastructure utilization costs between 2008 and 2014. The
state has offset its alleged claims for compensation under
antitrust law for 2003 and 2004 against the receivables
owing to DB Regio AG . We expect court rulings in the
course of 2017, at the earliest.

Field trial with megatrucks
in regular operation

The Federal Government’s field trial will be converted to
regular operation, starting on January 1, 2017. DB Group
cannot, nor does it want to, ignore innovations, even if
they relate to road freight traffic. But the Group places
importance on the specific implementation of these innovations avoiding additional competitive disadvantages

Contract violation proceedings of the
European Commission continued

At the end of October 2014, the European Commission filed
proceedings before the ECJ against the Federal Republic of
Germany on grounds of alleged non-compliance with EU
regulations governing financial transparency in the railway

ongoing since 2012, the Federal Government has already
refuted the accusations of the European Commission
several times, and provided detailed information about
the financial relationships within DB Group. The Advocate
General published its opinions at the end of May 2016.
The European Court of Justice is expected to announce

The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has
extensively investigated potential conflicts relating to the
Northern Rail contract. The investigation analyzed the
other services offered by DB Arriva in Northern England
that were not associated with the contract. In the course
of its investigation, the CMA studied 1,235 passenger flows.
In 99.8% of all cases, no conflicts were identified. DB Arriva

Regionalization funds increased

The Federal Republic of Germany increased the regionalization funds which the Federal states in particular use to
finance local rail passenger transport services to € 8.2 billion in total for 2016. Of this amount, € 8 billion were distributed among all Federal states in line with what is known
as the Kiel allocation formula. A further € 199 million were
allocated among the Federal states in Eastern Germany,
and € 1 million to the state of Saarland. The regionalization
funds are scheduled to increase by 1.8% every year from
2017 until 2031. The Federal states and public transport
authorities are now charged with investing the available
funds effectively in local rail passenger transport, as envisaged by legislators. The railways and passengers who use
the local rail passenger transport services believe the available funds should first be used to order more transport
services. Once these options are exhausted, the funds
should go toward improving quality in local rail passenger
transport Β , for example, by providing WiFi in trains Δ ,
modernizing the fleet and expanding safety and service.

The Danish Department for Transport and Building has
begun the planning phase for deregulating passenger
railway services in Denmark. In 2016, the Danish Department for Transport and Building started the process for
tendering regional rail services in Jutland and Funen for
2017/18.

for rail freight transport wherever possible. Accordingly,
DB Schen­­ker took part in the field trial with just four vehicles on a few selected routes in Germany. These routes
continue to be used for transporting time-critical general
cargo shipments that customers believe are not suitable
for rail transport anyway. There is therefore no danger of
a shift from rail to road transport.
There are currently no specific plans to expand the
megatruck fleet.

Deutsche Bahn Group – 2016 Integrated Report

Higher EEG surcharge

The Renewable Energy Sources Act (Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz; EEG) of 2014 stipulates an EEG levy on railways for traction current amounting to 20% of the full EEG
surcharge as part of the “special equalization scheme.” In
2016, the EEG surcharge increased by 0.18 cents/kWh to
6.354 cents/kWh. This resulted in an increase of the EEG
rate for traction current to 1.271 cents/kWh. For DB Group
this led overall to an additional burden in the single-digit
million range.

Railway Regulation Act comes into force

The Act to strengthen competition in the railway sector,
which implemented Directive 2012/34/EU (recast) into
German law, was approved by the two houses of the
German parliament (Bundestag and Bundesrat) at the
beginning of July 2016 and came into force at the beginning
of September 2016. Its main component is the Railway Regulation Act. In addition, amendments were made to other
laws, including the General Railways Act.
In some places, the law extends far beyond the recast
specifications. All in all, it results in a considerable tightening of the regulatory framework. For example, the fee
regulation provisions have been tightened and the competences of BNetzA considerably extended. At the same time,
the newly adopted fee approval procedure enhances legal
certainty.

Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 2030

The German Federal Cabinet approved the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan (Bundesverkehrswegeplan; BVWP)
2030 Ε on August 3, 2016. Following consultations in the
Bundestag (Lower House of Parliament) and final approval
in the Bundesrat, the relevant additional legislation was
successfully passed on December 16, 2016. Key measures
that DB Group has submitted to the new BVWP with the
target network for 2030 were adopted.
BVWP 2030 contains important projects for further
developing the rail network. Top priority, for example, is
given to the expansion of the five major hubs (Frankfurt,
Hamburg, Cologne, Mannheim and Munich) and to the East
corridor, which is so crucial for freight transport. Moreover,
the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure
(Bundesministerium für Verkehr und digitale Infrastruktur;
BMVI) has commenced its evaluations of a continuous network for trains measuring 740 m in length, which would
make a material contribution to improving the performance
of the rail network and to reducing the production costs in
rail freight transport.

Follow-on regulation governing equalization
payments for level crossings

The equalization payments made by the Federal Government for level crossings offset 50% of the costs incurred for
operating and maintaining the crossings used by both rail
and road vehicles. The payments will run until the end of
2017 on the legal basis of European (EEC) regulation
1192/69, which has been in force since 1969. Following the
consolidation of existing European Union legislation as
part of the fourth railway package, appropriate regulations
governing continuation of the payments are necessary and
are being developed by the BMVI.

New Bus Services Bill in Great Britain

The new Bus Services Bill in Great Britain has been postponed, although the government did stress its expectations that the Bill would come into force at the beginning
of May 2017. The Bill governs new bus service options
for local authorities and mayors, including a new approach
to franchising. DB Arriva is involved in the process and
believes that efficient partnerships are the most viable
approach for the future, rather than strict franchise
systems.

Energy and Climate Fund to encourage
energy efficiency in rail transport

The Federal Government’s draft funding guidelines for
strengthening electric rail transport envisage sponsorship
of electric transport performance for the period from 2016
through 2020.
Only train operating companies are eligible to apply for
funding. The payments are to be made from the Energy and
Climate Fund (Energie- und Klimafonds; EKF) if the relevant train operating company can prove the heightened
energy efficiency of electric transport performance. Payment is effected retroactively, which means the transport
companies must document their electric transport performance provided in Germany and the energy efficiency
achieved in the previous year in the spring of the following
year. The funds available amount to as much as € 100 ­million
each year.

B usiness and ov era l l conditions

The draft law banning the operation of loud freight cars,
which the Federal Cabinet adopted on December 21, 2016,
envisages a complete ban on the use of loud freight cars
starting with the 2020/2021 working timetable. In addition,
the draft law provides for certain exceptions and exemptions: for example, the use of loud cars by infrastructure
operators, based on case-by-case examination. This requires
that, by specifying a reduced speed, the noise emitted by
a train with loud freight cars is not louder than that emitted
by a train with refitted cars.

Fourth railway package has come into force

The EU Commission presented its recommendations on the
fourth railway package on January 30, 2013. The package
includes a political part containing recommendations on
the liberalization of national rail passenger transport markets and on further separation of the railway infrastructure,
along with a technical part, consisting of proposals on the
technical interoperability and safety of the European rail
system.
The EU’s legislative bodies agreed on the political part
in April 2016. Practical solutions have been found that will
help to further strengthen the independence of infrastructure operators, further improve the transparency of financial flows, and sensibly extend regulation. As such, European Union legislation remains open to differing railway
structure models. Integrated railway structure models that
can generate efficiency, cost and cooperation advantages
are still explicitly allowed in future.
The fourth railway package also constitutes a step
toward further opening the markets for rail passenger
transport in Europe. Starting in December 2020, transport
services operated on a purely commercial basis will have
a fundamental right of access to the infrastructure. Access
can be restricted if the economic equilibrium of public
service routes running in parallel is in jeopardy. When
awarding public service routes, public transport authorities
may still choose between awarding contracts directly or
putting them out to competitive tender. The requirements
for direct awards will become stricter from December
2023 onward. They will only be permissible if the public
transport authority deems them justifiable in light of the

structure of the market and the rail network, and if the
direct award guarantees improved quality and/or cost
efficiency compared to the previous transport contract.
Contracts that have already been directly awarded remain
valid until their regular expiry date.
The political part of the fourth railway package came
into force following publication in the EU federal gazette
on December 23, 2016. The technical part with regulations
on eliminating market entry hurdles and improving
rail’s ability to compete intermodally came into force on
June 15, 2016.

Change in employment conditions in France

In 2014, the French act governing rail reform stipulated the
standardization of employment conditions for the entire
rail transport sector by the end of June 2016. The model is
divided into three stages, and builds on a base decree published by the government on June 9, 2016, which focuses
mainly on regulating work hours. It is supplemented by a
sectoral collective wage agreement and company wage
agreements. Specifying employment conditions at levels
close to those in place at SNCF constitutes a considerable
burden, especially on the competitive ability of rail freight
transport.

To optimize perception of the price-performance ratio of
our offers, specific measures aimed at increasing quality Β
and broadening the scope of services were implemented,
together with certain pricing measures and measures aimed
at altering customer perception.
Customers’ views of the price-performance ratio are collected through customer satisfaction surveys in many business units. Views are rated on a scale from 1 (very satisfied)
to 6 (very dissatisfied), except for DB Cargo, which uses a

Survey every two years.

The development in our customers’ satisfaction with the
price-performance ratio offered was largely positive in the
year under review, with marked improvements at DB Long-­
­Distance, in particular.

≈≈ Punctuality above previous yearʼs level
¿ Punctuality [%]

Survey every two years.

Regular measurement of customer satisfaction Β is very
important to us. The data is gathered in each case by independent market research institutes. Customer satisfaction in
freight transport and logistics is measured every two years.
In the year under review, customer satisfaction im­proved
tangibly, especially in DB LONG -DISTANCE [ PAGE 1 37 ] . Overall,
however, customer satisfaction among passengers deteriorated slightly in the year under review in spite of improved
punctuality data. This is the result of developments at DB

Change in method, figures for 2015 retroactively adjusted.

To measure punctuality Α , we compare the target time to
the actual time for every train trip. We summarize the arrival
of punctual trains and trains with a delay of up to a specified
time period in the degree of punctuality.
During the year under
review, we were able to sigPLANSTART IS WORKING
nificantly improve PUNCTUALIT Y AT DB LONG -DISTANCE
[ PAG E 1 3 7 ] ,

registering the
larg­­est increase since 2011.
Overall, the average figure
for the punctuality of DB
Group (rail) in Germany
improved significantly, as
did the punctuality of passenger trains in Germany.
The increases are due to
the consistently improved
punctuality data at DB Long-­
­Distance, DB Regional, and
DB Cargo.

Of all delayed departures, 60 % originate
at the ten most heavily frequent­­­ed stations in Germany and impact the entire
network. By using hub coordinators,
we want to ensure that 90 % of the long­­
distance trains leaving from these stations depart on schedule by 2018. The
teams working on the PlanStart project
are responsible for trains departing on
schedule and are striving to optimize the
process from making trains available
to delegating employees and assigning
platforms, right up to the departure
signal. In the year under review, we man­­
aged to improve departure punctuality
at these ten main railway stations by
15.8 % on average.

Deutsche Bahn Group – 2016 Integrated Report

G R O U P M A N AG E M E N T R E P O RT

The marked improvement shows the effect of the measures
developed and implemented in R AILWAY OF THE FUTURE
.
These include the hub coordinators increasing the punctuality of departures of long-distance trains at our most heavily
frequented starting stations in our PLANSTART [ PAGE 1 4 F.]
project, and significantly reducing drive and brake malfunctions in the ICE fleet. In addition, improved construction site
management enabled us to successfully cushion the impacts
of the increased construction volume on punctuality.
Punctuality performance is therefore consistent with

In addition to customer satisfaction and punctuality, image
is a further key indicator for us. The image of DB Group is
measured using the Corporate Reputation Index (CRI) and
is ascertained by an independent market research institute.
The measurement method was changed slightly, starting
from the year under review. The CRI value continued its
slightly declining trend. Even on a comparable basis (using
the former method), Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
still scores less year on year, at 51.

≈≈ Various measure to improve

During the year under review, we implemented or initiated
a large number of measures aimed at improving customer
sat­­isfaction and quality Β , taking particular advantage of
the opportunities offered by digitalization Δ . Many of
these mea­­sures are bundled in R AILWAY OF THE FUTURE

We have devised five points to counter the growing num­
­ber of attacks on our staff in trains and stations, which
we started putting in place in the year under review and
are gradually extending:
≈ ≈ safety-relevant staff training,
≈ ≈ procurement of better equipment,
≈ ≈ technical support,
≈ ≈ visible patrols by teams of three accompanied by
guard dogs, and
≈ ≈ recruitment of a further 500 security forces.
We continued to expand our video surveillance in stations
in the year under review:
≈ ≈ Implementation of the recording function on exist­
­ing video technology in 100 stations in Berlin. Since
May 2016, recordings from around 800 video cameras
are being stored and made available to the Federal
police, if necessary.
≈ ≈ New video surveillance and recording systems were
put into service at the central stations in Bremen,
Cologne and Nuremberg. The recordings are inspect­
­­ed in the station control centers and forwarded to
the Federal police.
A total of 60 specially trained Federal police officers
patrolled together with DB security forces during the
2016 European Football Championship to prevent conflicts and crimes.
Together with the security authorities, we are investigating new technologies for assuring the safety of our
customers and employees. Preparations commenced to
test software solutions for supporting the security areas
and authorities at Berlin Südkreuz station.
Together with the Federal police, DB Group launched
an information campaign to raise awareness among rail
customers and thus reduce handbag and luggage theft.

Revenue development in all regions outside of Germany was
negative, mainly due to exchange rate effects.
◊ ◊ In Germany revenues increased, due particularly to growth
in the infrastructure business units and at DB LongDistance. Performance-related decreases in revenues
at DB Regional and DB Cargo had a negative effect.
◊ ◊ Revenue development in Europe (excluding Germany)
was virtually stable. Negative exchange rate effects and
the operating development at DB Cargo were almost
entirely offset by the positive operating development at
DB Arriva.
◊ ◊ Revenues in the Asia/Pacific region were mainly im­pacted
by negative exchange rate effects. Adjusted for exchange
rates, revenues primarily increased due to performance
in India, Indonesia and the Philippines.
◊ ◊ Performance in North America was mainly influenced
by negative exchange rate effects and a weak operating
development in the USA and Canada.

Positive income development

Transition to adjusted profit calculation

Special issues are eliminated in the adjusted statement
of income – the transition to the adjusted statement of
income is a two-step process. The first step comprises
standard reclassifications, with the figures then being
adjusted for individual special items.
◊ ◊ The reclassifications essentially relate to two issues. The
first issue is the reclassification of net interest income
components not related to net financial debt and pension
provisions: predominantly the compounding and dis­
counting effects of non-current provisions (excluding pen­
­sion obligations) and non-current liabilities (excluding
financial debt). The non-operational character of these
components can be seen in the fact that their influence
on net interest income very much depends on their given
interest rates as of the balance sheet date.
	 The second significant reclassification relates to the
amortization of intangible assets capitalized in the course
of purchase price allocations (PPA) of acquisitions con­
ducted during the assessment of long-term customer con­
­tracts. The existing transport contracts are an essential
component in the purchase price valuation in passenger
transport in particular. In order to ensure the operating
assessment and to prevent these contracts from being
treated differently to other contracts, these amortization
components are eliminated from operating profit. The
sum reclassified in the year under review relates almost
entirely to the acquisition of Arriva.
◊ ◊ ADJUSTMENTS FOR SPECIAL ITEMS [ PAGE 108 ] involve issues
which are extraordinary based on their reason and/or
the amount and which would have a significant negative
effect on operating development over time. Regardless
of their amounts, book profits and losses from transac­
tions with subsidiaries/financial assets are adjusted.
Individual items are adjusted if they are extraordinary
in character, can be accounted for and assessed pre­
cisely, and are significant in volume.
The following presentation of income development describes
the changes in the key statement of income items, adjusted
for special items. The effects from the changes in the scope
of consolidation and exchange rate effects are presented
in the following table and are not explained further in the
following section.
In the year under review, changes in the scope of con­
solidation increased income and expenses overall, while
exchange rate effects had the opposite effect of reducing
income and expenses overall.

Positive development of operating profit figures

The REVENUE DEVELOPMENT [ PAGE 105 F.] from operations was
slightly positive in the year under review.
◊ ◊ Other operating income decreased, mainly due to lower
damage compensation payments at DB Regional and the
elimination of one-off effects at DB Netze Track. Income
from locomotive sales at DB Cargo had the opposite
effect.

Cost of materials in operations declined slightly, mainly
as a result of a reduced volume of purchased services at
DB Schenker in the wake of lower freight rates.
◊ ◊ Personnel expenses were considerably higher, mainly as
a result of collective wage bargaining agreements and
following the commencement of operations of Northern
Rail.

G R O U P M A N AG E M E N T R E P O RT

Other operating expenses in operations increased sig­
nificantly, partly due to transport services newly acquired
by DB Arriva in Great Britain. At DB Schenker service
costs and rents increased.
On balance, the slightly higher operating profits and overall
lower expenses led to a slight increase in adjusted EBITDA.
Depreciation decreased significantly, mainly as a result
of the impairment charge recognized at DB Cargo in the
previous year. The development was also influenced by the
fact that some vehicles reached the end of their useful life
for accounting purposes while the delivery of new vehicles
was delayed in some cases. The addition of new vehicles
had the opposite effect.
Accordingly the development of adjusted EBIT was also
positive. The development of adjusted EBIT FOR THE BUSINESS
UNITS [ PAGE 1 32 FF.] was varied. Year-on-year, the operating
result generated by DB Cargo improved, but was still neg­
ative. Positive development was recorded at DB Long-Dis­
tance, DB Arriva, DB Schenker and particularly DB Netze
Energy. Developments at DB Regional and DB Netze Sta­
tions had a primarily dampening effect.

The development of operating profit after interest was also
significantly positive. Net operating interest im­­proved,
mainly as a result of low interest rate levels.
The development of the other financial result was pri­
marily attributable to hedging transactions and to the com­
pounding of provisions.
Since the increase in the extraordinary result significantly
exceeded this development, profit before taxes increased
even more strongly.

In the year under review, the extraordinary result in­­
cluded the following special items:

In 2015, the extraordinary result included the following spe­
cial items:
◊ ◊ Effects related to the restructuring of the Group (€ 1.7 bil­
lion), mainly resulting from impairments at DB Cargo
(€ 1.3 billion). They were joined by restructuring expenses
in the railway in Germany, as well as DB Schenkerʼs and
DB Cargoʼs activities outside Germany.
◊ ◊ Effects of impairments and the accrual of provisions
relating to the superstructure (decommissioning over­
head line systems on disused routes) at DB Netze Track.

The marked improvement in profit before taxes was ampli­
fied by developments in the income tax position, mainly
influenced by higher deferred taxes at DB AG following
changes in profit expectations of DB Group. Accordingly, net
profit for the year (profit after taxes) increased even more
significantly.
The development of profit (after taxes on income) for
DB AG shareholders was also positive in the year under
review. Net profit attributable to minority interests also rose.

DB Regional was weaker than expected due to income
declining to a greater degree than expenses.
The anticipated profit target at DB Netze Track was just

The creditworthiness of DB Group is constantly monitored
and assessed by the rating agencies S&P Global Ratings
(S&P) and Moody’s. Credit ratings provide an independent,
up-to-date assessment of a companyʼs creditworthiness.
When calculating ratings for DB AG, the ownership structure
means that the rating agencies take into account not only
the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the company,
but also an assessment of the relationship to our owner, the
Federal Government, and the potential support that DB AG
could receive from the Federal Government. This means
that the ratings given to the Federal Government are also
significant for the ratings given to DB AG.
There was a change to S&Pʼs assessments of DB AG
during the year under review. S&P adjusted DB AGʼs longterm rating from “AA” to “AA–,” among other things because
of persistently weak profit development, and simultane­
ously raised the rating outlook from “negative” to “stable.”
The short-term rating assessments remained unchanged.
Moody’s confirmed both its ratings assessments and its
outlook.

◊ ◊ A five-year € 300 million zero coupon bond yielding
– 0.006% for investors. This was the first euro corporate
bond that we issued with a negative yield.
◊ ◊ An HKD 350 million private placement among institu­

In the context of our value management, we want to main­
tain, increase and guarantee DB Groupʼs enterprise value over
the long term so that we can finance capital expenditures in
our core business. The financial management of DB Group
and therefore also the monitoring of the success of our tar­
gets for profitable growth is performed on the basis of a
value-oriented management system based on key figures.

The results are an important factor for our strategic approach,
capital expenditures decisions, as well as employee and
management remuneration.
Our value management approach is based on profit­
ability and creditworthiness:
◊ ◊ Profitability: profitability as an overriding target in value
management ensures that investors receive a reason­
able long-term rate of return over several economic cy­­
cles. We calculate the weighted average cost of capital
(WACC) of debt and equity capital on an annual basis
using market values. The actual return, ROCE, is calcu­
lated as the ratio of operating profit before interest and
taxes (EBIT adjusted) to capital employed. The ROCE
target is set higher than the cost of capital. The longterm aim is to keep the multi-year average ROCE above
the target, thereby covering the cost of capital. This
ROCE target corresponds to the minimum required rate
of return (MRR). The different business characteristics
result in different target values for our activities in pas­
senger transport, in logistics and in rail freight trans­
port as well as in infrastructure. The cost of capital and
thus the expected returns from the infrastructure busi­
ness units are lower compared to passenger transport,
logistics and rail freight transport, due to our projection
of continually low profit volatility. The operating business
is always controlled before taxes; accordingly the report­
­ing of key figures is based mainly on pre-tax figures.
◊ ◊ Creditworthiness: For our capital-intensive business, it
is essential that we have permanent access to the cap­
ital market at favorable terms and conditions. Conse­
quently, an additional material target of value manage­
ment is achieving appropriate key debt ratios from the
standpoint of our debt investors. The key figures for
controlling indebtedness are redemption coverage
(ratio of adjusted operating cash flow after taxes to the
adjusted net financial debt), gearing (ratio of net finan­
cial debt to equity), and the ratio of net financial debt
to adjusted EBITDA . The target values for the key debt
ratios are derived from key rating figures as well as
annual benchmarking with comparable companies with
an excellent credit rating.

Capital employed

The capital employed equates to the assets deemed neces­
sary for business and subject to the cost of capital as derived
from the balance sheet. Reasons for the decrease in capital
employed include the reduced portfolio of property, plant
and equipment, and intangible assets, as well as higher
trade liabilities and deferred income. The increase in receiv­
ables and other assets, in particular, had a dampening effect.

112

The cost of capital is updated annually in order to account
for changes in market parameters. We take the long-term
focus of the controlling concept into consideration and bal­
ance out short-term fluctuations.
In the year under review, DB Group recorded a decline
in the cost of capital, both before and after taxes.

We calculate DB Groupʼs cost of capital as a weighted
average interest rate of equity, net financial debt and pen­
sion obligations. This is determined once a year and reflects
current capital market parameters, the prevailing tax frame­
­work and the value share of financing types used to finance
capital employed.
When determining the company-independent capital
market parameters, market risk premium and risk-free inter­
­est rates, short-term debt and equity market return fluctu­
ations are smoothed out in line with the long-term focus of
our value management concept. The parameters are deter­
mined on the basis of the yields of long-term German Fed­
eral bonds (bunds) as well as the long-term average inter­
­est rates of the German DAX 30 share index. The parameters
used are also validated on the basis of up-to-date recom­
mendations given by well-known valuation experts. The
company-independent capital market parameters, beta and
credit spread, measure the risk of our debt and equity financ­
­ing in comparison to alternative investment vehicles. Beta
reflects the risk of equity relative to the risks of the equity
markets. Comparisons are performed against international
benchmark companies. The selection of peer group compa­
nies and their aggregation to beta follows the business unit
structure of DB Group. The credit spread matches DB Groupʼs
current issue costs relative to bunds with an imputed term

of ten years. For transport and logistics, the credit spread
is determined in line with the market, using current capital
market data of companies with comparable creditworthiness.
Tax factors are calculated using a taxation rate of 30.5%.
The tax factor for net financial debt reflects the German
trade tax on attributable financing costs. Remaining taxes
are fully assigned to cost of equity. The weighting of financing
types is based on market values. Net financial debt and
pension obligations are valued at their carrying amounts.
Equity weighting is based on recognized methods of busi­
ness valuation.
The weighting of financing types for passenger trans­
port, freight transport and logistics as well as infrastructure
corresponds to that of DB Group as the tax shield resulting
from the tax-deductible status of debt interest arises, as a
rule, from DB Group being a consolidated tax group.

Net change in cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents as of Dec 31

Cash flow from operating activities mainly rose as a result
of the positive development of profit before taxes, de­­
preciation and interest (€ +158 million), and positive
working capital effects.
◊ ◊ The cash outflow from investing activities decreased
significantly, mainly due to much lower payments for net
capital expenditures (€ +1,122 million). This item was par­
­ticularly affected by higher cash inflows from investment
grants (€ +712 million) related to the LUFV II [ PAGE 2 49 ] ,
coupled with lower cash outflows for gross capital ex­­
penditures (€ + 410 million). Payments for the repayment
of investment grants also decreased (€ +134 million).
◊ ◊ Cash flow from financing activities decreased signifi­
cantly in the year under review. This resulted in part from
lower net cash inflow from ISSUING AND REDEEMING BONDS
[ PAGE 111 ] (€ –1,200 million), caused by a higher volume
of cash used to redeem bonds (€ – 842 million), while at
the same time declining issuance activity resulted in
lower cash inflow (€ –358 million).
	
The net cash outflow (€ – 545 million) from borrowing
and repaying loans also had an impact in the year under
review. Compared to the previous year, this item was
influenced, in particular, by the repayment of European
Investment Bank loans (€ – 400 million).
	 The dividend payment for the 2015 financial year
also resulted in higher cash outflow in the year under
review compared to the previous year (€ –150 million).

were down slightly compared with the end of the pre­
vious year.

Financial debt was influenced by the decline in interest-­
free loans following repayments.
Finance lease liabilities increased as of December 31, 2016,
in the wake of contractual adjustments for six rental
properties. Ongoing repayments had a dampening effect.
Other financial debt was significantly shaped by the
development of the bond portfolio. In the year under
review, BONDS [ PAGE 111 ] were issued with a total volume
of € 2.1 billion and redeemed with a value of € 1.5 billion.
In addition, the bond portfolio decreased as of Decem­
­ber 31, 2016, due to exchange rate effects (€ – 0.2 bil­
lion). The DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRITISH POUND [ PAGE 90 ] ,
in particular, resulted in lower debt.
Since our foreign currency-denominated bonds are with
very few exceptions hedged against currency fluctua­
tions by corresponding derivatives, exchange rate effects
are offset by the corresponding opposite position of the
hedge. The effects from currency hedges relating to the
hedged exchange rate at the time of issuance were on
a par with the previous year’s level.
The level of financial debt was virtually identical year-on-­
­year. The increase caused by the bigger bond portfolio
and the increased finance lease liabilities were offset
almost in their entirety, above all, by a smaller portfolio
of borrowings following repayments.

The maturity structure of the financial debt changed only
slightly as of December 31, 2016.

The increase in gross capital expenditures was mainly due
to noticeably higher investment grants, which accounted
for about 65% of all gross capital expenditures in the year
under review (previous year: about 59%).
Net capital expenditures were significantly below the
previous yearʼs level, mostly due to higher investment grants
for infrastructure.

Capital expenditures activities focus mainly on the business
units of the railway in Germany, particularly on measures
designed to assure high performance and efficiency in track
infrastructure. Overall, the business units of the railway in
Germany accounted for a slightly higher share of gross cap­
ital expenditures. Lower capital expenditures on vehicles
compared to the high level of the previous year were offset
by higher capital expenditures on infrastructure.
Among others, the share of gross capital expenditures
attributable to DB Arriva for procuring vehicles to service
newly acquired transport contracts increased slightly.

Broken down by regions, the focus of gross capital expendi­
­tures remained on Germany, where the increase was mainly
due to higher infrastructure capital expenditures at DB Netze
Track (€ + 403 million). In addition, adjustments to rental
contracts, which are recognized as finance leases in other
items, had the effect of raising the capital expenditures
figure (€ +248 million) in Other. On the other hand, capital
expenditures decreased at DB Long-Distance (€ –257 million)
and DB Regional (€ –188 million), mainly because vehicle
procurement projects came to an end.
Following the conclusion of extensive vehicle projects in
2015 at DB Cargo in Great Britain (€ –205 million) and Poland
(€ –25 million), capital expenditures in Europe (excluding
Germany) declined. The increase in vehicle procurements
at DB Arriva (€ + 83 million), especially in Great Britain and
the Netherlands, had the opposite effect.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accor­
­dance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). There were no material changes to IFRS regulations
for DB Group’s consolidation and accounting principles that
would result in any changes to the consolidated financial
statements.
◊ ◊ The balance sheet total increased slightly as of Decem­
­ber 31, 2016.
◊ ◊ Non-current assets were slightly above the level at the
end of the previous year as of December 31, 2016. This
was mainly due to the increase in non-current receiv­
ables and other assets (€ + 452 million), partly following
DB Arriva’s acquisition of transport contracts in Great
Britain. Receivables relating to deferred tax assets
(€ +176 million) increased in the wake of revised profit
expectations of DB Group, which also had an impact. By
contrast, property, plant and equipment decreased
(€ –175 million). This was partly due to lower net capital
expenditures at DB Netze Track in the wake of the LUFV II
[ PAGE 2 49 ] . Vehicle acquisitions and capital expenditures
related to the facilities infrastructure at DB Long-Dis­
tance had a dampening effect.
◊ ◊ The increase in currents assets as of December 31, 2016,
was mainly driven by higher current other receivables
and assets (€ +274 million). Here particularly DB Arrivaʼs
launch of new transport services in Great Britain had an
impact again. By contrast, cash and cash equivalents
declined (€ – 99 million).
In structural terms, this did not produce any change on the
asset side.

118

On the equity and liabilities side of the balance sheet,
equity decreased significantly as of December 31, 2016. This
was mainly due to the decline in reserves related to the re­­
­­valuation of pensions (€ –714 million) based on lower inter­
­est rates, the dividend payment to the Federal Government
(€ – 850 million), and the changes in reserves related to
ex­­change-rate volatilities (€ – 50 million). The positive net
profit for the year (€ +716 million) had a compensating effect,
as did the changes recognized in reserves in connection with
volatilities of hedging transactions (€ +228 million), espe­
cially for hedging energy prices.
In the face of a higher balance sheet total but lower
equity, the equity ratio decreased further.
◊ ◊ Non-current liabilities increased as of December 31,
2016. This development was driven mainly by the reval­
uation of pension obligations (€ + 822 million), espe­
cially in Germany, and by the increase in NON- CURRENT
FINANCIAL DEBT [ PAGE 116 ] (€ +289 million). The decline in
non-current other provisions (€ –235 million) following
reclassification of the retirement obligations relating to
the NECK ARWESTHEIM COMMUNAL POWER PLANT [ PAGE 161 ]
to current provisions, due to their potentially becoming
payable in the short term, had the opposite effect. The
decline in non-current derivative financial instruments
(€ –168 million) also had a compensating effect.
◊ ◊ Current liabilities increased as of December 31, 2016,
mainly as a result of higher trade liabilities (€ + 421 mil­
lion) caused primarily by reporting date effects at DB
Arriva and DB Schenker. In addition, current other pro­
visions (€ +258 million) were also higher compared to
the level at the end of the previous year due to the
reclassification of long-term retirement obligations.
This was partly offset by a decrease in current financial
debt (€ –236 million), mainly following the elimination
of the European Investment Bank loans, which became
due in the year under review.
Within the structure of the equity and liabilities side of the
balance sheet, the ratio of non-current and current liabili­
ties to the balance sheet total increased slightly as of De­­
cember 31, 2016.

G R O U P P E R FO R M A N C E – ECO N O M I C D I M E N S I O N

In addition to the assets shown in the consolidated balance
sheet, DB Group also uses off-balance-sheet financial instru­
­ments and assets that cannot be recognized in the balance
sheet.
The off-balance-sheet financial instruments are pri­
marily leased or rented goods (operating leases). For oper­
ating leases the value management system calculates a
present value. This amounted to € 5,002 million as of De­­
cem­­ber 31, 2016 (as of December 31, 2015: € 4,208 million).
DB Arriva enters into operating lease contracts, in some
cases due to regulatory requirements, especially in con­
junction with providing vehicles for rail passenger and road
passenger transport. In the year under review, the Northern
Rail tender, which DB Arriva won in 2015, resulted in a signi­
­ficant increase in the present value of the operating leases.
In addition, we used factoring to sell minor volumes of
receivables (as of December 31, 2016: € 446 million; as of
December 31, 2015: € 192 million).
With regard to the company pension schemes for em­­
ployees, the obligations are to some extent covered and
netted by and against plan assets which are capable of
being netted, in line with the respective rules. As of Decem­
­ber 31, 2016, total obligations amounted to € 10,957 million
(as of December 31, 2015: € 8,139 million), and the fair
value of plan assets was € 5,023 million (as of December 31,
2015: € 3,941 million). Balancing the obligations against the
plan assets reduced the balance sheet total. The net obli­
gation recognized on the balance sheet was € 4,510 million
(as of December 31, 2015: € 3,688 million). In the year under
review, no larger endowments were made that would have
had a significant impact on the financial position. Accord­
ingly, no significant future effects are to be expected in this
respect.

Our forecast for capital expenditures in the 2016 financial
year was not met. In particular, capital expenditures with
regard to vehicles for DB Regional and DB Arriva were not
as high as expected, resulting in lower gross and net capital
expenditures than forecast.
With respect to DB Groupʼs financial position, our fore­
cast for maturities corresponds with actual developments
in the year under review. The bond issues needed to cover
our fund requirements were much lower than expected. We
had anticipated using the low interest rates, possibly
opportunistically, to cover repayments already in 2016 that
were actually due in 2017. The actual development thus
deviates from our forecast.
The same applies for our cash and cash equivalents and
net financial debt as of year-end 2016. Cash and cash equiv­
alents were much higher and net financial debt much lower
than expected. This was mainly due to lower net capital
expenditures and less utilization of provisions. Other working
capital effects also had a positive impact. As regards net
financial debt, the development was also helped by positive
exchange rate effects relating to foreign currency bonds
issued in British pounds that were not hedged.

≈≈ Strategic workforce planning
ensures staffing needs are met
For several years, the demographic trend, combined with a
mixed order situation, has presented us with a number of
internal and external HR policy challenges. DB Group’s HR
management works proactively to ensure that staffing
needs are covered.
As part of our strategic HR 2020 program on strategic
workforce planning, we set the goal of using future-oriented planning tools and reports to identify short-term,
medium-term and long-term actions that need to be taken
in all business units and occupational groups. Countermeasures are being developed in cooperation with centralized
and decentralized personnel areas. An important central
function is the Group job market, which enables us to
ensure efficient deployment of personnel within the Group
job market and to control employment incentives.
With our strategic workforce planning (SWP) program,
we have created a firmly established strategic tool for
dealing with the aforementioned HR policy challenges that
gives us a standardized, systematic way of looking ten years
into the future to foresee staffing shortfalls and surpluses.
At the same time, we can analyze the effects of medium-­
term and long-term trends, such as demographic trends
and the resulting risks, and examine various options for
addressing them. This allows us to clearly see the impact
of strategic decisions and to evaluate the effectiveness of
long-term measures.
Our newly developed “SWP Speedboat” provides a quick
overview of the entire business unit, thereby enhancing our
strategic focus and making our SWP more agile. In addition,
we are focusing more and more on the way jobs are
changing due to digitalization Δ .

We also continually verify that our other tools, including
HR reporting, are up-to-date and have the potential for
further development, and we implement the results accordingly. For example, in 2016 we introduced an IT-based
­forecasting model to further expand our existing IT-based
reconciliation of future staffing needs with existing staffing
levels, thereby improving our responsiveness. Currently, we
are working on an enhancement to our reporting system
that will add analyses from the field of predictive analytics.

≈≈ Talent acquisition continues

We further improved our ranking in the year under review.
With that our performance was also in line with the FORECA ST FROM THE 201 5 INTEGR ATED REPORT [ INTEGR ATED REPORT
201 5 PAGE 183 ] .

As part of our employer branding campaign “A job like
no other” we organized two wide-coverage employer
­branding campaigns for high school students and skilled
workers in the year under review. These core elements of
our employer branding work were supplemented by seven
regional and target-group-specific recruiting campaigns.
For example, we also held targeted recruiting campaigns
for engineers and IT specialists with professional experience for which we integrated specific and new HR marketing
tools into our mix of already existing measures. Among
other things, we worked closely with Xing on social media
campaigns and managed to authentically place our em­­
ployer brand into the environments in which our core target
groups interact. For the first time, we created new online
Web formats for high school students that supplement our
already existing activities with innovative formats. During
this campaign, we also directly addressed parents for the
first time with the slogan “We help parents help.” The
appeal was made in various languages. New video formats
that gave very vivid and authentic depictions of our jobs

G ROUP MANAG EMENT REPORT

In addition to the TOP TARGETS [ PAGE 1 20 ] the six HR 2020
programs form the core of our HR strategy. In terms of
digitalization Δ , we have already taken our first steps into
the future with Working Environments 4.0.
Following the formation of the expert network Working
Environments 4.0 in the previous year, development paths
based on possible future scenarios were identified for
DB Group. To take the first steps along the development
path, prototypes such as “non-hierarchical teams,” “Co-­
determination plus” and “host of the future” were developed,
and were implemented during the year under review. In
parallel, the network developed concrete actions on the
issues of customer focus, future skills, personal responsibil­
­ity, and an organization capable of change and innovation.

Deutsche Bahn Group – 2016 Integrated Report

G R O U P M A N AG E M E N T R E P O RT

and our employees were particularly successful. In the area
of trade fairs and events, we organized new in-­­­­house events,
for example for engineers, which, with the slogan “DB
Backstage,” give exciting, first-hand insights into our many
different career opportunities and introduce some of the
people behind the job titles. The virtual reality glasses Δ
introduced in the previous year gives applicants a virtually
real insight into various professions; since then, the glasses
have become a regular part of the candidate experience
and ­are being deployed nationwide. In May 2016, we
received the Employer Branding Award from the European
research institute trendence in the category “Best Social
Media Impact.”
In order to attract talented young people from an early
stage, we have established cooperation programs with
almost 300 schools, 20 national and four international universities, in addition to holding recruiting events such as the
DB Backstage event “Women&Experience Day.” Students
can gain first work experience and make important career
contacts within DB Group while still at university through
internships, as working students or while writing their
theses. University graduates are offered the possibility of
a trainee program or direct entry as a regular employee. We
aim to align our selection of candidates even more closely
with their potential and talent over the long term. Through
our career networks for high school students and students/
graduates and academically experienced professionals,
potential candidates can network for entry in the DB Group
among themselves and with DB Group employees.
In an international project, a new recruiting software
program was selected as part of an EU -wide tender. It is
being introduced worldwide throughout DB Group. A
monthly meeting of experts made up of international DB
HR recruitment managers is held to jump-start the process
and to further address international issues. This group
works on worldwide talent acquisition projects, such as the
development of a global career Web site and cross-border
recruiting efforts.

≈≈ Personnel development continues
We have a strategic career development program to help
employees and executives shape their career at DB Group.
Systematic promotion of high performers and high potentials is an important instrument for ensuring the supply of
future leaders, and for retaining motivated employees
and executives. The basis for this is a continuous dialog.
Through written development pathways, career development options are shown to employees and executives.
This procedure enables us to manage talent and succession planning DB Group-wide. Our Web tool and career
develop­ment map make the development pathways transparent and accessible for all employees and executives.
The professional development compass provides online
information about on-the-job training schemes.

≈≈ Securing new talent

With more than 11,000 vocational trainees, dual degree
college students and “Chance plus” participants, DB Group
is one of the largest vocational trainers in Germany. Along
with the teaching of specialized knowledge and practical
skills, central components of vocational training in DB
Group are the acquisition of service-based, social and
methodological competences. Over 92% of trainees receive
a job at the conclusion of their vocational training.

We offer about 250 spots at ten locations throughout
Germany in our vocational preparation program, “Chance
plus,” including 70 spots reserved explicitly for refugees.
The approach is the same: with the help of in-house trainers
and social education workers, we provide technical and
academic preparation for vocational training within DB
Group for young people who need to be integrated into the
job market. For refugees, we have expanded the program
by adding at least 300 course units of German language
lessons. Around 75% of the participants from the 2015/2016
class year who successfully completed the program have,
immediately upon completion, started vocational training

or a job in DB Group or at another company, including 11 of
a total of 14 refugees who started their vocational training
at DB Group on September 1, 2016.
During the year under review, a skills assessment called
“DB Check-up for Refugees” based on the Social Code was
launched to prepare refugees for a vocational qualification
within DB Group.

≈≈ Five transformation targets
added to corporate culture

As part of R AILWAY OF THE FUTURE
, the four areas for
action with respect to our corporate culture have been
further developed into five transfor­­mation targets: Γ customer focus, cooperation, leadership skills, responsibility
and high performance. They form the basis for further
development of our corporate culture.
In order to effectively embed the targets and procedures
of R AILWAY OF THE FUTURE
and the transformation targets within DB Group, the circle of participants at the 2016
Global Group Meeting was extended to include all managers
and non-tariff executives. With more than 3,200 people
attending, this was the biggest DB Global Group Meeting
to date.
In the fall of 2016, DB Group called on its employees to
‡
DB 04 participate in the employee survey – in 72 countries and 36
languages. More than 194,000 employees participated –
this is 60.7%, and with that more participated compared to
the last survey in 2014 (60.1%). Once again, the independent outside service provider GfK administered this survey
and anonymously analyzed the questionnaires.

The employee satisfaction survey is conducted every two years. When no survey has been
conducted the proxy indicator “Follow-up workshop implementation rate” is used.

Group-wide, employee satisfaction was at the same level as
in 2014. A total of 53% (2014: 48%) of employees rate their
teammates’ commitment as high, which implies a better
overall working environment. Employees’ perception of
their own level of motivation is still in need of improvement: 49% (2014: 48%) describe themselves as motivated.
Job satisfaction continues to be positive at 67% (2014:
67%), as is satisfaction with the employer 63% (2014: 64%),
while 9% and 12%, respectively, indicated that they were
dissatisfied. Other emotional factors such as fun, loyalty or
commitment to the company declined slightly.

Details on changes by business unit can be found in the
section DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS UNITS [ PAGE 1 32 FF.] .
At Group level, the results point to four areas of action:
◊ ◊ Communication, information and involvement: As in
2014, this was the highest-priority area of action for the
Group as a whole. Since 2014, the day-to-day aspects of
communicating with direct superiors has improved
slightly. Still scoring low are cultural aspects and assessments of “open and honest communication” and “taking
employees’ interests into account.”
◊ ◊ Tasks and activities: The overall score for this subject
area continues to be very good. However, the specific
aspect “well-organized work processes,” which is an
especially important driver of employee motivation and
satisfaction, received a low score.
◊ ◊ Direct supervisor: Here, nearly every aspect has im­­
proved. There is still room to improve communications
about the usefulness of the work and to provide more
encouragement for questioning existing processes.
Overall, more work needs to be done on leadership skills.
◊ ◊ Cooperation: Overall, this topic receives a positive score,
although the results from the evaluation of interfaces
and cross-divisional cooperation have deteriorated.
In early February 2017, executives received the reports on
results for their areas of responsibility. Based on these,
executives will hold over 10,000 moderated follow-up workshops to discuss the results with their employees, to evaluate changes from 2014, and to decide what actions to take.

≈≈ Diversity

We have been supporting diversity for many years. In
gender diversity, our focus is on increasing the share of
women in management positions, promoting careers with
children and strengthening the role of fathers. Following
the adage “With women in the lead,” in January 2016, about
220 female managers came together at the first international DB Female Managers’ Conference in Berlin to discuss
strategic issues affecting the future of DB Group. Increasingly, executives are striving to find a better work-life
balance. One solution is to split one job into two. Therefore, we have developed a manual aimed, on the one
hand, at managerial employees who would like to implement job sharing and, on the other hand, at executives
whose em­­ployees, as managers, would like to share a job.
In addition, we are implementing the two-year, in-house
DB mentoring program, “Career with Children,” via DB
Training. To in­­crease language awareness, we developed
the manual on gender-sensitive language within DB Group.

≈≈ Fair and performance-oriented
working conditions
A standardized HR policy applies within DB Group: compensation, job promotions and FRINGE BENEFITS [ PAGE 2 7 3 ] are
covered by uniform rules for all employees – mainly through
collective bargaining agreements with trade unions and
works councils.
To retain employees over the long term, we strive to
offer them opportunities at every stage in their professional
and private lives, allowing them to balance personal needs
with the demands of DB Group.
Employment conditions must remain attractive and at
the same time affordable, even as overall conditions continue to change. Collective bargaining agreements make an
important contribution to these efforts.

≈≈ 2016 collective bargaining negotiations
with the EVG completed

In October 2016, the 2016/2017 collective bargaining
negotiations with the German Train Drivers’ Union (Ge­­
werk­schaft Deutscher Lokomotivführer; GDL) and with
the Railway and Transport Workers Union (Eisenbahnund Verkehrsgewerkschaft; EVG) started. The collective
bargaining negotiations with the EVG were completed
on December 12, 2016. On December 23, 2016, the GDL

124

announced that the collective bargaining negotiations had
failed and simultaneously called for ARBITR ATION [ PAGE 189 ] ,
which commenced on January 11, 2017.

New collective bargaining agreement

The terms of the collective bargaining agreement with the
EVG dated December 12, 2016 apply to employees in the
area of functional-group-specific collective bargaining
agreements 1 to 6 and of the companies DB Services GmbH,
DB Dialog GmbH, DB Fahrwegdienste GmbH, DB Kommu­

GmbH. It will run for 24 months, beginning on October 1,
2016.
The following terms were agreed with the EVG:
◊ ◊ A total increase in income of 5.1%, in two stages. Wages
will rise by 2.5% in April 2017. In addition, starting on
January 1, 2018, an additional 2.6% will be made available for an innovative model for choosing working
hours. On January 1, 2018, each employee may decide
whether he or she wants a 2.6% pay rise, a reduction in
working hours of one hour per week, or, instead of the
pay rise, six additional days of vacation.
◊ ◊ One-off payment in January 2017 (among others � 550
for full-time employees) for the period from October
2016 to March 2017.
◊ ◊ Introduction of a new pay grade 7 for employees who
have at least 30 years of service in one pay category
with a graduated system. Beginning in 2017, they will
receive � 500 more in annual scale wages and will automatically be transferred to pay grade 7.

Further development of the collective
bargaining agreement designed to address
demographic change

Sustainable HR policies are the focus of the collective bargaining agreement designed to address demographic
change that was negotiated with the EVG and entered into
force in 2013. The main provisions include greater scope for
employees to choose their own working hours and working
conditions in order to make it easier to balance a career and
a family. The parties agreed, among other things, on an
incentive to transfer overtime to the long-term account for
the 2016 accounting period and an incentive for contributing pay to the long-term account for calendar year 2017
for employees who cannot contribute overtime to the longterm account.

The collective bargaining agreement Work 4.0, which was
concluded in 2015, was redesigned during the year under
review. This new type of collective bargaining agreement
demonstrates how the employer, the trade union and works
councils can work together to support and shape the
impact of digitalization Δ and the associated changes in
working and employment conditions at an early stage and
in a proactive manner. They agreed that DB employees are
entitled to qualification measures if job descriptions and
work change on account of digitalization. Moreover, in the
future, DB employees will be able to choose, in agreement
with the employer, where they will work if their jobs permits
mobile working. For the first time, the wage-bargaining
parties have agreed to a set of standardized principles
governing standby duty and deployment on standby duty
within DB Group.
In order to be in a better position to assess the impact of
digital innovations at an early stage, the wage-bargaining
parties have agreed to follow various joint model projects,
some of them scientific in nature.

Compared to the previous year, the health rate was stable.
This is remarkable, because according to Federal statistics,
the health rate for 2016 decreased by 0.4 percentage
points. However, because of longer periods with significantly higher influenza activity in 2016, the improvements
seen in previous years were not achieved.

We pressed ahead with the improvement of the HR division.
Some portions of the project “Future of HR Management”
were completed. These are important steps on the path to
an integrated support model. The project will run until the
end of 2018. DB Schenker launched the program TOM@HR
aimed at creating new structures, more efficient processes
and new competence models to promote greater professionalization with digitalization support Δ .
In addition, DB Schenker rewrote its global diversity and
corporate volunteering strategy.

≈≈ Progress in climate protection
The Climate Protection Treaty agreed in Paris in December
2015 was another milestone in the global reduction of green­
­house gas emissions. Even long before the Treaty, the Fed­
eral Government decided to cut greenhouse gas emissions
by 80 to 95% in Germany by 2050 compared to 1990. Through
our continuous reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from
rail transport in Germany, we are making our contribution
to the Federal Government’s targets. If rail transport is not
in a strong position and traffic is not shifted to environmen­
tally friendly rail, it will not be possible to cut greenhouse
gas emissions in the transport sector. As a first step, we
intend to maintain the greenhouse gas emissions of our
worldwide transport services outside Germany at a stable
level, despite a rising volume sold. We aim to do so by in­­
creasing efficiency together with our carriers.

In the year under review, we improved our climate protection
target and raised it further. By 2020 we now wish to achieve
a reduction of the specific CO₂e emissions of our carriers
worldwide by 30% compared to 2006. We had already
achieved the original target of a 20% reduction last year, six
years earlier than planned. Key drivers of the improvement
include the steady increase

tion of the climate protection target, our ecological foot­
print and the specific emissions. These gases are called CO₂
equivalents (CO₂e), since they are converted into the equiv­
­alent value of CO₂. We measure achievement of our climate
protection targets on the basis of energy consumption, the
corresponding emissions factors and performance data.
In the year under review, we further reduced the spe­
cific CO ₂e emissions of our worldwide transport services
compared to 2006, thereby complying with our aspiration
in relation to climate protection. With reference to 1990,
the basis of our first climate protection program, we have
achieved a reduction of more than 62% for our rail trans­
port in Germany.

In all our modes of transport, the specific CO₂e emissions
fell slightly in the year under review; in ocean freight the
drop was substantial. An
exception is European road
freight transport, due to a
shift to­­wards smaller parcel
sizes and vehicle units.

G4-EN3

≈≈ Energy efficiency
increased

Lower energy consumption
helps the climate through a
reduction in the emission
of greenhouse gases and it
cuts the cost of buying en­­
ergy. By reporting primary
energy as a reference level, we are also taking into
ac­­count the processes requir­­­­e d for providing the
energy, such as extraction,
pro­­cess­­ing and the trans­
port of fuels or the genera­
tion of electricity.

OUR CONTRIBUTION TO THE
CLIMATE PROTECTION PLAN 2050
With the Climate Protection Plan 2050,
the Federal Government is aiming to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the
transport sector by up to 42 % by 2030
compared to 1990, as a first step.
A sys­te­matic shift to environmentally
friendly rail transport could help in this
respect. On average, a DB long-distance train emits only one-tenth of the
greenhouse gases of a car per passenger kilometer and only one-twentieth of the greenhouse gases of an
airplane. In freight transport, DB rail
freight transport produces only
one-quarter of the greenhouse gas
emissions of a truck.

In the year under review, the specific primary energy con­
sumption in regional rail passenger transport, bus, air and
ocean transport fell further. An exception is road freight
trans­­port due to the changes mentioned above. The re­­
ported increase in long-distance rail passenger transport is
a result of our recalibration of the energy consumption

≈≈ Share of renewable energies remains high

We had already reached, ahead of schedule, the target of
raising the share of renewable energies in the traction cur­
rent mix to 35% by 2020. From 2017 onwards, the target
relates solely to the traction current mix of DB companies
in Germany. We have raised the new target figure to 45%.
The increase up to 2020 will result primarily from the stat­
utory allocation of power quantities under the Renewable
Energy Sources Act (Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz; EEG).

Modern rolling stock can convert a part of its kinetic energy
into electrical energy during braking, allowing it to be fed
back into the traction current grid. In the year under review
we put additional new vehicles with this technology into

≈≈ Reducing energy needs in stations,
facilities and buildings

Our stationary facilities, which include more than 5,000 sta­
tions and over 2,000 sites worldwide operated by DB Schen­
­ker, account for about 8% of DB Group’s total energy
demand. Here, too, we want to further reduce energy con­
sumption and CO₂ emissions.
In our stations we managed to lower absolute primary
energy consumption by nearly 17% in comparison to 2010 by
‡ the end of 2016. The focus of the energy-saving measures
DB 06 were particularly on upgrading the lighting and orientation
systems to LED, and on improving the operational perfor­
mance of our ventilation, cooling and boiler systems. The
energy management system of DB Station&Service AG was
certified to DIN EN ISO 50001 in the year under review.
Additional targets were formulated during the certification
process.
In December 2016, we opened the second CO₂-free station
in Lutherstadt Wittenberg. The use of geothermal power,
photovoltaics, roof greening, rainwater management and
LED lighting enables the station to operate in a carbon-neu­
tral way. The green station in Kerpen-Horrem (North Rhine-­
­Westphalia) has been operational since 2014.

In the year under review, DB Long-Distance has started to
build its first CO₂- NEUTR AL ICE FACILIT Y [ PAGE 4 2 F.] . It will
become operational in 2017. As in the green stations, pho­
tovoltaic systems and geothermal power will help to save
several thousand tons of CO₂ per year, compared to con­
ventional technologies. Intelligent lighting control in the
workshop and the use of LED lighting in the external facil­
ities guarantee optimum use of energy.
In addition, DB Regional has started with the construc­
tion of a climate-friendly facility in Munich-Pasing. Through
its use of geothermal power, LED lighting and intelligent
facilities management, the company meets high ecological
standards that also pay off from a business viewpoint. CO₂
emissions will be 80% lower than in conventional systems.
DB Schenker’s facilities comply with the latest require­
ments in terms of energy efficiency and environmental pro­
tection. An example is the recently opened terminal in the
Finnish town of Vaasa, a CO₂-neutral facility, which is pow­
ered by geothermal sources and solar energy.
Throughout Europe, about 700 subsidiaries of DB Group
are required to conduct energy audits by the EU’s Energy
Efficiency Directive. By 2015, more than 100 companies had
already conducted energy audits in Germany alone. By the
end of the year under review, 14 companies including DB
Energie GmbH, DB Regio AG with the Berlin and Hamburg
S-Bahns (metros), DB Fernverkehr AG and DB Station&Ser­
vice AG, each introduced a comprehensive energy manage­
ment system (EnMS). These EnMS enable about two-thirds
of DB Group’s energy consumption in Germany to be re­­
corded. The required certification of the EnMS was success­
fully completed by external auditors in 2016.

DB 07

In order to noticeably relieve residents near railway tracks,
we plan to halve our rail transport noise by 2020, compared
to 2000. We will achieve this by implementing the noise re­­
mediation program and the use of whisper brakes on freight
cars. In the year under review, we considerably accelerated
the process to refit freight cars with quiet brake shoes. As a
result, half of our freight cars now run more quietly in Ger­
many. We are reducing noise by building fixed sound bar­
riers along the tracks as well.

2014 rounded.
	C ompleted sections of track as per Annex 1 of our overall
noise remediation program, cumulated.
Preliminary figure.

Since 1999, we have been voluntarily implementing the pro­
gram launched by the Federal Government, “Noise remedia­
tion of existing rail lines of the Federal Government” (Lärm­
­­­sanierung an bestehenden Schienenwegen des Bundes).
On the 3,700-km-long lines identified as particularly affected
in Germany, we will build sound barriers and equip apart­
ments with soundproof windows, for example. Of that total,
2,000 km is scheduled to be noise remediated by 2020. A
list of priorities defines where the highest impacts are and
sets out the sequence in which these places will be noise
remediated. The Federal Government further in­creased the
funding for noise remediation in the year under review. It
provided € 150 million in the Federal budget accounts for
noise abatement measures (previous year: € 130 million).
This amount is not only being used to fund conventional
noise remediation measures on the tracks, but also to refit
freight cars and to finance special noise protection schemes.
In total, about € 80.3 million was spent on implementing
the Federal Government’s voluntary noise remediation
program. The progress made in noise remediation of lines
corresponds largely with our FORECA ST FROM THE 201 5 INTEGR ATED REPORT [ 201 5 INTEGR ATED REPORT, PAGE 183 ] .
The calling in of funds of € 100 million as scheduled for
the year under review was not fully implemented. The rea­
sons for this include the length of time taken for the plan­
ning permission procedure, delay in the planning process
due to complaints by residents against plan approval deci­
sions, tighter requirements in relation to construction noise
and greater strain on the availability of check intervals as
a result of increasing maintenance and renovation work in
the existing network and for ongoing expansion projects.
For the period 2016 to 2018, the Federal Government is
providing funding totaling about € 1 billion through the
C APITAL E XPENDITUR E PRO GR AM FOR THE FUTUR E [ 201 5 INTEGR ATED REPORT, PAGE 1 3 4 ]

130

for infrastruc­­ture projects. An amount

in the tens of millions of euros is also earmarked for noise
abatement measures. In the year under review the relevant
finance agreements were signed in order to implement the
noise abatement measures in sub­­sequent years. These
include feasibility studies in the Middle Rhine Valley and
in the valleys of the Inn and Elbe rivers.
In the year under review, the Federal Government de­­
cided to cut the threshold values (3 dB(A)) for noise reme­
diation, in addition to discontinuation of railway bonus 2015
(5 dB(A)). Since January 1, 2016, for example, the nighttime values in residential areas are 57 dB(A), and thus were
aligned with the level of protection applicable to road traffic.
As a result, noise protection must be implemented that is
an improvement of 8 dB(A) compared to 2014. Owing to the
changes in the legal framework, the Federal Government’s
voluntary noise remediation program is being completely
revised and will then be published by the BMVI. The sections
of track that have already been remediated will also be in­­
cluded in the study.
Noise prevention is legally anchored in the 16th Federal
Immission Control Act (Bundesimmissionsschutzverord­
nung). It applies to new construction and expansion proj­
ects. As a result, the number of measures depends on the
construction projects in the respective year.

≈≈ More quiet freight cars on the rails

With the use of so-called composite brake shoes (V brake
shoes), which minimize abrasion on the wheel surface,
passing freight transport noise can be effectively reduced
by about 10 dB(A), which corresponds to a 50% reduction
to the human ear. For this purpose two different types of V
brake shoes are available. We started buying new freight
cars equipped with brake shoes of type K back in 2001,
while we have been refitting our existing freight cars with
type LL brake shoes since 2013.

The number of new and existing freight cars with this noise-­
­reducing technology has increased further. By the end of the
year under review, more than 50% of the current fleet oper­
ated by DB Cargo in Germany had been fitted with whisper
brakes. In the year under review, we refitted quiet brake
shoes to almost 12,000 existing freight cars. This progress
thus corresponds to our FORECAST FROM THE 201 5 INTEGR ATED
REPORT [ 201 5 INTEGR ATED REPORT, PAGE 183 ] .

G roup perfor m ance – en v iron m enta l di m ension

Whisper brakes significantly reduce rail transport noise.
The refitting of freight cars is being supported with finan­
cial assistance from the BMVI. In addition, DB Netz AG’s
NOISE-BA SED TR AIN-PATH PRICING SYSTEM (LÄRMABHÄNGIGES
TR A S SEN­­P REIS SYSTEM; LATPS) [ PAGE 1 52 F.] , which was intro­
duced with the timetable change 2012/2013, also supports
the refitting. The complete active vehicle fleet of DB Cargo
in Germany will be quiet by the end of 2020.

≈≈ Test lines set up for new
noise control technologies

The BMVI launched in cooperation with us the “New and
application-oriented noise control trials initiative” (Initiative
Lärmschutz-Erprobung neu und anwendungsorientiert;
I -LENA). This initiative, which runs from April 2016 to the
end of 2020, will give developers and manufacturers of
noise control technologies the chance to test their innova­
tions in practice on DB lines. BMVI is subsidizing these trials
with about € 6 million. In the year under review, almost 50
suggestions were submitted for innovative measures for
protection against noise and vibration Ε . I -LENA focuses
on infrastructure measures aimed at reducing noise. The
suggestions submitted can be implemented, tested and im­­
proved in real operating conditions on suitable test lines.
The portfolio of feasible measures for reducing noise and
vibrations is to be extended in this way.

≈≈ Recycling rate continues
at a high level
The scarcity of resources and increasing prices provides us
with considerable challenges. Particularly in construction
and in the maintenance of the rail infrastructure, a large
quantity of different resources are used, which increases
the pressure to act. We are living up to our responsibilities
in regard to our entire value-added chain: from purchasing
to the operational use to recycling and disposal. We intend
to transform our waste management process from an opti­
mized disposal management system into a modern resource
management system. This is why our activities are mainly
focused on maintaining our recycling rate at a high level of
at least 95% until 2020. While we achieve a high recycling
rate for construction waste, we wish to increase this further
for other types of waste, in particular municipal waste, in
the coming years.
In addition, we plan to increase the use of recycling
materials, and extend the service life of our production
equipment, including vehicles. In doing so, we are contrib­
uting to the increased use of secondary raw materials in

society as a whole. We are also protecting natural resources,
since the production of recycling materials is better for the
environment than sourcing primary raw materials.
The modernization of our vehicles significantly reduces
material and energy consumption. In the case of the ICE 2
redesign, for example, the saving of materials was about
80% com­­pared to new purchase. The redesign of the ICE 3
started in the year under review. In local transport, the
S -Bahn (metro) systems for the Rhine-Neckar region and
Hamburg, among others, are currently being upgraded.

while there was about a 10% rise in construction waste. The
target for the recycling rate of 95% was again achieved. It
was up 0.1 percentage points on the previous year. Through
specific measures such as selective dismantling and con­
tractual commitment of sorting and recycling facilities, we
would like to maintain the share of recyclable waste at a
high level and further reduce the proportion of waste that
is destined for incineration.

Data collection was once again improved in all areas. This is
shown especially in the increase in quantity seen in municipal
waste and other types of waste. Such waste has been pro­
duced increasingly in the European section of DB Schenker.
Two areas have been major factors in the increase in
construction waste. In the case of both the Stuttgart – Ulm
project (+ 0.7 million t) and at DB Netz AG (+ 0.5 million t),
construction waste rose compared to the previous year,
with the recycling rate remaining at the same high level.

The order volume decreased slightly overall in the year
under review. Additions from newly awarded transport
contracts of € 13.3 billion were offset by disposals,
mainly due to services performed, of € 11.7 billion and
changes in assumptions of € 2.3 billion, which were pri­
marily due to exchange rate effects.
The volume of new transport contracts acquired by
DB REGIONAL [ PAGE 1 41 ] was lower than the scope of ser­

≈≈ Further agreement reached with
Bombardier Transportation

In the second quarter of 2016, DB Regional and Bombar­
dier Transportation were able to agree on an out-of-court
settlement with regard to the late delivery of double-deck
trains (locomotives and cars), which also includes agree­
ment with DB Long-Distance with regard to the double-­
deck Intercity 2 (IC 2). Thus we were able to avoid exten­
sive legal battles.

≈≈ Progress on the Stuttgart – Ulm project

In the year under review, a comprehensive cost assessment
and forecast was prepared for the Stuttgart 21 Ε part of
this project, which confirmed adherence to the financing
budget of € 6.526 billion, but revealed a need for counter­
measures of about € 0.5 billion in order to remain within
the total project volume. Countermeasures are also needed
with regard to the commissioning date.
The first construction phase of the new central station
commenced with the pouring of the concrete floor slab.
The plan approval decision was issued for the part relating
to the new construction line near the airport. More than
23 km, representing more than one-third of the tunnels
required for Stuttgart 21, have been drilled and excavated.
All of the structural works for the new construction
line Wendlingen – Ulm Ε have been awarded. More than
half of the necessary tunnels have already been drilled
and excavated. One milestone in the year under review
was the tunnel connecting Ulm with the Alb plateau.

134

On December 23, 2016, DB Group filed a lawsuit against its
project partners before Stuttgart Administrative Court
with regard to additional costs in excess of € 4,526 million.
The lawsuit aims to secure agreement of additional financing
contributions.

≈≈ Capital expenditure program
for the future has started

The BMVI is providing additional funding of up to € 942 mil­
­lion from 2016 to 2018 as part of the German Federal Gov­
ernment’s capital expenditure program for the future Ε .
Areas of focus include the creation of a planning reserve,
noise protection on tracks, digitalization and the expansion
of new control systems. In the digitalization Δ segment,
funding agreements were reached for both the BUILDING
INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) [ PAGE 1 52 ] pilot project and the
Digital Capacity Increase (Digitale Kapazitätssteigerung)
project. About € 106 million were already spent in the year
under review.

≈≈ LuFV quality targets met

For the proof of infrastructure quality Ε that must be pro­
­vi­­ ded annually under the LUFV II [ PAGE 2 49 ] , a total of eight
key quality indicators subject to sanctions as well as other
assessment parameters were established which are used
to describe and assess in detail the state and development
of the existing track infrastructure. In the year under review,
we met the agreed contractual targets and will document
this with the Infrastructure State and Development Report
(Infrastrukturzustands- und -entwicklungsbericht; IZB) as
agreed in the contract. The Federal Government has not
yet completed all of its consultations on the audit per­
formed for the 2015 figures, however, which could impact
target attainment in the year under review. As far as the
proof of target attainment of quality indicator “Theoret­
ical lost travel time in the full network” in 2016 is con­
cerned, the opinion of the Federal Railway Authority
(Eisenbahn-Bundesamt; EBA) currently differs from that
of DB Netz AG. Accordingly, DB Netz AG has only used
the reported findings as its base so far. If the audit find­
ings from 2015 that are currently being assessed differ­
ently by EBA and DB Netz AG were to be included in the
presentation of the results, the target would have been
missed in the year under review. Future IZBs will include
the results of these consultations in the regular reporting
procedure. This reporting procedure will also address the
capital and maintenance expenditures we undertook, as
agreed, in the year under review.

D e v elopment of business units

≈≈ Business model

DB Long-Distance offers customers comfortable and envi-

ronmentally friendly travel within Germany and into neighboring countries. Daily travel with the ICE/IC/EC fleet forms
the backbone of long-distance transport. Offerings are being
supplemented by island services to Sylt and Wangerooge.
Long-distance bus services (IC Bus) provides an extension
to the rail transport offering for domestic and international
travel.
The important key performance figures are volume sold
and the specific load factor of the trains. The cost side largely
correlates with the volume produced, which is derived from
the schedule. Personnel and facility resource management
is determined on the basis of the annual train schedule to
optimize the unit cost per train kilometer traveled. The key
drivers are personnel, maintenance and infrastructure
costs, the latter being very fixed-cost intensive. Only a
small portion of costs varies with train capacity utilization.

The most important sources of income for commercially op­­
er­­ated long-distance transport are revenues from the sale
of tickets and BahnCards. Our employees, a modern vehicle
fleet and a high-quality infrastructure are key resources.
This is why DB Group’s internal infrastructure companies,
service providers and the vehicle industry are important
partners. Furthermore, cooperation with public transport
companies in countries bordering Germany is very important
for cross-border connections.

been expanded in line with the targets, nearly all cities with
a population of over 100,000 will be linked to long-distance
transport. This will expand our service offering by around 25%
by 2030. As a result, we expect to win over 50 million more
passengers per year.
The customer and service campaign incorporates the
mea­­sures defined in our Long-Distance 2020 strategy. We
want to be the “first choice for customers and employees.”
Together, our long-distance transport employees bear re­­
spon­­sibility for a financially strong company that focuses
on ensuring customers enjoy their travel experience.
◊ ◊ ECONOMIC ¿ dimension: DB Long-Distance is pursuing
the target of offering its customers high-quality products
and thereby achieving profitable growth. By 2020, we
want to offer the most recognized and trusted product,
both in terms of travel times and service. This is why we
are implementing R AILWAY OF THE FUTURE
. Our aim
is to significantly and sustainably enhance quality. For ex­­

improved punctuality Α considerably. If disruptions do
occur, however, our employees take excellent care of our
passengers and, together with our digital platforms, pro­
­vide an optimal flow of information and alternative so­­
lutions to bring passengers to their destination. New
vehicles make an important contribution to improving
reli­­ability. At the same time, the modernization of our
fleet creates the conditions for operational reliability and
a high degree of traveling comfort. Particularly noteworthy is the new ICE 4, by far the largest capital expenditure of recent years. Free WiFi on ICE trains, together
with the extended ICE portal, also enhances the positive travel experience and helps to convince long distance customers that this is the most relaxing way to
travel. Digital innovations make it even easier to use our
services and enable us to prepare for the increasing
competition.
◊ ◊ SOCIAL † dimension: In order to keep our promises to our
customers, we expect our employees to have a strong
focus on customers and quality. One prerequisite for this
is a solid cooperative spirit that can bring employees to­­
gether and allow them to participate. This is why we are
constantly working on improving our employee satisfaction, for example by including our employees in the plan­
n­­ing of specific working conditions, which also increases
our employer attractiveness.

dimension: DB Long-Distance has set
a target of being considered by its customers as the most
environmentally friendly provider by 2020. A central ele­ ‡
­ment in this regard are green offers with 100% eco-power. G4-EN7
G4-EN27
Currently, about 75% of traction current is drawn from
re­­newable energy sources. New vehicles support our
efforts to achieve this target. For example, the ICE 4 [ PAGE
3 4 F.] uses around 22% less energy per seat compared to
the comparable ICE 1 model. In addition, by encouraging
shifts in modes of transport, the new service campaign
will enable up to 1.7 million tons of CO₂ emissions to be
saved annually by 2030.

◊ ◊ ENVIRONMENTAL ¥

Bus service

The pace of further consolidation in the German long-distance bus market increased in 2016. The competitive pressure on rail transport services remained fierce. The main
driver of competition is now FlixBus, which has gained control of the market following its acquisition of Megabus and
Postbus. As a result, BerlinLinienBus temporarily became
the second-largest provider in the German marketplace, with
a market share of 14%, and – at the same time – was the only
remaining market player of any relevance alongside FlixBus
before BerlinLinienBus ceased operation.

≈≈ Events in 2016

Vehicle availability improved

The availability of the ICE fleet Β improved during the
year under review:
◊ ◊ Continuous reduction of drive and brake defects under
R AILWAY OF THE FUTURE
.
◊ ◊ The introduction of quality dialogs has improved incident resolution.
◊ ◊ Implementation of numerous stabilizing measures,
such as improving our ability to prepare for and resolve
incidents.
◊ ◊ 14 new ICE 3 multiple units (407 series) were approved
for transport services to France.
◊ ◊ The need to replace more drives on the ICE 1 and ICE 2
trains as a result of problems caused by distorted wheel
discs and power converter malfunctions had an adverse
effect. The program to replace power converters on ICE 1
and ICE 2 trains is still ongoing.

Vehicle projects in long-distance transport

In summer and fall 2016, we ran the program RESET [ PAGE 20 F.]
as part of R AILWAY OF THE FUTURE
to improve quality Β .
The redesign of the ICE 3 started in October 2016. Those
national ICE 3 trains that are not yet fitted with the European Train Control System (ETCS) will be upgraded during
the redesign.
On September 16, 2016, the EBA granted permission to
put the ICE 4 [ PAGE 3 4 F.] into national service. Prior to commencing regular operations in December 2017, two ICE 4
trains will first undergo two-stage trials. An initial test phase
took place with Group test subjects who first tested and
evaluated the train. Trial operation with passengers then
commenced in late fall 2016 on the Hamburg – Munich route.

RESET program for long-distance trains
The RESET PROGR AM [ PAGE 20 F.] brought about noticeable
improvements in quality and service Β in customer-relevant areas of ICE and IC trains. Measures included the rectification of malfunctions, thorough cleaning and furniture
replacements. To implement these measures, each train
spent three days in the workshop.
Between March and June, about 250 ICE trains were
overhauled. They were followed by about 1,400 passenger
cars and about 200 locomotives between September and
December. Work to improve the appearance and create an
atmosphere of wellbeing are also important. Alongside the
complete elimination of all malfunctions in the kitchens,
back and seat upholstery was replaced, and the carpets
and interiors were thoroughly cleaned.

Other events

Following conversion, a hall in the Berlin – Rummelsburg
facility reopened. With special cranes and deeper pits,
the hall now accommodates the technology for maintain­
­ing and servicing the ICE 4. Energy efficiency was also
improved.
◊ ◊ Our efforts in overnight rail travel will focus on offering
more IC and ICE connections in the future. The conven­
­tion­­­al night train services offering sleepers and cou­­
chettes were discontinued in the year under review.
When the timetable changed in December 2016, Austrian Railways expanded their overnight train network

In the year under review, punctuality Α in long-distance
transport improved significantly as a result of R AILWAY OF
THE FUTURE MEASURES [ PAGE 85 F.] . The increase was the largest
witnessed since 2011. The rate of people successfully making
long-distance transport connections was roughly at the
previous yearʼs level.
To assess customer satisfaction, 13,800 customers are ‡
asked each year in six waves about their satisfaction with G4-PR5

G ROUP MANAG EMENT REPORT

The program to refit the ICE 3 fleet with new drive wheel sets
will probably continue until 2018. Approval was granted in
October 2016 to put the new wheel sets into service on the
ICE T fleet. Refitting will probably continue until 2019.
The operation of IC 2 trains stabilized considerably follow­
­ing the implementation of technical and operational measures over the course of the year. The large number of train
command and control technology malfunctions remains a
problem. Several vehicles are still tied up in testing procedures at the manufacturers. The problem of swaying de­­
creases as the vehicles cover more mileage. We are in the
process of implementing a technical measure to fully eliminate this problem. A further technical measure is currently
undergoing approval procedures.

The higher cost of materials (+ 5.8%) was mainly due to
increased infrastructure expenses caused by higher prices
and volumes, and increased energy and maintenance ex­­
penses caused by higher volumes. The initiatives designed
to improve service and quality (especially the RESET [ PAGE 1 37 ]
program) were also noticeable.
Higher personnel expenses (+2.4%) were primarily due
to increases in collective bargaining agreements.
Other operating expenses (+ 0.7%) increased mainly as
a result of the Railway of the Future measures. By contrast,
the elimination of knock-on costs from the strikes in 2015

Depreciation (–10.0%) decreased, partly because some
ICE 1 and ICE 3 trains reached the end of their useful lives
for accounting purposes. Procurements of ICE 3 (407 series)
and IC 2 trains in 2015 had an opposite effect.
Adjusted EBITDA decreased, mainly as a result of the
charges for the cost of materials and the intense competitive environment. Adjusted EBIT showed positive development due to lower depreciation.

≈≈ DB Regional business unit
≈≈ Business model

DB Regional’s core service is to bring millions of passengers

in regional transport each day to their desired destination
in a punctual, safe, reliable and environmentally friendly
way. In doing so, we reliably fulfill the requirements of the
public transport authorities.
An extensive network of regional express, regional train,
S-Bahn (metro), and regional and city bus lines offers passengers connections in metropolitan areas and the surround­
­ing countryside. Our regions combine service planning and
provisioning with the target of offering local transport that
meets local transport needs.

As a negotiating partner for state and regional public transport authorities, DB Regional participates in tenders for
long-term transport contracts and route concessions. We
strive to defend our leading market position with integrated
transport concepts, persuasively good quality services, and
high capital expenditures on our vehicles.
Volume sold and volume produced are important key
performance figures. Transport contracts typically reference
volume produced. Moreover, there are contracts with public
transport authorities in which fare revenues are awarded
directly to the contracting organization, while the transport company is completely compensated for the entire
range of its services by the public transport authority (gross
contracts).
Due to the fact that transport contracts span several
years, functioning sliding price mechanisms that allow unex­
­pected cost developments to be passed on to the public
transport authorities play an important role in managing
the procurement market risks relating to energy, personnel

and infrastructure utilization. Another important risk management component is how reutilization risk is managed in
the event that the useful life of vehicles exceeds the term
of a transport contract. An operationally flexible vehicle fleet
coupled with a broad and balanced portfolio of transport
contracts considerably reduces this risk.
Concession fees, in addition to revenues from ticket sales,
are the most important source of income. Our employees,
a modern vehicle fleet and a high-quality infrastructure are
key resources for offering punctual transport. This is why
DB infrastructure companies and internal service providers
are important partners, together with the vehicle industry.
Furthermore, cooperation with public transport authorities
is very important.
Predefined terms in transport contracts and route concessions, combined with the expensive production system,
result in a cost structure with high fixed costs. The major
drivers are personnel, maintenance, energy and infrastructure expenses. Only a small portion of costs varies with train
capacity utilization.

≈≈ Markets and strategy

The German local transport market will continue to be one of
the most interesting markets in Europe in the coming years.
◊ ◊ ECONOMIC ¿ dimension: We want to continuously improve
quality, thus increasing customer satisfaction, and to
defend our market position without sacrificing profitability. To this end we have launched Railway of the Future
Regional:
≈ ≈ To regain quality leadership in the local rail passen­
­ger transport market. That means operating punctu­
­ally with no defects, where possible, which we plan
to ensure by optimizing our processes.
≈ ≈ To establish ourselves as innovation leader. Here, we
are focusing primarily on shaping innovation at the
interface to our customers, for example with digital
products such as our “Route Agent” or seat reservation system. We also want to work with the public
transport authorities to gradually implement WiFi in
regional trains.
≈ ≈ To further reduce costs. This strategic direction is es­­
sential since competition for tender awards in the
local rail passenger transport market continues to
be strongly driven by the prices bid. Initiatives in
this respect include leveraging economies of scale
along the entire value-added chain and reducing
overheads.
≈ ≈ To build a new “maintenance” market segment. Here,
we are focusing on using our size and maintenance
ex­­perience to offer maintenance services.

140

G R O U P M A N AG E M E N T R E P O RT

To tackle networks currently operated by compet­
itors. We want to win back tenders lost to other
competitors.
Bus services still have to prove themselves in an environment that is becoming increasingly competitive. DB Re­­gional
Bus is tackling the growing cost pressure in competitive
tender procedures with its Bus of the Future program. As
part of the strategy definition, 13 areas of action were identified, of which the six described below are currently being
implemented:
≈ ≈ Bid Management of the Future is focusing on optimizing our bidding process.
≈ ≈ Income Management of the Future is developing and
implementing a uniform income management system.
≈ ≈ Fleet of the Future is putting a uniform fleet manage­
­ment system in place.
≈ ≈ IT of the Future is transferring bus IT entirely to the
cloud and will make the application landscape much
leaner and more standardized.
≈ ≈ Control Systems of the Future is building a uniform
management information system.
≈ ≈ Organization of the Future is adapting the organization to meet market requirements.
◊ ◊ SOCIAL † dimension: Satisfied employees are essential
for success in the market. One important key to this is
to actively involve employees in the continuous improve­
­ment of DB Regional. These efforts include conducting ‡
employee surveys and organizing follow-up workshops DB 04
to derive actions together. Our “Train crew initiative”
addressed the findings from the past employee survey
‡
and developed appropriate solutions. For example, we
introduced a piercing alarm to enhance crew safety. As
DB 08
part of our “Onboarding initiative,” we developed measures aimed at helping new colleagues starting work at
DB Regional.
◊ ◊ ENVIRONMENTAL ¥ dimension: The target here is to continue to build on our strengths as a mode of transport
that has an environmentally friendly structure, especially
compared to car traffic. For example, as part our Rail­
­way of the Future Regional program, we are striving hard
to consistently promote an energy-saving driving style
and thus to significantly reduce energy consumption.
Various rail transport pilot projects have been launched
for this purpose. Calls for vehicle tenders by DB Regional
Bus also take the vehicle fuel consumption data into
account in addition to the acquisition and maintenance
costs. To raise energy efficiency even further, workshop
initiatives to improve heating control, optimize lighting
and renovate buildings are continuing.

74%) had previously been provided by DB Group companies.
DB Regional won 14 of the tenders (previous year: ten
tenders), which accounts for 51% of the train kilometers
awarded (previous year: 53%).

In bus services, a volume of 105 million bus kilometers was
awarded in Germany in the year under review (previous year:
79 million bus kilometers) in 162 tenders (previous year: 161
tenders). Of the bus kilometers newly awarded, 37% (previ­
­ous year: 41%) were previously operated by DB Regional Bus.

We participated in 115 tenders (previous year: 107 tenders)
with a volume of 87 million bus kilometers (previous year:
62 million bus kilometers). We won 38% of the tender procedures in which we participated (previous year: 31%).

≈≈ Events in 2016

Vehicle measures implemented

‡

The measures designed to improve our fleet Β include:
redesign of interiors, installing passenger information and
video recording systems, and repainting.
◊ ◊ The renovation of 102 double-deck cars for the NorthSouth network tender was concluded.
◊ ◊ 66 vehicles from the 423 series were completely renovated for the future operation of the Stuttgart S-Bahn
(metro).
◊ ◊ 25 vehicles from the 644 series were modified for the
transitional Baden-Württemberg regional contract.
◊ ◊ 56 out of a total of 91 electric multiple units from the 425
series were modernized for the Rhine-Neckar S -Bahn
(metro).

Delays in vehicle deliveries

We were able to vastly improve vehicle availability in the
year under review. Delays and restrictions relating to the
delivery of new trains did, however, occur:
◊ ◊ By year-end 2016, a total of 75 intermediate cars of the
2010 double-deck cars for the Ringzug-West and Main-­
Spessart transport networks in Bavaria, the North-South
network in Berlin-Brandenburg, and the Central network
in Schleswig-Holstein had been delivered.
◊ ◊ Bombardier commenced delivery of the 2010 double-­
deck cars in December 2015, behind schedule, and continued with the delivery of 12 intermediate cars for the
Central network transport contract in Schleswig-Holstein
in February 2016.
◊ ◊ Of the coaches ordered in 2014 to increase the number
of seats, Alstom had delivered nine two-part diesel multiple units of the 620/623 series by the end of 2016.
◊ ◊ In mid-2016, Bombardier delivered a total of 29 of the E
Talent trains (442 series) ordered in 2014 for the Central
German metro network II transport contract.
◊ ◊ By the end of 2016, Bombardier had delivered nine out
of ten 430 series multiple units ordered in 2014 for the
Stuttgart S -Bahn (metro). The one vehicle that is late
will apparently be delivered at the beginning of 2017. All
vehicles can still only be operated without the retractable step function. This step function has been undergoing trials since the beginning of 2016. Other faults
still exist and work to remedy them is still ongoing.

Provisional final contractual acceptance of 16 out of 20
147 series locomotives for the Baden-Württemberg transitional contract took place in December 2016. The vehicles were scheduled for delivery in 2015.
In December 2016, DB Regional rented a total of 15 locomotives and three diesel rail cars from Paribus for deploy­
­ment on the Schleswig-Holstein West transport contract.
Due to defects, 90 passenger cars cannot be rented until
2017. Until the defects are remedied, existing DB Regional
vehicles are being deployed.
Bombardier has postponed delivery of 60 vehicles (490
series) ordered for the Hamburg S-Bahn (metro) until the
period between May and December 2018.
We expect delivery of Link diesel multiple units by PESA
(632/633 series) for the Sauerland network and Dreieich
Railway to be delayed by more than two years and for
the Allgäu diesel network by one year on average.
The delivery of the vehicles ordered from Skoda for the
Nuremberg-Ingolstadt-Munich Express is to be delayed
by two years until mid-2018.

Subsidy procedures and requests for
information on transport contracts

There were no significant changes in the year under review
regarding the ongoing formal investigation by the EU Commission against the Federal Government for the alleged
provisioning of illegal subsidies as a result of the conclusion
of a transport contract between DB Regional and the states
of Berlin and Brandenburg. This also applies to the preliminary investigations concerning the transport contract for the
S-Bahn (metro) Berlin, the transport contract of the Rhine-­

customer satisfaction is the
result of driver training pro­

Performance development declined in both rail and bus
services in the wake of contract losses. The economic performance of DB Regional is particularly affected by the
development of the higher-revenue and higher-performance rail line of business. Unprofitable long-distance bus
business did, however, account for a major share of the
negative profit development.
In terms of revenue development, the non-recurrence
of the strike effects from 2015 and pricing effects were two
factors that offset virtually all of the performance losses.
Revenues were slightly down in total year on year. With the
elimination of the strike effects and a negative one-off effect
from the previous year, concession fees increased slightly.
Other operating income also declined (–29.0%), due
partly to lower compensation payments.

Performance development was shaped by declining volumes,
especially in the regions Southeast and North and in NorthRhine Westphalia. The non-recurrence of strike effects from
the previous year had a positive effect. The number of passengers was on a par with the previous year’s level.
Revenue development was slightly weaker. Price effects
and the non-recurrence of the strike effects, which mainly
impacted concession fees, were two factors that offset virtually all of the performance losses.
Other operating income (–27.3%) declined, partly due to
lower compensation for damages in connection with vehicle
projects.
The cost of materials (–2.1%) was influenced mainly by
lower energy expenses as a result of price and volume effects.
Performance-related decreases in infrastructure utilization
costs also had an effect, albeit the impact was cushioned by
countervailing price effects.
Personnel expenses (–1.5%) decreased as the number
of employees declined. Collective wage increases had an
opposite effect.

The expansion of available offers was one of the reasons
behind positive performance development up to the DISCONTINUATION OF LONG -DISTANCE BUS BUSINES S [ PAGE 1 36 ] at
the end of October 2016. Persisting fierce price and competitive pressure continued to weigh on the development of
operating profits in long-distance bus business in the year
under review, which resulted in considerable negative effects.
Only the development of other bus business is discussed
below.
Performance development in other bus business de­clined,
mainly as a result of tender losses in the Southwest region.
Revenues also labored under price effects and lower
reimbursements, and declined overall.
Other operating income (+ 5.0%) rose, mainly as a result
of higher intra-Group transfer prices, although they also
caused an increase in other operating expenses (+18.8%).
Cost of materials (– 6.9%) declined, mainly as a result of
diesel price levels and a reduced volume of purchased con­­
tractor services.
Personnel expenses (+1.8%) rose in the wake of a greater
number of employees and as a result of collective bargain­
i­ ng agreements.
It was only possible to offset the decline in income partly
with lower burdens on the expenses side. Adjusted EBITDA
therefore decreased accordingly. The reduction in depreciation (–22.0%) following the extension of the useful life of
buses caused the adjusted EBIT to rise.
Due to the extensive vehicle acquisitions for new services won in the previous year, gross capital expenditures
de­­clined significantly.
Following the introduction of new transport services in
Baden-Württemberg, the number of employees increased
as of December 31, 2016.

≈≈ DB Cargo business unit
≈≈ Business model

With around 4,200 customer sidings in Europe, DB Cargo
provides its customers with access to one of the biggest
rail networks in the world and is thus the number one in
European rail freight transport. The international network
stretches along the huge European freight transport cor­
ridor. This means that rail transport is offered across Europe
in the product areas of block trains, single wagons and
combined transport. Individual industry solutions complete
the range of services offered. Production is largely carried
out with our own fleet. The key industries served are the iron,
coal and steel (montan) industries, chemical, automotive,
and construction materials industries, heavy industry and
con­­sumer goods, as well as intermodal transport. The cus­
tomer structure is characterized by major customers. The
premiere key performance indicator is volume sold measured
in ton kilometers. The relevant capacity utilization figure is

measured in tons per train. The cost structure is mainly in­­
flu­­enced by volume produced. The most important source
of revenue is transporting goods by rail.
Key resources are customer relationships, a high level
of customer understanding, motivated and well-trained
employees along with efficient use of rolling stock and a
premium quality infrastructure. The DB infrastructure com­
panies and service providers are important partners in this
respect.
The business model of DB Cargo is undergoing adjust­

production system is being simplified, reducing vulnera­
bility to disruptions and increasing production stability. For
long-term predictable transport services, we manage a
stable quality network with high frequencies and guaran­
teed resources. By contrast, short-term transport services
are assured by reviewing all the necessary resources before
accepting orders.

The creation of continuous responsibilities in the corridors
is intended to enable management of transport services from
a single source in the future. The more flexible working con­
­ditions for drivers also ensure more efficient processes. The
operational concepts for local transport are designed to
optimize resource utilization. Sales are rigorously focused
on customer needs, and are further developing a modern
yield management system. The European network portfolio
is being strategically expanded to take advantage of the
growth potential on international corridors as part of a net­

Action plan for Germany plus

After three years, the end of 2016 marked the conclusion of
the action plan for Germany plus (Aktionsplan Deutschland Plus;
APD plus). During the year under review, APD plus made a pos­
itive contribution to the profit situation of DB Cargo AG. The
largest accumulated contributions to profits compared to
the previous year came from the measures aimed at opti­
mizing local dimensions, reducing personnel-related over­
heads, and driving a sales approach that focuses on capac­
­ity utilization.
Generally speaking, measures aimed at increasing effi­
ciency in respect of material costs or revenues proved to be
more successful than those that were strongly personnel-­
related, some of which were implemented with a delay.
These topics are particular areas of focus in Railway of the
Future @ DB Cargo. In order to further strengthen DB Car­
go’s capital expenditure capacity, topics producing positive
contributions to profits are being perpetuated within the
line organization.

Investments

Cargo Czechia s.r.o., Ostrava/Czech Republic, has
been active in the market since February 2016, expanding
the European network of DB Cargo. The new company
offers competitive alternative routes for transit trans­
port between German ports and destinations in South­
East Europe in Hungary, Bulgaria or Romania.

We rewon the steel producer ArcelorMittal’s contract for
rail transport services. The contract has a term of sev­
eral years and governs a transport volume of 42 million
tons in total.
In preparation for the anticipated growing demand for
trans-Alpine transport services now that the Gotthard
Base Tunnel has been opened and in view of other down­
­stream construction measures, DB Cargo fitted around
60 locomotives with ETCS. The volume of capital expen­
ditures amounted to about € 20 million.
Since October 2016, TFG Transfracht has been respon­
sible for BMW ’s seaport hinterland transport needs
from the region around Regensburg to the sea ports in
Bremerhaven and Hamburg. The contract runs for a term
of six years. In conjunction with the extension of the
contract, BMW is converting the transports to DBeco
plus, thus doubling its volume of CO₂-free transport.
The LEADER (Locomotive Engineer Assist Display and
Event Recorder) driver assistance system was put into
service on 300 electric locomotives. On a display in the
driver’s cabin, LEADER provides train drivers with infor­
mation about the right speed for saving as much energy
as possible for the schedule and route profile.
BMW has again commissioned DB Cargo to transport
vehicle parts from Germany on the trans-Siberian route as
far as Shenyang in North China. The contract has a term
of several years. During the year under review, DB Cargo
was able to cut rail transport time to China from 23 days
to less than 17 days.
In April 2016, DB Cargo opened a new automobile ter­
minal measuring 75,000 m² and offering space for 2,000
automobiles at the Mercedes-Benz plant in Bremen. A
hall has also been built on the premises for vehicle rework
and checks. The volume of capital expenditures amounted
to about € 15 million.

Europe remained challeng­
­ing for rail freight trans­
port during the year under review. In addition, the intense
competitive environment had a negative impact on devel­
opment. Transport services won in the European network
only partially offset the negative effects. Performance
development weakened as a result. The volume of freight
carried and volume sold both decreased. Measures put in
place to improve efficiency enabled us to raise the capacity
utilization per train slightly.
Revenue development was weaker than in the previous
year, mainly as a result of smaller coal and steel transport
volumes in Great Britain and Germany, and exchange rate
effects. Strike effects had a negative effect in the previous
year.

Performance development declined in region Central,
driven by the development in Germany where the intense
com­­petitive environment persisted and the development of
goods predisposed to rail transport, such as coal and steel,

was weaker due mainly to lower demand. Growth from addi­
­tional transport services in Italy and Scandinavia, and the
omission of strike effects from the previous year were only
able to partially offset this development. The implementa­
tion of optimizations enabled us to largely keep ca­­pacity
utilization stable.
Higher internal services caused revenues to increase. Ex­­
ternal revenues declined for performance-related reasons.
Other operating income (+37.5%) increased, mainly due
to higher income from the disposal of rolling stock.
Cost of materials (+ 9.4%) increased, mainly as a result of
a larger volume of purchased transport services.
Personnel expenses (+ 0.4%) increased slightly as a result
of collective bargaining agreements. This increase was partly
offset by the lower number of employees.
Other operating expenses (– 9.1%) were lower, partly as
a result of capitalizing IT development costs.
Depreciation (– 45.5%) was significantly lower following
the impairment in 2015.
Despite weak operating development, the operating
profit figures improved due to income from the sale of vehi­
cles. Adjusted EBIT also improved as a result of the impair­
ment in 2015.
Effects from the capitalization of IT development costs
caused a marked increase in gross capital expenditures. The
increase was also due to the purchase of locomotive utili­
zation rights.
Compared to December 31, 2015, the number of employ­
­ees decreased, mainly due to restructuring measures.

The development in region West was mainly driven by the
slump in the coal market in Great Britain and declining steel
production in Europe. Business performance development
was very weak as a result. Freight carried decreased con­
siderably, as did both volume sold and volume produced. In
addition to a statutory change (CO ₂ taxation), the other
factor driving the development of coal transport services
was primarily low natural gas prices, leading to combined-­
cycle power plants switching from coal operation to gas
firing. Performance was also adversely affected by losses of
transport contracts in France and a cut in the commissioned
transport route.
Revenues decreased considerably in the wake of the
performance development and due to negative exchange
rate effects.
Other operating income (+10.6%) increased as a result
of higher rental income for locomotives. This increase was
partially offset by negative exchange rate effects.
Cost of materials (– 9.3%) decreased in the wake of ex­­
change rate and performance effects, and due to lower diesel
prices.
Exchange rate effects and a performance-related reduc­
tion in the number of employees were the main reasons be­­
hind the lower personnel expenses (–10.7%).
Depreciation (–15.4%) decreased, mainly as a result of
the unscheduled impairment on property, plant and equip­
ment in 2015.
Other operating expenses (–19.1%) also declined due to
exchange rate effects.
Since the lower revenues were only partially offset by
lower expenses, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT de­­
creased significantly.
Gross capital expenditures were much lower, following
major capital expenditures in locomotives in 2015.
The number of employees declined following adjust­
ment to the poorer business conditions in Great Britain and
France.

Year on year, volume produced and sold improved in region
East, mainly as a result of changes to the goods portfolio
in Romania and additional transport volumes in Russia. The
volume of freight carried remained stable.
Revenue development was positive for performance-re­
lated reasons. Exchange rate effects had an opposite effect.
Other operating income (–19.9%) decreased, partly due
to exchange rate effects. The figure for the previous year
was, moreover, impacted by compensation payments for
Class 92 locomotives.
Cost of materials (+20.0%) increased, mainly as a result
of higher purchased transport services in Russia. Positive
exchange rate effects in Poland and lower energy expenses
as a result of price and volume effects had a dampening
effect.
Personnel expenses (– 0.3%) decreased due to exchange
rate effects. Adjusted for exchange rate effects, they in­­
creased as a result of collective bargaining agreements and
following the recruitment of new employees in Romania.
Other operating expenses (+ 0.1%) recorded stable devel­
­opment. Depreciation (–17.8%) was considerably lower due
to the impairment charges recognized in 2015.
In light of the disproportionate increase in expenses,
adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA declined noticeably.
Gross capital expenditures were much lower, following
major capital expenditures in locomotives in Poland in 2015.
The number of employees increased, mainly due to the
recruitment of new employees in Romania. Optimizations
in Poland had the opposite effect.

provider. More than one billion train-path kilometers are
traveled each year on the tracks in Germany. The most im­­
portant sources of income are revenues from train-path
products, which constitute over 90% of total revenues. Train-­
­path prices are established on a transparent basis by a
train-path pricing system regulated by the BNetzA .
DB Netze Track is also responsible for managing infra­
structure operations as well as for securing long-term infra­
structure quality and availability and non-discriminatory
access to train-paths and service facilities. This includes
preparing timetables in close cooperation with customers,
operations management, construction management and
maintenance.
The cost structure is determined by fixed costs. The rail
network is one of the most important cost drivers. The use
of resources for operation and maintenance of infrastructure
is very much influenced by specific facility characteristics,
requirements relating to operational opening hours, and
the degree of rationalization in operating business activi­
ties. As the dimensions of the infrastructure only change in
the long term due to new or expansion construction proj­
ects or targeted dismantling, optimal capacity utilization
of the existing infrastructure is of major importance for eco­
­nomic success. A high level of quality and availability for
the train operating companies also calls for a forward-­
looking integrated capital expenditures and maintenance
strategy. Capacity utilization is measured by train kilome­
ters on track infrastrucuture. In terms of relative network
capacity utilization, this figure can be compared to length
of line operated.
To reach our 10% growth target in train-path kilometers
by 2025, it is essential that new and expansion construction
projects concentrate on removing bottlenecks and on the
creation of additional capacities for growth in transport in
the main corridors and metropolitan areas. The budgetary
resources of public authorities, in particular the Federal
Government, are of considerable relevance for the financing
of replacement capital expenditures in the existing infra­
structure, as well as for the financing of new and expansion
construction projects. In this respect, integration of an entre­
­preneurial infrastructure into the Group structure is essen­
tial for enabling DB Group to continue making a high con­
tribution to the co-financing of these infrastructure measures.

The contributions made by the Federal Government to the
infrastructure financing Ε are of material importance to
secure the competitiveness of rail as a mode of transport.
A central instrument for this is the PERFORMANCE AND FINAN­
­C ING AGREEMENT [ PAGE 2 49 ] .
◊ ◊ ECONOMIC ¿ dimension: By developing infrastructure in
line with customer and market requirements, we enable
the entire rail transport sector to take advantage of
opportunities for growth. Our vision places the focus on
customers: “Together with our customers, we make rail
the first choice.” This is how we make our contribution to
the competitiveness of rail. With a strong focus on the
economic objectives, three key strategic anchor points
will help us achieve this vision: an increase in quality,
better control of capacity and a radical simplification of
the customer interface. The program Transport Network
of the Future was derived along the strategic anchors
quality, capacity and simplicity. Transport Network of the
Future combines all projects that have a significant in­­flu­
­ence on the objectives. Increasing customer satisfaction

requires optimum utilization and capacity control. In ad­­
dition to creating additional capacity, we want to mod­­er­nize and maintain the network efficiently and in line
with requirements. Integrated capital expenditures and
main­tenance expenses planning as well as concentrating
construction sites into corridors and integrating them
into the annual schedule will ensure the most efficient use
of resources. At the same time, we strive to minimize the
effects for our customers. We attempt to guarantee high
availability and quality of infrastructure in spite of ever-­
increasing transport volume. We incorporate a network
development strategy created on the basis of customer
requirements into the Federal Transport Infrastructure
Plan. We have established an additional infra­­­­structure
financing instrument in the form of the network fund.
◊ ◊ SOCIAL † dimension: Our employee structure is defined
by a high average age. Successful recruitment and timely
training for our employees is therefore crucial. Further­
more, we make use of the opportunities provided by the

≈≈ Events in 2016

Lawsuits due to train accident concluded

At the beginning of February 2016, a serious train accident
occurred on the line between Bad Aibling and Kolbermoor
in Bavaria. The casualties included 12 fatalities and nu­­mer­
­ous injuries. The accident was caused by several mistakes
made by the traffic controller. On December 5, 2016, he was
sentenced to prison by the Traunstein District Court.

Major new electronic interlocking
under construction

Construction work on new electronic interlocking (elektro­
nisches Stellwerk; ESTW) in Osnabrück started in May. In the
future, the new signal tower will control the 63 km Natrup –­
­Hagen – Lembruch section on the Münster – Bremen line as
well as the 35 km Wissin­­gen – Velpe section on the Löhne –
Rhine line and will replace 16 old signal towers. This makes
the ESTW one of the largest in Germany. The Federal Govern­
ment and DB Group are investing about € 175 million in this.

Digital planning and construction

We are also focusing on digitalization Δ in the planning
and implementation of infrastructure projects. In October,
a collective agreement was signed for the financing of
Building Information Modeling (BIM) under the FUTURE
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES PROGR AM [ PAGE 1 3 4 ] . BIM combines the
object-oriented 3D representation of construction projects
with information on deadlines, costs, schedules of service
and data relevant to the business. Digital planning and con­
struction increases transparency and significantly reduces
risks in the planning and construction process. DB Netze
Track tested the digital work methodology on 13 pilot proj­
ects, including expansion sections of the Emmerich – Ober­
­hausen line, the Rhine-Ruhr-Express and Karlsruhe – Basel
and the Fehmarn Belt crossing.

Digitalization in maintenance

DB Netz AG makes use of the opportunities created by dig­

italization Δ and technological innovations in the mainte­
nance of the rail network Ε in order to ensure a high-quality
railway infrastructure.
Within the framework of the standardization of produc­
tion system maintenance, the scheduling and feedback pro­
cess of operational maintenance are being standardized and
digitalized company-wide. The rollout of level 1 was largely
completed in the year under review. With this step, the main­
tenance organization now functions digitally. For example,
the digital analysis of bridges was introduced.
Another opportunity presented by digitalization is digital
switch diagnostics for predictive maintenance. In order to
optimize the availability of switches, a digital remote diag­
nostic system is used to detect potential faults before they
can occur. In this system, the measurement of the actuating
current of the switch is recognized early on when the func­
tionality of a switch is no longer guaranteed, for example
due to contamination of its mechanical parts. This gives
main­­tenance an indication of a possible fault, allowing pre­
ventive measures to be taken. In the year under review, more
than 6,600 switches were equipped with actuating current
diagnostic systems. By the end of 2020, the system will cover
more than 30,000 switches.
The fiber-optic sensing system detects obstacles on tracks,
monitors the condition of the superstructure and vehicles,
and detects cable thefts, thus allowing countermeasures to
be initiated. The system uses existing lightwave cable infra­
structure on the track to record noise, capture it digitally,
and assign it to a unique event. The cause of the noise can
be identified and analyzed to determine whether a fault is
present. After the system had already been used as a pilot in
the Landrücken tunnel for some time, it was introduced on
further test lines in the year under review.

Noise-based train-path pricing system
supports conversion of freight cars

The noise-based train-path pricing system (Lärmabhängiges
Trassenpreissystem; LaTPS) currently provides for a sur­
charge of 3% on the regular train-path price for loud freight
trains. Freight trains consisting of 90% cars with quiet
braking technology are exempt from the surcharge. In the
working timetable period of 2015/2016 about € 13 million
was generated, all of which was used to finance bonus pay­
ments for train operating companies that have equipped
their freight cars with composite brake shoes. In 2016, we
received and approved a total of 11,025 applications for
2015 in the LaTPS (2014: 5,388) to promote the noise-reme­
diation of existing freight cars. A total of € 2.34 million was
paid as a bonus to the train operating companies on the

Financing planning for 21 major projects

In September 2016, BMVI and DB Group signed the collec­
tive agreement 46 within the framework of the future cap­
ital expenditures program to finance planning costs. From
2016 to 2018, the Federal Government is providing about
€ 138 million for the design and approval planning of 21
new construction and expansion projects to enable the
planning of projects such as the expansion of the Frankfurt,
Hamburg and Munich hubs and the Karlsruhe – Basel line.

◊ ◊ In the Nuremberg– Ebensfeld expansion line, the Erlan­
­gen – Baiersdorf section will be completed shortly, and
the sections Baiersdorf – Forchheim and Breitengrüß­
bach – Ebensfeld are under construction.
◊ ◊ The first test runs have been taken on the Ebensfeld –
Erfurt new construction line, the completion of the
southern traction current line has been completed, the
overhead wire has been permanently connected and the
ESTW technology has been installed.
◊ ◊ At the Halle hub, on a stretch of about 12 km, bridges,
tracks, stations, a marshaling yard and signal tower
technology are being built.
◊ ◊ Construction work in the Erfurt hub was completed early.
◊ ◊ In the Leipzig hub, work has started on increasing the
entry speed.
◊ ◊ Feeder lines are also under construction, such as the
Erfurt – Eisenach line.
VDE 8.1 is scheduled to be operational with the 2017 time­
table change.

Expansion of northern Brenner feeder line

On behalf of the Federal Government, DB Netze Track is
working with ÖBB INFRA in the Inn Valley between Kufstein
and Rosenheim on a train-path selection process for a new
construction line to the Brenner Base Tunnel. This is done
as part of a process involving participation from within the
entire region.

Fehmarn Belt crossing rail connection

The design phase started in 2016; the first section on plan
approval will be submitted in the summer of 2017. Comple­
tion of the electrified, two-track new construction and
expansion line is planned for 2024. According to the Danish
Ministry of Transport, the commissioning of the Fehmarn
Belt tunnel is expected to be delayed from 2026 to 2028
due to the ongoing plan approval procedure on the German
side. The preliminary plans for an alternative Fehmarn Belt
crossing to be completed in 2028 are currently underway.

Munich S -Bahn (metro)

Plans for all sections of the project involving the second
main S-Bahn (metro) line in Munich have been approved,
but some lawsuits are still pending. The cost planning was
revised on the basis of the first calls for tenders. As a result,
total costs were set at € 3.84 billion, including a risk buffer.
A group of experts set up by the Free State of Bavaria has
confirmed that costing was done appropriately. The Federal
Government recommended the inclusion in category A of
the Municipal Transport Financing Act (Gemeindeverkehrs­
finanzierungsgesetz; GVFG) program. In December 2016,
the Free State of Bavaria confirmed the unconditional full
funding of the measure. The concluded construction and
financing contract thus became legally binding. Ground­
breaking is scheduled for April 2017.

Expansion of the Cologne S -Bahn (metro) begun

In September 2016, the planning agreement for the exten­
sion of the S 11 in Cologne between DB Netz AG, DB Station&
Service AG, the NRW Transport Ministry and the local trans­
port network of the Rhineland (Nahverkehr Rheinland; NVR)
was signed. Negotiations on a similar agreement for the S 12
(electrification of the Erft railway) are also taking place. In
November 2016, the groundbreaking of the 13-km-long ex­­
tension of the S 13 followed. In addition to new construction
and renovation of the line, two new stops are being built
and four stops are being rebuilt. The heavily traveled Cologne
railway hub is one of the biggest bottlenecks in the national
and international network. Core elements for the elimination
of the bottleneck are the expansion of the S-Bahn (metro)
main line and the use of modernized, more powerful com­
mand and control technology. The expansion of both S-Bahn
(metro) lines is part of an overall concept which is designed
to effectively take pressure off of the Cologne hub.

Progress in other projects
◊◊

Large parts of the line between Karlsruhe and Offenburg
and the Katzenberg tunnel are already in operation. At the
end of May 2016, the first pipe-jacking machine started
work on the Raststatter tunnel, another milestone in

the project. The second machine started work on the
4,270-m-long structure at the end of September. Con­
struction work is going on as well between the Katzen­
berg Tunnel and the Swiss border. In January 2016, a
decision by the German parliament (Bundestag) en­
sured that the necessary steps would be taken to enable
planning of the sections between Offenburg and Riegel
as well as Hügelheim and Auggen to commence.
◊ ◊ Public consultation on the Hanau – Würzburg/Fulda line,
which is part of the train-path selection process, was con­
­tinued. The members of the dialog forum made nu­mer­ous
comments and suggestions which were incorporated
into the planning. The best route is to be determined
by the second half of 2017.

Relieving pressure on the Frankfurt railway hub

The Frankfurt hub is one of the most heavily frequented in
Germany. The following measures ensure that the site is fit
for the future:
◊ ◊ The new Gateway Gardens district near the airport will
receive its own S-Bahn (metro) connection by the end of
2019. The main construction work has begun.
◊ ◊ The main construction work on the S6 between Frankfurt
West and Bad Vilbel were started.
◊ ◊ Initial discussions on planning of the construction of the
northern Main S -Bahn (metro) between Hanau and
Frankfurt took place.
◊ ◊ The plan changes for the further development of the
Frankfurt stadium hub have been submitted.
◊ ◊ The plan approval decision for the two-track expansion
of Homburger Damm has been legally binding since Jan­
uary 2016. The financing contract has been concluded,
which will allow construction work to begin in 2017.
◊ ◊ The relay interlocking, which has controlled metro trans­
­port on the tunnel main line since 1978, will be replaced
by electronic interlocking by 2018.

Start of one of the biggest network tunnel
construction projects as part of LuFV

Construction of the new 909 m Pforzheim tunnel commenced
on January 15, 2016. The capital expenditures amount to
about € 88 million. With the actual tunneling, construction
of the interior and technical equipment, the work will go on
until September 2018. The renovation of the Pforzheim
tunnel is one of the largest tunnel construction measures
in our infrastructure improvement acceleration program.

Overall satisfaction increased slightly once again.
The train kilometers on track infrastructure increased due
to higher demand from non-Group customers, especially
from regional and freight transport. Demand from intra-Group
customers for regional passenger transport and freight trans­
­port declined, which had a dampening effect.
Total revenues increased, mainly due to price adjust­
ments and the absence of negative effects associated with
storms and GDL strikes in the previous year. Lower demand
from intra-Group customers had the opposite effect. The
development of external revenues, along with price effects,
reflects the increase in demand from non-Group customers.
Other operating income (– 9.4%) decreased, mainly due
to lower income from property sales.
Cost of materials (– 0.3%) remained virtually unchanged
as a result of lower expenditures for energy and purchased
transport services, countered by increased maintenance
expenses.
The increase in personnel expenses (+7.7%) was primarily
due to collective wage agreements and the larger number
of employees due to intra-Group transfers of employees of the
S-Bahn (metro) Berlin, and to the need for more manpower

≈≈ DB Netze Stations business unit
≈≈ Business model

DB Netze Stations is the largest station operator in Europe.

In addition to the core business, the development and oper­
ation of stations, the business unit offers a variety of mobility-­
­oriented services in and around stations. With around one
million m² of leasing area, we are among Germany’s largest
commercial landlords.
Each day, more than 400,000 trains from 117 train oper­
ating companies with more than 17 million passengers use our
stations. We set priorities in the areas of safety, service and
cleanliness so that we can offer customers a high degree of
quality. Railway operations are coordinated via the opera­
tions control centers. The station management on-site takes
care of the facility management and services for passengers.
Infrastructure is characterized by high fixed costs. The
number of stops is one of the most important cost drivers.
The use of resources for operation and maintenance of

infrastructure is very much influenced by specific facility
characteristics, requirements relating to operational opening
hours, and the degree of rationalization in operating business
activities.
Sources of income are revenues from station stops (regu­
­­lated) and from leasing out commercial space (not regu­
lated). Revenues from station stops make up about 70% of
total revenues.
Key resources include attractive stations and concourse
buildings in order to channel flows of people. Our most
important regulatory partners are the BNetzA and the EBA.

≈≈ Markets and strategy

Stations are increasingly becoming meeting places in
today’s mobile society and forming the hub of multimodal
transport systems. With our about 5,400 stations, we con­
tribute greatly to this development. Our vision of stations as
hubs for people and mobility is clearly seen in our “Stations
2020” strategy.

Within the framework of R AILWAY OF THE FUTURE
,
€ 16 million was invested in extensive modernization mea­
sures for underground passenger transport facilities, in
particular in Frankfurt am Main, in the year under review.
One of the highlights is the Ostendstraße S-Bahn (metro)
station; the stationʼs vaults were redesigned and 6,600 m²
was enhanced visually by international artists.

Digitalization in facilities management

DB 01

‡

In the year under review, about 2,100 elevators and about
1,000 escalators were equipped with intelligent communi­
cation modules Δ , which enable system conditions to be
recorded in real time, making it possible to initiate necessary
repairs at an early stage. A new concept for securing the
availability of facilities relevant for customers in 97% of all
metropolitan areas was put into practice. The core is pro­
vided by remediation teams which ensure short response
times 365 days a year and a professional supply of spare
parts as well as ma­terial logistics to decrease repair times.
Passengers and visitors can check the operating status of
the facilities using the DB

multimodal design of the transport systems of the future.
Long-distance bus stops, taxi stops and charging infra­
structure for electric cars and e-bikes make the station an
indispensable part of the urban infrastructure. Free WiFi
access at major stations allows passengers to spend
their waiting time in a meaningful way, in comfortable
waiting areas in the concourse buildings and on the
platform. The expansion of accessibility combined with
an extension of our mobility service, new digital pas­
senger information media, digitally available informa­
tion on escalators and elevators, as well as a comprehen­
sive refurbishment of the toilet facilities are helping to
increase the satisfaction of our customers. The quality
initiative, which is implemented in the context of R AILWAY

‡ ◊ ◊ SOCIAL † dimension: We work continuously on further
developing our corporate culture and the satisfaction of

our employees. Our guidelines in this effort are the five
elements of customer focus, cooperation, leadership,
responsibility and performance. At the same time, a per­

and being able to accept criticism, always includes an
appreciation for the contribution that every employee
makes to the company. A common target culture is cre­
ated in dialog formats and through quality management.
We use tools such as the promotion of continuing voca­

investigate the use of innovative lighting technologies,
geothermal energy production, combined heat and
power generation, or photovoltaic systems at all sites.

The number of station stops increased, mainly due to in­­
creased schedule frequencies in regional transport. In addi­
tion, there was a shift in demand from intra-Group custo­mers
to non-Group customers as a result of failures to win tenders.
Facilities quality is assessed locally and is determined on
the basis of a detailed calculation and weighting algorithm
in accordance with the provisions of the LUFV II [ PAGE 2 49 ] .
The good qual­­ity level of facilities was slightly improved.
To assess customer satisfaction, about 29,000 passen­ ‡
gers are asked each year, in two waves, about their satis­ G4-PR5
faction with the stations, and annually about 60 tenants
and about 90 transport authorities are surveyed about their
satisfaction. The satisfaction figures were varied. The
decline in customer satisfaction among TOCs and transport
authorities is mainly the result of lower satisfaction on the
part of transport authorities in the areas of equipment and
condition of stations, schedule information and railway
operations.

Employee satisfaction is unchanged as a result of the stability
of the main area of action “communication, information and
integration.”
The share of women changed only slightly.
With the further reduction of the primary energy con­
sumption of the stations, for example through the use of
energy-saving technologies, the positive trend of the past
years contin­ued.

≈≈ DB Netze Energy business unit
≈≈ Business model

DB Netze Energy offers all of the conventional indus­­try

energy products in Germany in the fields of traction energy
and statio­nary energy. These include traction current and
diesel for rail transport, as well as electricity, gas and heat
to stations and other DB Group properties. Furthermore,
DB Netze Energy supplies industrial customers throughout
Germany with a broad array of electricity and gas products.
The service portfolio is rounded out with energy econom­
ics-related consulting and technical services. The core com­
petencies of DB Netze Energy are its experience in energy
economics-related issues and its position as an integrated
provider of energy.
The technical backbone of traction current supply in
Germany is our traction current grid, which offers a high
level of supply reliability. Traction current plants, con­
verters and transformers feed the required electricity into
the traction current grid. A second important pillar is the
Germany-wide network of refueling stations, some of which
can also be used by road vehicles. In addition, DB Netze
Energy operates 50 Hz medium-voltage networks for
energy supply to stations. DB Netze Energy also offers a
charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. The infrastruc­
ture operated by DB Netze Energy is to a high degree and
in varying forms subject to regulation by the BNetzA .

≈≈ Markets and strategy

The main tasks of DB Netze Energy are the economical and
environmentally efficient procurement of energy and the
reliable supply of energy for TOCs. In addition to structured
energy procurement and the effective control of auxiliary
energy costs, we counter risks of volatile commodity prices
using a hedging strategy established in DB Group; changes
in taxes and fees are compensated to the greatest degree
possible. We also have a high-performance infrastructure
Ε for the provision of electricity and diesel to mobile and
stationary consumers.
◊ ◊ ECONOMIC ¿ dimension: DB Netze Energy offers one of
Europeʼs highest levels of supply reliability for rail trans­
port. Thus far, we have exceeded the supply reliability

G ROUP MANAG EMENT REPORT

The rise in revenues is attributable to higher station reve­
nues as a result of volume and prices as well as higher
revenues from rental and leasing. The development of
external revenues, along with price effects, reflects the
increase in demand from
non-Group customers.

Law on the digitalization of the energy
transition enters into force

In September 2016, the law on metering station operation
and data communication in intelligent energy networks
entered into force as part of the omnibus bill for the digita­
lization of the energy transition Δ . The use of smart elec­
tric meters will make an important contribution to better
linking the increasingly volatile production and consump­
tion of electricity to each other. As a network operator, DB
Netze Energy is also affected by the new regulations in the
stationary sector and will have to equip some 58,000 sam­
pling points with new measuring devices by 2032.

Commissionʼs findings on the financing
of the nuclear energy phase-out

Based on the Commissionʼs recommendations to review the
financing of the nuclear energy phase-out, the legislature
has enacted regulations governing how the financing of the
nuclear phase-out for shutting down, dismantling and dis­
posal can be ensured in the long term. The operators
remain responsible for shutting down and dismantling
nuclear power plants. The Federal Government is assuming
responsibility for the interim and final disposal of radioac­
tive waste and to this end has established a public fund
into which operators transfer the provisions they have

formed (as of December 31, 2015: € 17.4 billion). In addition,
the Federal Government is assuming all cost and interest
rate risks against payment of a lump-sum risk premium of
35% to the present value of the provisions.
As a result of its shareholding in the Neckar joint power
plant, DB AG will have a payment obligation of € 389
million.

Lawsuits due to the traction
current pricing system

DB Netze Energy was taken to court by several TOCs for

damages due to improper traction current pricing in the
past. The years 2009 to 2014 are affected. Frankfurt am
Main Regional Court accepted the claims to the greatest
possible extent at the beginning of June 2015. An appeal
against the Courtʼs decision was lodged. Further lawsuits
are pending at the Regional Court. These are suspended
until the decision by the Higher Regional Court.

Deutsche Bahn Group – 2016 Integrated Report

The high level of supply reliability was maintained.
We survey about 230 customers each year regarding
‡
G4-PR5 customer satisfaction. Satisfaction, already at a high level,
improved further. The quality Β of the consulting services
and the information on the range of services in the area of​​
energy supply were perceived as better than in the previous
year.
Sales of traction current increased. In freight and regional
transport, the increase in non-Group customers due to intra­
­modal shifts was above average. Demand from DB Long-­
Distance was noticeably higher than in the previous year as
well. The absence of the effects of storms as well as strikes
by the GDL in the previous year had a positive effect overall.
The traction current volumes passed through on behalf
of non-Group customers increased as price competition has
become fiercer since the traction current grid opened.
The area of stationary energies is strongly influenced
by the development of non-Group demand, which con­
tinued to grow significantly. In addition to significant
growth in the industrial customer segment, portfolio opti­
mization continued to be important.
The increase in demand

In spite of rising sales volumes, revenues de­clined.
DB Group customers revenues decreased as a result of the
development of primary energy prices for electricity and
diesel products. The increase in demand from non-Group
customers in the area of stationary energy and traction
energy partially compensated for this.
Other operating income (+10.9%) increased due to
one-off effects from provisions for the shutting down and
disposal of the Neckar joint power plant. In addition, the
release of provisions for power plant settlements and
energy charges had a noticeable effect.
The cost of materials (–3.9%) decreased as prices in the
primary energy markets fell, and as a result of savings from
the Mannheim and Neckar power plant contracts in combi­
nation with positive effects from the final settlement for
the previous year. Higher sales-related purchase volumes
of electricity and diesel had an opposite effect, as did
increased maintenance expenses.

Personnel expenses (+ 0.8%) increased slightly as a result

≈≈ DB Arriva business unit
≈≈ Business model

DB Arriva is our European growth platform in passenger

transport. With buses, trains, trams, water buses and
non-­emergency patient transport, we offer a broad range
of transport services in 14 European countries. The activities of DB Arriva are divided into three lines of business:
UK Bus, UK Trains as well as Mainland Europe (Northern
Europe as well as Southern, Central and Eastern Europe).
Customers are primarily regional and national authorities
or other contracting organizations.
Proximity to local markets and the ability to adjust to
complex legislative environments and fulfill growing customer requirements are of major importance for reaching
our targets.

We are working together with our most important partners – our customers – to design efficient and sustainable
transport mobility solutions.
Revenues are generated primarily from orders for transport services, along with our own transport services. Contracting organizations especially appreciate our strengths
in the areas of efficiency, reliability, price-performance
ratio and customer service.
Contracts for ordered transport services can be de­
signed in different ways, ranging from gross contracts with
fixed revenues to contracts with revenue risk or bonus/
penalty rules relating to quality or passenger numbers.
By contrast, for transport services that we operate on our
own, ticket sales are the primary source of income.
For ordered transport services, vehicles are sometimes
provided by the contracting organization. Costs are therefore driven primarily by personnel and energy expenses.

The DB2020+ strategy forms the foundation of DB Arriva’s
strategy which is based on the vision statement “Arriva for
your whole journey” and focuses on four key themes: a
strong foundation, growth through continuous improvement, the best employees, and being preferred by customers by providing the best mobility solutions.
‡ ◊ ◊ ECONOMIC ¿ dimension: Profitable growth is only possible if we provide high-quality services and have satisDB 03
fied customers. To achieve this, we are continuously
investing in new vehicles and improving our customer
information systems. In addition, we are introducing
new ticketing systems through mobile and online solutions. Our innovations in the UK rail market received
industry awards and recognition for using the latest
advance booking and ticketing solutions – setting standards for quality and customer satisfaction. Profitable
growth is our basis for guaranteeing a stable and sustain­
­­ably successful business. We accomplish this primarily
by taking part in tenders for transport contracts and
through acquisitions. In the UK Bus business, we aim to
optimize existing business and expand the services
offered to customers. For example, our premium bus
service, Sapphire, continues to post strong growth and
is expanding further. In UK Trains we began operating
the Northern Rail franchise and London Overground
concession. We want to strengthen and continue to
expand our existing transport contracts in UK rail, winning additional contracts and growing our presence in
the open-access market. Across our Mainland Europe
line of business, we are growing with newly won transport contracts, including the LIMBURG [ PAGE 28 F.] bus and

164

rail contract in the Netherlands. We remain focused on
acquisition activities and the expansion of our existing
business. The liberalization of the European transport
markets is also creating opportunities in Southern,
Central and Eastern Europe, where we have experienced
further progress over the past 12 months, including
acquisitions in the Czech Republic, Spain and Italy.
◊ ◊ SOCIAL † dimension: Satisfied employees are an es­­
sential component of our success. Our attractiveness as
an employer enables us to recruit and retain talented
executives and outstanding specialists. As part of this ‡
commitment, we launched our employer brand, which DB 05
is underpinned by our fundamental value “Together –
we are Arriva.” Our graduate scheme has brought more
graduates into the business, and we have seen a continued increase in the number of apprentices across the
whole of DB Arriva.
◊ ◊ ENVIRONMENTAL ¥ dimension: The launch of Destina- ‡
tion Green has set out DB Arriva’s environmental ambi- G4-EN27
tions and advises employees on how they can reduce
their own environmental impact. Destination Green has
the key themes of fuel, energy, water and waste and
provides an overarching strategic framework for the
environment which connects all environmental activities at DB Arriva. To continually improve our carbon
footprint we maintain various partnerships with leading
bus manufacturers to further promote the use of alternative energy sources, and new vehicle and engine de­
signs. In addition we have also implemented measures
to reduce water and energy consumption and waste.
We have equipped a number of our sites with rainwater
collection systems, solar modules and wind turbines.

Expanding the European network

Arriva has been awarded the contract to operate the
London Overground network. The concession, with a
revenue value of about € 1.8 billion, started on No­vem­
­ber 13, 2016, and runs for seven and a half years with the
option of a two-year extension. DB Arriva had previously
been operating the London Overground network with
a joint-venture partner.
◊ ◊ At the beginning of April 2016, DB Arriva began operating
the NORTHERN R AIL FR ANCHISE [ PAGE 26 F.] in Northern
England. Since then it is operated by Arriva Rail North.
The franchise runs until March 2025 and is worth about
€ 10 billion in revenues. With more than 5,000 em­­
ployees and 333 trains, Arriva Rail North currently transports about 90 million passengers annually between
towns and cities in Northern England. The franchise will
involve expanding services and investing in extensive
modernization. For example, over the next three years,
Arriva Rail North plans to increase the number of services offered by 12%, offer numerous new connections,
invest in more than 280 new carriages, and completely
renovate the rest of the fleet.

‡

Arriva has won a bus and rail transport contract in
the Dutch province of Limburg with a term of 15 years
and a contract value of more than € 2 billion in revenues. By 2026, 226 new emissions-free buses and 36
trains are scheduled for deployment.
DB Arriva is offering a new train connection in the
Greater Prague area. The service, which is operated on
a purely commercial basis, has performed well since its
launch. About 10,000 passengers take the express train
monthly and the trend is increasing.
DB Arriva has commenced new bus services in the
Polish capital of Warsaw having won an eight-year contract in April 2016. To service the routes, 130 bus drivers
were recruited.
DB Arriva has signed the transport contract for bus
transport in the Nitra region in Slovakia in February
2016. The transport contract has a term of ten years and
worth about € 304 million.
Long-distance lines expansion is going on with the
“Arriva Express” brand, with 58 buses currently running
on 21 lines across Europe.

Additional environmentally friendly buses

Arriva operates over 450 hybrid buses in the UK
alone. It also started making older diesel buses more
eco-friendly in the UK. The technology, being trialed on
two Euro 3 buses in London, works by replacing the old
diesel unit with a new diesel/electric hybrid unit. The
retrofit hybrid pack has the potential to extend the life
of older buses, while reducing emissions.
◊ ◊ In the Netherlands, DB Arriva operates CO₂-free trains
that run on electricity supplied from wind power. DB
Arrivaʼs fleet in the Czech Republic, Sweden, Italy, the
Netherlands, Denmark, Slovakia and Great Britain in­
cludes more than 280 buses powered by natural gas,
either in compressed or liquefied form. Biodiesel is used
to power buses in other countries, including Sweden
and Portugal. In addition an extra 19 electric buses were
introduced in the Netherlands and two in the Czech
Republic, and 32 additional gas buses were introduced
into DB Arriva’s fleet, including in the Czech Republic
and Demark.

Change

Previous yearsʼ figures adjusted.

The decline in the number of passengers in the bus business in Great Britain resulted from changes in the contract
portfolio. The year-on-year effectiveness of the loss of lines
in London from the previous year and a reduction in traffic
in the regions outside London, among other things as a
result of increasing online shopping, had a negative effect.
Overall, operating performance declined.
Exchange rate effects had a major adverse impact on
revenues. Volume losses in London, difficult market conditions outside London and other portfolio changes also
contributed to the reduction in revenues.
Cost of materials decreased (–15.2%), mainly as a result
of exchange rate effects and volume losses in London.
Personnel expenses declined (– 4.2%) due to exchange
rate effects. Adjusted for exchange rate effects, these ex­­
penses increased due to a one-off benefit related to pension
adjustments in the previous year.
Year-on-year adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT performance were considerably weaker. The main drivers were
the impact of the previous year one-off benefit in personnel
expenses, weaker revenues and a negative exchange rate
impact.
Gross capital expenditures reduced, mainly due to
exchange rate effects and a decline in capital expenditures
in the regions outside London. This decline was partially
offset by the purchase of buses for newly won lines in
London.
The number of employees declined, largely due to the
cessation of patient transport contracts.

During the year under review, DB Arriva further reduced its

In bus transport the reduction of specific CO₂e emissions
compared to 2006 was lower due to the environmental
focus of new fleet additions being on the reduction of
exhaust emissions rather than CO₂e emissions.

In the year under review, performance development in
UK rail transport improved significantly, mainly due to
commencing operation of the Northern Rail franchise (on
April 1, 2016) and London Overground concession (on
November 13, 2016).
Revenue development was also positive as a result and
was further boosted by the full-year effect of having
expanded Chiltern Railways services in the previous year.
Revenue growth was weakened by significant negative
exchange rate effects.
The increase in cost of materials (+21.8%) and personnel
expenses (+ 50.8%) were higher due to the commencement
of the new operations, while exchange rates had a dampening effect. Personnel expenses increases were partly
offset by a one-off effect due to pension adjustments.
Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT both increased
significantly despite the negative impact of exchange rate
effects. The increase is primarily due to the start of the
North­­ern Rail franchise and London Overground concession and a one-off effect from pension adjustments.
Gross capital expenditures rose in connection with the
commencement of the Northern Rail franchise.
Having taken on about 7,000 employees for Northern
Rail and London Overground, the number of employees
more than doubled.

In the Mainland Europe line of business, the performance
in rail transport declined in the year under review due to
lost transport contracts in Sweden and Poland.
Bus passenger numbers and the volume produced
increased primarily due to the full year impact of 2015 additions in Slovakia and Slovenia together with the impact of
2016 acquisitions in Italy, Spain and the Czech Republic.
This increase was partially offset by other changes in the
contract portfolio.
Revenue development was also positive mainly driven
by the impact of the acquisitions. Other contract portfolio
changes and negative exchange rate effects had a dampening effect.
Cost of materials (+2.0%) and personnel expenses
(+ 0.9%) increased mainly as a result of acquisitions. The
increase was dampened by exchange rate effects and the
other portfolio changes.
Both adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT declined
slightly. Positive effects from the acquisitions could largely
offset the impact from the total challenging competitive
environment and contract cessations.
Year-on year gross capital expenditures were considerably higher, mainly as a result of the commencement of
new services in the Netherlands (Limburg and ZOWAD) in
December 2016 and expenditures in respect of acquisitions.
The number of employees also increased mainly due to
the start of the operations in the Netherlands and the
acquisitions. The other contract portfolio changes had an
adverse effect.

≈≈ DB Schenker business unit
≈≈ Business model

DB Schenker serves established markets and emerging

national economies with a global network as an integrated
transport and logistics service provider. In land transport,
the dense network combines the most important economic
regions in Europe. Services include time and cost-optimized
services for general cargo, partial and full load transport
along with door-to-door solutions across Europe. As one of
the global leaders in air and ocean freight, DB Schenker
offers the entire range of services in this segment. In contract logistics, the services offered cover all stages of the
value-added chain from supplier to producer/trade, to end
customers, and spare parts service. The core area of expertise is the planning and handling of complex global supply
chains, including sustainable logistics concepts.

DB Schenker has a global customer base in a wide range of

industries and a focus on industrial customers. The vertical
market approach pursues the target of developing industry-specific solutions. As global accounts, major customers
are provided with tailored solutions.
In air and ocean freight, we act solely as freight forwarder without own aircraft and ships. In parts of land
transport, we use our own vehicles and containers. Transshipment terminals and warehouses are generally our own
property or are leased over the longer term.
Motivated and well-trained employees are key resources
for a service provider. Close customer relationships and
industrial expertise are extremely important. Efficient IT is
also essential for good product and service quality Β .
In addition to airlines and shipping companies in air and
ocean freight, our major partners include land transport
subcontractors for the supply of transport services.
Measurement of performance depends on the line of
business: for European land transport, the number of shipments is the key indicator; for air freight, it is the tonnage
billed, while in ocean freight, it is the freight volume measured in TEU. There is no comparable volume measured in
the contract logistics segment. Market comparisons are usually performed here on the basis of revenues. DB Schenker
has a relatively low capital intensity and real net output
ratio. About 70% of revenues in the transport business line
come from procured intermediate input services. Therefore, optimizing these purchase relationships and balancing
various influential success factors such as transport relations,
volume, weight and mode of transport represent an im­­­
port­­ant factor for success and are value drivers. The same
applies to managing fluctuations in freight rates and the
specific surcharges to these freight rates. In particular, the
effective and efficient use of personnel resources is a key
driver below gross profit. This is of particular importance in
contract logistics. Here, expertise and experience relevant
to the industry are an essential success factor in the optimal
design of intra-company logistics processes. Effective IT
support is also especially important.
The most important sources of revenues are transport
and logistics services, including added value services such
as assembly of modules or assemblies in the automobile
industry or putting together special sales packaging for the
retail sector.

Schenker has adopted a new organizational structure with a
Chief Digital Officer and a dedicated digitaliza­­­tion unit. This
unit’s mission is to promote data-driven business models,
online platforms and technical innovations worldwide.
◊ ◊ ECONOMIC ¿ dimension: The central challenge is to be
able to respond more quickly to market demand. We
rely on processes for this, which are characterized both
through standardization as well as through industrialization. By adapting the supply chains consistently, we
fulfill customer requests while deepening the customer
relationship at the same time. The focus will also be on
further expansion of integrated and innovative solutions for the entire logistics chain. Our target is to grow
profitably and increase the EBIT margin on a sustainable

basis. In the medium term, we strive toward growing
more strongly than the market in all segments and
maintaining our leading market positions. In pursuing

With eco-procurement, we focus on the purchase of
CO ₂-friendly services from our carriers and sub-providers. The tools we use in this effort include our preferred carrier portfolio, our carbon reduction agreements, and our environmental partnerships with top
carriers. Eco-transparency includes instruments that

Restructuring of the organization

The former Board divisions at Schenker AG – Land Transport and Air&Ocean Freight – have been pooled into one
new division – Freight (COO), with the aim of linking these
three product areas more closely together so as to rapidly
improve our portfolio of integrated transport services and
to better leverage the growth potential. We are also planning to create an organizational unit called Global Land
Transport under this roof, and to standardize and drive the
development of land transport outside Europe.

In January 2016, DB Schenker acquired 75% of the shares
in Redhead Holdings Ltd., Bradford/Great Britain. The
agreement stipulates that it may acquire the remaining
25% after four years. This acquisition underscores our
strategy of further strengthening our pan-European
network. The new land transport organization in Great
Britain now has a network of five locations, serving
the entire British market. As part of the acquisition,
DB Schenker is also gaining access to the national pallet
network PALLETFORCE Œ [ DB.DE /LINK S _ IR 16 ] . With more
than 100 strategically located depots, it is one of the
largest and most efficient national pallet networks
in Great Britain. The company has been included in

We signed an agreement governing the reduction of CO₂
emissions with a further shipping company (CMA CGM).
DB Schenker is offering a new transport route between
Scandinavia and Turkey. The use of shipping moves the
goods faster, while emitting less CO₂.
In the iHub research project, which is being sponsored by
the Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy (BMW i),
DB Schenker is testing two vehicles operated by electric
battery, one of which is a 12-ton truck.
The “Hydrogen in logistics” project has entered its third
phase in Linz. The hydrogen for the ten forklifts fitted
with fuel cells is now extracted electrolytically from a
photovoltaic system, which makes refueling more efficient and permits economies of scale in sustainable
intralogistics, even at smaller sites.
DB Schenker in Sweden has taken over leadership of the
KNEG program. This initiative brings together scientific
and municipal institutions, energy providers, logistics
and loading experts in an effort to reduce the carbon
footprint of land transport in Sweden by 50% per ton
kilometer by 2020 compared to 2006. Specific CO₂ emissions were already reduced by 34% between 2006 and
2015, due in no small part to the 800 or so vehicles operated by DB Schenker that run – in some cases entirely –
on sustainable HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil).
DB Schenker was the first company to sign a global
standard (GLEC Framework) for calculating greenhouse
gases. In doing so, we are emphasizing the need to
drive further standardization of the procedure for measuring greenhouse gases.
Although DB Schenker only actually owns about 10% of
the fleet it uses, we are working with research institutes
on the deployment of new drives and fuels in regular
logistics operations. For example, some 1,000 vehicles
around the world are running on alternative fuels (CNG,
LNG, sustainable biofuels, fully electric and hybrid vehicles), which save between 20% and as much as 90%
green­­house gas emissions, depending on the type of
fuel (well-to-wheel), and cause virtually no pollution in
operation.

Ongoing legal proceedings

Group is pursuing damages against the airlines that
were part of the so-called air freight monopoly, which,
according to the findings of various competition authorities around the world, agreed on kerosene and security
surcharges from 1999 to at least 2006 at the expense of
freight forwarders such as DB Schenker. Claims for damages were instituted against several airlines in Germany
and the USA in 2014. In the USA, out-of-court settlements

left in the US proceedings are continuing. In addition,
the first out-of-court settlement relating to the proceedings in Germany was concluded with one airline. Settlement negotiations are still ongoing with various airlines
relating to the proceedings in Germany.
◊ ◊ The Cologne public prosecutorʼs office and DB Schenker
have agreed to terminate the investigations into unexplained payments for logistics services provided in
Russia. At the public prosecutor’s request, a fine of
€ 2 million was imposed on DB Schenker’s Russian entity
for breaches of the law between 2010 and mid-2012.
The proceedings against – largely former – officers of
DB Schenker have also been halted, in some cases in
return for payment of a fine.

agree on binding reduction targets with our largest carriers
to reduce total CO₂ emissions. During the year under review
CO ₂ emissions in ocean freight were again significantly
reduced by deploying big new ships on the main trade lane
between Europe and Asia. The figures in air freight were
also lower, but higher in land transport following the shift
toward smaller consignment and vehicle units.

High competitive pressure, lower diesel prices.
Within the system and direct transport areas
greater focus on international transport services.
◊ ◊ Commencement and expansion of the
cooperation agreement with GLS.
◊ ◊ Optimization of the IT landscape and general
cargo transport.

Shipment volume was slightly positive overall. Improvements in system (+2.3%) and direct (+ 5.3%) transport
services were offset virtually entirely by the weaker development in parcel business (– 4.4%).
Revenue development was weakened by the intense
competitive environment and the low diesel price which
made it difficult to raise prices. In addition, negative
exchange rate effects and volume developments in parcel
business had an adverse effect. As a result, revenue development was only slightly positive.
Cost of materials increased year on year, due mainly to
direct transport services, although the developments in
general cargo and parcel business had a partially offsetting
effect, as did exchange rate effects.
Due to changes in the accounting and allocation of
overhead costs to the lines of business, the figures for
personnel expenses, operating profit and the number of
employees are not comparable to the figures for the previous year.

Although air freight rates recovered somewhat in the
second half of the year, they were still much lower by yearon-year comparison. The insolvency of Hanjin caused ocean
freight rates to recover.
Revenue development was negative in both air and

rate developments.
By contrast, both had a positive impact on the cost of

≈≈ Procurement contributes
to Group objectives

Procurement supports the implementation of DB2020+
[ PAGE 85 F.] .
and forms part of R AILWAY OF THE FUTURE
Leveraging the purchasing potential achieved through the
purchasing program launched in 2015 and the interdepartmental collaboration among the business units makes a
contribution to the Group target of PROFITABLE QUALIT Y
LEADER ¿ . Together with the relevant consumers, Procurement identifies options for generating monetary savings
through optimizing award procedures, and ensures supply
reliability at competitive prices. Within the framework of
commodity group strategies, detailed market and field analysis is conducted, resulting in appropriate measures for the
procurement processes.
The trend toward higher wage agreements and wage
costs continued in 2016. Pressure on prices remained high,
especially in the services sector. By contrast, prices for
commodities declined, albeit not to the same extent witnessed in 2015.
In keeping with our aspiration of being an E C O - P I O NEER ¥ , efforts relating to our commodity group strategy
embrace environmental aspects as well as the identification
of potential. In addition, our supplier management process
incorporates CSR assessments.
The Procurement personnel qualification portfolio,
which is specifically tailored to the needs of the various
functions and is subject to continuous further development, supports the top target of being a TOP EMPLOYER † .
During the year under review, the expert qualification program for buyers was revamped in terms of both content
and methodology and subsequently successfully piloted.
After Group Procurement underwent a performance
check in 2015 by an external consulting firm with the objective of benchmarking its services in comparison with “World
Class” organizations, a roadmap was drawn up to optimize
Procurement’s performance in the direction of a “World
Class Procurement” organization. An external consulting
firm confirmed our “Professional Procurement” sta­tus
again in the year under review, and this status is stable.

Procurement as a building block
for sustainable development

Procurement continued to focus on sustainable criteria in
the year under review. In addition to the code of conduct
for business partners and our purchasing guidelines, Purchasing also implements further CSR policies in the supply
chain. We therefore ensure that environmental and social
standards are observed and maintained in the supply chain
together with suppliers, above and beyond our own added
value.
The risk management system developed in 2015 to flag
potentially risky suppliers was further developed, together
with the CRS assessment procedure that builds on the
system. Flagged suppliers are audited and assessed with
regard to environmental and social standards.
The industry initiative R AILSPONSIBLE Œ [ DB.DE/LINK S _ IR 16 ]
that was founded together with other companies in the rail
industry in 2015 was further developed. We succeeded in
persuading Swedish company SKF – a globally leading technology provider and supplier to the railway industry – to
join the initiative. The initiative has compiled a joint work
program for the next three to four years and is highlighting
the issues of raising employee awareness, supplier development and communication.
In addition, further supply chain analysis was conducted
together with DB Group suppliers in order to promote practi­­cal understanding of the supply chain structure and existing social risks. The objective is to develop means of influencing identified risk areas and supply chain stages that do
not add value.
In addition, our quality assurance team again conducted audits on site at suppliers’ premises. During the
assessment of the systems, processes and products at suppliers of quality-controlled products or of products with a
manufacturer-related product qualification, these audits
did not result in any findings with regard to violations of
human rights, the freedom of collective bargaining, child
labor or forced labor.

Expansion in internationalization

As internationalization progresses, the supplier structure
of DB Group is also becoming increasingly global. The focus
is on the qualification of suppliers in the Asian market. One
year after the establishment of our International Procurement Office in Shanghai, more than 300 potential suppliers
have been identified in countries that include China, South
Korea and Taiwan. Commercial and technical qualification
has commenced with suitable firms. After just six months,
Asian suppliers participated in the award of contracts by

DB Group. The International Procurement Office has estab-

lished initial contact to Asian railway operators with a view
to exchanging ideas on selected commodity groups.

≈≈ Other legal issues
≈≈ Cartel proceedings relating to
ticket sales halted

In May 2016, the German Federal Cartel Office halted the
abuse proceedings regarding ticket sales launched against
DB AG in January 2014 in exchange for the issuance of
binding commitments. The commitments will create the
greatest possible legal certainty and establish a new contractual basis for the existing mechanisms for cooperative
ventures in ticket prices and sales in rail passenger transport in Germany. In particular, in the future even more flexible sample contracts will be available to local transport
companies for cooperation with DB Vertrieb GmbH (DB
Sales). In addition, the commitments will mean expanded
opportunities for competitors to sell long-distance tickets from DB AG. The German Federal Cartel Office did not
detect any conclusive infringement.

≈≈ Additional settlement on
rail cartel concluded

In March 2016, we reached an out-of-court agreement with
the Stahlberg-Roensch Group and Constantin Stahlberg on
payment of damages relating to the rail cartel.
After Voestalpine and ThyssenKrupp, Stahberg-Roensch
Group is the third participant in the rail cartel with whom
we managed to reach an out-of-court settlement after
intense negotiations. We have not yet reached a settlement
with the last cartel participant, the Moravia Group. Therefore, DB Group continues to pursue claims for damages
against Moravia Steel in a lawsuit.
We transfer most of the compensation payments to the
Federal Government, the Federal states and other funding
bodies which previously had assigned their claims to us.
Because the rail procurements in question were largely supported by public funding, in obtaining damages we are
working primarily in the interest of the funding bodies.

≈≈ Opportunity and risk management
within DB Group
Opportunity and risk management in DB Group comprises
the systematic identification, assessment and management
of opportunities and risks. The primary objective of opportu­
­nity and risk management is to ensure the long-term exis­
tence of DB Group.
The principles of opportunity and risk management are
laid down by the Group headquarters and implemented on
a Group-wide basis. As part of our early-warning system,
quarterly reports are submitted to the Management Board
and the Supervisory Board of DB AG. Major risks occurring
outside of this reporting cycle must be reported immedi­
ately. Planned acquisitions are subject to additional specific
monitoring.
Our risk management system (RMS) maps all of the op­­
por­­tunities and risks in an opportunity and risk portfolio and
also individually in detail, factoring in materiality thresh­
olds. The opportunities and risks considered within the risk
management report are categorized and classified according
to probability of occurrence. Together with possible conse­
quences, the analysis also takes into account the starting

180

very likely	 
likely	 

position and the cost of countermeasures. In organizational
terms, Group controlling is the central coordination point
for our opportunity and risk management.
In conjunction with Group financing, with its strict focus
on the operating business, Group Treasury is responsible
for limiting and monitoring the resulting credit, market and
liquidity risks. The centralized handling of the relevant
trans­­actions (money market, securities, foreign exchange,
and derivative transactions) means that potential risks can
be managed and limited centrally. Group Treasury is orga­
nized in line with the appropriate risk control and manage­
ment system requirements for banks (MaRisk), which
means that it complies with the resulting criteria of the
German Corporate Sector Supervision and Transparency Act
(Gesetz zur Kon­­trolle und Transparenz im Unternehmens­
bereich; KonTraG).
Our strategic opportunity and risk management efforts
are mainly derived from the targets and strategies of our
business units. Operational management personnel in the
business units are directly responsible primarily for the
early and regular identification, analysis and management
of strategic opportunities and risks. These activities are an
integral element of the Group-wide planning and con­
trolling systems. We focus intensely on detailed analyses
of our markets and competitors, market scenarios, relevant
cost drivers and critical factors for success, including those
within our political and regulatory environment. Concrete
opportunities for specific business units are identified and
analyzed from these.

O pportunit y and risk r e port

Our RMS is complemented by a Group-wide internal control
system (internes Kontrollsystem; IKS) that also includes
the accounting-related processes. To the extent that com­
pliance is deemed to be ap­­pro­­priate, the components of
our IKS take into account the principles of the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO) publication: “Internal Control – Integrated Frame­
work” in its revised version of 2013. Based on this, our
accounting-related IKS is a continuous process, based on
fun­­­­damental mechanisms such as system-technical and
manual coordination, separate and clear definition of func­
tions, and the monitoring of compliance and further devel­
opment of guidelines and specific operating procedures
that are applicable Group-wide.
In addition to the instruments listed above, the account­
ing-related control mechanisms include a Group-wide, uni­
form reporting system and the regular updating of the
relevant accounting directives and accounting systems.
Subject to a binding schedule, business transactions of
the accounting-relevant units are processed in line with
IFRS principles and in compliance with Group-wide, uniform
procedures. These are then transmitted to the centralized
consolidation system.
The auditing activities of the intra-Group auditors, which
represent a key element of our control mechanisms, are
fo­­cused on evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of
our IKS. Audits are also conducted during the stocktaking
of property, plant and equipment as well as inventories. In
addition to these measures, the Audit and Compliance Com­
mittee and the Supervisory Board monitor the account­­ing
process and the effectiveness of the IKS.
The management of the companies included in the scope
of fully consolidated companies and of the individual busi­
ness units of DB Group verifies the completeness and accu­
racy of data relevant to the financial statements among
other aspects, using a quarterly internal reporting process.
Confirmation is also given that the executives responsible
have implemented the centrally defined IKS minimum stan­
dards for reporting and, where appropriate, have supple­
mented these with their own documented control and mon­
itoring tools.

≈≈ Management assessment
of the risk situation

The current risk situation is assessed on the basis of our RMS.
The system is based on the requirements of the KonTraG
and is continually evolving. During the year under review,
there were no major methodological changes to that system.
During the year under review, the key risks of DB Group
were in the areas of economic climate, market and compe­
tition, and production and technology. Compared to the
previous year, the overall risk position in relation to the
forecast for the respective following year declined in the
year under review (€ – 0.2 billion). One of the reasons for this
was that risks with a high probability of occurrence were
already taken into account almost fully in the forecast.
For the forecast of development in the 2017 FINANCIAL
YE AR [ PAG E 193 FF. ] , risks amounting to € 0.1 billion exist
(thereof very likely (vl): € 0.0 billion), including counter­
measures. These risks are primarily in the areas of produc­
tion and technology, and economic climate, market and
competition.
Opportunities in relation to the forecast of develop­
ment in the 2017 financial year exist in the amount of € 0.1
billion (thereof vl: € 0.0 billion). These opportunities exist
primarily in production and technology (€ 0.1 billion).
We have addressed further quality improvements in
relation to punctuality and comfort and convenience on rail
transport in Germany through the comprehensive R AILWAY
[ PAGE 85 F.] program.
OF THE FUTURE
Third-party evaluation is also an important indicator for
overall risk assessment. In addition to internal risk assess­
ment, DB Group’s creditworthiness and its aggregated
default risk is also assessed by the two R ATING AGENCIES
[ PAGE 1 10 ] Moody’s and S&P. Their external assessments of
DB Group’s overall risk position are reflected in the good
ratings. Nevertheless, the profits and the debt situation have
been reflected in the assessments of the rating agencies.
In terms of organization, we have created all of the con­
ditions necessary to enable the early identification of pos­
sible risks. Our continuous risk management system and
the active management of key risk categories help limit risks
within DB Group. Key strategic opportunities and risks were
identified at the business unit level and stored in the course
of the SMP for operationalization with measures.

Demand for our mobility services and, in particular, for our
transport and logistics services is dependent on overall
economic development, among other things:
◊ ◊ Economic growth fuels the trends underlying our strat­
­egy in our operating markets.
◊ ◊ Macroeconomic shocks such as economic and financial

The development of key economic factors (such as dis­
posable income or number of persons in active employ­
ment) is particularly important for passenger transport.
◊ ◊ Risks arising from depleted public sector budgets could
have adverse effects (particularly in the form of spend­­ing
cuts), especially on DB Arriva activities.
Developments in the competitive environment are of par­
ticular importance for DB Group:
◊ ◊ In long-distance transport, we are exposed to heavy interand intramodal competition, particularly with motor­
ized individual transport as the dominant competitor,
but also with long-distance bus services and air trans­­
port. Increased competition has a negative impact on
price perception.
◊ ◊ There is intense competition in regional transport through­
­out Europe for securing long-term contracts. The market
volume here is greatly determined by the financial situ­
ation of the contracting organizations. The restructuring
of regionalization funds has created a long-term basis
in Germany.
	 There is a risk of performance losses or failing to win
tenders. To be able to compete in this market, we are
constantly working to optimize our tender management
and our cost structures. Furthermore, depending on the
contract type, there is also the risk of a loss of passen­
gers without the possibility of being able to adapt the
operating schedules. In order to ensure continuous
◊◊

quality and customer satisfaction, and to profitably
defend our position in the market, we have launched
Railway of the Future Regional.
◊ ◊ There is fierce intramodal and considerable intermodal
competitive pressure in rail freight transport. Risks arise
from the fact that competitors can operate with less ex­­
pensive cost structures while enjoying greater flexibil­
­ity. To address factor cost increases and business chal­
lenges in Germany, numerous initiatives are being put
in place within Railway of the Future @ DB Cargo.
A key component in facing the competition is improvement
in quality of service. Significant opportunities arise from
the trend toward digitalization Δ :
◊ ◊ We can use this to make processes in passenger trans­
port more efficient and customer-focused.
◊ ◊ Customers can be offered new and improved digital ser­
vices, for example in the field of passenger information.
◊ ◊ Online portals and apps facilitate access for customers,
but also alter the price perception of mobility services.
Key sales market opportunities and risks also result from
foreseeable changes in the competitive situation:
◊ ◊ With the rise of the sharing economy and more mobility
service providers as well as rising cost transparency,
price perception of mobility services is changing. Digital
platforms are increasing cost transparency across all
modes of transport. This offers the opportunity that
public transport usage will become more intensive
compared with a private car. However, higher quality
mobil­­ity services are feeling the squeeze, for example
from low-priced car sharing offers and real-time cost
com­parisons.
◊ ◊ New online portals Δ may result in the loss of the cus­
tomer interface.
◊ ◊ Pure brokerage of transport capacity by freight forward­
­­­­ers could be taken over gradually by online services,
such as online booking platforms. In addition, it would
be possible to exploit the high volume levels on booking
platforms for grouping purchasing.

We are responding to opportunities and risks arising from
changing demand patterns and from shifts in traffic pat­
terns throughout the Group with intensive market observa­
tion and by continuously upgrading our portfolio and our
products:
◊ ◊ The growth of the sharing economy Δ may provide an
opportunity to increase customer loyalty to public trans­
­port, particularly among young people. Car sharing allows
a mobile life without owning a car. By offering services to
this group, DB Group can exploit this change in mobility
behavior.
◊ ◊ Digital innovations Δ are opening up the possibility of
enhancing existing products with value-added services
or developing completely new logistics services. 3-D
printing, for example, has potential in this regard. How­
ever, this will also eliminate the need for some transport
in the future, which will lead to a fall in transport volume.
◊ ◊ Structural changes to our customers’ production struc­
tures, as our customers are frequently faced with inter­
national competition.
◊ ◊ Change in customers’ willingness to pay. Traction (espe­
cially block trains and combined transport), for example,
will become a commodity with low margins.
◊ ◊ Relocation and fluctuations in the importance of indus­
tries and markets requires that the current portfolio and
its direction be continuously reviewed and developed.
This leads to risks and opportunities, primarily in the
logistics field.
The demand for our products and services is partly depen­
dent on the development of our customers sales markets:
◊ ◊ Our customers’ economic development dictates their
need for storage and transport services, which in turn
affects our freight forwarding and logistics businesses.
Our activities are affected in particular by the very com­
petitive nature of the market. We are responding to this
by further expanding our networks and improving our
cost structures, services and IT infrastructure.
◊ ◊ Rail freight transport is partly dependent on industries
that are stagnating. The decline of coal as an energy
source in Germany, for example, is having an effect.
◊ ◊ The development of demand in rail infrastructure is
dependent on rail transport’s ability to compete on the
upstream transport markets.

G ROUP MANAG EMENT REPORT

O pportunit y and risk r e port

Deutsche Bahn Group – 2016 Integrated Report

Opportunities arise from new prospects due to changes in
our markets:
◊ ◊ The increasing linkage of different modes of transport
affords an opportunity to develop stations into central
mobility hubs between different transport networks.
◊ ◊ New market segments are being created along the trans­
­port chain by new competitors such as long-distance bus
services (by expanding long-distance bus stations at
railway stations, for example).
◊ ◊ The liberalization of the value-added chain for rail freight
transport has created new market segments (such as rent­
­al of locomotives, cars and personnel as well as mainte­
­nance). Here we can record additional growth from ex­­
isting resources (for example car fleet and workshops)
and economies of scale.
Opportunities and risks arise throughout DB Group from the
potential exploitation of big data Δ :
◊ ◊ Big data analytics offers the chance to better understand
our customer portfolio and optimize the way we approach
customers through, inter alia, customer segmentation
based on big data analytics (“predictive selling”) and
ad­­justment of our portfolio of services through improved
transparency when it comes to customer data.
◊ ◊ New, efficient competitors from outside the transport
sector with a thorough understanding of the digital econ­
­­­­­­omy could establish themselves as independent players
in the transport market. With a high capacity to innovate
and sizable financial resources, it is mainly companies
from the ICT sector which pose a risk for incumbents.

≈≈ Production and technology

Key topics: technical malfunctions, technology risks (vehi­
cles, infrastructure, IT and telecommunications), custom
offenses and thefts, maintenance, fire protection, legacy
remediation, noise abatement, technical further develop­
ment, and sale of real estate
If the quality of long-distance transport services suffers,
this has an impact on production and service quality and
can lead to the loss of customers. The postponement of
delivery of new rolling stock causes revenue losses and
additional costs.
The availability and the condition of rail infrastructure
are a key prerequisite for the performance capabilities of rail
transport Ε . Intense construction work on the network
affects schedules and the production quality of carriers,
part of which cannot be compensated.

184

G R O U P M A N AG E M E N T R E P O RT

In regional transport, a risk can arise from the redundancy
of vehicles following the expiry or re-tendering of a trans­
port contract. As a countermeasure, alternative possible
uses are checked continuously.
For DB Group the dependence on secure IT that is avail­
able around the clock will continue to increase in future.
This dependence also entails potential risks, such as a break
in the availability of IT systems Δ or hacking of customers’
data. DB Group must respond systematically and appropri­
ately to these threats and risks.
Our forward-looking IT security management ensures
that the necessary security measures are in place for our
IT-based business processes. A key tool in this respect is
risk management for IT applications and IT infrastructure/
services. The relevant risks are systematically identified,
analyzed, evaluated and reduced. Residual risks are docu­
mented, reported to the competent department as appli­
cable, and monitored. The IT risk management of DB Group
follows the internationally accepted standard as defined in
ISO 27001/27002:2013 and applies regardless of the IT ser­
vice provider that is contracted.
In order to avoid critical gaps in security, appropriate
countermeasures (such as firewalls, encryption and reserved
areas of servers, prompt upgrading of software) have been
implemented. In order to ensure high availability of IT oper­
ations, we use redundant systems distributed across dif­
ferent locations. Data backup is carried out at a separate
location from actual operations. Operational management
is performed by trained personnel, and there is clear sepa­
ration of responsibilities. Our wide area network (WAN) is
redundantly designed wherever IT security and business
continuity require this. Penetration tests are conducted sys­
­tematically and regularly for the most important IT appli­
cations, with the aim of detecting weak points at an early
stage and eliminating them. These measures reduce the risk
of IT system failures and avoid large-scale disruptions,
ensuring that mission-critical business processes are oper­
ational at all times.
Sufficient availability of our VEHICLE FLEET [ PAGE 1 41 ] is
essential for our operations. Significant reductions in vehicle
availability pose a threat to operating schedules. We try to
minimize this risk by taking preventative actions and also
by minimizing the consequences should it happen, such as
by providing replacement vehicles or by organizing substi­
tute transport.

O pportunit y and risk r e port

≈≈ Personnel

Key topics: collective bargaining agreements, Group-wide
labor market, pension commitments
To be able to hold our own against the competition, our
personnel cost structure plays an important role. Our target
is always to conclude competitive collective bargaining
agreements in terms of the labor market and the transport
market.
Due to demographic changes and the associated lack of
skilled employees, it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill
vacancies with qualified personnel. This in turn leads to risks
such as lack of know-how transfer and the restriction of
opportunities for career development.
Our life-phase-oriented HR policy gives us the opportu­
nity to promote loyalty among employees. Flexible working
time models and jobs designed specifically for the age of
the employee contribute to this, as do the job security we
offer and our intensive work on our corporate culture.

Diversity in the workforce can lead to more creativity and
productivity. Young employees bring new ideas and con­
cepts into the working routine. Older employees have varied
and extensive experience, and pass on their knowledge to
new groups of employees. In addition, in mixed teams, new
perspectives and viewpoints are contributed to the solu­
tion-finding process. In the long term, and in an appropriate
corporate culture, this can have an impact on the innovation
capacity and performance of DB Group.

≈≈ Regulation

Key topics: government intervention or changes in the reg­
ulatory environment relating to railway-specific infrastruc­
ture (access, pricing and unbundling requirements)
Regulation to the detriment of rail, for example due to addi­
tional legislative requirements, endangers intermodal com­
petitiveness. Changes to the legal framework at national or
European level could pose risks to our business. This gen­
eral regulatory risk could result in tangible negative effects
on revenues and profit.
DB Group provides rail transport services in a regulated
market. These regulations govern the individual components
of the pricing systems, and general terms and conditions
applied by our rail infrastructure companies. Risks in this
re­­gard are complaints and intervention. Measures that
threaten or even prevent DB Group from attaining a reason­
able yield in our infrastructure business units (such as inter­
­vention in pricing systems) make it more difficult to control
these activities from a business perspective and can there­
fore threaten financing contributions by DB Group to infra­
­structure capital expenditures.
Political risks concern particularly a tightening of ex­ist­
­ing standards and regulations affecting the railways. The
structure of DB Group may also expose it to regulatory risks.
In order to respond to risks resulting from changing
legal framework conditions on either a national or an inter­
national level, we take an active part in the discussions and
debates that take place ahead of this type of change.

G ROUP MANAG EMENT REPORT

In regional transport, there is the additional risk of penalties
imposed by the relevant contracting organizations if trains
are canceled or punctuality Α is insufficient.
PUNCTUALITY Α [ PAGE 101 F.] is a key factor for rail freight
transport customers when selecting a mode of transport. In
addition to this, irregularities can occur during transport,
such as customs offenses and theft. We combat these risks
with measures such as employing qualified customs coor­
dinators and using a system of immediate reporting for tax
assessment notices.
The range and quality of our services depend to a sig­
nificant extent on the availability and reliability of the pro­
duction resources used, intermediate services procured,
and the quality of our partners’ services. We therefore keep
up an intense dialog with our suppliers and business part­
ners on the subject of quality. This is of particular importance
in the vehicle industry.
The technical production resources used in rail trans­
port must comply with applicable standards and require­
ments, which are subject to change. As a result, we may
receive technical complaints concerning our vehicles. This
leads to the risk that we may only be permitted to use
individual series or rail car types under certain conditions,
such as limited speeds, shorter intervals between mainte­
nance or reduced wheel set loads. In addition, we cannot
accept newly purchased vehicles that have flaws or for which
the necessary vehicle certification has not been granted.

≈≈ Procurement /energy market

Key topics: price trends for external procurement markets,
full auctioning of CO₂ certificates

Rising energy prices threaten the intermodal competitive
advantage of rail. Purchase prices for raw materials, energy
and transport services vary according to market conditions.
This means that depending on the market conditions and
our competitive situation, it may not be possible or may only
be possible to a very limited extent to pass increased costs
on to the customer in the short term. This in turn has a neg­
ative impact on margins.
We respond to the risk of increasing energy prices by
using appropriate D ER I VAT I V E FI N A N C I A L I N S T RU M EN T S
[ PAGE 22 4 FF.] and entering into long-term procurement con­
tracts. However, these safeguards also limit opportunities
arising from trends in energy prices. In the event of falling
energy prices, we do not benefit from the market trend and
could lose intramodal competitiveness.
Further potential for procurement prices can be lever­
aged by bundling requirements and optimizing the procure­
ment strategy.
Noticeable train-path price increases outside of Germany
result in costs for the use of infrastructure rising signifi­
cantly. Due to the intensity of competition, it is not always
possible to pass on cost increases.

≈≈ Capital markets and taxes
Key topics: interest and currency risks

The expansion of our international business entails currency
risks. This risk, however, is largely limited to the so-called
translation risk, since usually there is a high regional con­
gruence between the production and sales markets. We use
original and derivative financial instruments as one means
of countering interest rate and currency risks from our oper­
­ating business. These instruments are discussed in the
notes. Within DB Group, they may only be used for hedging
purposes. There is a risk that these hedging measures will
not pay off, or not in the way expected.
To prevent counterparty default risk from financial and
energy derivatives, we conclude credit support agreements
(CSA s) for all hedges.

186

G R O U P M A N AG E M E N T R E P O RT

Due to the long-term capital employed, we also use long-term
financial instruments. As a result, only new issues are ex­­
posed to the risk of rising interest rates. We apply a conserva­
­tive planning approach to deal with risks arising from cap­
ital market performance or a deterioration in credit ratings.
Pensions and similar retirement benefit obligations are
partially covered by plan assets from stocks, real estate,
fixed-income securities and other investments. Value losses
in these assets directly reduce the cover of pension obliga­
tions by plan assets, potentially resulting in DB Group having
to provide additional cover.
In addition, there are potential risks from back-tax pay­
ments from tax audits that are in progress.

≈≈ Law and contracts

Key topics: compensation claims, lawsuits, active and pas­
sive claims

As a result of delayed vehicle deliveries and vehicle defects,
operating difficulties and breaches of contract or non-com­
pliances arise with respect to contracting organizations.
Higher expenses and penalty payments combined with lower
fares are the result. Ensuing damage claims are asserted
against the manufacturers.
Provisions have been made for legal and contractual risks
based on an assessment of their probability of occurrence.
Opportunities arise from the discovery of cartels that
operated in the past and the enforcement of claims for
damages against cartel members.
Compliance with current laws, company guidelines, and
recognized regulatory standards is the task and duty of
every DB Group employee. It is the mission of our COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT [ PAGE 72 ] to ensure compliance with such
criteria.
Large-scale capital expenditures mean that the infra­
structure business units are exposed to a significant risk of
becoming the target and victim of corruption, cartel agree­
ments, or fraud. As a third-party provider of financing, the
Federal Government places high demands on DB Group
with its anti-corruption guidelines.

O pportunit y and risk r e port

Key topics: disasters and accidents, sabotage, extortion
Our activities are based on a technologically complex, net­
worked production system. In general, we try to combat
the risk of potential operational disruptions through reg­
ular maintenance and by taking on qualified employees,
coupled with continuous quality assurance and improve­
ment of our processes. The nature of rail transport as an
open system means that certain factors (such as natural
disasters, accidents, sabotage and theft) over which we
have only limited influence could have a negative impact
on operations. Our efforts in such cases focus on minimiz­
­ing the potential effects. However, this could also result in
cost risks from countermeasures.
Increasing damage to infrastructure by the accumula­
tion of extreme weather events due to climate change lead,
inter alia, to loss of income due to reduced services due to
weather-related breakdowns and increased need for expen­
ditures on preventive measures.
In order to adapt the means of production to extreme
weather phenomena and to avoid restricted operating
quality due to weather damage, DB Group is working with
national and international experts on the adaptation of
external technical regulations to altered climatic conditions.
In addition, DB Group is reviewing its own rules bearing in
mind the impact of a changing climate.

≈≈ Other issues
Project risks

Our measures involve not only in part huge capital expen­
diture volumes, but also a large number of highly complex
projects. Changes in the legal framework, delays in imple­
mentation (including due to comprehensive public consul­
tation), necessary adjustments during the frequent multiyear project periods, or deviations from the ramp-up curves
agreed with the Federal Government for the capital expen­
ditures funds available can lead to project risks. The net­
worked production structure means that these can often
affect a number of business units. For example, in such cases
planned modal shifts from road to rail will not be feasible.
Also price increases in bought-in services or for con­­
struc­­tion can have negative consequences and may lead,
for example, to liquidity risks. We keep up to date with this
by closely monitoring projects. This applies in particular to
large, centrally managed projects.

Realization of the extensive measures required for Railway of
the Future is subject to uncertainty. These measures are re­­
quired for eliminating deficiencies in the railway in Germany.

Infrastructure financing

As a key element of the German Rail Reform the Federal
Government has enacted a constitutional obligation to fi­­
nance the capital expenditures in rail infrastructure Ε . The
main criterion is the provision of sufficient amounts of
funding, but also the ability to plan the financing available
in the future. In addition to the risk of a lack of available
funds for financing capital expenditures, there is also a risk
of insufficient funds for the adequate maintenance of the
existing network. The economic sustainability of capital
expenditures or financial contributions to capital expendi­
ture projects funded with DB funds is essential if we are to
ensure DB Group’s ability to invest in the long term.
We have an agreement with the Federal Government
that sets out the financing of the existing network until
2019. LUFV II [ PAGE 2 49 ] and the associated long-term safe­
guarding of infrastructure quality and availability increase
the attractiveness of rail as a mode of transport. Positive
effects from this could be felt in higher revenues from the
infrastructure companies. The profits of infrastructure com­
panies in turn are plowed back into the infrastructure via
the funding cycle. Risks arise from a possible failure to
achieve the quality targets set out in LuFV II.
However, to ensure the long-term competitiveness of
rail as a mode of transport, sufficient financial means must
be available to ensure systematic new construction and
expansion as well as to eliminate bottlenecks (requirement
plan for capital expenditures).
There is also the risk that the Federal Government could
reclaim its funding on the basis of an audit of exactly how
the Federal funds were used.

Political risks

EUROFIMA has made loans to state-owned railways that

now have poor credit ratings. If these state-owned railways
should fail to meet their financial obligations to EUROFIMA,
this could have repercussions for the book value of the
participating interest, and under certain circumstances
trigger further financial obligations.

≈≈ Key actions
≈≈ Railway of the Future program

[ PAGE 85 F.]
In August 2015, the R AILWAY OF THE FUTURE
program was set up with the objective of developing mea­
sures across all business units in order to strengthen railway
operations in Germany and in particular to improve product
quality Β significantly.

≈≈ Digitalization

Digitalization Δ affects almost every aspect of life. Infor­
mation and communication technologies are having ever-­
increasing influence. For mobility and logistics providers,
it is increasingly important to digitalize products. Digitali­
zation can be used to leverage internal cost-cutting. The
expansion of automated solutions and processes is of major
importance in this respect. For these reasons, DB Group
intends to drive digital transformation.

≈≈ Market development

DB Group is active in attractive markets with good growth

prospects:
◊ ◊ With DB Arriva, we have positioned ourselves in such a
way that we are well prepared to take advantage of the
opportunities posed by open and opening markets. As
a result of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, we see
opportunities in increased tender procedure activities
for bus and rail transport in countries where their gov­
ernments are forced to implement austerity measures.
In addition, there is the possibility that new markets or
market segments will be opened for competition.
◊ ◊ Different patterns of growth are apparent in logistics
markets worldwide. For example, emerging markets and
certain vertical markets, such as healthcare, are experi­
encing growth at an above-average level. By focusing
more closely on particular vertical markets and geo­­gra­­phic markets, DB Schenker can increase its proximity
to customers and exploit existing opportunities for
growth.
◊ ◊ A sustained high level of growth is expected for the
Euro­­pean parcels market in the next few years, driven
by the robust e-commerce business. This provides an
opportunity for DB Schenker to grow significantly in this
promising segment by introducing a European package
product.

188

G R O U P M A N AG E M E N T R E P O RT

≈≈ Demography

The trends of demographic change, diverse lifestyles, our
achievement-oriented society and the battle for talent all
put their special mark on our HR management. With our
HR 2020 strategy, we give answers on how to make HR man­
agement fit for the future.
◊ ◊ For example, we counter demographic changes by giving
employees the opportunity to design their working time
and working conditions flexibly, such as with long-term
work accounts and sabbaticals. We also have numerous
innovative pilot projects that offer our employees cus­
tom-fit ways to transition to flexible working hours.
◊ ◊ We meet the diverse lifestyles and the trend to an
achievement-oriented society by offering ways to make
family and personal life more compatible with part-time
management and much more. In addition, we have been
working continuously on further developing our corpo­
rate culture.
◊ ◊ In order to stay ahead in the battle for talent we work
intensively on our image and our attractiveness as an
employer. To identify possible bottlenecks early enough
to react in the appropriate manner, we rely on strategic
workforce planning which gives a ten-year forecast.

≈≈ Climate protection

Environmental unique selling points improve customers’
positive opinions and thus improve external perception.
Such activities not only have a positive effect on shrinking
our carbon footprint, they can also have a positive influence
on customer satisfaction and our market position.
◊ ◊ To generate an environmental unique selling point
based on CO ₂-free transport, we offer our customers
green pro­­ducts derived from renewable energy.
◊ ◊ In order to increase efficiency in the area of traction cur­
­rent, we regularly offer training courses on how to save
energy when driving, and in future will also continu­
ously invest in the renewal of our vehicle fleet.
◊ ◊ In the area of stationary facilities, we intend to gradu­
ally establish a professional energy management system
and an innovative stationary power supply through
numerous activities as well as already implemented
“beacons of light,” such as climate-neutral station build­
­ings and intelligent mobility stations.

≈≈ Additional bond issued

On January 30, 2017, the Supervisory Board of DB AG unan­
imously voted to approve the request of Dr. Rüdiger Grube
to renounce his appointment as CEO with immediate effect.
The Supervisory Board has charged the Personnel Commit­
­tee to agree the necessary ramifications with Dr. Grube.
As per the rules of procedure of DB AG, CFO Dr. Richard
Lutz has taken over the responsibilities of heading the CEO
Board division for the time being.

In February 2017, we issued a privately placed bond through
DB Finance with a volume of NOK 700 million (about € 79
million) (maturity: 15 years; coupon: 2.49%) and swapped it
to euros.

≈≈ Draft bill on automated driving
On January 25, 2017, German Federal Cabinet adopted the
draft bill on automated driving Δ (amendment to the High­
­way Code). According to the bill, automobile manufacturers
are responsible for complying with road traffic rules. They
must ensure that the autopilot recognizes speed limits.
Drivers must only take back control of the vehicle when
asked to do so by the highly or fully automated system, or if
the conditions for proper use of the highly or fully automated
driving function are no longer present. The use of a data
storage facility will become mandatory to prove who was
driving – the system or the driver – in specific situations.

≈≈ Further developed train-path
pricing system approved
At the beginning of February 2017, the German Federal Net­
work Agency approved the further development of the train-­
­path pricing system with the fees for the 2018 network
timetable. For the first time, the train-path usage fees were
examined on the basis of the Railway Regulation Act
(ERegG). The decision by the authorities did not include
any complaints about the level of fees although it did con­
tain modifications to a few of the fee applications. DB Netz
AG is checking the decision and how to proceed.

≈≈ Arbitration with GDL postponed
The arbitration proceedings with the German Train Drivers’
Union (GDL) were initially postponed until February 9,
2017, and then suspended once more by unanimous deci­
sion of the Arbitration Commission. As a result, the arbitration period has extended up to the end of the tenth
calendar week. Complex issues prompted the decision to
extend this period again to develop results that are ready
for approval and in the interests of both parties.

≈≈ Implementation of Railway
of the Future @ DB Cargo
In mid-February 2017, DB Cargo and the general works
council reached agreement on an amicable reconciliation
of interests. It forms the basis for implementing the initia­
tives relating to Railway of the Future @ DB Cargo in line with
the timetable. This includes implementation of the future
production and sales structures.

≈≈ Investment in uShip
In mid-February 2017, Schenker AG acquired 7.4% of the
shares in uShip, Inc., Austin/Texas, for USD 25 million. uShip
operates an online platform for freight forwarding and
transport services. We have been in COOPER ATION [ PAGE 17 2 ]
with uShip since May 2016.

≈≈ Overall statement of the
Management Board
regarding the economic
development of DB Group
Following the overall positive development in the year
under review, the Management Board of DB AG anticipates
that DB Group will demonstrate further positive development in the 2017 financial year. Despite higher costs, the
increase in revenues is expected to have a noticeable effect
on profits.
We expect to continue to have excellent access to the
capital market in the 2017 financial year.
Our activities are subject to various risks, as described
in the OPPORTUNIT Y AND RISK REPORT [ PAGE 180 FF.] . For the
2017 financial year, we see risks above all in the areas of the
economic climate, market and competition, as well as production and technology.
The Management Board believes that DB Group has
taken all necessary measures to protect itself from existing
risks and to be able to take advantage of possible opportunities. We want to further expand our market positions and
implement our strategy. On the whole our assessment of
DB Groupʼs medium-term prospects is therefore positive.

≈≈ Future direction of DB Group
≈≈ Future business policy

We want to assert our market positions in the 2017 financial
year and stimulate further organic growth in our business
strategy, we have defined the straunits. In our DB2020+
tegic directions for the coming years which we consistently
pursue. The 2017 financial year will mark the start of the
second phase of R AILWAY OF THE FUTUR E
. In our
efforts to attain a consistent level of performance, the
second phase will systematically address structural deficits
to enable our ability to offer convincing product and performance quality.

190

≈≈ Future strategic focus

The further development of our strategy into DB2020+
still focuses on sustainability as the key issue, while at the
same time addressing the challenges that lie ahead –
especially in the ECONOMIC ¿ dimension and in the railway
in Germany. To attain our strategic targets, we are concentrating particularly on three areas of action – culture of
quality, digital expertise and high performance. Consistent
efforts to advance these three areas – mainly through
Group, divisional and business unit programs – will form the
main focus of our future activities.

≈≈ Future sales markets

Our opportunities for growth in the German passenger
transport market are limited due to the high level of competition and restrictions imposed by antitrust laws. As a
result, we are primarily focused on defending our strong
market position and strengthening the competitive position of the railways in intermodal competition. Over the
medium term, we foresee a shift to demand-driven road
transport in the German passenger transport market, as
new data-based business models are established. Autonomous driving, for example, will lead to ever fewer people
having to own their own automobile. At the same time,
autonomous transport on the road could potentially make
certain areas of public transport independent of stops/stations and schedules, and thus enhance flexibility. Our poten­
­tial for growth in the area of passenger transport services
lies in other European countries and in cross-border long-­
distance rail passenger transport services.
In the area of rail freight transport, our focus continues
to be on the European market. We are well positioned in all
of the central European corridors and can offer service connections to locations as far afield as China.
We also do not expect significant changes in the freight
forwarding and logistics area in 2017. DB Schenker is already
very well represented in all key markets and regions.

Source: Oxford Economics.

In 2017, we expect global economic growth to increase
slightly, which should benefit world trade, leading to
stronger growth than witnessed in previous years. Russia
and Brazil, especially, are expected to overcome their severe
recessions, which will also have a positive effect on their
neighboring countries. Growth is also expected to be stronger
in North America, whereas it will probably remain at a consistently high level in Asia, and weaken slightly in Europe.
◊ ◊ Economic growth expectations in the USA, in particular,
are shrouded with high uncertainty. Although the policies announced by the newly elected president – especially plans to expand infrastructure and reduce taxes –
could help to stimulate the economy, there is no way of
knowing how these measures are going to be funded,
particularly since reducing the national debt is another
of the plans announced by the new administration.
◊ ◊ The pace of economic growth in China is expected to
remain high. As global demand picks up, exports could
make a greater contribution to economic growth again,
which could potentially lead to less need for state intervention to support the economy.
◊ ◊ Economic development in Europe continues to differ
from one country to the next. Now that it has overcome
its severe recession, Spain has meanwhile become a
driver of growth again. By contrast, Sweden’s economy
is expected to grow at a slower pace. The restraint in
investments in Great Britain continues in light of the
uncertainty surrounding the country’s withdrawal from
the EU. At the same time, the positive effects of a weaker
pound on foreign trade will gradually dissipate.

In 2017, growth in Germany will probably be at the same
pace as the Eurozone overall, and thus slightly less than
in the year under review. After several years of strong
growth rates, the stimulus from private consumption is
weakening. Investments are stable, while foreign trade
is laboring under weak global demand for capital goods.

+1.7

~ +1.0

Expectations for 2017 are rounded off to the nearest half percentage point.

In the German passenger transport market, we expect
growth in volume sold to increase moderately in 2017, albeit
without matching the level of the year under review. This
trend will probably be driven by weaker growth in employment and real disposable income than witnessed in previous
years. At the same time, fuel prices are expected to rise.
The growth in rail passenger transport should be stronger
than the average in these conditions. Improvements in qual­
­ity and in the products and services offered by DB Long-Distance should contribute to this development, as should
new transport services offered by the competition between
several German cities. Growth in public road passenger trans­
­port, by contrast, is only expected to be slight. Following
consolidation, the development of long-distance bus services will probably be much weaker than witnessed in previous years.
Positive stimulus from the labor market is expected to
result in further growth in motorized individual transport,
despite rising fuel prices.
Moderate growth in air transport will probably be driven
by persistently intense competition and, especially, by low
ticket prices.
Notwithstanding Brexit, the general framework for Euro­
­pean passenger transport also appears to be positive. The
pace of income growth will probably weaken in numerous
countries compared to the year under review. Together with
rising employment figures, however, it should contribute to
positive performance development overall. Growth is ex­­
pected to be well above the average in countries where
intra- and intermodal competition is fierce, capital expenditures on infrastructure and vehicle fleets are significant,
and clear measures to liberalize the market are in place.

Volumes in the German freight transport market are ex­­
pected to increase further in 2017, albeit at a slightly lesser
pace than witnessed in the year under review. The market
will continue to be characterized by fierce inter- and intramodal competitive pressure.
◊ ◊ As the economic environment remains stable overall,
the development of German rail freight transport should
be somewhat more positive, but will probably not ex­­
tend beyond a moderate increase in volume. Structural
measures at DB Cargo are likely to continue limiting the
increase in volume for the rail market as a whole.
◊ ◊ Road freight traffic should also continue to benefit from
the robust development of both foreign trade and the
domestic market in 2017, with growth above the average.
◊ ◊ Subdued momentum is likely to keep growth in inland
waterway transport below the average, even in the
absence of any lengthier restrictions caused by poor
weather conditions.
Positive developments are expected for the European rail
freight transport market. Growth should be supported
mainly by intra-European trade in consumer and capital
goods, which should stimulate the intermodal transport
market.
The European land transport market is expected to
record revenue growth slightly above the previous yearʼs
level, driven by regions in Southwestern and Eastern Europe.
Freight charges will presumably be influenced by continued
low diesel price levels in 2017.
Expectations for growth in the global air freight market
remain moderately positive. As far as air freight capacity is
concerned, shortages are not anticipated, given the continuing supply of new aircraft and addition of new routes.
In light of the increased capacities, we do not expect air
freight charges to increase significantly, despite rising kerosene prices.
Global ocean freight is also expected to record higher
growth year on year, as demand should recover with the
renewed rise in global trade. Given the probable moderate
increase in fuel prices, rates are also likely to rise some-

192

what. The consolidation among container shipping companies and creation of new alliances could also help to produce
greater rate stability.
We are assuming that growth in the contract logistics/
SCM market will be on a par with the previous year. The core
industries automotive, healthcare, electronics, consumer and
industrial will continue to be the main drivers of expected
growth. Asia/Pacific is likely to remain the region with the
strongest growth.

≈≈ Infrastructure

Overall, we expect train-path demand to decline slightly in
2017, driven mainly by increased construction volume and
the associated suspension of service. Most of the construction-related suspensions will affect regional rail passenger
transport. By contrast, we expect the development in longdistance rail passenger transport to be more or less stable.
We expect rail freight transport to decline slightly as optimizations are put in place at DB Cargo.
Due to the ongoing construction activity, we expect the
development of station stops to be constant. The share of
station stops by non-Group train operating companies will
continue to increase.
Slightly positive developments are being forecasted for
real retail sales (excluding cars and gas stations) in Germany
in 2017. Leasing income in stations will also show stable
development and be just over the level of the previous year.

≈≈ Procurement markets

We continue to expect no bottlenecks in procurement. Due
to the oversupply in the oil market, no significant increase
in the oil price is expected in the foreseeable future. In
Germany there will continue to be struggles over the design
of the new electricity market (Electricity Market 2.0). The
wholesale price might fall even further without political
intervention.

≈≈ Financial markets

Trends on the financial markets continue to be shrouded
with high uncertainty. The markets remain extremely volatile in light of the lack of clarity surrounding the procedure
for Great Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, the
future of economic policy in the USA, global central bank
policies and economic development in China.
Bond markets play a special role in this respect. With
demand for safe investments rising, prices in this market
segment rose considerably. Bond prices were also pushed
up by the open market intervention policy adopted by the
ECB. With prices at already high levels, strong gains are
unlikely, but so is a fundamental turnaround of the trend

Volume sold at DB Long-Distance should increase in the
2017 financial year due to improved quality of performance.
By contrast, volume development of DB Regional will be
negative due to lost tenders. Train-path demand is likely to
decline slightly in the 2017 financial year, due mainly to an
expected lower demand from rail freight transport. The
trend of steadily increasing train-path demand from nonGroup customers will continue.
Positive economic and market expectations are also
reflected in the anticipated improvement of performance
by DB Schenker. We expect all lines of business to grow at
a faster pace than the market.

We expect a slight improvement in customer satisfaction
due to the variety of measures initiated in the private customer area.
The actions taken under R AILWAY OF THE FUTURE
are expected to improve punctuality Α further in the 2017
financial year.

◊◊

Prior to year-end 2016, the ICE fleet was equipped with
new WiFi technology, which uses all mobile networks at
the same time to significantly enhance the quality of
In­­ternet connections. The same approach will be used
when rolling out free WiFi in 2nd class of the ICE fleet in
2017.
The lounge concept was extensively revised in recent
months to reinforce the functional character of DB
lounges as part of the travel chain. The pilot of the new
lounge concept will open at Nuremberg central station
in summer 2017.
The ICE PORTAL [ PAGE 103 ] is being expanded to include a
broad portfolio of movies and TV series. Special operating
system variants will make it possible for people with
visual impairments to also use the service.
In September 2016 the 14-month trial and introduction
phase of the new ICE 4 [ PAGE 3 4 FF.] has started. The trains
will be put into regular service on the Hamburg– Munich
and Hamburg – Stuttgart routes when the timetable
changes in December 2017.
The services for families and children are being expanded
to include a CHILDCARE PROGR AM [ PAGE 103 ] on board the
trains all year round. In 2017, this service will be extended
to a further seven routes during the Easter, summer and
fall vacations.

DB Regional

Südostbayernbahn will develop an innovation train in
collaboration with Hyperloop Transportation Technologies in 2017 to develop new product concepts for regional
transport that are linked to digital apps.
◊ ◊ Following the commencement of successive integration
of regional transport associations into the DB NAVIGATOR
[ PAGE 102 ] in 2016, more than 80% of the German population in transport association areas will be able to use
the DB Navigator to buy tickets by the end of 2017.
◊ ◊ Following the launch of the Regio-Spezial promotion in
mid-2016, this special offer is being extended on a trial
basis to the Southwest, Southeast regions and Bavaria
between this year and June 2017.
◊ ◊ Following conclusion of the “Mobility in old age” research
cooperation project with Fresenius University, DB Re­­
gional is planning a bus that is suitable for senior citizens and incorporates new concepts for accessibility.

G ROUP MANAG EMENT REPORT

so far. The general framework is expected to remain ex­­
tremely favorable for bond issuers. The probable continuation of the interest rate turnaround in the USA is, however,
likely to make negative interest rates a thing of the past. In
addition, expectations of higher inflation rates will probably contribute to a moderate rise in interest rates.
Alongside the trends mentioned above, the anticipated
base rate hike in the USA is also affecting the foreign ex­­
change market and the development of the euro. The latter
will probably lose moderate ground temporarily versus the
US dollar. Parity between both currencies cannot be excluded.

Following its successful launch, the DB Streckenagent
(route agent) app was rolled out throughout Germany
on January 1, 2017.

DB Cargo

Starting in early 2017, we will be offering a fast and daily
shuttle for conventional and intermodal transport be­­
tween Belgium and Germany. The DB antwerp-­rhineshuttle will link the Belgian industrial region of Antwerp
with the Ruhr and Rhine-Neckar regions.
◊ ◊ A new link for conventional and combined transport
between Aalborg and Fredericia will improve the connection between Northern Denmark and the European
network, commencing in February 2017.
◊ ◊ Adjustments to production methods in railway construction aim to improve the quality in this segment and to
respond more specifically to customer needs. We want
to reduce car turnaround times to increase the availability of the cars for transporting ballast and sleepers.
◊ ◊ By focusing on three market areas and restructuring
the customer service and marketing functions, we want
to im­­prove our ability to respond to customers’ sales
re­­quirements.

DB Netze Stations

The replacement of the 82 existing DB INFORMATIONS

in fall 2017. Alongside the existing stations, a further
26 stations will be equipped with DB Information 4.0
be­­tween now and 2020.

our stations will be gradually tested and rolled out in
2017 with the aim of visibly enhancing the cleanliness at
stations.

DB Netze Track

The TR AIN-PATH FINDER [ PAGE 103 ] helps customers to plan
train-paths and is scheduled for further development in
2017. Plans include expanding the train-path finder to
include passenger transport, offering a comparison of
the routing results, and integrating the new train-path
pricing system and additional functions.
◊ ◊ New communication formats are going to be rolled out
in 2017 to expand our dialog on construction measures
with customers. Alongside our “Construction Round
Table,” we plan to establish construction and information dialogs in 2017 as an ongoing tool for coordinating
construction sites with the af­­fected customers.

By 2019, we plan to revamp the waiting areas at 21 high-­
frequency stations. Ten stations had already been
equipped with new indoor waiting benches by the end
of 2016.

In 2016, vehicle manufacturer MAN AND DB SCHENKER
[ PAGE 86 ] entered into a partnership agreement governing
the development and testing of linked and AUTOMATED
DRIVING Δ [ PAGE 86 ] systems. The project framework and
practical trials scope will be defined in 2017. For 2018, a
truck platoon is planned to commute along the digital
test field of the A 9 highway between DB Schenker’s
offices in Munich and Nuremberg. In a second step, we
plan to put self-driving trucks into service on DB Schenker’s site in Nuremberg.

Additional measures
◊◊

Together with the sponsor, Lidl Deutschland, we plan
to launch a new bicycle hire system in Berlin called LIDLBIKE. Starting in spring 2017, 3,500 bikes will be made
available for hire and return at various stations within the
S-Bahn (metro) ring in Berlin.

Further improvements anticipated in the 2017
financial year.

regarding market, competition and environ­mental developments, as well as the successful
implementation of planned measures.

The main drivers of revenue growth will be DB Arriva

program will have a
noticeable effect, for example.
◊ ◊ ROCE is expected to improve slightly as a result of the
slightly positive development of adjusted EBIT in conjunction with a proportionately smaller increase in capital employed.
◊ ◊ The development of redemption coverage is likely to be
slightly positive while the increase in net financial debt
is expected to be proportionately smaller.

At DB Netze Energy, revenue development is likely to be

­ary and traction energy. Accordingly, we also expect profits
to decline.

2016

In 2017, revenues at DB Netze Stations should increase,

a positive effect on the profit development.

DB Long-Distance

In the 2017 financial year, we expect DB Long-Distance to
generate slightly higher revenues by year-on-year comparison. With additional support from cost-reducing measures,
adjusted EBIT should increase year on year.
DB Regional

In the 2017 financial year, we expect DB Regional to generate revenues on a par with the previous year. In the wake
of the Regional Railway of the Future measures, we expect
higher profits despite a slight decline in volume.
DB Cargo

In the 2017 financial year, we expect a decline in volume
sold at DB Cargo caused by the initial effects of R AILWAY OF
THE FUTURE
and by refocusing the business model in
France. Revenues should remain constant. We hope that
countermeasures will be able to compensate for negative
effects arising, for example from increased factor costs, to
produce a result that is above the previous yearʼs level.

In the 2017 financial year, the positive effects resulting from
new transport services and acquisitions as well as exchange
rate effects will be noticeable at DB Arriva. We therefore
expect revenue and profit developments above the previous yearʼs level.
DB Schenker

In the 2017 financial year, we expect further growth at DB
Schenker, following implementation of the new PRIMUS
[ PAGE 170 ] strategy. This growth will be based on both vol­­
ume and price effects. This development should also have
a positive impact on adjusted EBIT.

be launching a far-reaching follow-up process at team, busi- DB 04

at DB Netze Track to be slightly positive. Adjusted EBIT is
also expected to improve in conjunction with R AILWAY OF

We will continue on our course of modernization with high

activities on rail infrastructure. In the 2017 financial year, we
intend to invest a total of well over € 5 billion, including in­­
vestment grants, in the renovation and renewal of existing
lines, facilities and technology. This is even more than the
capital expenditures in the year under review. Net capital
expenditures will also increase, mainly due to vehicle procurements at DB Long-Distance and DB Regional.

Net financial debt as of Dec 31

Efficient liquidity management is once again a top priority
for us in the 2017 financial year. We are focusing on continually forecasting the cash flow from our operating activities, as this is our main source of cash and cash equivalents.
We produce liquidity forecasts every month on the basis of
a 12-month liquidity plan. In the 2017 financial year, we must

196

redeem financial liabilities (excluding commercial paper and
current bank liabilities) amounting to about € 2.1 billion.
Funding needs are met by the issue of public and non-public
bonds. Roadshows are planned in Europe and Asia in conjunction with the bond issues.
We anticipate that the shares of current and non-current
liabilities will not essentially change the structure of the
equity and liabilities side of the balance sheet as the financ­
­ing measures will primarily serve to refinance expiring
financial debt.
We continue to have adequate financing scope for our
capital markets activities based on our DEBT ISSUANCE AND
COMMERCIAL PAPER PRO GR AM [ PAG E 1 10 ] . The GUAR ANTEED
CREDIT FACILITIES [ PAGE 1 10 ] serve as a fallback in the event
of interrupted access to the capital market. Our short- and
medium-term liquidity supply is therefore also secure in the
2017 financial year.
The majority of our gross capital expenditures in the 2017
financial year will again be covered by investment grants.
The net capital expenditures to be financed by DB Group will
remain at a high level in the 2017 financial year.
In the year under review, the owner of DB AG decided to
support DB AG with a capital increase of € 1 billion in the 2017
financial year. Of this amount, € 0.5 billion must be additionally approved by the Budget Committee of the Bundes­
­t ag. In addition, the planned dividend payment will be
reduced by € 350 million in the 2017 financial year.
DB Group assumes, however, that it will not be able to
fully fund net capital expenditures and the dividend payment to the Federal Government from internal sources of
financing and the capital increase. Net financial debt as of
December 31, 2017, is therefore likely to be higher than at
the end of the year under review.
We will continue our M&A activities in a selective and
focused manner in the 2017 financial year. We do not expect
these activities to have any significant impact on our financial position in the 2017 financial year.
FORWARD -LOOKING STATEMENTS
This management report contains statements and forecasts pertaining to the future
development of DB Group, its business units and individual companies. These forecasts
are estimates made based on information that was available at the current time. Actual
developments and profits may diverge from the current expectations as a result of the
non-materialization of the assumptions upon which our forecasts are based or the materialization of risks such as those presented in the Risk report.
DB Group does not assume any obligation to update the statements made within this

management report.

other transactions are set out in the section “Changes in DB Group.”

Changes in segment allocation

In connection with the process of the Group restructuring which was
decided in the previous year, the internal service functions and services
within the Group were restructured at the beginning of the 2016 financial
year. The previous segment DB Services has been dissolved and has not
been replaced. The companies in this segment have been allocated to
the segment Subsidiaries/Other. In addition, DB Bahnbau Gruppe GmbH
(previously allocated to the segment DB Netze Track) is disclosed in the
segment Subsidiaries/Other, and AMEROPA-REISEN GmbH (previously
allocated to the segment Subsidiaries/Other) is disclosed in the segment
DB Long-Distance.

In this connection, the segment DB Energy has been taken out of the
segment Subsidiaries/Other and shown separately in line with internal
reporting.

Any difference between the purchase costs of the business combination and the acquired assets valued at fair value is shown as goodwill.

Movements in the group of fully consolidated companies of DB Group
are detailed in the following:

If the purchase price is lower than the fair value of the acquired assets,
the difference, following a further assessment, is shown immediately in
the income statement.
Minority interests are calculated on a pro rata basis from the assets,
liabilities and contingent obligations valued with their fair value.
The acquisition and sale of shares in an already fully consolidated
company which does not result in a change of control is shown directly
in equity. There have accordingly been no changes to the carrying

DB AG directly or indirectly holds 20 to 50% of the voting rights in these

companies and the related assumption of association is not refuted.
In exceptional cases, companies in which DB Group holds fewer than
20% of the voting rights are also classified as associates. Despite such a
low shareholding, a major influence is deemed to exist in such cases, for
instance as a result of various rights of co-determination in major issues
of business policy or because members of management are appointed
by DB Group.
Joint ventures and associated companies are accounted for using the
equity method in accordance with IAS 28 (Investments in Associates and

capital structure which is adequate for maintaining a very good rating.

Change

The capital structure is managed on the basis of the gearing figure.
Gearing is defined as the ratio between net financial debt (financial debt
less receivables from financing and cash and cash equivalents) and shareholders’ equity. The main instruments for managing the capital structure
are: scheduled repayment of financial debt as well as strengthening of
the capital base by way of retained earnings.
The aim is to achieve gearing of 100% and thus parity between debt
and equity. This objective is unchanged compared with last year. Gearing
has developed as follows:

assigned civil servants, DB AG reimburses to the BEV (Federal Railway
Fund) those costs which would be incurred if an employee covered by
collective bargaining arrangements were to be employed instead of the
assigned civil servant (pro forma calculation).
The increase in wages and salaries mainly reflects the linear in­­
creases resulting from the collective bargaining agreement in 2015 as
well as the one-off payment agreed in the collective bargaining agreement of December 12, 2016. The one-off payment is applicable for the
period from October 2016 to March 2017, and was recognized on a pro

The actual taxes on income have been incurred mainly at foreign Group
companies. Income was recognized in the year under review in relation
to deferred taxes, whereas expenses were recorded in the previous year.
The change is due in particular to an increase of the expected future use
of tax loss carry-forwards as well as new temporary differences which
have arisen and tax loss carry-forwards.
Starting with the net profit of DB Group before taxes on income and
the theoretical taxes on income calculated using a theoretical tax rate

in the IFRS financial statements have been deducted directly from the
costs of purchasing the assets. It is not permissible for deferred taxes to
be created in relation to these temporary differences.

effects attributable to the difference in the assessment bases of different

≈≈ (16) Deferred taxes

Deferred taxes are calculated in accordance with IAS 12 ( Income Taxes ).
The theoretical income tax rate for corporations for domestic companies used as the basis for calculating deferred taxes was 30.5 %. The
income tax rate comprises the corporation tax rate plus solidarity surcharge and an average trade tax rate. Foreign subsidiaries use their
relevant local tax rates for calculating deferred taxes.
A deferred tax asset is recognized in accordance with IAS 12.24 or IAS

12.34 if, after corresponding deferred tax liabilities have been deducted,
it is likely that adequate taxable income is available. The medium-term
planning is used as the basis in this respect. Deferred tax assets relating
to income which can be generated after the medium-term period are not
recognized, on the grounds that they cannot be reliably determined.
Deferred taxes are established on the basis of the tax rates which
can be expected for the period in which the deferred tax is realized on

The calculation of deferred tax assets is generally based on the mid-­term
planning. If the sum of net profits planned for the mid-term planning period
were to decline by 10 % in conjunction with otherwise unchanged tax
param­­eters, deferred tax assets would have to be adjusted by € 115 million

basis short-term euro-denominated trade accounts receivable up to a
maximum volume of € 550 million. The agreement has been concluded
for an indefinite period of time. DB Group will continue to be responsible
for sales ledger accounting and the dunning system on behalf of the
bank until further notice. The risks relating to the receivables which are
sold and which are relevant for the risk assessment are the credit risk
and the risk of late payment (late-payment risk). The pur­­chase price is
equivalent to the nominal amount. DB Group bears bad debt related to
credit risks from the various tranches as well as late-payment risks up to
a maximum amount of € 123 million. The other bad debts related to the
credit risk are borne by the bank. Virtually none of the opportunities and
risks associated with the receivables have been transferred or retained
(breakdown of major risks between DB Group and bank). Control over
some of the receivables which have been sold has been transferred to
the bank, as the actual power for authorizing onward sales lies with the
bank. These receivables are derecognized entirely. As of December 31,
2016, outstanding receivables with a volume of € 446 mil­­lion had been
sold; of this figure, € 200 million had been entirely derec­­ognized, and
€ 246 million had been derecognized to the extent of the transferred
risk. Purchase price payments received from the bank boosted the cash
flow from operating activities.
The receivables from financing include residual values of € 32 million

date. Common valuation methods such as option price or present-value
models are used for determining the fair value of financial instruments
which are not traded in an active market. If valuation-relevant parameters are not directly observable on the market, forecasts are used based
on comparable financial instruments which are traded in an active
market; these forecasts are then adjusted by premiums or discounts on
the basis of historical data. The mean value of bid and offer rates are
used. Trades for which no premium has been paid have a fair value of
zero upon conclusion. DB AG operates with long-dated financial derivatives on a hedged basis, and does not perform any credit risk adjustment
for the present value for hedged transactions. For considerations of
materiality, no credit risk adjustment is used for short-term derivatives.
If credit risk adjustment is used, the relevant discounts are derived from
the credit default swap ( CDS ) figures observable on the market.
All derivatives used in DB Group are measured using common methods
such as option price or present value models, because their fair values
are not traded on an active market. No parameters from non-observable
markets are used for measurement purposes.

of hedges due to the transfer of transactions between banks. The conditions, including the cash flows of the derivatives, remained unchanged,

(e.g. special-purpose association, local transport company); these contracts determine the way in which the transport service is provided and
continued, and also governs the relevant compensation (concession
fees) paid for the transport services.
The funds necessary for this purpose are made available to the
Federal states by the Federal Government in accordance with the regulations of the Regionalization Act (Regionalisierungsgesetz; RegG).
The concession fees received by the subsidiaries of the segment
DB Regional amounted to a total of € 3,866 million in the year under
[ PAGE 209 ]).

In addition, there are similar transport contracts with international
contracting organizations in the segment DB Arriva, with a volume of
€ 873 million in the year under review (previous year: € 656 million) (see
NOTE (1) [ PAGE 209 ]).

80% of all the hedged transport contracts run until at least 2019,
50% run until at least 2023 and 25% run until at least 2027. The transport
contracts can only be terminated by the contracting organization during
the term of the agreement for a compelling reason.
In many cases, the companies enjoy legal and beneficial ownership
of the assets necessary for providing the services, and in particular the
rolling stock. Some transport contracts include obligations whereby the
assets which are deployed have to be handed over at the end of the life
of the agreement. In addition, DB Group is recording an increasing percentage of transport contracts in which the rolling stock is either leased
by contracting organization or for which the leasing arrangement is supported by capital service guarantees by the contracting organization.

In Germany, companies with more than 20 employees are legally required
to have an occupational health and safety committee (Arbeitsschutzaus­

The key is the definition of the operation (production facility, branch,

Regular check-ups and advice
in health protection

DB Group offers its employees preventive healthcare in the form of

training sessions, advice and regular medical check-ups. In addition, the
companyʼs occupational social services (BSW and VDES) offer advice and
training programs, as do DB Groupʼs social insurers (Bahn-Betriebskrankenkasse; BAHN -BKK), Eisenbahn-Unfallkasse (EUK) and Deutsche Renten­
­versicherung Knappschaft-Bahn-See (KBS)). The focal points in occupational health management are on demographic change and the prevention
of mental stress.
In Germany, DB Group determines the possible health hazards using
a risk analysis for each type of workplace and determines appropriate
measures: ergonomic design of workstations, training on the handling
of hazardous substances or hazardous work, as well as general instructions on the dangers in the individual work environment. Any known
potential hazards are described to the employee in writing and in person.

The number of employees in Germany was at the previous yearʼs level.
The share of employees outside Germany increased slightly to about
39% (previous year: about 37%).

IT systems for the detection of contact points

We use geographic information systems (geografische Informationssysteme; GIS), in which the data on train lines and surrounding land and all
digitally available information on protected areas is stored in Germany.
This enables us to quickly identify the points of contact between nature
and DB Groupʼs train lines and rights of way. These findings are important
for our planning. There are different restrictions and conditions in each
protected area, which are described in protected area ordinances. These
are stored in our system and are taken into account when planning construction and maintenance work.
