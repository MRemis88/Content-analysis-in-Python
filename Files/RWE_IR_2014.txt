INTERVIEW WITH PETER TERIUM CEO OF RWE AG
Mr Terium, four years ago you launched the programme “RWE 2015”.
In 2015, are you now in a position to say: “Job done”?
No, certainly not. It’s true that we have achieved a lot over the past
four years. We have become more efficient in our work processes,
reduced our debts and developed new business ideas. Nevertheless,
the changes are going to continue. The transition in the European
energy sector, and megatrends like “Sustainable Development” and
“Digitisation” are challenging us anew every day.
Is it possible to position a company sustainably if it is engaged in an
ongoing process of transition?
This is absolutely essential. We will only have a common benchmark
for our actions on a day-to-day basis if our mission is clearly defined
over the long term. That benchmark is: We are the most trusted and
high-performing partner for the sustainable transformation of the
European energy system.
How do you motivate your employees to commit to this mission?
A transition of this nature cannot be ordered top down – it needs to
be lived bottom up by everyone working for RWE. Over the past few
years, we have introduced the project “We are RWE”, which is
designed to achieve this objective. Since the project has been in
existence, we have held discussions in small workshops about the
new strategic direction of the Group and addressed new ways of
thinking and working. This has involved around 60,000 employees.

GRI G4-1

RWE has traditionally been a company defined by technology. Are
supposedly soft topics like this taken at all seriously by colleagues?
Fifteen years ago I would have had considerable doubts. However,
today the mood is different. Everyone in the company is aware that
technical excellence is no longer adequate on its own. Not only
‘what’ but also ‘how’ is a key factor in decision-making. We need
employees who have creative powers and use their own initiative to
develop new ideas independently. They then need to go on and
develop these ideas in the interests of the customer.
Does RWE have the right people on board for this task?
There’s no question about it. And we also have the right mix with
experts from the power plants, energy trading, distribution grids and
the customer centre – each of them has their own special knowledge
and experience. This is how innovative solutions are generated.
How do you ensure that employees from the different RWE companies are able to come together, let alone cooperate together?
We have formed our own innovation teams which are bundled in an
“Innovation Hub”. Some colleagues work there full-time and others
have a commitment in addition to their other functions. This creates
an ideal balance between continuous cooperation and tight integration within the structure of routine business every day.

Interview with Peter Terium

Does RWE have the capital available to develop new products and
take them to market?
We no longer have the funds to invest that we had ten years ago. But
there again we are not building new, expensive power plants any more.
Nevertheless, there is still money available for healthy growth. However,
although the main fields where we want to focus our growth require a
lower level of finance, they demand know-how and strategic partners
in order to develop new business models and smart technologies.

“How is also
a key factor”

The interview was conducted by
Dr Matthias Kussin and
Daniel Schneiders,
RWE Corporate Responsibility

GRI G4-1

Who are you working with in concrete terms?
For example, we are working with the thermostat developer Nest. We
have been selling intelligent heating controllers in the United Kingdom
since April 2014 and since September of last year we have also been
selling these exclusively in the Netherlands. A second example of this
is our cooperation with Samsung. The SmartCams are now compatible with our Smart Home System for intelligent house control.
Why is the topic of partnership so important for RWE?
The global world is too complex and dynamic for us to implement
the energy transition alone. Joined-up action is the key. It provides
information, opens up new markets for us and increases the level of
acceptance for our role in the new energy world. Finance is also
important, particularly finance for the expansion of renewable energies. Last year, we invested around 750 million euros in renewable
energies. From 2015 until 2017, we are planning capex of one billion
euros. We need partners to continue developing major new projects
with this budget.



Content

In which areas are you experiencing a higher level of acceptance
through joint ventures?
One example of this kind of success is setting up intelligent networks
or building local-authority generating plants. The value of joint ventures is also evident in completely different areas, such as the purchase
of hard coal from other countries. Our objective here is to ensure
that standards for human rights and the environment are upheld at
our producers. Working as an individual company we are unable to
get much leverage on this issue. We are only able to exert an impact
together with other companies in the Bettercoal sector initiative.
Generating electricity from hard coal will undoubtedly also be an
issue at this year’s World Climate Summit in Paris. What are your
hopes from this conference?
Most importantly, more reliability in relation to how international climate protection will be dealt with in the future. We have been
demanding a binding international agreement for some time now.
This will not only help the climate, it will also power economic development in Europe.
What climate targets has RWE defined for itself?
We have set ourselves the goal of reducing our CO2 emissions by
20 % compared with 2005. However, as far as we are concerned,
sustainability is not just about climate protection. We have also set
ourselves goals in the other CR areas for action. Our commitment to
the United Nations Global Compact at an overarching level has been
steadfast since 2004 and we continue to be dedicated to its principles.

OUR COMPANY
RWE ranks among the biggest electricity and gas utilities in Europe.
Around 60,000 employees ensure that some 16 million customers are
supplied with electricity and 7.2 million customers with gas. At the close
of 2014, RWE had power station capacities totalling 49,064 MW. 32 % of
this electricity was generated from gas (2013: 34 %), 23 % from lignite
(2013: 23 %), 21 % from hard coal (2013: 20 %), 8 % from nuclear energy
(2013: 8 %) and 7.5 % from renewable energies (2013: 7 %). This includes
4,351 MW of capacity generated by contracted power stations owned by
other companies and we are able to access their capacities freely through
long-term contracts. In Europe, we are ranked by retail business in third
place for electricity and fifth place for gas. In Germany, the Netherlands
and the United Kingdom, we are positioned among the biggest electricity
and gas utilities. In the Czech Republic, we are number one in the gas

OUR VALUE CHAIN
RWE is an integrated energy supplier and operates at all stages of the
value chain. At the moment, we are adapting our business model to the
changes in the sector. This is because the energy industry in Europe is
undergoing fundamental change. We are increasingly focusing on initiatives for local energy supply, seeking out partnerships with investors and
municipal utilities, and we want to drive the energy transition forward
together with local residents in the community. We are achieving these
goals by offering our customers products and services based on innovative
technologies. This is also reflected in the structure of our value chain.

GRI G4-18; G4-23

We have allocated our CR areas for action to the stages of the value chain
and highlighted the relevant challenges. These vary according to the different stages of the value chain. Furthermore, the representation includes
an allocation of the key aspects of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).
We also state whether the major opportunities for exerting influence to
overcome the challenges are inside or outside the RWE Group.

DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR REGIONS
Our market environment and the demands of the community are changing with the transition of the energy systems in
Europe. We are meeting the diverse challenges faced by the RWE Group at all levels of the value chain and in all the
regions where we are operating.

Europe’s energy industry in transition
The framework conditions for our business are changing fundamentally as a result of political interventions. The expansion of renewable
energies is modifying the way energy markets operate – with major
impacts on our business success.
In wholesale markets for electricity generation, regulatory instruments like the feed-in priority for renewable energies and their remuneration through the system of subsidies increase demand and
thereby reduce electricity prices in this market segment and the associated utilisation of our plants. This in turn cuts down the revenues
derived from our power plants, especially in Continental Europe.
Many plants, in particular gas-fired power plants, are no longer able
to cover their operating costs. Conversely, their use is popular with a
large number of stakeholders because they are regarded as flexible
and have lower CO2 emissions by comparison with coal-fired power
stations.

GRI G4-DMA

Our electricity production has therefore also declined. This trend will
continue over the coming years because an increasing number of
citizens, companies and energy cooperatives are generating electricity for themselves in decentralised plants and feeding some of that
electricity into the public electricity grid. This is also reducing the
amount of electricity are able to market to customers in our retail
business. At the beginning of 2012, we launched the programme
“RWE 2015” in order to maintain our position in this market environment. This programme has defined the changes and efficiency
improvements within the RWE Group for the future. These include
comprehensive measures for reducing costs, increasing profits and
a strategic realignment with a stronger focus on innovative products
and services in the energy market.

Germany
Germany is our biggest market. This is where we generate 57 % of
our total sales amounting to € 26.2 million (not including levies on
natural gas/electricity). The historic roots of our company are also in
Germany. We manage the entire RWE Group from our Head Office
located in Essen.
Extraction and generation
RWE operates three large opencast mines in Germany for the production of lignite. We have four lignite-fired power stations with a total
generating capacity of 10,291 MW. Furthermore, BoA 2&3 optimised
power plant units are currently the most advanced lignite-fired units
in the world. These generating plants are located very close to our
lignite mines at Neurath, Niederaußem, Weisweiler and Frimmersdorf. We also have generating capacity in Germany amounting to
5,318 MW for hard coal and 4,411 MW for gas. At the Hamm site in
Westphalia, we are constructing one of the most advanced hard-coal
power stations in the world with a total output of 1,528 MW. In
August 2014, we brought unit E of the power plant on stream. At the
end of 2014, we additionally had generating capacities of nuclear
energy in Germany amounting to more than 3,908 MW. Following
the exit from nuclear energy adopted by the German Parliament
(“Bundestag”), our last nuclear power station is scheduled to exit
from the grid in 2022. We are not involved in investment projects for
nuclear energy. We have a further generating capacity of 4,197 MW
in the areas of pumped-storage, oil and other power-plant capacities.

GRI EU1; EU10; EU4

Grids and retail business
RWE is one of the biggest operators of distribution grids in Germany.
The Group operates electricity distribution grids with a total length
of 330,000 km and gas distribution grids with a total length of
48,000 km. At the end of 2014, we were granted around 3,000 electricity grid and 800 gas grid concession agreements in Germany with
a term of at least 15 to 20 years. Alongside the sale of electricity, gas
and heat, we are also active in the areas of energy efficiency and
electromobility, as well as in the development and operation of
smart devices to measure and control energy consumption. Overall,
we supply around 8.0 million customers in Germany with electricity
and gas, in addition to other energy services. The regional companies enviaM, LEW, Süwag and VSE are part of the RWE Group and we
also have shareholdings in around 80 regional and local-authority
energy utilities.
Renewable energies
In Germany, we are particularly strong in the area of renewable energies. At the end of 2014, RWE in Germany was operating consolidated generating capacity of renewable energies amounting to
1,263 MW, of which 621 MW is generated by hydropower, 598 MW is
wind energy and 40 MW is biomass. In 2014, RWE joined forces with
29 municipal utilities to bring the onshore wind farm “Düshorner
Heide” on stream with 26 MW. Furthermore, RWE supports the development of future-proof technologies and provides seed capital for
innovative companies at the pump-priming stage and finance for
them in the growth phase.

Structuring the energy transition
The German government wants to use its national climate protection plan to achieve the ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and hence highlight its pioneering
role in climate protection. All sectors need to be integrated in
order to achieve the objective of a 40 % reduction for CO2 emissions in Germany by 2020 compared with the established baseline from 1990. The German government has defined a reduction
volume of 22 million mt of CO2 each year for the energy industry
in addition to the savings previously agreed. We are reducing our
CO2 emissions with advanced and highly efficient plants. At the
same time, by 2017 we will have reduced our generating capacities in the area of conventional power plants in Germany by up to
around 9,000 MW, partly on account of lack of profitability. We
are also taking 6,300 MW of our own gas-fired and hard-coal
power stations out of service or mothballing them over the long
term. A further 2,700 MW of generating capacity relates to contracts for long-term use of hard-coal capacities which we will not
be renewing.
The improvement in energy efficiency in Germany is a key element
of the national climate protection plan. We offer customers intelligent products and services to provide solutions that allow energy
to be used more efficiently, for example by deploying intelligent
control systems or advanced electricity storage (p. 38 and p. 53).

GRI EU10

In addition, climate protection is also a constituent element of
further regional and local initiatives and we contribute our expertise and concrete proposals to these projects.

United Kingdom
The United Kingdom is our second most important market. RWE is
one of the six biggest energy suppliers in the country and produces
around 10 % of the electricity consumed there. In 2014, we generated sales of € 9,533 million in the UK with a total workforce of
9,984 employees.
Generation
RWE operates conventional power plants in the United Kingdom with
a total capacity of 9,830 MW. Gas-fired power stations make up the
biggest proportion. Pembroke is the largest CCGT power station in
Europe with a net output of more than 2,000 MW and it also has the
highest level of efficiency at 59 %.

Retail business
We are one of the leading suppliers of electricity and gas with
around 5.556 thousand retail and business customers in the United
­Kingdom.
Renewable energies
In the United Kingdom, RWE is also focusing on the expansion of
renewable energies in onshore and offshore wind farms. Overall, we
operate 1,194 MW of generating capacity from renewable energies.
During the year under review, the Goole Fields 1 onshore wind farm
came on stream with a capacity of around 33 MW and the Maldie
pumped-storage plant with a capacity of 4 MW also started up.
At the latest from mid-2015, our offshore wind farm Gwynt y Môr is
scheduled to be connected to the grid generating 576 MW of electricity commercially at full capacity.

Fair prices in focus
The United Kingdom is legally bound by a political decision to
deliver a greenhouse-gas emissions reduction of 80 % by 2050.
As one of the biggest energy suppliers in the country, RWE has
the challenge of meeting all the requirements for an affordable
and secure energy supply while also protecting the climate. In
recent years, we have invested heavily in advanced gas-fired
power stations in the United Kingdom. As in Germany, profitable
operation of these power plants is at risk due to the latest developments, comparatively low electricity generating costs in hardcoal power stations and the expansion of renewable energies.
The British government therefore introduced a capacity market in
order to counteract potential problems with security of supply.
The first auction for the initial subsidy period (2018/2019) was
held in December 2014.
Providing fair and transparent energy prices is particularly important for our customers in the United Kingdom. In recent times,
the biggest driver of customer prices has been the regulatory and
policy costs that are associated with delivering infrastructure
investment and implementing social and environmental programmes. We support consumers in improving their energy efficiency in order to make energy affordable, particularly for the
most vulnerable households in society. Intelligent electricity

meters known as smart meters help consumers to understand
and control their energy use as never before. They will therefore
also be key to delivering other intelligent levels of service in the
area of energy efficiency. We are cooperating with the government in order to foster greater public understanding and acceptance for this technology among consumers. Through ECO (Energy
Company Obligation) we support the energy efficiency measures
of our customers, such as building insulation and new heating
systems. We are the only energy supplier in the United Kingdom
to offer our customers the Nest Learning Thermostat. This thermostat programs itself and can switch off automatically.

Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg
RWE is one of the leading energy utilities in the Netherlands and Belgium. A focus of our activities in these countries is in the area of
renewable energies, as well as in the retail business for electricity
and gas.
Generation
In the Netherlands and Belgium, RWE operates hard-coal and gasfired power stations with a total generating capacity of 6,045 MW.
At our coal-fired power station in Geertruidenberg, we also use large
quantities of biomass to replace hard coal. The new hard-coal Eemshaven power station with a total capacity of 1,554 MW will start
commercial operation in 2015. We are planning to use biomass for
generation there as well if technical and commercial conditions permit. RWE also holds a minority shareholding in the Borssele nuclear
power station.
In Luxembourg, we operate the Vianden pumped-storage power
plant. This is one of the largest power generating facilities of its type
in Europe. The plant plays a key role in the stabilisation of Europe’s
electricity grids and in maintaining the balance between feed-in and

GRI EU1; EU10

consumption of electricity and it is connected to the German grid.
We installed an additional turbine to increase its output to 1,300 MW
in 2014.
Retail business
In the Netherlands and in Belgium, we have 3.7 million electricity
and gas customers. More than one million customers use our “green
power” product. We also deliver heat and offer innovative energy
services. In Belgium, we are continuing to expand the energy retail
business.
Renewable energies
RWE is one of the major investors in wind farms in the Netherlands
and Belgium, and its portfolio includes onshore and offshore facilities. At the end of 2014, we were operating wind turbines here with
a total capacity of 217 MW. In 2014, we started construction work on
the Zuidwester (90MW) wind farms. The Thornton Bank offshore
wind farm has a capacity of 325 MW and is one of the biggest facilities of its kind in the Belgian section of the North Sea. RWE has a
stake of around 27 % in this offshore wind farm.

Retail channels in transition
As a result of low wholesale prices, the crisis in the eurozone
and solar-powered generation of electricity in Germany, Dutch
coal-fired power stations and in particular gas-fired power
stations are coming under economic pressure. Since 2013,
we have mothballed two modern and environmentally friendly
power stations “Claus C” and “Moerdijk II”. In 2013, the Dutch
government also introduced a coal tax which brought about a
deterioration in the competitive conditions in the Netherlands
for coal-fired power stations by comparison with power plants in
other countries. Under the National Energy Agreement, it was
agreed to reduce the coal tax to zero with effect from 1 January
2016. In return, the power plant operators agreed to take five old
coal-fired power stations out of service by the same date.
The current national subsidy system for the generation of electricity from biomass comes to an end in 2015. We will continue to
expand electricity production with the help of biomass within the
framework of the successor programme and this will therefore
provide significant support for the Dutch and European targets
on expanding renewable energies.



Content

In the Netherlands, we are being challenged by increasing competition from new, national energy suppliers and by new retail
channels. We have been successful in the face of this competition
by improving our customer service, introducing new pricing models for loyal customers and developing new retail channels with
retail partners. We offer customers other products in the area of
renewable energies and energy efficiency. They can use an online
portal to check their energy consumption, obtain advice about
energy issues and order products to reduce their energy consumption.

Central Eastern and South-eastern Europe, and Turkey
RWE is also an active player in Central Eastern and South-eastern
Europe, and Turkey in the areas of conventional generation, retail
business and grids, as well as operating in renewable energies. We
have businesses in Croatia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Turkey and Hungary. Overall, we supply around five million customers there with energy and services.
Generation
In Hungary, we operate the Mátra lignite-fired power station with
two associated opencast lignite mines. In 2014, we produced a total
of 8.8 million mt of lignite. The power plant with a generating output
of 780 MW was also fuelled with 373,000 mt of biomass. RWE operates a gas-fired power station in Turkey with an output of 775 MW.
We are involved in Croatia as the co-owner of the Plomin hard-coal
power station and in wastewater business.
Grids and retail
Retail business, distribution and storage of gas are the focus of our
business in the Czech Republic. RWE operates a gas distribution grid
there with a length of 63,875 km and supplies 1.4 million customers
with natural gas. Since 2010, we have also been selling electricity in
the Czech Republic and we supply around 265,000 customers with
power.
In Hungary, we operate an electricity distribution grid with a length
of 46,200 km and supply around 2.1 million customers with
electricity.

GRI EU1; EU4

We have an electricity distribution grid in Poland with a length of
15,998 km and we supply around 900,000 customers with electricity.
Since 2014, we have also been supplying natural gas in Poland.
In Slovakia, we supply more than 100,000 customers with natural
gas. We also operate an electricity grid more than 20,000 km in
length and we are developing decentralised energy solutions in
Central and Eastern Slovakia.
We are active in energy retail business in Croatia and we supply
nearly 100,000 customers with electricity.
Since 2014, we have been operating a nationwide retail organisation
in Romania and we are now supplying our first customers with electricity. Our head office is located in Bucharest and we have a number
of regional offices. We want to grow our operations there and concentrate on supplying small and mid-size companies, and industrial
customers.
Renewable energies
In Poland, we are continuing to expand our capacities in the area of
renewable energies. We have a total of six wind farms there with an
installed output of 197 MW.

Study on the Polish energy market
RWE contributes its expertise to the debate about energy systems of the future. We carried out an energy market study in
Poland to analyse the developments and technological challenges
there. We have presented potential political, economic and community framework conditions for the development of innovative
technologies up until 2050 in four hypothetical scenarios.
Poland’s energy industry is currently defined by energy generation from coal-fired power stations. Coal as a fuel will continue to
play an important role there for the generation of energy, even if
the proportion of this form of energy generation declines in
favour of other energy sources. These include in particular
increasing levels for generation of electricity by gas-fired power
stations, and from wind power and photovoltaic plants. As they
are expanded, Poland will also be in a position to safeguard security of supply over the long term without significantly increasing
its energy imports. At the same time, the study identified opportunities for increasing diversification and modernisation of the
energy supply in order to reduce the country’s greenhouse gas
emissions and make its contribution to the climate protection targets of the European Union. Important issues include the ongoing dissemination of smart meters, load management and hence
associated services for reduction of energy consumption. By
2020, electromobility will play an important role in Poland.

GRI G4-DMA

Content

By 2015, decentralised energy generation in small plants has also
increased in importance. The proportion of energy produced by
these plants out of all the energy generated in Poland was seen
to rise significantly in all the scenarios analysed. Two developments in particular have contributed to this change in the electricity market. Small plants which have previously only been used
for generating heat are now being upgraded with the help of
cogeneration and they are achieving higher levels of efficiency as
a result. At the same time, energy generation by photovoltaic systems will become increasingly popular as investment costs come
down significantly over the upcoming five years.

CR Strategy and Management



Content

CR STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT
We pursue the objective of integrating sustainability more firmly in the core business of RWE through our Corporate Responsibility (CR)
Strategy. Ten areas for action have been defined which encompass the most important challenges confronting RWE and we use them to
achieve this goal. The areas for action are the means of continuously managing our activities on the basis of concrete goals and measurable
key performance indicators (KPI). Our intention is to make Corporate Responsibility a fixed element in the operational controlling system of
our company by 2020. Our roadmap on Corporate Responsibility presents development since 1998 and describes our long-term objective.

Continuous further development
In 2012, we launched a group-wide process for revising Corporate
Responsibility in order to strengthen Corporate Responsibility within
the Group. In the following year, we adjusted our strategic focuses to
match current developments by revising the conceptual platform
underlying our areas for action. The results of this process were validated by a stakeholder survey. The three dimensions of environment,
social engagement and corporate governance in accordance with the
ESG Model (Environment, Social, Governance) served as a framework
for the new alignment. In 2014, we consistently continued along the
road route of realignment relating to our areas for action and strategic focuses.

In the area for action “Energy Efficiency”, we continued to focus on
efficient electricity generation at our power plants and energy efficiency in other corporate activities. Conversely, we have allocated
our packages for improving energy efficiency with customers to the
recently renamed area for action “Market/Customer” and we report
here on our products and services for the energy world of the future.
This complements the content of the original area for action which
was focused on the issues of credibility and performance for our customers under the former designation “Customer Trust”. This realignment enables us to focus on the Group Strategy. This incorporates a
greater role to the offering of products and services for the energy
transition as a division of the RWE Group.

CR Strategy and Management



CR Management
The RWE Group Centre holds overall responsibility for coordinating
the group-wide implementation and realisation of Corporate Responsibility in all divisions. At the beginning of 2014, the Corporate
Responsibility Department was brought together with the areas of
communication and energy policy to form the Corporate Affairs
Department in order to ensure tighter integration of differing stakeholder interests. The head of this department, reports directly to the
Chief Executive Officer. Since 2014, the RWE “Stakeholder Council”
(p. 28) has been advising the Executive Board of the Group on sustainability issues. Furthermore, representatives from the Group Cen-

Content

tre and the major operating companies come together at meetings
held by the staff of CR officers several times a year. These meetings
serve as forums for coordinating ideas and discussing joint activities.
Making CR successes quantifiable
We consistently pursue the roadmap of making governance and its
effectiveness quantifiable and controllable. Our ten areas for action
are underpinned with targets, measures and concrete key performance indicators. A review of the relevance and timeliness of the
programme is carried out every year and always takes account of
developments in the areas for action, the strategy of the RWE Group
and the expectations of our stakeholders (p. 35).

We also create long-term incentives for sustainable corporate governance by linking part of the variable compensation payable to Members of the Executive Board with the achievement of our CR goals.
The assessment is carried out by the Supervisory Board of the RWE
Group. Relevant CR aspects are channelled into the individual balanced scorecards of the operating companies.
Orientation to national and international standards
We base our reporting on globally acknowledged targets such as the
guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the UN Global
Compact. This enables us to comply with the growing demands
being placed on the quality of our CR Management and our reporting. We have also developed a Data Recording Manual with the aim
of continuously improving the quality of our CR indicators. This manual sets our binding definitions, assessment limits and processes for
collecting data.

At national level, we have been submitting a Declaration of Compliance with the German Sustainability Code since 2011. This declaration makes our activities transparent to external stakeholders year on
year.
> The Sustainability Code
Transparency through dialogue
Openness, dialogue and participation are central community expectations for large companies. We strive to meet this challenge. In
cooperation with the operating companies, we track all important
developments on the issue of sustainability and we evaluate them
for their relevance to the RWE Group. The dialogue with our stakeholders provides some essential indications. Large sections of society continue to be critical of our company when it comes to a number of issues. Our aim is therefore to expand dialogue and achieve a
high level of acceptance for our actions in the public domain by 2020
(p. 28). This is in harmony with the guiding principle of RWE as the
empowering and credible partner for restructuring the European
energy system.

Compliance and Risk Management



Content

COMPLIANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT
Acting in accordance with the law and rules and procedures is an
integral part of our corporate culture at RWE. Any breaches mean
that the company can suffer major and serious reputational damage.
RWE therefore bases all its activities and business decisions on established rules for compliance and does not tolerate any corruption or
other breaches of compliance regulations. Compliance requirements
are factored in when taking all decisions on entering into business
relations with suppliers or subcontractors (p. 63).
The main focus of our internal compliance management is to raise
the level of awareness among our employees and our governance
bodies in order to prevent the possibility of any breaches. A groupwide reference standard sets out a guidance framework for all our
employees. Our Code of Conduct defines binding conditions for compliance with national and international laws and regulations, as well
as rules for fair dealings with market participants and competitors.
The Code of Conduct provides the platform for reference standards
applicable throughout the Group, for example guidelines which provide additional concrete details relating to regulations. The prevention of corruption is particularly important here. Compliance with the
guidelines is supported by organisational regulations, e.g. the double-checking principle, separation of functions, authorisation concept
and rules for approval.

GRI G4-DMA; G4-14; G4-56; G4-SO4

Compliance organisation
The Centre of Expertise Legal & Compliance based at RWE Group
Business Services GmbH is responsible for directing our Compliance
Management. The Group Centre continues to have overall responsibility for governance. Compliance Officers in all the operating companies are responsible for uniform implementation of group-wide
principles. An independent, external ombudsman is also available to
receive information about any breaches of the Code of Conduct from
employees and from external third parties. Reports can be submitted
in the relevant national languages and must remain anonymous if
requested by the whistleblower.
The Chief Compliance Officer submits regular reports to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee of RWE AG. Internal media
within the Group inform our employees about behaviour that conforms with compliance guidelines and also highlight potential risks if
compliance is breached. Members of our workforce are also able to
take part in a wide range of training sessions through a web-based
training programme and at presentation events. Participation is
obligatory and calibrated according to the risk of corruption associated with the relevant activity. The Executive Board too is integrated
in this training concept. In 2014, we delivered training sessions to
some 4,200 employees at presentation events in Germany and
around 1,000 employees in the other regions where RWE is operating.

Compliance and Risk Management

Compliance monitoring
We are able to track all compliance-sensitive procedures using our
group-wide database. The use of this compliance IT tool is mandatory. This is how we are able to guarantee maximum transparency
within the company. We also offer comprehensive assistance in processing the defined transaction.
We use a two-stage process to identify and assess compliance risks
which arise for the RWE Group in the area of corruption. After we
had established the risk profiles for the Group companies reporting
directly to RWE AG in 2012, we moved onto a second stage in 2013
which focused on developing detailed corruption risk scenarios. In
2015, we want to include more companies in the detailed analysis.
The Group Audit Department regularly carries out preventive compliance audits in the Group companies. This enables us to review the
implementation and effectiveness of our Compliance Management
across the Group. We always follow up any information relating to
potential breaches of compliance and we take any necessary measures as required. The reviews carried out by the Group Audit Department for the year 2014 revealed no material or systematic breaches
of our compliance guidelines. Any individual shortcomings in processes or in the documentation were remedied.
The Executive Board of RWE AG commissioned audit firm KPMG to
carry out the audit of the Compliance Management System (CMS) in
order to combat any corruption and to ensure independent scrutiny
of the compliance system. This was carried out in accordance with
the IDW Audit Standard 980 drawn up by the German Institute of
Auditors (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer). The first stage involving the
audit of the conceptual approach and the appropriateness of the

GRI G4-DMA; G4-SO3



Content

CMS was completed in 2012. This process was continued in 2013
with an audit of effectiveness and it was successfully concluded by
the start of 2014.
Corporate security
As an operator of a critical infrastructure, RWE is aware of its important contribution to providing a secure energy supply. Security
Management is therefore a central management function at RWE.
The Group Security Department reports directly to the RWE Group
Executive Board. We use predictive risk management to derive measures which secure a commercially appropriate level of protection – for
tangible and intangible company assets, as well as for personnel and
sensitive business processes. This also applies to information security
which is a further constituent element of security management.
In order to prevent security hazards, RWE is a member of various
associations of companies and plays an active role in other security
associations and initiatives. These commitments include the “Security Partnership against Metal Theft” (SIPAM). RWE was one of two
German energy companies taking part in the exercise “Cyber Europe
2014” run by the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA). As a member of the association “Cyber Security
Council German”, we also support the development of a German
Cyber Security Act. We guarantee the security of our employees while
on business trips through our strategic travel management. We
prevent criminal actions with corresponding preventive measures.
When investigating criminal acts, we respond appropriately and work
together with the responsible security services. If there are any suspicions of criminal actions, the Compliance and Group Security departments cooperate closely together.

We have made comprehensive organisational preparations to overcome crises and emergency situations. Crisis teams have therefore
been appointed at different levels and they are continuously accessible. Manuals, alarm lists or tools, and the necessary technical equipment are available for crisis management. We carry our regular emergency training courses and exercises. Emergency plans are also
drawn up at the operational level to take account of different scenarios. Restarting critical business processes after major interruptions is
controlled by “Business Continuity Management”.

Stakeholder Dialogue



Content

STAKEHOLDER DIALOGUE
Our stakeholders include all persons and organisations with which
we maintain relations and engage in dialogue. We also regard as
stakeholders individuals and entities who seek communication with
us or who are interested in our company. The expectations placed on
RWE are often very different from region to region.
In order to identify the different aspirations and take account of
them in our corporate policy, we are in continuous communication
with our stakeholders. Our company regularly engages in communication based on differing formats with customers, academics, politicians, representatives of environmental organisations, neighbours of
our locations and other citizens. We also seek contact with the players who are involved in issues relating to the energy industry and the
entrepreneurial actions of RWE and their effects on the community at
large.
Stakeholder Council established
In 2014, we set up the RWE “Stakeholder Council” with the aim of
establishing an in-depth dialogue. This group-wide body advises the
Executive Board on sustainability issues and is made up of eight
independent experts representing perspectives from the world of
research and civil society. The experts on the panel come from
­Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Poland, and
this means that they bring different regional perspectives to the
discussion table. Following the constituent meeting held at the end
of 2014, the Stakeholder Council will meet twice a year in the future
and discuss the current challenges for the company.

GRI G4-DMA; G4-24; G4-25; G4-26; G4-27; G4-SO1

Constructive exchange of ideas at different levels
The communication with our stakeholders gives us valuable ideas
for the orientation of our corporate activities. There is frequently
common ground between their aspirations and our objectives. This
means that engagement of this nature can result in different forms
of cooperation over the long term (p. 30). At the same time, this
dialogue provides us with the opportunity to give them better
­communication on our company decisions and explain the under­lying
motivation.
The dialogue takes place in the framework of diverse formats and at
different levels. Accordingly, we engage in discussions at local level
with neighbouring residents and citizens’ initiatives, for example
about construction measures and approval proceedings. Our local
residents frequently follow our projects and activities with a great
deal of interest, perhaps because they may be looking for positive
effects to give upside impact on the local economy. Alternatively,
they may be anxious about negative effects on their own lives and
the surrounding environment. We meet these expectations with an
honest exchange of views and generate an atmosphere of lively
openness for constructive proposals. At national level, we engage in
discussions with our stakeholders about wide-ranging issues, such as
sustainability in international supply relationships, a responsible
approach to customers, the future of the energy market and our
contribution to the energy transition and climate protection.

Stakeholder Dialogue

Stakeholder dialogue by regions
Our stakeholders and their perspectives are nuanced in tune with the
diversity of the regions where we have operations. We have a range
of different dialogue formats to conduct the dialogue and exchange
of ideas with the stakeholder groups at our locations.
Germany
The targets, consequences and challenges of the energy transition
continue to be the most important topics within the framework of
communication with our stakeholders in Germany. A highly relevant
issue is how RWE can make use of new business models and products to integrate the burgeoning proportion of renewable energies in
the existing system. We are continually holding events on this subject and comparable issues, for example the RWE Talk held several
times a year in Berlin. Managing directors and members of the Executive Board at RWE also participated in four events in 2014 and
swapped information and ideas about the latest high-level discussions with politicians, representatives of other companies, journalists
and representatives of unions and various special-interest groups.
The most important topics include the break-up of the energy sector
and the associated changes entailed for companies, the design of
the electricity market in the future, as well as innovations in electricity generation and storage, and products for retail customers.
The RWE Energy Round Table (Energiestammtisch) is another important format operating at national level. This format gives interested
citizens the opportunity to find out about the latest topics in the
energy industry and integrate their proposals or ideas into specific
projects within the framework of the energy transition. In 2014, one
Energy Round Table took place in Essen.

The Customer Council met twice during the course of 2014. The
members mainly engaged in debate about future issues, such as
decentralised energy supply, energy efficiency, as well as the digitisation of the energy industry.
The Neighbourhood Forum (Nachbarschaftsforum) in Niederaußen,
which RWE set up in the Rhineland lignite mining area, continued on
a successful trajectory. This forum offers neighbours, associations
and other stakeholders the opportunity to engage in discussion with
RWE about issues related to electricity generation and power stations. During the year under review, the issues under discussion
focused on approval procedures and involvement of public relations
in opencast mines in the Rhineland lignite mining area. In addition,
conferences and forums for dialogue were also held on specialist topics such as the water industry, fine particulates, recultivation and
impairment from mining activities.
> Energy Round Table
United Kingdom
In 2014, we also engaged in dialogue with various stakeholders,
including representatives of environmental associations and consumer protection organisations. The focus of these discussions
related to issues from the area for action Market/Customer, including
the increase in customer satisfaction, combating fuel poverty and
the inclusion of customers in brand management. Other key issues
were climate protection, the future role for the use of coal in the
United Kingdom and the development of offshore wind technology.
Netherlands
In 2014, the Netherlands saw communication with our stakeholders
focusing on issues relating to the supply chain for coal and biomass.
There was an exchange of views including representatives from gov-

ernment and civil society. The conversations on the coal supply chain
were primarily about local mining conditions. They led to the voluntary self-commitment by the participating companies to increase
transparency for the origin of the coal (p. 66). As a result of the
debate on the procurement of biomass, new national sustainability
criteria were introduced which focused on climate protection as a
particularly important aspect.
Stakeholder dialogues at local level were shaped by questions relating to acceptance of new wind turbines for generating energy and
discussions centred on progress with the new RWE hard-coal power
station in Eemshaven and the associated nature conservation projects.
Central and Eastern Europe
We exchanged views with a variety of stakeholders in Hungary,
including customers, union representatives, ministries and other
political decision-makers, employees and community representatives.
As a result of our cooperation with local universities, we are engaged
in a constructive dialogue with students on topics relating to the
energy industry and we are highlighting career perspectives for them
in the sector. In 2014, we also continued the event series “Meet the
Customer” by holding four events. At these meetings, we discuss
current issues in the energy market with customers. In the Czech
Republic, the main focus was on the security of gas supply, economic
conditions in the energy industry and the challenges of more environmentally friendly mobility.

Cooperation as a result of stakeholder dialogue
We also work closely together with the affected stakeholders in order
to develop appropriate standards and assessment criteria, for example in the context of the Bettercoal Initiative and the Sustainable
­Biomass Partnership (p. 65 f.).
At the end of 2013, we entered into a cooperation with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) aimed at protecting
biological diversity. The objective of the cooperation is to join
together and exert our influence more intensively on environmental
systems and manage them better. We have joined forces to launch a
common project for this in which we plan to investigate the effects
of recultivation carried out at lignite opencast sites in the Rhineland
lignite mining area. We are also developing a group-wide biodiversity
guideline which will define our principles and objectives on this issue
(p. 48).

Content

MATERIALITY ANALYSIS
In 2014, we reconciled our Materiality Analysis for the first time with
the requirements defined by the current reporting standard of the
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), GRI G4. Dialogue with our stakeholders forms an important foundation for the annual update of our
Materiality Analysis. This dialogue allowed us to record the opinions
and expectations of the community in relation RWE (p. 28).
Initially, we use an established process to evaluate the relative importance of the areas for action from the perspective of our stakeholders and reconcile these results with our assessment of the
opportunities available to the RWE Group for exerting an influence.
We obtained the internal assessments in a group-wide consultation
process in which the board members of the Group companies responsible for CR were included for purposes of validation. The findings
derived from this dialogue enable us to balance the relevance of sustainability issues and review the alignment of our CR Strategy. We
evaluate the expectations of stakeholders on the basis of conversation records or public statements, as well as in communication with
the specialist departments and the RWE companies in different countries. The stakeholder perspectives also provide us with impressions
gained about the impact of our company’s activities on the community. At the same time, we also include additional factors such as
exposure of the company due to the sector, the profile and the strategic alignment.

GRI G4-18; G4-19; G4-20; G4-21; G4-25; G4-26

The assessment forms the second pillar for the evaluation of sustainability issues. It is carried out on the basis of a comprehensive survey
within the RWE Group. The departmental managers and board members from the various Group companies are included in the assessment alongside experts on a range of issues. We then select the GRI
aspects relevant for RWE and allocate them to our CR areas for action
(p. 4 ff.).
Presentation of the key issues
When the report changed over to GRI G4, we accordingly also
adjusted the representation of our Materiality Analysis. As in earlier
reports, the vertical axis measures the expectations of stakeholders.
For the first time, the horizontal axis plots the impact of the RWE
Group on the community. This mapping of the areas for action indicates that our most relevant areas for action are characterised by the
high expectations of our stakeholders in combination with the high
level of opportunities available to RWE to exert influence.
The matrix provided below sets out the assessed importance of our
areas for action which were each evaluated with the categories
“moderate”, “high” and “very high” on a relative scale. They reflect
the Group perspective, although the assessments of the issues may
vary in the regions and the individual divisions of the Group. We
attribute above-average importance for the sustainable alignment of

economic and community developments are continuously presenting
new challenges and focuses within the individual areas. We analyse
these and adapt our areas for action as appropriate.
Environment dimension
The Environment dimension comprises the areas for action Climate
Change, Energy Efficiency and Biodiversity/Environmental Protection.
In 2014, restructuring of the energy system was discussed intensively throughout Europe and particularly in Germany. This also
exerts an impact on the individual relevance of the associated areas
for action of RWE. Climate Protection continues to remain the most
important issue and governments throughout Europe are placing this
at the top of the political agenda. As Europe’s biggest single emitter
of CO2, RWE is confronted by major challenges in this area to make
energy generation more climate friendly (p. 38). The topic of energy
efficiency impacts on energy-saving packages in our own company
and in the businesses of our customers (p. 43). We have allocated
the latter to the area for action Market/Customer, since measures for
energy savings at the end user are closely linked with new business
models developing in the context of the energy transition. The high
level of importance of the new lines of business also flows into the
evaluation of the corresponding area for action.
RWE and our stakeholders continue to perceive relevant tasks in the
area for action Biodiversity/Environmental Protection. The promotion
of biodiversity is of central importance particularly in the management of opencast mining facilities and we are continually making
efforts to bring about improvements (p. 46). This issue also presents
us with challenges relating to the expansion of renewable energies,
for example through offshore wind farms. We want to set up and
operate these plants safely and under profitable conditions, while at

the same time avoiding negative impacts on ecosystems. Sustainable
solutions in this area provide fundamental conditions for successful
restructuring of the European energy system. That’s why we already
attributed major importance to the issue last year even though its
relevance had slightly declined as far as our stakeholders were concerned.
Social dimension
The affordable supply of energy continues to be an important issue
in public debate. This is mainly about the additional burdens brought
about by public subsidies for renewable energies. From a social perspective, these should be distributed in a maximally fair and equitable way. It is equally important that we offer packages to our customers which are designed to save energy and provide them with advice
about optimum use of their facilities in the areas of renewable energies and storage technologies. Our stakeholders attribute the greatest importance to the area for action Market/Customer – alongside
Climate Protection and Supply Chain – for the sustainable development of RWE, particularly since they perceive a success factor here
that will help the energy transition to succeed. Given that we have
23 million customers, we believe that we have major opportunities
for impact in this area. We therefore want to make use of the access
to our customers, in order to develop and disseminate smart products for saving energy and for integration of renewable energies
(p. 53).
The increasing cost pressure associated with the energy transition
continues to exert an impact on our human resource policy and presents us with major challenges in the area for action Employees
(p. 59). We are compelled to adapt our human resource structure to
the difficult framework conditions of the energy industry as it under-

goes change. This means that our employees and our management
are confronted with major challenges. However, the opportunities for
exerting influence in this area are only available within the company.
Community engagement continues to form the platform for acceptance of the company by society as a whole. Nevertheless, the expectations of our stakeholders have diminished marginally in relation to
this area for action. We regard our own influence and our strategic
opportunities as limited in this sphere (p. 49).
Governance dimension
The Governance dimension comprises the areas for action Occupational Safety/Healthcare Management, Security of Supply, Supply
Chain and Innovation.
Our stakeholders set the bar very high and we indeed meet their
aspirations on an international sector comparison in the area for
action Occupational Safety/Healthcare Management. Here we have
significant opportunities for exerting influence with our own employees and suppliers. However the impacts on workplace safety in the
community at large are limited (p. 68).

GRI G4-18; G4-19; G4-20; G4-21

Content

In 2014, the area for action Security of Supply continued to be a top
priority for our stakeholders in Germany. The public discussion surrounding this issue relates on the one hand to the robustness of
electricity grids. The second issue involves adequate availability of
power plant output to cover the demand at all times. As an energy
supplier, we also have a great deal of influence on both factors
(p. 72).
A sustainable structure for the supply chain continues to be important. Our stakeholders attribute major responsibility to us in this area
and particularly in the supply chain for hard coal. We are working
intensively together with other European suppliers within the Bettercoal sector initiative in order to achieve an impact in this area (p. 63).
We continue to regard innovation as a key element and catalyst in
order to provide the energy industry with a future-centric structure,
meet customer wishes and expectations and drive forward the
expansion of renewable energy sources (p. 76). The expectations of
our stakeholders in regard to the power of innovation increased
slightly by comparison with the previous year.

CLIMATE PROTECTION
An important target of European energy policy and the individual national
energy policies is to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions. Our aim
is to tackle this issue by further expanding renewable energies and to contribute to replacing older power plants generating high levels of emissions with
new and highly efficient plants. The deployment of conventional power
plants in this scenario at the community level will continue to be absolutely
essential in order to guarantee the security of supply and to keep energy
costs affordable for consumers.

Overview of our Ten Areas for Action and our CR Objectives | Climate Protection

Governments and society as a whole expect major energy utilities
like RWE to make their contribution to climate protection and restructuring the European energy economy. We have therefore modernised
large parts of our power plant portfolio. This new-build programme
for power plants is now close to completion. At the same time, we
are also continuing to expand renewable energies.
Challenge
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),
the advancing progress of climate change will exert a tangible
impact on people and the environment. It will also entail high macroeconomic costs throughout the world. The European Union therefore
intends to significantly reduce its emission of greenhouse gases. In
order to achieve climate targets for 2030, the EU wants to reduce the
emission of CO2 by 40 % compared with the baseline year of 1990,
the proportion of renewable energies needs to be increased to at

least 27 % and the energy efficiency ought to go up by 27 %. As a
major energy utility and Europe’s biggest single emitter of CO2, RWE
is in a position to make a significant contribution and support these
targets.
Climate protection also plays an important role in the debate going
on in the public domain. Our stakeholders, including environmental
organisations, customers and government politicians, expect us to
develop ambitious targets and a consistent approach directed
towards reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time,
we are expected to guarantee security of supply.
Motivation and targets
Climate protection is a top priority for us. We have therefore defined
ambitious targets to inform our action. By 2020, we want to reduce
our specific CO2 emissions from the current level of 0.745 metric tons
(mt) for each megawatt hour (MWh) generated to 0.62 mt/MWh. By
reducing the CO2 intensity of our power plant portfolio, we can also
bring down the financial risks arising from high CO2 prices. During
the year under review, we succeeded in reducing our specific CO2
emissions by around 1 % to 0.745 mt/MWh. In absolute terms, we
reduced our CO2 emissions by around 5 % from 163.9 to 155.2 million mt.
Monitoring and performance measurement
We use the CO2 emissions for each megawatt hour of electricity generated as the KPI and indicator for measuring our target attainment.
Advances and successes in target attainment form some of the indicators used to assess the long-term variable compensation for the
Executive Board of RWE AG.

Overview of our Ten Areas for Action and our CR Objectives | Climate Protection

The financial risks arising within the framework of emission trading
posed by our CO2 emissions are reflected in our risk management.
We reduce these risks by concluding appropriate hedging transactions. To this end, at the same time as we sell a specific amount of
electricity in the futures market we procure the necessary fuel and
buy the emission certificates required.
Renewal of our power plants
We will soon complete our projects currently under construction for
modernising our power plant portfolio. This will mean that since
2006 we have replaced around 25 % of our capacities with advanced,
highly efficient plants. We have spent a total of more than € 12 billion in the biggest programme of capital expenditure throughout the
history of RWE. Apart from building new power stations, we have
also modernised existing power plants. This has enabled us to
improve efficiency in electricity generation, reduce the consumption
of resources for each unit of energy generated and therefore also
bring down the emission of greenhouse gases.
When we brought the lignite twin-unit optimised power units BoA
2&3 at the Neurath site on stream, we shut down 16 older and less
efficient units with an output of 150 megawatts (MW) each by the
end of 2012. By comparison with comparable old power plants, the
BoA 2&3 units allow us to cut down CO2 emissions by 6 million mt
each year. One of the most advanced hard-coal power stations in the
world with a total power output of 1,528 MW will also make a contribution to reducing CO2 emissions. We are cooperating with localauthority partners to construct this plant at the Hamm site. In August
2014, we brought unit E of the power plant on stream.

GRI G4-EC2; EU10



Content

We are also constructing a hard-coal power station with a comparable level of efficiency at the Eemshaven site in the Netherlands. The
plant will have a capacity of 1,554 MW and will also be partly fuelled
with biomass, if the technical and economic conditions permit this.
The beginning of commercial operation is planned for May 2015.
Capital expenditure on renewable energies
The expansion of electricity generation from renewable energies will
continue to remain a cornerstone of our strategy in future. However,
limited financial resources mean that we have scaled back the pace
of growth. Currently we have capacities amounting to 3,677 MW in
operation and another 4,100 MW of renewable energies are under
construction or at the planning stage. Between 2015 and 2017, RWE
will invest around € 1 billion in the expansion of renewable energies.
In future, we will have to implement the major projects increasingly
with partners and shift our focus to the development, operation and
marketing of onshore and offshore wind farms. We are disposing of
shares in wind-power projects (e.g. Nordsee One, Nordsee 2 and 3)
and wind farms (e.g. Gwynt y Môr). This will enable us to invest in
major projects as well during times of scarce resources.
In Germany, RWE started up a number of wind farms including the
“Düshorn Heath” wind farm in Walsrode, Lower Saxony during 2014.
This wind farm has an installed output of 26 MW and can supply
around 16,000 households with electricity and thereby avoid the
emission of some 40,000 mt of CO2 each year. The wind farm is part
of the Green GECCO Initiative which involves RWE working together
with 29 municipal utilities to drive forward the expansion of renewable energies. Our offshore wind farm “Nordsee Ost” is under construction. It is scheduled to come on stream at the latest from mid-

|

2015 and with an output of 295 MW should supply 300,000 households with electricity and consequently avoid the emission of
750,000 mt of CO2 each year.
In September 2014, RWE started up operation of the “Goole Fields
1” onshore wind farm in the United Kingdom. This wind farm has
16 turbines, a total generating capacity of 32.8 MW and covers the
electricity requirement of around 18,200 households. We are the biggest private investor involved in construction of the Gwynt y Môr
wind farm located off the Welsh coast. This facility will become the
second biggest offshore wind farm in the world with a capacity of
576 MW and is scheduled to come fully on stream at the latest by
mid-2015.



We are also expanding our capacities for renewable energies in the
Netherlands. In 2014, a start was made on construction of the “Zuidwester” wind farm with a planned total output of 90 MW. The startup of the onshore wind farm is planned for 2017. As early as July
2013, the expansion of “Thornton Bank” from an initial 30 MW was
completed. An output of 325 MW makes this the biggest offshore
wind farm in the Belgian section of the North Sea. RWE is the biggest
private investor in the wind farm with a shareholding of 26.7 %.
The biomass-fired heating station located in Markinch, Scotland, is
also a new addition to our generating portfolio. It has a rated output
of 46 MW of electricity and started up production in March 2014.

Hydropower is also an important component of the portfolio at RWE.
In 2014, we brought on stream the “Maldie” pumped-storage power
plant in Scotland. It has an output of 4 MW and supplies around
3,000 households with green electricity. The plant was partly constructed underground so that it blends in naturally with the environment. In 2014, we successfully completed a partial modernisation of
our pumped-storage power plant at Dogarrog in Wales, which has

Conflict of objectives in climate protection
In the course of our Power Plant New-build Programme, we
have invested in advanced and efficient coal-fired power stations as well as making a major capex commitment to gasfired power stations – we are now confronted with a dilemma.
Due to the low price of electricity, it is currently virtually
impossible to operate gas-fired power stations with any commercial viability. Some plants have already been shut down
after very few operating hours and others are under threat of
closure. On the other hand, our stakeholders support the
availability of gas-fired power stations because they are
regarded as flexible and they are able to mitigate the fluctuating supply of electricity from renewable energies. Gas-fired
power stations also have low specific CO2 emissions and they
are therefore classified as an important technology for
empowering the energy transition.

been in existence for more than 100 years. Another run-of-river
power plant with an output of 3 MW on the Abhainn Chia-aig River in
the Scottish highlands is currently under construction.
In Hungary, we have constructed a photovoltaic plant with an output
of 15 MW above the slag deposit at the Mátra power station. This
plant is the first major demonstration plant for photovoltaic technology to be built in Hungary. It therefore represents a milestone for the
expansion of renewable energies in this country.

reduce fuel costs and cut our CO2 emissions for each unit of energy
generated, enabling us to bring down expenditure on CO2 certificates. We have defined our goal as increasing the average energy
use of our power plant portfolio to at least 40.1 % by 2017.
At the same time, we are making efforts to reduce the amount of
energy expended on our vehicle fleet, in our real estate portfolio and
for other areas of the company, such as opencast lignite mines and
other production plants. The potential opportunities for savings
available to our customers are also an important issue for us. So that
they can make the most of these options, we are offering consumers
comprehensive energy service packages and consultation for
improvement of their energy efficiency (p. 53).
Monitoring and performance measurement
The average energy use of our power plants is the key performance
indicator for calculating our energy efficiency. It shows how much primary energy we use per kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity or amount
of heat.

Advances in energy efficiency
We have mainly achieved a higher level of efficiency in our power
plant portfolio by replacing old power plants with new ones which
are in compliance with the most advanced technology available. This
means, for example, that the efficiency of new lignite-fired power
stations is 30 % more than the older power plants. By the end of
2012, we had taken out of the grid 16 lignite-fired power-plant units
with an output of 150 MW with lower efficiency. Over recent years,
we have also modernised our six 600 MW units.

Overview of our Ten Areas for Action and our CR Objectives | Energy Efficiency

In 2014, the first unit of a new hard-coal twin unit (total output:
1,528 MW) came on stream at the Westphalia power station with a
generating output of 764 MW. At the same site, we also shut down
less efficient power plants. In 2014, we succeeded in achieving an
efficiency of energy use of 40.4 % (2013: 40.5 %)
If the savings made in our real estate portfolio and vehicle fleet are
set against the total footprint of our Group, they only make up a
small proportion. Nevertheless, these efforts highlight the credibility
of our action and also contribute to raising the awareness of our
employees for environmental issues.
A continuous process of modernisation enabled us to increase
energy efficiency in our real estate portfolio during the course of
2014 – by a total of 29 % for the refurbished buildings. Measures
such as upgrading of roofs and modernising heating systems contrib-

uted to this. During the year under review, we also replaced 607
older vehicles in our fleet with 546 new vehicles. On average, the
new vehicles will generate 14 % fewer CO2 emissions per kilometre.
Furthermore, we have included electric cars in our fleet and these
vehicles are available to all employees in Essen, for example to make
the journey to Dortmund.
Certified energy management system
RWE has established an Energy Management System in conformity
with the ISO 50001 standard. This is intended to further enhance the
efficiency of our German production plants. The system was initially
set up in 2013 and certified in the sectors lignite-fired power stations, opencast mines and hard coal/gas. In 2014, we also expanded
the external certification process for the sectors nuclear energy,
hydropower and refinement. This means that our large German and
British power plants are certified in conformity with ISO 50001.

Overview of our Ten Areas for Action and our CR Objectives | Biodiversity/Environmental Protection

Challenge
We mainly use natural resources as fuels for the generation of electricity and heat. The operation of opencast mines, power plants and
distribution grids partly results in inevitable impacts on natural ecosystems. Furthermore, pollutants are also released by electricity and
heat production at our power plants which can lead to negative
impacts on humans and the natural environment.
Motivation and targets
We aim to avoid or at least minimise our impacts on ecosystems.
Where this is not possible we deploy appropriate nature conservation
measures to mitigate any unavoidable or irreversible negative consequences. This means that we create ecosystems with at least the
same functional capability as before the intervention.
We have to ensure that we retain our operating licences if we are to
secure the future of our business. We have defined our aspiration as
a commitment to absolute compliance with all licensing regulations
in the construction and operation of our plants and facilities, and
group-wide coverage of RWE’s activities by our environmental management system. Furthermore, we are also committed to playing a
proactive role in eliminating or reducing environmental impacts. At
the same time, we are continuously in dialogue with our stakeholders, in order to obtain acceptance for our actions (p. 28).
Monitoring and performance measurement
We analyse and evaluate environmental issues continuously in order
to assess their relevance for the RWE Group and we engage with the
implementation of measures for achieving this objective that extend
beyond the statutory requirements for the protection and reinstatement of healthy, fully functional ecosystems. A key performance indicator in the area of environmental protection is compliance with the

GRI G4-DMA; G4-EN12; G4-EN27



Content

licensing regulations for the installation and operation of our plants
and facilities. We regularly check compliance of such systems. The
percentage coverage by our environmental management system is a
further key performance indicator.
Group-wide environmental management system
All RWE companies have an obligation under our Group guidelines to
set up a dedicated environmental management system in conformity
with the ISO 14001 international standard. Compliance with this
standard is ensured by annual audits. In 2014, the focuses of investigation were on checks to establish the operational organisation of
responsibilities relating to environmental protection in accordance
with statutory regulations. During the course of 2014, group-wide
expenditure on environmental protection amounted to € 2.4 billion.
During the year under review, there were no major incidents at the
plants of the RWE Group that resulted in significant impacts relevant
to the environment. Compliance with all licensing regulations was
consistently ensured. In 2014, 14 notifiable events at notification
level 0 were registered for our nuclear power stations. There were
16 notifiable events in 2013. Our fossil-fired power stations were
operated in 2014 without any major disturbances.
Pollutant emissions and waste
The modernisation of our power plant portfolio and technical separation processes help us to reduce the emission of pollutants released
during the production of electricity and heat at our power plants.
This approach has enabled us to reduce the specific emissions of the
airborne pollutants NOX and SO2 by more than 10 % to 0.60 g/kWh
and 0.33 g/kWh respectively.

48

Our Responsibility. Report 2014

Overview of our Ten Areas for Action and our CR Objectives | Biodiversity/Environmental Protection

Our waste management is based on the principle of “avoid, recovery,
disposal”. We are therefore continually reducing the amount of waste
which cannot be recycled for further downstream application. All
residual waste is disposed of in compliance with statutory regulations. We dispose of radioactive waste under the supervision of the
responsible government authorities.
Protecting ecosystems and maintaining biodiversity
When we supply our thermal power plants with cooling water, we
ensure that our use of water exerts minimum impact on natural
resources. This includes the protection of aquatic habitats and other
ecosystems against adverse effects. We prevent environmental
impacts by recycling water, more intensive use of pumped water
from opencast mines and using collected rainwater, as well as recovering and re-using process water from operations. Internal wastewater treatment and continuous monitoring of the process ensures that
potential contamination is eliminated. We avoid negative impacts on
human health and on nature by providing verifiable compliance with
the statutory threshold values.

If natural habitats are destroyed by our activities, we protect the
diversity of species by strategic measures and support the reinstatement of substitute habitats or the repopulation of existing habitats.
Examples of these measures include fish ladders at run-of-river power
stations, the use of technical measures to protect marine species at
offshore wind farms and measures to protect birds at overhead transmission lines. In 2014, RWE for example, worked together with state
of North Rhine-Westphalia to establish a pilot facility for fish conservation at the Unkelmühle hydropower plant. The project allows
migrating fish to get round the turbines of the power plant when
migrating upstream and returning downstream without being
injured. Ecological and technical monitoring was carried out over a
period of five years and it investigated the effectiveness of the measures and their compatibility with economic generation of renewable
energy.
In 2013, we launched a cooperation with the International Union for
Conservation of Nature (IUCN). In 2014 independent experts carried
out a pilot project to investigate the impact of our measures for restoration of opencast mining areas on biodiversity in the Rhineland
lignite area and to identify potential improvements. In 2015, we are
also developing a Biodiversity Guideline for the Group. This guideline
establishes how RWE intends to protect and promote biodiversity
stewardship as the company carries out its business activities.

Motivation and targets
The challenges of the energy transition can only be solved at the
level of society as a whole. We want to be a credible partner and
enhance trust in our company within our regional and local environment, as well as within society overall. That’s why we promote social
developments through initiatives in social, environmental and cultural spheres, with volunteering engagement by RWE employees and
through financial support. We want to continue improving our appeal
and create a profile that is distinct from our competitors.
Monitoring and performance measurement
We want to use the resources available effectively and in conformity
with our compliance objectives. Our group-wide valid guideline entitled “Donations and Sponsorship” defines the rules for resource allocation. Our “compliance IT tool” is used to record all donations and
sponsorship measures in compliance with this guideline and to track
all processes.
A standardised annual survey is used to measure the results of our
engagement in order to determine the Reputation Index. We apply
the results to check the effectiveness of our measures and to assess
our performance by comparison with our competitors. In 2014, we
were ranked in second place among our peer companies. Our objective is to be in pole position.
Combatting fuel poverty
We help to ameliorate fuel poverty in the countries where we are
operating – particularly where the government and civil society do
not provide enough support. Fuel poverty is defined as households
which have to spend more than 10 % of their net income on energy
needs. There are various differences here between needs and offerings in the individual countries. In the United Kingdom, we support

vulnerable people in the “Health Through Warmth” programme. We
step in and provide assistance if they are suffering from bronchial illnesses of a chronic nature and need help with financing and installation of heating and insulation in their homes, which they would not
otherwise be able to afford. We offer them financial support in providing heat insulation for their homes and advice on energy efficiency. In Hungary, we supply coal briquettes at reduced prices and
provide vulnerable customers with pre-paid electricity meters so that
they have the capability to control their own costs. In the Czech
Republic and Germany, we give customers help in paying their
energy bills. This is achieved by offering instalment payments and
advice on energy.

Overview of our Ten Areas for Action and our CR Objectives | Market/Customer

As an integrated systems provider, we want to support our base of
more than 23 million customers with future-proof products and services. We are developing new business lines to achieve this objective,
such as intelligent storage technologies, and solutions for saving
energy or for the management of photovoltaic systems and wind turbines operated by our customers. At the same time, we are also
expanding the array of advice we offer.
Challenge
Apart from energy utilities, an increasing number of citizens, midsized companies and cooperative ventures, and ordinary citizens are
also generating electricity and feeding it into the public grid. Our
aim is to retain existing customers and acquire new ones in this
dynamic and competitive environment. In addition to fair prices for
electricity, gas and heat, this also demands intelligent solutions for
efficient and sustainable energy management. If we are to offer new
products and services which will benefit the energy world of tomorrow, we need to be able to understand the modified requirements
and needs of our customers even better.
Motivation and targets
Our objective is to be a credible and empowering partner for our customers in the transition taking place in the European energy system.
Our commitment to be a credible partner means that we will supply
retail customers, industry, commercial customers and local authorities with electricity, gas and heat, as well as offering products,
energy advice and energy services which will create benefits for
them and at the same time drive forward the energy transition. Being
an empowering partner means that we will consistently align our
efforts on the changed needs of our customers and position ourselves as a provider of solutions. We want our customers to remain

loyal, to be interested in new products and to recommend our company to other people. By 2017, we want to maintain a score of at
least 75 index points for customer loyalty.
Monitoring and performance measurement
The Customer Loyalty Index provides our method of measuring success in issues relating to customer satisfaction and trust. Since 2009,
we have been determining this rating uniformly for all retail businesses in Germany and we have also been using the rating in a similar form for other countries. This indicator is based on surveys conducted among our residential and commercial customers. Loyalty is
rated low for scores of 70 or less, moderate for scores of 70 to 79
and high for scores above 80. During the year under review, we
achieved a Customer Loyalty Index of 76 in Germany and in the previous year the value was 73. We want to retain at least a score of 75 in
the coming years up until 2017.
International customer loyalty and satisfaction
The loyalty of our customers has undergone the biggest increase in
the Czech Republic and Belgium. The reduction in energy prices was
the key factor for this increase in loyalty. We also succeeded in posting a positive development for the Index in Hungary. At 76 %,
customer loyalty remained relatively high in the Netherlands even
though we experienced a slight reduction compared with 2013. Our
customer switching rates in Poland increased slightly due to stronger
competition. The score for our Customer Loyalty Index has also
improved slightly in the United Kingdom.
Apart from customer loyalty, we also determine customer satisfaction at our regional companies and in other RWE markets. We use telephone interviews to carry out surveys with them and we review all
relevant contacts with our customers. In 2014, the Customer Satis-

faction Index of the RWE Deutschland Group was 77 on a scale of
1 to 100. In the Czech Republic and Hungary, the satisfaction of customers increased essentially owing to the lower energy prices prevailing and improvements in customer service made during the period
under review. This also resulted in a decline in the number of complaints in the Czech Republic. Surveys in the Netherlands show that
customer satisfaction there has remained high and unchanged at
83 % compared with the previous year, while the satisfaction rating
fell back slightly in the United Kingdom. Less than half of our customers in the UK are now satisfied with RWE. We believe that this
reduction is mainly due to the price increases in autumn. The surveys
carried out in Poland also reveal a deterioration in satisfaction values
compared with the previous year. Nevertheless, we achieved a score
of 73.5 there and this indicates that we have achieved a satisfactory
result, similar to the outcome in Belgium.

Comprehensive energy advice
An important objective of the energy transition is to strengthen climate protection but this can only be achieved by making more efficient use of energy. This applies to the production of electricity and
heat (p. 43) and equally to behaviour in relation to the use of energy.
Our engineers and our retail experts are working together to develop
solutions along these lines. They help our customers to identify
potential savings and make the most of them. Initiatives include
energy concepts, provision of advice on reducing electricity use and
building analyses.
Customer-centric information provided on our Internet pages complements our offerings on energy advice. Anybody interested can
find out about issues such as building insulation, promotion measures for energy-based refurbishment and particularly efficient household appliances. In 2014, we received 650,000 visitors to the RWE
energy advice portal > www.energiewelt.de. We have used our network of professional energy advisers to provide 9,800 energy advice
sessions for residential customers in Germany. Our advisers have also
been dealing with hundreds of thousands of questions at local level
in more than 150 energy shops and service outlets across Germany.
In 2014, we logged more than 800,000 customer enquiries.
In 2014, we continued the cooperation with our local-authority partners in, Arnsberg, Dorsten, Ense, Essen, Rheinbach and Wesel (Germany). Over the past two years, more than 85,000 thermal images
were collected by aircraft in these regions. They show the insulation
properties of building roofs and are made available to any residential
homeowners with an interest in energy issues. On the basis of this
information and the initial advice offered by RWE they can take a
decision on whether energy refurbishment makes sense for them and
decide what form it should take.

Transparent energy costs
We offer our commercial customers energy controlling. This allows
them to strategically increase their energy efficiency. The process
involves recording the relevant data relating to the consumption of
electricity, heat energy and water and subsequent evaluation of the
findings. Monthly reports enable us to show the potential savings
and give concrete recommendations for action. One example of
energy controlling is the SmartCompany concept which allows us to
support small and mid-sized companies in adopting an energy-saving
approach to handling energy. This method generates savings of up
to 20 %. Retail consumers can use intelligent electricity meters
known as smart meters to continuously check their energy consumption and reduce the amount of energy they use.

Outstanding service
The concerns and feedback of our customers are a top priority for us. An array
of surveys and awards demonstrates that we are on the right track here.
Apart from the customer satisfaction analysis for retail customers, we carried
out a major customer needs analysis for business and commercial customers in
2014. The knowledge gained has been used in the interests of customers to further develop the product and service portfolio, customer aspirations and marketing activities.

business models to accommodate this scenario. The leasing model
involves us in planning, financing and constructing the cogeneration
plant and then leasing the plant to the customer. Under the classic
contracting model, we build the plant, carry out maintenance, repair
and operation of the plant and also supply electricity and heat.

“ECO Prestige”. This gives them the opportunity to decide for themselves and purchase
a proportion of their electricity from renewable sources. During the year under review,
this approach enabled us to sell 400 GWh of
electricity generated from different types of
renewable energy. ELMŰ is a retail business
operated by RWE East and it has been offering residential and commercial customers in
Hungary electricity generated from renewable energies for a number of years now.

Offerings for electromobility
Our intelligent charging systems enable companies generating electricity themselves to optimise charging of electric vehicles in their
company fleets. At the same time, we continue to support the establishment of the charging infrastructure in Europe. RWE has joined
forces with partners from the energy industry such as municipalityowned utilities to operate more than 2,350 charging points in Germany and more than 3,800 stations in Europe. “RWE Power” is a tariff we offer throughout Germany for electricity to charge electric
vehicles generated entirely from renewable sources. In Hungary, we
are the market leader for electromobility. We cooperate with 43 partners, including industrial companies, players in the energy industry
and research institutes to promote the project e-mobility Green eMotion. Our main target is also to create the enablers for a cross-border
charging infrastructure in Hungary.

Green tariffs
Our subsidiary company eprimo supplies
electricity generated entirely from hydropower. During the year under review, we
sold 3,762 GWh of “Groene Stroom” in the
Netherlands. The number of customers purchasing this product increased by 12,5 %.
“Groene Stroom” is electricity generated
from renewable energies which are made up
of 40 % from biomass, up to 40 % from wind

Supporting customers in the transition of energy systems
As European energy systems change, the needs and requirements
of customers are also in transition. How is RWE positioning itself in
this transformed market environment? Our Editorial Team asked Dr
Arndt Neuhaus, Chief Executive Officer of RWE Deutschland AG,
about these issues and other questions.
An increasing number of customers are themselves becoming energy
generators. What are the implications for you?
Arndt Neuhaus: Local energy generation and the rising number of
generating consumers (prosumers) are key developments in the
energy transition. This situation is yielding both technical challenges
and retail challenges. Firstly, the large number of photovoltaic and
wind power plants have to be integrated technically in the distribution grid. This needs to be carried out in such a way that grid stability
is safeguarded at all times in spite of the fluctuating and bidirectional feed-in through renewable plants. Secondly, we have to align
our lines of business on new markets and retail channels. The trend
towards digitisation throughout the energy industry creates new customer requirements. The upcoming generation thinks in terms of the
categories renewable, efficient and electric. We are meeting these
new customer aspirations with innovative products and services, for
example energy management packages with decentralised energy
generators.

The interview was conducted by
Klaus-Peter Kreß,
RWE Corporate Responsibility



The concept of “smart” is often applied to new products and services. What can RWE offer here in its product range?
Arndt Neuhaus: Once again, there is a technical aspect and a sales
side here. When it comes to grids, we are upgrading our distribution
grids to create modern, intelligent grids, so-called “Smart Grids”, and
we are providing an increasing number of local authorities with powerful broadband grids. We offer residential and corporate customers
a simple, safe and cost-effective facility automation system with RWE
SmartHome. For example, this system allows users to control heating
or light sources with their smart phone while they are on the move.
Dr Neuhaus, you regularly assess the loyalty and the satisfaction of
customers. What is the position on this issue at the moment?
Arndt Neuhaus: We are delighted that our customers acknowledge
our very good service quality and appreciate our reliability and
strong performance. We offer our customers individually tailored supplementary offerings with professional consultation packages and
long-term products (for example a 3-year fixed price).
Do you have any green tariffs in your portfolio?
Arndt Neuhaus: RWE offers all customer groups – from retail to business customers – green electricity products. This enables us to meet
the needs of our customers in the development of new products. We
have concluded an eco-friendly green electricity contract with up to
30 % of all customers through our energy discounter “eprimo”.
Almost every other new customer selects a green electricity contract.

Overview of our Ten Areas for Action and our CR Objectives | Employees

Challenge
The RWE Group is confronted by the biggest challenges in the history of the company. This is also exerting an impact on our human
resource policy. Restructuring operations and organizational realignments are unavoidable in the context of this environment. Last year,
the number of employees in our workforce came down from 64,896
to 59,784 (expressed in full-time jobs or full-time equivalents, FTE).
Such a turnaround entails a redistribution of functions within the
company and also means that some jobs inevitably have to go.
Motivation and targets
We are organising necessary restructuring measures, reallocation of
human resources and a reduction in the overall number of jobs in
conjunction with a social compensation scheme, while taking
account of our ethical responsibilities. The process involves ongoing
conversations with employee representatives in the Group and with
union representatives. In order to remain competitive and attractive,
we want to modify our work culture while maintaining the engagement and motivation of our employees even though the framework
conditions have become tougher.
Monitoring and performance measurement
We have defined the Motivation Index as a benchmark to measure
the engagement and motivation of our employees. This is recorded
in a staff survey carried out across the entire Group. The index is integrated as a performance indicator in the calculation of the variable
compensation paid to the Executive Board of RWE AG. The Demography Index serves as a second indicator in the area for action Employees. This indicator provides a method of assessing the age structure
of the employees in the company during times of demographic
change. The Demography Index was 82.8 points in 2014. As the
value approaches 100, the age structure within the Group becomes

GRI G4-DMA; G4-LA4; G4-LA10

more balanced. During the year under review 2014, the Motivation
Index had a value of 70.7 points. We therefore did not reach our target score of 71.6 points.
Strategic realignment of human resources
RWE developed a new management model as part of a strategic realignment of human resources in 2013. This model incorporates
strong overarching management by the Group and lays down clearly
defined management guidelines. Internal human resource processes
were bundled and centralised transnationally within the RWE Group.
The future personnel organisation in the RWE companies will be
reduced. This will enable us to focus better on our core competencies. We have also developed a new Group HR strategy alongside
this. It supports the future vision of the RWE Group and takes
account of its specific requirements in close integration with the core
business.
Group-wide job market
The newly created group-wide SWITCH Job Platform has enabled us
to further harmonise the existing personnel tools and complement
them with additional services. The platform is an initial step in helping us to improve transparency over all the deployment options
within the Group. This not only includes short-term and long-term
posts but also relates to short-term project assignments. Our employees can use the available information to submit even more targeted
applications on their own initiative. Furthermore, they are able to
take advantage of personal advice and support for their career
change. An internal temporary employment pool serves to cover
short-term requirements in the specialist departments. This enables
employees to gain further skills and experience for new posts and
reduces external costs. By making use of the Job Platform, RWE is following the goal of optimally using different experiences and exper-

tise within the Group. This approach is intended to enable SWITCH to
help specifically in providing the best support for long-term restructuring of personnel within the Group.

managers. This will enable us to reach all employees and encourage
them to play a role in structuring the changes that are necessary
within the company.

Cultural change in the company
Our objective is to counteract the growing business pressure being
exerted on the RWE Group and the changes occurring in the energy
market by bringing about a change in culture at our company. An
array of different programmes has been launched in order to make
this a reality.

Our programme entitled “New Way of Working” (NWOW) has been
designed to establish new mindsets and new ways of working within
the Group. We are defining new standards for our working practices,
promoting the skills of our employees and developing a common
working culture in the three areas of leadership and alignment, universal process management, and operational excellence. We are also
analysing functions, processes and methods of working in different
areas of the Group and initiating any changes required, for example
by improving internal cooperation, implementing a more robust feedback culture and raising management awareness through cultural
sensitisation. We are aiming to use these measures and additional
action to increase the Organisational Health Index (OHI), employee
satisfaction, customer satisfaction and the financial result. The OHI is
used to assess the effectiveness of our management team.

“We are RWE” communicates a common understanding to all our
employees about the structural changes taking place in the RWE
Group. Starting at the level of the Executive Board of RWE AG, the
planned changes will be communicated to our employees by RWE’s

Attractive as an employer
We will only be able to continue mastering the future challenges presented in the energy business by having professional and dedicated
employees and managers. This is why the issues of promoting and
recruiting the next generation of staff and emerging leaders continue to be a top priority at RWE. Our objective is to attract and
recruit talented young people to work at RWE. A number of tools are
deployed to make contact with them including our Online Career Portal and our Applicant Academy where we advise graduates, school
students and people with career experience, and help them make a
start on the career ladder in the world of work or change jobs. Training opportunities are extremely important in this context. We provide around 2,300 young people with a high-quality apprenticeship

training in 30 different training vocations in industrial, technical and
commercial fields. We also offer twin-track degree courses which can
be undertaken by incorporating practical and training modules
within the course structure. We continue to carry out training beyond
our own specific needs and thereby give a large number of young
people an opportunity in the job market.
The initiative “I can do this” (“Ich pack’ das”) supports teenagers and
young adults who have not yet been able to gain an apprenticeship
place although they have successfully completed education at
school. Since the programme was launched, nearly 1,000 participants have benefited from the one-year entry-level foundation qualification. More than 80 % have gone on to obtain an apprenticeship
place.
Diversity and opportunity
We regard diversity as an enrichment – it supports the cultural
change in the RWE Group and improves our routine work every day.
We therefore promote the careers of women, the integration of people with disabilities, intercultural exchange within the Group and getting the work-life balance right between career and family.
In 2011, we also defined the goal of increasing the percentage of
women in senior management positions to 22 % by 2018. At the end
of 2014, the proportion of women in management positions across

GRI G4-DMA; G4-LA12

the Group was 14.3 % (2013: 13.9 %). On account of the new statutory framework of regulations from the first half of 2015, all our
affected German subsidiary companies will also have defined binding
targets for the percentage of women in supervisory boards and management bodies by mid-2015. We have been preparing RWE for this
scenario over a considerable period of time. RWE has a large number
of subsidiary companies and investments. Here we have more than
700 mandates on supervisory boards. During the course of the past
year, we increased by more than 25 % the presence of women
responsible for these positions held by RWE.
Three women are currently members of the 20-strong Supervisory
Board of RWE, of which two are employee representatives. No
woman was represented on the Executive Board of RWE during the
year under review.
The initiative “Inclusive Culture Focus Group” was established to promote diversity among the people in our Group, including those working in the subsidiary companies. Men and women in the Group from
different origins, religion and sexual orientation, people with and
without disabilities discussed which measures can be used to further
reinforce the group-wide integrative corporate culture.

SUPPLY CHAIN
As globalisation of markets continues apace, national borders also lose their
relevance for trade in energy sources. However, internationally binding standards for environmental protection, human rights and occupational safety have
hardly been established. Companies like RWE are therefore being challenged
by their stakeholders to exert influence on their suppliers through their
procurement policy.

Challenge
RWE purchases a large proportion of its fuels in global wholesale
markets. This also applies to many goods and services. Our stakeholders expect us to purchase these products from companies which
observe compliance with human rights, offer workers reasonable
working conditions and operate effective environmental protection.
Motivation and targets
We want to go beyond the statutory requirements and work together
with our suppliers to comply with and promote international environmental and social standards for procurement. We therefore take
account of information about how our suppliers ensure compliance
with sustainability requirements in our purchasing decision. These
requirements are defined on the basis of the ten principles of the UN
Global Compact, our Code of Conduct and other detailed guidelines.

We have defined our target as ensuring that our suppliers understand and take account of the relevant international environmental
and social standards, and other detailed requirements as necessary.
Monitoring and performance measurement
We use the proportion of the purchase volume subject to the requirements of our Code of Conduct as a constituent element of the contractual relationship in the form of the KPI and indicator for target
attainment in the area for action of Supply Chain. This should apply
to at least 98 % of our purchasing volume. The degree of coverage
was 99.6 % in the year under review.
Sourcing energy commodities and trading
The procurement of hard coal, biomass and natural gas, as well as
trading in fuels are key elements of our value added (p. 4). Trading is
mainly carried out through international, virtual wholesale markets.
Raw materials are traded there as standardised products with
defined quality attributes. Trading is carried out along a standardised
process with the involvement of a large number of market players.
The raw materials may change ownership several times in the virtual
market after they have first been offered for sale by the producers
and before we take physical ownership. Generally, it is only possible
for us to identify the immediate upstream owner, but the precise
geographical origin of the raw material is not known. When combustion fuels are procured on a wholesale market, RWE is therefore not
in a direct supplier relationship with the producer. This means it is
virtually impossible to exert any influence on the production conditions.

65

Our Responsibility. Report 2014

Overview of our Ten Areas for Action and our CR Objectives | Supply Chain

Review of trading partners
We review all potential trading partners for energy commodities
before we enter into any business relationships. Alongside financial
aspects, we also take account of the aspects enshrined in our Code
of Conduct and the ten principles of the UN Global Compact. Our
Counterparty Risk Assessment (CPRA) provides helpful assistance in
carrying out this review. We undertake a standardised, multistage
process to check international databases and information systems to
see whether any misconduct is known. Since 2014, we have been
taking account of the information garnered in the Bettercoal initiative. The review of business partners is repeated at least once a year.
If the results indicate potential risks, the analysis is expanded to
encompass a maximum of four checks a year. We discuss any
breaches of our Code of Conduct with the business partner involved
and aim to develop a solution, but we also reserve the right to
exclude such a business partner from concluding any contracts in the
future. The number of our accredited trading partners fluctuates and
is generally between 1,000 and 2,000. The purchasing volume procured through wholesale markets amounted to around € 10 billion in
2014.
Requirements for procurement of hard coal
When Germany ceases to produce any hard coal, the country will be
completely dependent on the import of this fuel after 2018. In 2014,
we imported around 57 % of our hard coal from countries which are
not members of the OECD. We expect the production conditions
there also to comply with international environmental and social
standards. We are extremely assiduous in tracking reports about
resettlements, interventions in the natural environment, working
conditions and standards relating to occupational safety. Our goal is

to ensure sourcing of hard coal in the necessary amounts and to the
required quality while at the same time monitoring environmental
and social standards in our supply chain.
Acting alone as a single company, RWE can only exert a limited influence on the overall situation. In 2012, the Group purchased 13.7 million mt of hard coal and this only amounted to 6.5 % of the total
amount of the coal imported into the EU. Cooperating with other
energy companies is absolutely essential in order to be in a position
to exert more pressure and achieve sustainable production conditions.
Initiative for a sustainable supply chain
In 2012, we joined forces with other large purchasers of hard coal to
launch the Bettercoal initiative. By the end of 2014, eleven of the
biggest European energy companies were already members of Bettercoal.
A Code of Practice for coal mining was developed within the forum of
an international consultation process which took place with involvement of the most important hard-coal supplier countries of Colombia,
Russia, Indonesia and South Africa. The code formulates concrete
requirements for social and environmental conduct by the mine operators and forms the platform for audits at the international production sites. After the first trial runs had been carried out for the generated audit protocols and the self-assessment questionnaires, in 2014
Bettercoal started to invite producers of hard coal from across the
world to participate in the assessments.

66

Our Responsibility. Report 2014

Overview of our Ten Areas for Action and our CR Objectives | Supply Chain

The first inspection of a coal mine by independent auditors was carried out in Colombia in 2014. The results revealed no significant
breaches of the requirements defined in the Bettercoal Code but indicated some weaknesses. An improvement process with clear targets
and deadlines was agreed with the audited producer. Bettercoal will
track progress and review this as necessary by implementing a further independent audit. Bettercoal uses a central database to provide its member companies with the results of the audits and the
self-assessments of the mines. This information is used by RWE in its
Counterparty Risk Assessment.
At the end of 2014, the Dutch energy utilities, including our subsidiary company Essent, and the Dutch government signed a self-commitment declaration for more transparency in the procurement of
hard coal. They regard the Bettercoal initiative as a good way of
bringing about improvements in the production of hard coal across
the world.
> Bettercoal
Requirements for the procurement of biomass
Since we use biomass for electricity and heat generation, this enables us to reduce our CO2 emissions. However, we have to ensure
that production is carried out in conformity with environmental and
socially ethical conditions. Biomass is mainly purchased for Dutch
power plants and we use the Green Gold Label (GGL) for purposes of
certification. The label guarantees compliance with sustainability
aspects along the entire supply chain. In 2014, we procured around
1.2 million mt of biomass for our own use and for use by third parties
with most of it coming in the form of wood pellets. 99.4 % of the fuel
supplied was certified in conformity with the GGL or another equivalent label.

In the context of our membership of the Sustainable Biomass Partnership initiative, we are developing standards and processes for
international wholesale trading in wood biomass. Following an official comment and test phase, the first version of the standard will be
published in 2015.
> Sustainable Biomass Partnership
Sourcing goods, services and plants
The purchase of goods, services and plant components for the operation, maintenance and new-build of our plants is subject to a uniform
Group reference standard. By contrast with fuel procurement, there
are direct business relations with suppliers and service providers. Our
Code of Conduct is included as an addendum to each contract we
sign and it forms a constituent element of the contract. This enables
us to communicate a clearly defined specification of our expectations
for suppliers and service providers.
We use a self-assessment to survey potential suppliers in an initial
appraisal seeking information on the issues of environmental protection and occupational safety, and compliance. During the year under
review, 26 suppliers were reviewed on the issue of environmental
protection and 2,049 on occupational safety. Every month, all suppliers are reviewed for conformity with potential compliance risks. This
review involves reconciliations with the black list maintained by the
World Bank and with sanctions lists drawn up by the EU. If problems
occur during the course of a business relationship, we address the
matter with our suppliers and work together with them to achieve
improvements jointly. Around 12,500 suppliers are registered in our
supplier portfolio, 350 of them are of particular strategic importance.
We are in regular, close contact with these specific suppliers. The
purchase volume for goods, services and for plant components was
€ 7.3 billion in 2014.

Advocating more transparency and sustainability in the supply chain
Hard-coal mining throughout the world shows room for improvement concerning people and the environment. Why do buyers of
coal make a commitment to this objective? Our Editorial Team put
some questions to Marga Edens, responsible at RWE AG for international corporate responsibility and Chair of the Board of Directors
at Bettercoal, and to Dr Martin Christie, Managing Director of
Bettercoal.
In media reports energy utilities are held responsible for infringements of human rights and environmental pollution. What is your
view?
Martin Christie: Bettercoal brings coal buyers and suppliers together;
the risks that buyers see in their supply chain are the same risks that
suppliers have to manage at their operational sites. By working in a
collaborative approach through Bettercoal, members are able to
engage the supply side in a more constructive and efficient way than
working individually. The picture is complicated by the fact that it's a
commodity market; so the origin of the coal is not always known. We
are working to address this with the coal trading community to see
how Bettercoal can extend its impact.

The interview was conducted by
Dr Marita Hilgenstock,
RWE Corporate Responsibility



Marga Edens: Of course, we recognise that ethical, social and environmental performance at some mines should improve. Members are
aware of this and so need to have the objective data that Bettercoal
provides to make informed coal purchasing decisions.

Your members use about 40 % of the volume of hard coal consumed
in Europe. Is Bettercoal already in a position to make an impact?
Martin Christie: Yes, we have a robust ‘Code of Practice’ and assessment toolkit and are engaging coal suppliers in the assessment program. Our first site assessment completed in Colombia is already
bringing change on the ground. And as more and more buyers are
joining forces, we will be able to use that leverage to move things
forward. Bettercoal is open for all industries using hard coal – for
example cement producers and steel manufacturers.
Marga Edens: All this is documented in the Bettercoal database to
create more transparency for members and inform their buying decisions. The willingness of mine operators to accept audits and disclose information in self-assessments is therefore a key factor for the
success of the initiative.
What is the next step at Bettercoal?
Martin Christie: More assessments. Through this process we not only
provide members with data to inform their purchasing decisions but
also challenge suppliers to make improvements. We also need to
raise our profile and become part of the public debate. We still have
a lot to do.
Marga Edens: And in general, the producing countries themselves
need to provide support in order to strengthen the impact. This
means commitment from government and society at large.

Our employees and the employees of our partner companies (subcontractors) often work at workplaces with special requirements for
occupational health and safety. This applies in particular to activities
in the area of opencast mining, power-plant construction sites, transmission lines or wind turbines. As an employer, we take our responsibility very seriously and minimise the risks of accidents and health
hazards.

by international accident analysis teams. On the basis of the results
of these analyses obtained by our specialist experts, we are taking
action together with our subcontractors to adopt suitable measures
to prevent accidents of this nature in the future. We measure the progress in healthcare management on the basis of annual indicators
such as the health ratio or the Work Ability Index (WAI). In 2014, the
health ratio in the RWE Group amounted to 95.4 %.

Anchoring at management level
Our managers bear responsibility for implementation of our standards. We therefore discussed health protection and occupational
safety with the 300 most senior managers of the Group at the Executive Meeting in 2014 and identified opportunities for improvement.
The newly launched project “Health and Safety Culture Development” is a prime example for closer networking of health and occupational safety. Managers and employees join together in implementing preventive measures within this framework. The project
focuses on three aspects: trustworthy and respectful behaviour by
managers as an enabler for target-led communication, raising the
awareness of our employees to promote a self-critical analysis of
their health and safety conduct, and adoption of internal and external ideas for improvement of health and occupational safety.
Excellent occupational safety
Work on offshore wind farms takes place a considerable distance
from the mainland and this places special demands on occupational
safety and the management of emergencies. In 2014, RWE was
awarded the Renewable Energy Health and Safety Award for its
emergency plan at the offshore wind farm Gwynt y Môr. This award is
made annually by RenewableUK and The Crown Estate. The objective
of the emergency plan is to achieve the same emergency provision at
sea as on the mainland by using emergency teams. The emergency
teams are responsible for an area of 80 km2. 9,000 workers have
been working on the wind farm with more than 500,000 offshore
transfers without any significant incidents to date.
Another example of successful measures in the area of occupational
safety is the “Safe Shift Start” implemented with RWE East at the
Mátra power station. Before the start of each shift, employees and

managers have an update on potential hazards involved in the work.
This enables us to strengthen the awareness of hazards in routine
operations every day.
Occupational safety with partner companies
Occupational Safety Partner Management (OSPM) is directed towards
long-term improvement of occupational safety at subcontractors.
During the year under review, we expanded safety management by
the concept of “Safety Teams”. This envisages representatives of
RWE and the implementing partner company (subcontractor) communicating about concrete occupational safety measures before the
planned measures commence. After pilot projects have been successfully completed at our subsidiary company Süwag, Safety Teams are
then deployed throughout the Group. Action guidelines provide managers and employees with instructions for training and implementation of Safety Teams.
RWE also offers managers of subcontractors the opportunity to take
part in workshops, for example on the issue of “behaviour-oriented
inspections”. These workshops give them insights into how they can
sensitise employees to the issues of risk assessment and risk reduction when they are at work. Measures for enhanced occupational
safety are communicated in the workshops and the importance of
successful management and personal commitment are highlighted.
Expansion of Operational Healthcare Management (OHM)
In 2014, we complemented our OHM Principles Programme “Sustainably Positive Influence of the Health Ratios” and adopted the health
ratio as a uniform KPI in the goal agreement for managers at RWE
Generation SE. We succeeded in maintaining the health ratio for
2014 at a constant level compared with the previous year and we
therefore achieved our objective for the year under review.

Overview of our Ten Areas for Action and our CR Objectives | Occupational Safety/Healthcare Management

We carried out a prevention campaign within the framework of OHM
during 2014 for early detection of diabetes. This campaign was
implemented at 21 sites of RWE Deutschland AG and RWE Vertrieb
AG. Information events held by the RWE health scheme (BKK RWE) on
screening and early detection of testicular cancer also took place
under the motto “You can do it – man!” (“Pack's an, Mann!”) at five
RWE sites. More than 200 employees took part in the campaign.
All the managers working in the RWE companies in Germany have
had access to the interactive guidelines “Managing with Healthcare”
(“Gesundheitsgerecht führen”) since 2014. This platform has provided a sound basis for discussing health issues with employees and
for highlighting healthcare packages and measures on promoting
good health.
Our employees in Hungary have access to a range of different healthcare packages. We are using workshops and training sessions on
stress and risk management, programmes for a healthy lifestyle and
health days to promote behaviour based on health awareness. The
inclusion of managers, training of health promoters and the introduction of a points scoring system are contributing to the success of the
programme.

Stress management in focus
A key element of healthcare management is the communication of
a reasonable approach to stress. Apart from stresses in the world of
work, private situations can also result in additional psychological
stresses. The “Social Services” department has been specifically
established for this purpose and it supports employees on matters
such as caring for relatives or childcare issues. This is our way of
ensuring that situations putting excessive stress on employees are
avoided before they even come into being.
We use a number of measures to record employees’ performance and
ability to carry out their work including the Work Ability Index (WAI).
This is based on subjective assessments by the employees in our
workforce and records the extent to which they are in a position to
carry out their work satisfactorily at the present time and in the
future. By the end of 2014, 70 % of the employees in our German
companies had access to the WAI (2013: 70 %). At the end of 2014,
a total of around 19,000 questionnaires had been completed.

SECURITY OF SUPPLY
The uninterrupted and affordable supply of electricity and gas to our customers is the key mission of RWE. We therefore procure the necessary raw materials for producing energy, construct and operate power plants and deploy
innovative solutions for the modernisation and maintenance of our distribution grids so that we are in a position to fulfil our commitments.

Challenge
The changes in Europe’s energy economy entail significant of engineering challenges – for reliable generation and for safe transmission
and distribution of electricity and gas. The expansion and integration
of renewable energies and local generating units present challenging
demands for the performance of distribution grids and conventional
power plants without which a stable supply cannot be guaranteed.

Motivation and targets
As an energy utility, our objective is to guarantee safe and affordable
supply of electricity and gas for our customers continuously and at
all times. We have therefore defined a target of restricting power
outages in Germany to a maximum of 30 minutes per customer each
year. Dependable availability of our power plants and secure supply
with fuels for combustion are equally important factors. We want to
guarantee a secure supply for generation and distribution of electricity and gas in a changing energy environment which encompasses
factors like the ongoing expansion of renewable energies.
Monitoring and performance assessment
As the key performance indicator in the area of security of supply, we
use the number of minutes of power outages that occur per customer and year (System Average Interruption Duration Index, SAIDI).
In 2013*, we succeeded in continuing to provide a largely uninterrupted supply of electricity and gas for our customers. Non-availability for the electricity distribution grid in Germany amounted to an
average of 15.7 minutes for each customer (2012: 17.1 minutes) in
2013. The average non-availability for the gas supply resulting from
faults in Germany was less than 0.46 minutes per customer and year
in 2013 (2012: 0.8 minutes). The energy sources necessary for secure
operation of our power plants were available throughout 2014.

Loss-free electricity transmission in conurbations
The “AmpaCity” project is subsidised with funding of € 5.9 million by
the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy. It involved us
in laying a high-temperature superconductor cable (HTS) around one
kilometre long in our distribution grid located in Essen. This HST
cable allows five times more electricity to be transmitted at temperatures of around -200°C and at the same voltage as conventional
underground cables. The technology is therefore particularly appropriate for space-saving and efficient distribution of electricity in
densely populated urban cityscapes. Since the beginning of 2014,
we have been testing the application of the technology in daily operation. Up to now, we have used the system to transmit electrical
energy sufficient to meet the requirements for around 10,000 households with virtually no losses and without any significant technical
problems.
Research cooperation for intelligent distribution grids
In association with European operators of distribution grids, we
established the “Grid4EU” research project. The cooperation is
intended to facilitate knowledge exchange on experiences with intelligent grid technology. RWE is currently carrying out a review within
this framework to establish how electricity distribution grids can be
adapted to the fluctuating feed-in from locally-based renewable
energy sources without incurring the need for cost-intensive expansion or modification. The project entails fitting existing distribution
substations and switchgear cabinets with intelligent and interlinked
modules in the municipality of Reken, Münsterland. These units monitor the voltage in the grid and transmit the energy input to consum-

GRI G4-DMA; EU29

ers in the region to match the demand. The objective is to adapt the
distribution grid so that it can respond autonomously to any changes
and provide fully automated regulation for the flow of electricity.
Broadband provision for rural regions
Alongside the expansion and operation of intelligent electricity distribution grids, since 2009 RWE has been supporting local authorities
in Germany with assistance in planning and setting up advanced data
networks. Comprehensive local analyses on the ground have encouraged us to cooperate with partner companies in developing and setting up a modern glass-fibre infrastructure. Citizens and businesses
in the region gain access to fast Internet with transmission speeds of
up to 50 megabit per second.
Carbon-neutral operation of gas grids
We are expanding our expertise in safe, reliable and efficient transmission and distribution of natural gas with strategic research projects. In 2014, the Smart Regulation Station project provided evidence in the Czech Republic that renewable energies can be used for
carbon-neutral operation of gas regulation stations independently of
the central electricity supply. The combined deployment of solar
modules, wind turbines and battery storage systems which are
installed directly at the gas regulation stations supply the energy
required for regulating the pressure in the pipelines. After the successful test phase, Smart Regulation Stations are also scheduled for
installation in other grids.

Aerial inspection
Continuous checks are used to monitor reliable operation of our
plants, cabling and transmission lines. We use a Hexacopter for
this work – this is a small, unmanned drone equipped with camera
systems which is controlled from the ground. This system is used to
inspect electricity pylons, transmission lines, wind turbines and photovoltaic systems without the need for high-cost, close-up inspections. This technology helps us to improve the identification of

sources of fault and to plan corrective maintenance measures in
advance. The deployment of a Hexacopter reduces the risks to our
employees and provides a cost-effective, low-noise and low-emission
alternative to conventional checks. In 2014, deployment of the airborne drones was awarded the “German Prize for Ideas” (“Deutscher
Ideen Preis”) by the German Business Management Institute. We use
the technology for maintenance work on our own installations and
offer this service to other companies.

Overview of our Ten Areas for Action and our CR Objectives | Innovation

Challenge
The energy supply of the future must become more climate-friendly,
more efficient and more intelligent. Innovative technologies, products and systems at all stages of the energy value chain are essential
for achieving this objective. The stages range from extraction of raw
materials, through electricity generation, trading, distribution and
storage of energy, to the use of energy. The development and application of innovative technologies here are empowering for achievement of this target and for the future success of the RWE Group.
Motivation and objectives
Our objective is to play a role in structuring the energy transition so
as to create a carbon-neutral electricity supply, while at the same
time being in a position to make provision for future energy needs
with a high quality of supply over the long term. Continuous development of innovations will enable us to ensure that we always have
the best possible solutions to meet the challenges and objectives in
our core processes and core business lines. This will also empower us
to offer our customers the products and services they request. If we
are to achieve this mission, we need to optimise existing technologies, processes and products, and develop new ones.
Monitoring and performance measurement
Our central department of research and development (R&D) enables
us to control all the research and development activities in the
Group. All relevant RWE companies therefore operate with uniform
processes, for example in R&D planning and reporting. We use the
extent of coverage in relation to strategically relevant R&D issues in
percent as the KPI and indicator for target attainment. It was 96 %
during the year under review.

Affordable and environmentally compatible installation
of wind turbines
As a member of the initiative “Offshore Wind Accelerator”, RWE has
joined forces with other European energy utilities to test a new
installation procedure for anchoring offshore wind turbines. This
involves using vibrations to fix the foundations in the ground. A pilot
project is involved in carrying out onshore testing to establish
whether towers installed using this method are equally well anchored
as pile-driven towers. This installation method can be used to significantly reduce the costs of building an offshore wind farm. It also
brings down a large proportion of the underwater noise which can
exert a negative impact on dolphins and whales.
> Research and development projects
Electromobility tested in practical application
Alongside the establishment of a charging infrastructure, we are also
committed to networking current everyday technologies in the area
of electromobility. Our aim is to use the “Smart E” project to promote electromobility as an integral element for the energy structure
of the future and develop and test appropriate business models and
processes. Since 2014, we have progressed this objective by providing ten test households located in Mülheim an der Ruhr with electric
cars and an efficiency package as part of a field test. This overall
approach allows users to generate, store and themselves use their
own electricity. One of the examples of how householders can use
their own electricity is to charge up their own electric vehicle. The
field test is scheduled to run for around 18 months and during this
period we will be testing and working out new tariff models and concepts to establish how decentralised generating systems, electricity
storage facilities and house automation can be optimally harmonised

Batterien GmbH & Co.
> RWE eMobility
The RWE Future House
We have modified a single-family home in Bottrop constructed in the
1960s to create a Plus Energy House as part of the “InnovationCity
Ruhr” project. Energy efficiency refurbishment and the use of smart
technology for generating electricity, as well as for managing heating and energy supply such as ‘RWE SmartHome‘” energy controls
used for household appliances could reduce the energy used by
99 %. The Future House provides impressive testimony to the specific
building measures and technical equipment that could lead to even
older buildings in the property stock generating more energy than
they actually consume. We are also testing the practical feasibility of
these technical solutions in the Future House over a longer timeframe.
> RWE Zukunftshaus
Flexible power plants
Our conventional power plants are also being confronted by new
challenges. They need to be in a position to compensate flexibly for
fluctuations in feed-in from renewable energies. These plants have to
be in a position to adjust their output quickly and sometimes in large
increments. The problem is that most fossil-fired power stations originally tended to be designed for constant energy production. How-



Content

ever, today innovative technologies can assist in enabling the volume
of electricity produced to be more favourably adjusted to meet the
requirement.
The use of new materials and advanced control technology in our
condensation power plants can increase the speed at which they are
able to adjust their output. This has led us to develop a number
measures including the testing of innovative materials within the
scope of the “COMTES+” initiative at Mannheim’s large-scale power
station under conditions of dynamic stress.
Another initiative relates to intermediate storage of energy. RWE
supports research and development into this technology through the
project “TcET” (Thermochemical Energy storage for Thermal power
plants). We have joined forces with a number of joint-venture partners in a consortium led by Munich Technical University (TU
München) to investigate whether the minimum output of a power
plant can be reduced as a temporary measure by using an energy
storage facility. Lower outputs enable power plants to remain on the
grid for longer and they have to be shut down and started up less
frequently. This then avoids the costly, time-intensive and materialdegrading process. A system of this type allows conventional power
plants to continue guaranteeing safe and economic energy supply at
any time as baseload power plants.
Efficient technology for lignite-fired power stations
Innovative plant technology is enabling us to increase the efficiency
of our lignite-fired power stations and reduce the impacts on the
environment. At the Coal Innovation Centre located at our Niederaußem site, we set up a prototype plant for pre-drying lignite (WTA)
in 2009. This process uses fluidised-bed drying technology with internal waste-heat utilisation for processing the lignite. Making use of

79

|

Overview of our Ten Areas for Action and our CR Objectives | Innovation

pre-dried lignite allows us to increase the efficiency of lignite-fired
power stations and reduce their emissions. The innovative flue-gas
desulphurisation plant (FGD plant) also scrubs the emissions generated by our lignite-fired power stations and removes air pollutants
from the flue gases. REAplus is a powerful technology we have been
developing with plant engineering group ANDRITZ Energy & Environment in a joint venture running since 2008. It brings about significant reductions in the energy required for carrying out flue-gas desulphurisation. We have now deployed “REAplus” under commercial
conditions at our Niederaußem site for the first time.
> RWE Coal Innovation Centre
Future ideas in the “Innovation Hub”
Alongside the technological focus of innovation activities in the area
of R&D, we want to work more intensively on innovative business
models for the future. In view of the rapid and fundamental changes



Content

taking place in the energy sector, we want to gain a better understanding for transforming the needs of our customers and develop
innovative solutions. An Innovation Team known as the “Innovation
Hub” has been created to achieve this objective. The team currently
has eleven employees and external experts. The participants work in
multidisciplinary international teams to develop and test new business ideas in the areas of energy efficiency and renewable energies.
We have identified some promising approaches suitable for commercial use in a number of areas including digitisation, new forms of
energy management and the use of data within the company. When
implementing new ideas, we give the team of the “Innovation Hub”
maximally generous scope for entrepreneurial initiative.

Explanations of the Indicators
The following table provides explanations of our indicators. These are sorted according to the sequence in the indicator tool.
Indicator category

Explanations

Electricity generation

Including electricity procured from power plants not owned by RWE that we can deploy at our discretion on the basis of long-term agreements. In the
business year 2014, this amounted to 15.9 billion kWh in the Conventional Electricity Generation Division, of which 12.9 billion kWh was generated by
hard-coal power plants and 0.7 billion kWh in the Renewable Energies Division.
Partly adjusted values for 2013 on account of discontinued operations (RWE DEA) and due to first-time application of IFRS 11 (see Annual Report, p. 41)

Power plant capacity

Including capacities of power plants not owned by RWE that we can deploy at our discretion on the basis of long-term agreements. On 31 December
2014, this electricity generating capacity amounted to 4,351 MW, of which 2,151 MW were based on hard coal.
Partly adjusted values for 2013 on account of discontinued operations (RWE DEA) and due to first-time application of IFRS 11 (see Annual Report, p. 41)

CO2 emissions

Including power plants not owned by RWE that we can deploy at our discretion on the basis of long-term agreements. In the year under review, these
plants produced 14.8 million mt of CO2.
Calculated on the basis of electricity production, not including emissions from biogenic fuels.
Scope 1: direct CO2 emissions from in-house sources (gas transmission, electricity generation)
Scope 2: indirect CO2 emissions from the transmission and distribution of electricity purchased from third parties
Scope 3: indirect CO2 emissions that do not fall under Scope 1 and Scope 2, produced through the generation of electricity procured from third parties,
the transmission and distribution of electricity in third-party grids, the production and transmission of used fuel, as well as the consumption of gas sold
to customers
Partly adjusted values for 2013 on account of discontinued operations (RWE DEA) and due to first-time application of IFRS 11 (see Annual Report, p. 41)
