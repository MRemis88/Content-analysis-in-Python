Key Figures
The financial figures in this report correspond with the data provided in the Annual Report 2014. Fraport AG prepared the consolidated
financial statements for the accounting period ending December 31, 2014 in accordance with the standards published by the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
The financial, personnel, and environmental indicators at the Group level are determined using a SAP-based application. The same method
of calculation is used for all of these data. Details of any different survey methods are indicated in individual cases.
The circle of consolidated Group companies is reconciled to the financial data for the purpose of determining the Group personnel indicators. Since the start of 2014, Fraport has applied the new IFRS 11 accounting standard “Joint Arrangements”. IFRS 11 stipulates that joint
ventures that have until now been proportionately consolidated in the consolidated financial statements must be accounted for and consolidated using the equity method from January 1, 2014 onwards. At Fraport, this has a particular impact on the Group companies Antalya
(Turkey), N*ICE Aircraft Services & Support GmbH (Frankfurt am Main), Medical Airport Service GmbH (Kelsterbach) and AirIT Systems
GmbH (Hannover). For the purpose of comparability, the previous year’s figures have been adjusted to conform with the new accounting
method. No adjustment was made to the figures for 2010 through 2012. The companies included in the consolidation expanded in August
2014 to include the Group company AMU Holdings Inc. and again in October 2014 to include Ljubljana Airport. Due to their proportional
consolidation, some key figures for these two companies could not be obtained.
Beginning in 2014, the consolidated Group companies exerting material environmental effects are as follows: Fraport Cargo Services GmbH
(Frankfurt am Main), GCS Gesellschaft für Cleaning Service mbH & Co. Airport Frankfurt/Main KG, Airport Cater Service GmbH (Frankfurt
am Main), Varna (Bulgaria), Burgas (Bulgaria), Lima (Peru), and Ljubljana (Slovenia). The environmental data are systematically surveyed at
the Frankfurt site in accordance with the EMAS regulation (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme) and DIN EN ISO 14001, and subject to
external verification by an accredited environmental auditor. Lima Airport and Antalya Airport are also certified in conformity with ISO 14001.
The reporting data are calculated using the methods, calculations, and estimates we believe to be appropriate and as used in standard
business practice. However, it is not possible to exclude the possibility of individual GRI indicators being associated with some degree of
uncertainty. An overview of all key figures is provided in our accounting.

In 2014, the circle of consolidated companies – the “Group” – includes the Fraport parent company and the fully consolidated investments
at the Frankfurt site with relevant environmental impacts (figures for 2013 are adjusted). These are: Fraport Cargo Services GmbH (FCS),
Gesellschaft für Cleaning Service mbH & Co. (GCS), Airport Cater Service GmbH (ACS), and the major Group airports in Varna, Burgas,
Lima, and Ljubljana (starting in the fourth quarter of 2014). For the years 2010 – 2012, the scope of consolidation encompassed the Fraport
parent company, FCS, N*ICE Aircraft Services & Support GmbH, and the Group airports in Varna, Burgas, Lima, and Antalya.
Rounding differences are possible.
Validated indicators audited by an external environmental auditor in accordance with EMAS are highlighted in color.

	A 2 h mixed sample is collected each month from the precipitation water channel at a fixed sample test station located just before the discharge point into the Main River.
In 2012, the value for hydrocarbons was calculated from twelve individual samples and the value for “depositable substances” from eleven individual samples.
2)
In eleven samples of hydrocarbons in 2012, the value was < 0.1 mg/l. In one sample it was 0.1 mg/l.
3)
The elevated values come from a sample taken in February 2012 with dead biomass from the precipitation water network itself.
4)
	The increase in 2014 in comparison to past years is due to a high figure in July. High precipitation was recorded on the preceding days, which increased deposits in the
channels.

*) Population database DDS. Survey status of these data for all evaluations 2008.
1)
	The aircraft noise contours were calculated on the basis of the regulations introduced in Germany, “Guidance for Calculation of Noise Protection Areas (AzB)” and “Guidance
for Data Collection on Flight Operations (AzD, 2008)”. All scenarios were standardized on the basis of the long-term average operating direction distribution for the ten years
2000 to 2009. The Sigma supplement developed for the projected protection zone calculation in accordance with the Aircraft Noise Abatement Act and described in AzB and
AzD was not applied.
2)
	The evaluation standard Ldn (Level day/night) is a 24h equivalent continuous sound level in dB(A), where a supplement of 10 dB is applied to sound events occurring during
night time. The Ldn permits impact changes from year to year to be documented on the basis of a single criterion.
3)
The criterion Leq, day = 60 dB(A) is based on the definition of day protection zone 1 in accordance with the Aircraft Noise Abatement Act.
4)
The criterion Leq, day = 55 dB(A) is based on the definition of day protection zone 2 in accordance with the Aircraft Noise Abatement Act.
5)
	The data on Leq, day = 55 dB(A) is the total number within this contour; the number specified under Leq, day = 60 dB(A) is therefore a sub-quantity.
6)
	The criterion envelope from NAT, night = 6 x 68 dB(A) and Leq, night = 50 dB(A) is based on the definition of night protection zone according to the Aircraft Noise
Abatement Act.
7)
	The increase in the indicators compared to both of the previous years is a consequence of steady passenger growth while flight movements remain nearly unchanged: there is
a trend toward use of heavier aircraft, which are assigned to louder aircraft groups in the noise calculations. Since the base data in the AzB aircraft noise calculation continues
to use aircraft noise measurements from the 1990s, it still does not take into account that an increasing number of these heavier aircraft has been recently developed,
relatively quieter models such as the B787, B747-800, and A380. Also, the active noise abatement measures introduced under the Alliance for Noise Abatement can only be
taken into account in the aircraft noise calculation on a limited basis or not at all.

	Bird strike rate (number of bird strikes per 10,000 aircraft movements): All incidents with birds at Frankfurt Airport and in the adjacent surrounding environment for aircraft
with German registrations. The bird strike rate is transferred to the total flight movements at Frankfurt Airport. The notification of a relevant bird strike is made by the pilot
to the German Committee for Prevention of Bird Strikes in Air Traffic (DAVVL e.V.). The DAVVL forwards an annual list of all bird strikes to the relevant airport operator. The
airport operator calculates the bird strike rate, in this case Fraport AG.

2)
Reportable = a work-related accident is deemed to be reportable if it involves more than three days of absence.
3)
	With respect to the average number of employees. The average number of employees is obtained by adding together the total monthly staff figures and dividing by the
number of months.
4)
Days of absence = planned working days.
5)
With respect to scheduled working hours.
6)
A breakdown of accidents by causes of injury is not yet possible for Fraport due to technical reasons. The aim is to collect these data in the future.
7)
	The occupational illnesses and absences include the total workforce but not independent contractors because the data for these staff members are not collected.
8)
	A breakdown of accident days and days of absence is not relevant for Fraport. The largest share of work accidents takes place in the operational area where mostly men are
working. An assessment would therefore primarily relate to men.
9)
The occupation illnesses in 2012 are retrospectively identified illnesses for the year 2011.

About this Report
Our sustainability reporting for 2014 consists of the report “2014 Compact – Fraport. Finances. Sustainability.” and the GRI Report 2014.
The report is based on the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative GRI G3.1, taking account of the airport-specific Airport Operators
Sector Supplement (AOSS).
Our sustainability reporting for 2014 also acts as a progress report on the implementation of the ten principles of the UN Global Compact
in corporate governance.
The GRI checked our report at the end of March 2015 and confirmed “Application Level A+” .
The GRI Content Index shows where information on the individual issues and aspects of sustainability reporting can be found.

Profile
Aspect: Strategy and Analysis
1.1 Statement from the most senior decision-maker of the organization

Status:

Sustainability for Fraport means taking responsibility for structuring the future. We understand sustainable development to be a continuous
process. We believe that the entrepreneurial scope for action can only be ensured by consistent inclusion of non-commercial aspects in
the management processes. We are aware that our corporate governance will inevitably lead to conflicts of interest within our company
and between us and our stakeholder groups. Our “license to operate” and our “license to grow” can only be secured over the long term
if we find the right balance between the factors relevant for the company and for the community in solving these conflicts of interest (see
“Our understanding of sustainability”).
See report “2014 Compact – Fraport. Finances. Sustainability.”, page 3 et seqq. (for short: “2014 Compact”).
Sustainability management at Fraport is based on internationally accredited standards such as the principles of the UN Global Compact,
the OECD principles for multinational companies, and the core labor standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO). Fraport’s
own principles and internal guidelines are also binding, for example, the Fraport Corporate Governance Code and Codes of Conduct for
Employees and Suppliers.
See also “Values and Codes” (http://www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/sustainability-management/werte-und-kodizes.html)

1.2 Description of key impacts, risks, and opportunities

Status:

Approach for identifying the key issues (areas of action):
A strategic goal of Fraport is to generate value over the long term. In this context, the Materiality Matrix makes a contribution to recording
key issues relevant to sustainability. It also contributes to assessing the future opportunities and risks for the company and adopting a
controlled approach to dealing with them. Derived from the Group Strategy (see indicator 1.1) and the Agenda 2015 (see indicator 1.1),
Fraport drew up a Materiality Matrix for the first time in 2010 which records the most important areas of action for the future development
of the Group. For the approach adopted in the development of the Materiality Matrix see report “2014 Compact”, page 16 et seqq.
Opportunities/risks:
Information on the opportunities and risks of the company is explained in the opportunities and risks report of the Annual Report 2014.
See Annual Report 2014, page 75 et seqq.
Targets and measures (Sustainability Program):
A comprehensive overview of all the issues, including the associated targets and measures is provided in the Sustainability Program (see
report “2014 Compact”, page 17 et seqq.).
Positioning in the high-priority areas of action and approach to the opportunities and risks:
See Annual Report 2014, page 75 et seqq.

Management (governance) of the opportunities/risks:
Since 2014, sustainability issues that are relevant to decision making have been discussed in meetings of the Executive Board, including
the relevant heads of the business, service, and central units. This has increased engagement with these issues and consequently increased
their importance. These include the adoption of the Materiality Matrix and the Sustainability Program, and the commissioning of significant
sustainability projects. The Executive Board takes responsibility for monitoring and managing the issues relevant to sustainability (see http://
www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/sustainability-management/strategy-and-goals.html and Annual Report, page 75 et seqq.).
Within the framework of validation in conformity with EMAS, Fraport AG is certificated with conformity with statutory regulations, a systematic
approach to corporate environmental protection, a continuous improvement in environmental performances, and provision of information to
the general public about its environmental impacts and performances. Since 1999, the information has been provided in an Environmental
Statement published on a regular basis. Comprehensive Environmental Statements are published every three years. In the interim, we report
on annual progress in abridged Environmental Statements (see http://www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/stakeholder-dialog/publications.

3.5 Process for defining report content and stakeholders

Status:

Identification and prioritization:
The selection and weighting of the issues presented in our report “2014 Compact” are carried out on the basis of the principles formulated
in the Global Reporting Initiative (completeness, materiality, and inclusion of stakeholders). The material issues are identified and prioritized
in the Materiality Matrix.
The content of the report is selected based on the regular exchange of views with our stakeholder groups (see “2014 Compact”, page 2 and
page 14 et seq.), and on our Sustainability Program. We first carried out a thorough materiality analysis in 2010. In this context, we defined
the most important areas of action for Fraport and positioned these in a Materiality Matrix according to their relevance to stakeholders and
to the company. In 2013, we updated the Materiality Matrix with the involvement of the Executive Board and the heads of the business,
service, and central units, as well as representatives of our most important stakeholders. This matrix was tested for currency in 2014 and
confirmed to be valid. This report describes its effectiveness (see report “2014 Compact”, page 16).
Inclusion of stakeholders:
Fraport has a broad network of institutionalized, structured communication media to promote dialog and a regular exchange of views with
our stakeholder groups. These include carrying out regular surveys and operating systematic feedback management for our passengers, as
well as ongoing dialog with local communities and citizens on airport-related topics (see report “2014 Compact”, page 14).

Aspect: Governance, Commitments, and Engagement
4.1 Governance structure

Status:

In accordance with German legislation, Fraport is governed by a dual management system: The Executive Board manages the company
with responsibility for sustainable growth in the interests of the company, i.e. taking account of the requirements of the shareholders, its
employees, and the other stakeholder groups associated with the company. The Executive Board develops the strategic direction of the
company, defines it together with the Supervisory Board, and ensures implementation. The Executive Board is responsible for compliance
with the statutory regulations and internal company guidelines and ensures compliances within the Group. The Executive Board also
ensures appropriate risk management and risk controlling within the company. The Supervisory Board appoints, monitors, and advises
the Executive Board. Fundamental decisions for the company require the consent of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board has 20
members and has equal shareholder and employee representation. The shareholder representatives are appointed by the shareholders
at the Annual General Meeting. The employees are elected by the employees in accordance with the regulations of the Codetermination
Act. The period of office is five years.
More detailed information on the individual members of the Supervisory Board, the composition, and work of the committees is provided in
the Annual Report 2014 (see Annual Report 2014, page 22 et seqq.). A list compiled by the Supervisory Board relating to diversity aspects
is provided in the section “Indicators”, page 25 et seq.

4.2 Independence of the Chair of the highest governance body

Status:

The Chair of the Supervisory Board is not a Member of the Executive Board.

4.3 Independent members of the highest governance body

Status:

This information is only necessary for organizations without a Supervisory Board. Fraport AG has a Supervisory Board under German legislation for joint-stock companies.

4.4 Mechanisms for shareholders and employees to provide recommendations
or direction to the highest governance body

Status:

The employees have equal representation with employers in the governance body of the Supervisory Board pursuant to German legislation. The Supervisory Board has a separate Human Resources Committee. The function of the Human Resources Committee is to prepare
resolutions pertaining to human resources. The employee representatives on the Supervisory Board can make recommendations to the
Executive Board. Recommendations can also be made to the Executive Board through the system of Works Councils.
The shareholders of Fraport AG assert their voting rights in the company and their right to voice their opinions at the Annual General
Meeting. In the run-up to the Annual General Meeting, shareholders are informed about the business developments and the agenda for
the meeting. During the year, the shareholders receive the latest information about the company through interim reports and additional
publications on the home page. The representatives of the shareholders and employees prepare for each meeting of the Supervisory Board,
as necessary with members of the management. The members of the Executive Board take part in the meetings of the Supervisory Board,
unless the Supervisory Board decides in individual cases to meet in the absence of the Executive Board.
The Supervisory Board is regularly informed in each of its meetings by the Executive Board about the economic, ecological, and social
performance. This takes place due to the obligation arising from Article 90 Stock Corporation Act (AktG) which commits the Executive
Board to informing the Supervisory Board about the economic development on a regular basis. These discussions also regularly address
the company-specific environmental issues. Social issues are generally addressed in advance in the Human Resources Committee so that
they can be presented to the Supervisory Board in the context of regular items on the agenda.

4.5 Linkage between compensation for members of the highest governance body,
senior managers, and executives and the organization’s performance

34

Status:

The compensation of the Executive Board of Fraport AG was linked more firmly to longer-term criteria in 2010 and meets the requirements
defined by the Act on Appropriateness of Management Board Compensation (VorstAG). In 2010, the salary structure of executive employees
was also adjusted accordingly. In accordance with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in the version dated
May 13, 2013, further adjustments were agreed with the Executive Board in December 2013, in particular in relation to caps for variable
compensation elements. Detailed information on remuneration, also for the Supervisory Board, is included in the Remuneration Report in
the Annual Report 2014 of Fraport AG (see Annual Report 2014, page 22 et seqq.).
Since 2009, sustainability has been incorporated within the new compensation system for the Executive Board. In 2010, the salary structure of executive employees was also adjusted appropriately. The new compensation structure has been designed for the long term with
assessment principles covering several years and the possibility of a ceiling for extraordinary developments. The pay structure is therefore
geared more strongly than previously to the long-term and sustainable development of the company. Parts of the remuneration are linked
to longer-term criteria of employee satisfaction, employee development, and customer orientation. The parameters are defined by employee
and customer surveys and the future development of jobs.

4.6 Processes in place for the highest governance body to ensure conflicts of
interest are avoided

Status:

The approach to conflicts of interest is dealt with in the Fraport Corporate Governance Code (see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraportgroup/corporate-compliance/integrated-management-systems.html, pages 11 and 17).

4.7 Qualifications and expertise of the members of the highest governance body,
including any consideration of gender and other indicators of diversity

Status:

The structure of the management and governance bodies of Fraport AG is based on German joint-stock legislation. The Supervisory Board
meets at least four times a year. Once a year, it reviews the efficiency of its activity. This enables issues to be identified that require the initiation
of individual career development measures. For further information see “Statement on Corporate Governance” pursuant to Article 289a
German Commercial Code (HGB) (see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/corporate-compliance/integrated-management-systems.html, the Corporate Governance Report, and the Report of the Supervisory Board in the Annual Report 2014). When proposals for
election of the Supervisory Board members are considered, emphasis is placed on Supervisory Board members having the necessary knowhow, skills, and specialist experience to carry out the functions properly. They must also have the appropriate level of independence. The
Supervisory Board has also been addressing the issue of “Diversity” in a more in-depth approach. In 2010, it already passed resolutions
on this matter which affect the company in general and the composition of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board themselves.

4.8 Internally developed statements of values, codes of conduct, and principles

Status:

The Supervisory Board of Fraport AG adopted the Corporate Governance Code of Fraport AG as early as 2002. The code describes the
essential principles for the management and monitoring of the company and includes internationally and nationally recognized standards
for good and responsible corporate governance.
In 2007, Fraport made a commitment to the UN Global Compact principles. Following on from these principles, we decided in 2012 to
develop the content of the “Values Management System” which had been primarily focused on anticorruption measures up to that point.
The Codes of Conduct for Employees and Suppliers are a constituent element for the realignment of values-based compliance. The Code of
Conduct for Suppliers formulates rules for business relationships with the companies of Fraport AG and applies to all suppliers and service
providers with which there is a direct business relationship. Similar to the Code of Conduct for Employees, this code addresses the issues
of compliance, working conditions, and human rights and was supplemented by the aspects of environmental conservation and climate
protection (see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/corporate-compliance/compliance-values-management.html). At the beginning of 2013, these were initially introduced to the German companies of the Fraport Group and they were then gradually rolled out
in the majority shareholdings abroad. The Group Codes were introduced as a dedicated code for each subsidiary company of Fraport AG.
Fraport has different management systems which support responsible corporate governance (for more information see http://www.fraport.
com/en/the-fraport-group/corporate-compliance/management-systems.html).

The Environmental Policy of Fraport AG has been adopted and signed by the Executive Board of the company. It is therefore binding on the
whole Group. This policy commits Fraport AG to adopt an environmentally compliant approach for all the business activities it is involved
in at all its sites (for further information see Environmental Statement 2014, page 6 ).
The Group company agreement entitled “The Conduct of Partnership, Diversity, and Equality at the Workplace” defines the principles for
antidiscrimination, equal opportunities, the advancement of women into management positions, and diversity for Fraport. These principles
are a key element for decision making on personnel appointments, training measures, organizational changes, and structuring work time.
“We show the flag: Fraport Management Principles”. The Fraport management principles are based on vision and corporate goals and
define the management ethos at Fraport AG. All managers are committed to these principles.

4.9 Procedures of the highest governance body for overseeing the management of
economic, environmental, and social performance

Status:

Since 2014, sustainability issues that are relevant to decision making have been discussed in meetings of the Executive Board, including
the relevant heads of the business, service, and central units. This has increased engagement with these issues and consequently increased
their importance. These include the adoption of the Materiality Matrix and the Sustainability Program, and the commissioning of significant
sustainability projects. The Executive Board takes responsibility for monitoring and managing the issues relevant to sustainability (see report
“2014 Compact”, page 16).

4.10 Processes for evaluating the highest governance body’s own performance,
particularly with respect to economic, environmental, and social performance

Status:

The Supervisory Board meets at least four times a year. Once a year, it reviews the efficiency of its activity and fulfils its supervisory duties
with regard to the activity of the Executive Board (see “Statement on Corporate Governance/Corporate Governance Report” according to
Article 289a German Commercial Code (HGB) at http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/corporate-compliance/integrated-management-systems.html, and the “Report of the Supervisory Board” in the Annual Report 2014, page 22 et seqq.).

4.11 Explanation of whether and how the precautionary approach or
principle is addressed by the organization

Status:

Fraport actively looks for opportunities and embraces them if the magnitude of the projected benefits and the exposure to risks are in a
reasonable relationship. A controlled approach to risks is the primary goal of risk management (see report “2014 Compact”, page 13).
Furthermore, our business model supports a precautionary approach when dealing with environmental problems while also taking into
account aspects such as the cost efficiency, economic feasibility, and sustainability of our environmental programs (see Environmental
Statement 2014).
A range of comprehensive measures directed toward preventive health and safety are designed to avoid the physical, psychological, and
social forms of stress that employees experience at work as far as possible. If stress cannot be avoided, the preventive measures are intended
to reduce or compensate for it (see report “2014 Compact”, page 46 et seqq. and http://www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/employees/
occupational-health-and-safety.html). The Executive Board and the employees have formulated a statement of principles on occupational
health and safety and incorporated it into the Group guidelines.
Security is a key condition for air traffic. This principle applies equally to passenger traffic and airfreight. This is why security management
has always been a top priority at Fraport. Increasingly advanced technologies and more and more personnel are being deployed at Frankfurt
Airport to guarantee the security of passengers, baggage, and cargo. The security of people working at the airport is also a top priority. The
Security Management System (SMS) at Fraport AG is an instrument set up in conformity with the ICAO standards and recommendations.
It records and evaluates all events relevant to security in airport operations and potential weak points in the operating processes. The SMS
is directed toward all users at Frankfurt Airport; the relevant processes, procedures, and responsibilities are defined in a manual accessible
to all internal personnel (see http://www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/our-customer-commitment/air-safety.html).

Status:

Voluntary initiatives (selection):
Fraport AG has made a commitment to compliance with the most important internationally recognized codes of conduct to promote
responsible corporate governance at all Group sites – the principles of the UN Global Compact (since July 2007), the OECD principles,
and the ILO core labor standards.
In addition, Fraport signed the Business Conduct Rules of the biggest European purchasing association, the German Association of Materials Management, Purchasing, and Logistics (AMMPL) in 2009. The guideline is based on the principles of the UN Global Compact and
includes fundamental anticorruption rules, antitrust agreements, rules on child labor and forced labor, and compliance with human rights,
environmental protection and health promotion, and fair working conditions. The companies signing up to the agreement have made a
commitment to promoting the “Business Conduct Rules” with their suppliers with the best possible effectiveness.
The Supervisory Board of Fraport AG adopted the Corporate Governance Code of Fraport AG as early as 2002. The code describes the
essential principles for the management and monitoring of the company and includes internationally and nationally recognized standards
for good and responsible corporate governance. The Fraport Code also includes the essential rights of the shareholders who provide the
company with the necessary equity capital and bear the entrepreneurial risk. The Fraport Code is firmly based on the German Corporate
Governance Code.
Equal opportunities, diversity, and getting the work-life balance right for career and family are key elements of our employment policy.
Fraport signed the Charter of Diversity in December 2007.
Since 2002, Fraport has been a member of Transparency International German Chapter (http://www.transparency.de/English.1222.0.html).
Fraport participates in Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA), a program of ACI Europe with the objective of persuading the maximum number of European airports to adopt CO2-neutral operation. Frankfurt Airport was the first airport to be assessed on the basis of the rules of
the ACA and was included in the program in 2009. The highest level of 3+ can be reached in four stages. In 2012, Frankfurt Airport was
accredited to Level 3 and Antalya Airport was accredited to Level 3 in 2012.
Mandatory initiatives:
Reporting is in accordance with the principles of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). As the capital market-oriented
parent company of the Fraport Group, Fraport AG must prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS Reporting.

Status:

The stakeholder groups relevant to us were defined with the involvement of the Executive Board and the division managers. These groups
should be selected and included. We seek dialog with our business partners, our customers, and politicians. We also seek dialog with our
critics, particularly those people who live their lives near the airport and experience the negative impacts of aircraft noise. Last but not least,
we are also dedicated to looking after more than 78,000 employees (as at: 2012) at the biggest workplace in Germany. As a large company,
we bear direct social responsibility for some of these people and we have indirect social responsibility for the other people working here.

Status:

Fraport has a broad network of institutionalized, structured communication media to promote dialog and a regular exchange of views with our
stakeholder groups. These include carrying out regular surveys and operating systematic feedback management for our passengers, as well
as conduction ongoing dialog with local communities and citizens on airport-related topics. (See report “2014 Compact”, page 14 et seq.)

4.17 Key topics and concerns that have been raised through stakeholders

Status:

Approach to integration of the interests of the stakeholders:
The Materiality Matrix helps us to identify and take account of risks and opportunities for the benefit of Fraport, or to avoid impacts as
appropriate. The systematic exchange of information with the most important internal and external stakeholders enables us to develop
perspectives for the strategic alignment of the company. We outline below the opportunities we want to take forward into the future. We
present key risks in our Annual Report (see Annual Report 2014, page 75 et seqq.).
We first developed a Materiality Matrix in 2010. The result was 17 areas of action which we developed from all the most important issues
for Fraport on the basis of the Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and in an interactive dialog with the most important
stakeholder groups of the company. The matrix reflects Fraport’s broad understanding of sustainability which is not simply restricted to
environmental factors but also encompasses economic and community or social aspects.
We updated this Sustainability Matrix in 2013 and at the same time reviewed and adjusted the areas of action. For purposes of drawing up
the new matrix, the Executive Board and the managers of the business units, services units, and central units were requested to assess the
areas of action on the basis of their importance for the future capability of the company. Managing directors of selected subsidiary companies – here the three biggest subsidiaries in Germany measured by the number of employees (APS Airport Personal Service GmbH, FraSec
Fraport Security Services GmbH, and GCS Gesellschaft für Cleaning Service mbH & Co.) and the managing directors of our investment
in Antalya and majority holdings in Lima, Varna, and Burgas – were requested for their assessment. In the second stage, we asked representatives of our most important stakeholders (capital market, airline companies, passengers, employees, local residents, NGOs, business
partners, and government) for their assessment of the relevance of the individual areas of action. This matrix was tested for currency in
2014 and confirmed to be valid.
Resulting key issues:
The Sustainability Program was derived from this Materiality Matrix. This focused on the areas of action with maximum priority:
>> Safety and security in air traffic
>> Product quality and customer satisfaction
>> Noise abatement
>> Value creation
>> Employee development
>> Compliance/Governance
>> Appeal as an employer
>> Valued added and engagement in the region
>> Climate and environmental protection
>> Air quality
>> Conservation of nature and resources
>> Diversity and equal opportunities
>> Procurement
A comprehensive overview of all the issues, including the associated targets and measures is provided in the Sustainability Program (see
report “2014 Compact”, page 17 et seqq.).
Implementation in communication:
The Executive Board of Fraport AG adopted the targets and measures at the end of 2014. The Sustainability Program is a key element of
sustainability reporting. It allowed the interests of the stakeholders to be integrated in reporting.

Economic Performance Indicators
Management Approach EC
Targets and performance:
We summarized our targets and the measures adopted to achieve them in the Sustainability Program under the area of action “Value Creation” (see report “2014 Compact”, page 30 et seq.).

Policy:
Alongside our function of providing transport, the interest of our owners is safeguarding value and revenue over the long term, i.e. sustainable corporate development. We want to continuously increase the assets of Fraport, generate a reasonable return on shareholders’ equity
and generate the financial means that are necessary for financing future development. Target attainment is measured by various indicators
such as value added, ROFRA (Return on Fraport assets), sales, and earnings. Fraport has been planning and controlling the development
of the Group based on the principles of value-based management since 2001 with the objective of bringing about a sustainable increase
in corporate value. Key measurement and control parameters of this strategy include “Fraport value added”, which is calculated as the difference between the cost of capital for the company (Fraport assets x weighted average cost of capital) and EBIT (earnings before interests
and taxes) (for further information see Annual Report 2014).

Organizational responsibility:
The highest level in the organization, which takes responsibility for the economic performance, is the Chief Financial Officer (CFO).

Key opportunities and risks:
The Fraport Group has a comprehensive risk management system. This ensures that material risks are identified, continuously monitored,
and delimited within the framework of the existing options (see Annual Report 2014, page 75 et seqq.).

Aspect “Economic performance”:

Status:

For information on the economic performance of the Group, see report “2014 Compact”, page 6 et seq. and Financials, page 4.
The subsection “Business development 2014” in the Management Report of the Annual Report 2014 included information on the business
development in 2014 (see Annual Report 2014, page 29 et seqq.). Information on the opportunities and risks of the company is provided
in the Opportunities and Risks Report of the Annual Report 2014.

Aspect “Market presence”:

Status:

Fraport AG operates on four continents as a full-service provider in airport management through investments and subsidiary companies
(see report “2014 Compact”, page 6 et seq., http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/about-us/fraport-at-a-glance.html, and http://
www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/fraport-worldwide/our-airports.html).

Aspect “Indirect economic impacts”:

Status:

The airport is an important economic factor for the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region. Thanks to its central location and the link with the airport,
this region has been transformed into one of the most dynamic and most highly integrated international economic zones in Europe. Our
economic value added benefits the various stakeholder groups in the company, for example, staff members and shareholders. It is therefore
a good benchmark for the community benefit of our business activities. 63 percent of our value added and the biggest share goes to our
staff members in the form of wages, salaries, and social benefits, more than eleven percent goes to our lenders in the form of interest, and
eight percent in the form of dividends to shareholders. We support a wide variety of sports, social, cultural, and ecological activities in the
area surrounding Frankfurt Airport (see report “2014 Compact”, page 62 et seqq. and “Financials”, page 5). Our members of staff and our
Group companies abroad also make important volunteering commitments, generally in the area of social engagement (see report “2014
Compact”, page 66 et seqq.).

EC2 Financial implications due to climate change

Status:

The Fraport Group has a comprehensive risk and opportunities management system to identify, manage, and limit risks and to detect
opportunities across the Group. The reference basis is the rolling 24-month period. Due to the lengthy time frame of climate change and
its manifestations, risks and opportunities are assessed within the environmental management system.
It is not clear at this moment in time whether the amendments to existing regulations initiated due to climate change will entail significant
amendments to business processes that have significant costs associated with them. A global regulation that could significantly influence
the forecasted growth of global air traffic is rather unlikely, as it would entail restrictions for individuals as well as for whole economies.
Annual global growth rates of 4.1 percent are expected by 2031. The expansion measures at Frankfurt Airport and at our Group airports
will create sufficient capacity to meet the increasing growth in traffic.
Frankfurt Airport is less vulnerable to possible limitations of air traffic on short-haul routes due to national regulations, as it handles a higher
proportion of medium- and long-haul flights, which cannot be replaced by other public transport. Compared to short-haul flights, they are
comparatively more profitable and have a better environmental record. In addition, Fraport is proactively working to reduce emissions by
levying emissions-based airport fees, as the airlines are being incentivized to use modern aircraft with lower emissions. At Frankfurt Airport
around forty percent of freight is transported by passenger aircraft. This benefit is of strategic importance against the background of the
debate on energy efficiency and makes a significant contribution to the site’s higher profitability.
No specific risks have been detected due to changes in the physical climate parameters that have a material influence on the company.
Frankfurt Airport makes use of a long time series of meteorological indicators that are updated daily. These indicators are analyzed periodically in order to make any necessary adjustments to the airport infrastructure or to existing business processes in good time. The
dimensioning of the drainage and the volumes of the rainwater collection basins are monitored and taken into account when planning
new infrastructure. Fraport is implementing a range of measures as preparation for extreme weather events. One of these is the expansion
of the winter services facility and its employees. Early action is being taken to counteract the possible increase in energy consumption due
to climate change by reducing consumption in existing buildings through structural and organizational measures. An energy monitoring
system is used to monitor this.
However, tighter regulatory requirements due to climate change can also be viewed as an opportunity. The further development of energy efficiency requirements supports, for example, operational efforts to reduce energy consumption and associated emissions and costs.
The standards are met through measures in both existing and new buildings. For example, the new corporate headquarters building has
been awarded certification by the German Sustainability Building Council (DGNB) for reducing life-cycle costs through energy savings and
selecting easily recyclable materials. Fraport expects energy efficiency requirements to increase for vehicles and equipment in daily use,
which is why we are gradually modifying our vehicle fleet accordingly.
Physical opportunities exist in the forecasted trend of global warming. For example, Fraport could benefit from the expected rise in the
average temperature in the winter months by reducing the cost (materials, staff, expenses) of clearing the operational area, the taxiway
system, and the takeoff/landing runways. The same could apply to aircraft de-icing. In addition, energy consumption would be reduced in
terminals and administrative buildings during the winter months, with consequently lower CO2 emissions and costs.
Fraport has been reporting regularly to CDP since 2006 and has been included in the Climate Disclosure Leadership Index (CDLI) right from
the start. Further information: https://www.cdp.net/en-US/Results/Pages/responses.aspx?Search=True&Keyword=Fraport+AG.

For further information see http://www.fraport.com/en/careers/working-at-fraport/rewards---benefits.html.

EC4 Significant financial assistance received from government

Status:

Fraport has not received government grants and subsidies. Fraport AG is a joint-stock company under German law. The share is quoted on
the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and is included in the MDAX, the index for mid-sized German companies. The stakes held by the State of Hesse
and Stadtwerke Frankfurt am Main Holding GmbH, and the consortium agreement between these two stakeholders mean that Fraport AG
is controlled by these two entities (for further information see “2014 Compact”, page 10 and Indicators, page 6).

EC5 Range of ratios of standard entry level wage compared to local minimum wage

Status:

Frankfurt Airport is defined as a significant business site, since over 90 percent of the employees in the Group work at this site. There are
collective payscale agreements in over 99 percent of all the Group companies. These agreements exceed local minimum wage standards
(see “2014 Compact”, page 67 et seqq.). In accordance with the collective agreement for public service workers, no gender-specific criteria
may be taken into account when assessing activities. Criteria such as knowledge and skills, responsibility, level of difficulty of the activity
or management responsibility must form the basis for assessment. Only the actual job is assessed and not the person who is carrying out
the activity.

EC6 Practices of spending on locally based suppliers

Status:

Frankfurt Airport is defined as a significant business site and the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region is defined as local. Around 73 percent (520
million euros) of the order volume from the parent company totaling 712 million euros was placed with companies in the Frankfurt/RhineMain Region. On account of the legal requirements for the airport operator as a sector contracting entity, it is not possible for Fraport AG
to show preference to companies located in the immediate vicinity or within the area when awarding contracts.
Significant factors for selection of suppliers include the following principles for awarding orders based on Article 97 Act against Restraints
on Competition (GWB):
>> Competitive principle (the maximum number of bidders should be given the opportunity to offer their services in a formalized procedure)
>> Transparency principle (all bidders should be provided with the same information. The selected procedure must not be changed in an
ongoing commissioning procedure)
>> Equality principle/Prohibition on discrimination (all bidders should be treated equally)
>> Offer based on batch allocation (major orders should be allotted in specialist batches and sub-batches, in order to give small and medium-sized companies the opportunity to submit bids within the scope of their capacity)
>> Principle of profitability (the contract should be awarded to the most cost-effective offer)

Status:

Frankfurt Airport is defined as a significant business site, since over 90 percent of the employees in the Group work at this site. Fraport has
no corporate policy covering the entire organization and does not implement a procedure for preferring local residents in recruitment. In
foreign subsidiary companies, employees from within the country are generally employed on account of the specifics of the business. Only
a small number of managers are seconded from the parent company.

Aspect: Indirect Economic Impacts
EC8 Infrastructure investments and services provided primarily for public benefit

Status:

As an operator of the German airport with the biggest volume of traffic, we have a particular commitment to the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region. We have a strong track record over many years of contributing to a wide variety of sporting, social, cultural, and ecological activities.
These include donations and sponsoring for numerous clubs, cultural activities, charitable organizations, and educational institutions. For
further information (on the effects of the support, among other things) see “2014 Compact -> Company”, page 62 et seqq. or http://www.
fraport.com/en/sustainability/social-responsibility-ii/voluntary-commitments.html.
You will find an overview of the outgoings for donations, sponsoring, and the Environmental Fund under EC8 Community engagement,

An investigation into the needs of the community in order to establish the concrete packages required was not carried out during the
reporting period.
Our employees at our Group sites abroad also engage in volunteering, see “2014 Compact”, page 66 et seqq.

EC9 Indirect economic impacts

Status:

Frankfurt Airport is an important economic factor for the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region. Thanks to its central location and the link with the
airport, this region has been transformed into one of the most dynamic and most highly integrated international economic zones in Europe.
A workforce of some 78,000 employees (as at 2012) makes the airport Germany’s biggest workplace.
Around 73 percent (520 million euros) of the order volume from the parent company totaling 712 million euros was placed with companies
in the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region. More than 91 percent of all awarded orders were below an order volume of €10,000 and are therefore
to the particular advantage of small and medium-sized companies. In 2015, the orders to companies in the region are likely to remain at a
similar high level. This is complemented by the economic power of some 500 companies based at the airport. The tax volume generated
by the “Airport corporate complex” contributed to financing public services such as schools, sports facilities, hospitals, universities, and
social services.
See also “2014 Compact”, page 43 and http://www.fraport.de/de/konzern/flughafen-und-region/ausbau-fra.html.
The airport is also important for the entire Federal Republic of Germany because the German economy is mainly dependent on exports.
Many companies rely on short delivery times and fast turnover of goods, in order to be in a position to operate successfully in global markets
for sourcing and sales. Air traffic is an important condition for this. Frankfurt Airport plays a pivotal role for Germany.

Aspect “Water”:

Status:

Our environmental management encompasses a number of aspects including water. Environmental management at Frankfurt Airport has
been validated in conformity with the European Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) since 1999. Our airport was the second
in Germany to open its doors to the critical scrutiny of independent experts – and this validation process has been repeated each year.
Since 2002, we have also received certification under the international environmental standard ISO 14001. For further information see
Environmental Statement 2014 (http://www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/stakeholder-dialog/publications.html#_sustainability_stakeholder-dialog_publications__expandables_containe__items__expandable_item_1).
Measures are described in the report “2014 Compact”, page 58 et seqq. and in the Sustainability Program, page 25 et seqq., and at http://
www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/environment/conservation-of-natural-resources.html. Indicators are presented under AO4 “Quality of
storm water” (see Indicators, page 11 et seqq.).
Fraport treats precipitation water to provide service water: Fraport operates two rainwater treatment plants which are located on the site
of CargoCity South and in Terminal 2. When rainfall is low, treated water from the Main River is fed into the system. The service water is
conducted along separate supply networks into the areas of sprinkler systems, WC flushing, and watering of landscaped areas. There is a
complete service-water supply system in CargoCity South. In the north of the airport, Terminals 1 and 2 are supplied with service water.
The supply of service water in Terminal 1 and the neighboring office buildings is currently still undergoing expansion.

Aspect “Biodiversity”:

Status:

Our environmental management encompasses a number of aspects including biodiversity. Environmental management at Frankfurt Airport
has been validated in conformity with the European Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) since 1999. Our airport was the second
in Germany to open its doors to the critical scrutiny of independent experts – and this validation process has been repeated each year.
Since 2002, we have also received certification under the international environmental standard ISO 14001.
Fraport has a “wildlife management” system. Collisions with large and heavy birds or flocks of birds are a particular hazard for aircraft.
Since approximately 90 percent of bird strikes occur near airports, the aircraft operator has an obligation to minimize this risk. Contrary
to the situation at other international airports, Frankfurt does not focus on driving birds away but relies on a special system of biotope
management. The objective is to structure the airport site and its environment such that birds are not attracted there in the first place and
opportunities for breeding, resting, and feeding are avoided at the outset. A wildlife control manual regulates measures, responsibilities and
information pathways which are primarily directed toward reducing the potential risk of bird strike. A bird strike officer has been appointed
who is specifically dedicated to the issue of bird strike at the airport. “bird control” is operated throughout the day on the airport site and
in the area surrounding the airport. The functions of bird control include regular bird surveys and documentation of the results, general
monitoring of the airport site to identify any occurrences of birds relevant to aircraft safety and bird clearance. Management of landscaped
areas plays a key role here. When species of shrub and tree are being selected, species attractive to birds, in particular those bearing berries
are prohibited. Cultivation of long grasses (standard species height at least 20 cm) is a basic specification for grassland areas throughout
the apron area to avoid attracting birds that breed on the ground. Areas of water that are permanently open are not allowed throughout
the aircraft site and large areas that become covered in water have to be cleared. The Bird Strike Office from Fraport provides advice to the
airport investments and helps to implement wildlife management systems there. Regular bird surveys are carried out throughout the year
to check the numbers, composition, and spread of bird species on the airport site.
The MIVOTHERM system for monitoring bird flight movements was introduced along the Main River when the new Runway Northwest started
operating. It uses thermophotographic technology to record and identify flocks of birds by means of high-resolution stereoscopic thermal
imaging cameras. A range of parameters, such as flight altitude and flight speed, can be precisely determined alongside the size of the bird
flock. An opaque curtain was also erected on the south bank of the Mönchwaldsee lake with the aim of keeping birds off the landing runway.
At the same time, the curtain is intended to minimize the optical signals offering disruptive stimuli generated on the Mönchwaldsee lake.

Status:

The air-pollutant emissions are recorded in an Environment Department in the strategic business unit “Flight and Terminal Management,
Corporate Safety and Security”. The CO2 emissions are surveyed and monitored in the Department for Environmental Management. The
operational management of waste is based with Facility Management. At the Fraport parent company, a dedicated Department of Waste
Disposal carries out this management function. Our environmental management comprises the aspects emissions, wastewater, and waste.
For further information see Environmental Statement 2014, Organizational chart, page 4, Air quality, pages 27–29, Wastewater, pages
37–38, Waste, pages 46–47 (see http://www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/stakeholder-dialog/publications.html#_sustainability_stakeholder-dialog_publications__expandables_containe__items__expandable_item_1). Environmental management at Frankfurt Airport has been
validated in conformity with the European Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) since 1999. Our airport was the second in Germany
to open its doors to the critical scrutiny of independent experts – and this validation process has been repeated each year. Since 2002, we
have also received certification under the international environmental standard ISO 14001. Airports where the Group holds a majority
shareholding have developed environmental management systems which systematically record emissions, wastewater, and waste. In Lima
and Antalya the management systems are also certified in conformity with ISO 14001.
In 2008, Fraport already summarized all activities directed toward climate protection in a single project that focused on three fields: energy-saving measures in the existing portfolio of buildings and infrastructure, efficient energy use in new buildings, and reduction of energy
consumption in the company’s own vehicle fleet. Comprehensive CO2 controlling is used to check all measures directed toward climate
protection. Fraport AG has received international recognition for its climate protection activities: In 2015, the airport operator again achieved
the third out of four certification levels of Airport Carbon Accreditation awarded by ACI Europe, the umbrella organization for airport operators. Since 2006, Fraport has been contributing its climate reporting to the “Carbon Disclosure Project” (CDP), the world’s leading climate
reporting initiative in the financial industry. Fraport was listed for the fifth time in succession in the Climate Disclosure Leadership Index
(CDLI), which was set up in 2010. This index lists the best ten percent of the participating companies. The air pollutants and emissions
have been continuously calculated and measured at two dedicated stations since 2002. Measures for reduction are implemented: Survey of
emission-dependent airport charges based on nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons, reduction of taxiing and waiting times for aircraft using
new procedures, use of mobile work machines and vehicles based on the most advance technology (electromobility), software tools for
optimizing handling processes, and avoidance of empty journeys.
The precipitation water falling in winter is contaminated with biologically degradable deicing agents for the aircraft and airfield surfaces
when snow falls or frost occurs. In future, precipitation water at Frankfurt Airport with a Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of 200 mg of
oxygen per liter will be retained and treated in water treatment plants. For further information on reductions of emissions, wastewater, and
waste, see “2014 Compact”, page 25 et seqq.
The guiding principle of Fraport waste management is to recycle or reuse unavoidable waste as much as possible. Frankfurt Airport separates
waste including paper, glass, packaging waste (DSD green-dot waste), and residual waste. The collected waste is either fed into advanced
sorting systems where any contaminants are separated out and the recyclable materials are then conveyed to the recycling plant or the
recently modernized waste incineration power plant operated by the City of Frankfurt. The steam generated here by combustion is used
for the production of electricity and district heating. The hazardous waste created at Fraport is collected separately and channeled away
for recycling as far as possible. If there are no options for recycling, this waste is fed to a suitable incineration plant for thermal recovery or
disposed of by chemical or physical means in a suitable treatment plant.
Our objective by 2015 is to reduce the paper consumption for each employee at the Fraport parent company by 25 percent compared
with 2009. We have developed a central printer concept with central print points to this end. Most printers at individual workstations have
been discontinued. In September 2012, the preset print option was converted from single-page to printing on both sides. The savings in
paper consumption for each employee at Fraport AG accumulated over five years amounted to around 28 percent at the end of 2013. This
meant that we had already achieved our ambitious target in advance of the specified date.

Aspect “Products and Services”:

Status:

Our commitment to environmental protection and environmental compatibility is directed toward preserving the conditions necessary for
living in our natural environment. The focus of our actions is provided by measures to avoid, reduce, and mitigate environmental impacts
that arise or could arise as a result of the operation of the airport. The content focuses of our environmental management are in the areas of
noise abatement, climate protection, and biodiversity. We have defined strategic goals to achieve these aims in our Sustainability Program
(see “2014 Compact”, page 24 et seqq.) and we pursue them in a range of different measures, for example, for climate protection (see
report “2014 Compact”, page 58 et seqq. and http://www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/environment/air-quality.html) with our biodiversity
strategy (see “Biodiversity strategy” http://www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/stakeholder-dialog/publications.html#_sustainability_stakeholder-dialog_publications__expandables_containe__items__expandable_item) and within the framework of our global environment
management (see Environmental Statement 2014, page 6, http://www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/stakeholder-dialog/publications.
html#_sustainability_stakeholder-dialog_publications__expandables_containe__items__expandable_item_1). We are also continuing our
efforts to promote noise abatement.

Aspect “Compliance”:

45

Status:

Compliance is part of our environmental management at Frankfurt Airport and this is validated in conformity with the EMAS European
Eco-Audit Directive (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme). Our airport was the second in Germany to open its doors to the critical scrutiny
of independent experts in 1999 – and this validation has been repeated each year. Since 2002, we have also received certification under
the international environmental standard ISO 14001. Compliance also forms part of the environmental management systems implemented
at the Group airports where we have a majority shareholding. The Antalya and Lima sites are also validated in conformity with ISO 14001.
For more information see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/corporate-compliance/compliance-values-management.html.

Aspect “Transport”:

Status:

Links with other carriers – also known as intermodality – generates additional traffic volume in competition with competing airports: The
link to the high-speed rail network increases the catchment area compared with airports without a long-distance railway station. It enhances
the hub function, increases passenger numbers, and generates important competitive advantages for us. At the same time, the transfer
from flight to rail traffic facilitates partial easing of capacity for air traffic. This means that slots (time windows for takeoffs and landings)
of short-haul flights, which have been transferred to rail, can be released for urgently needed European and intercontinental flights. The
strategic networking of the airport with other carriers, also called intermodality, has a long track record at Fraport extending back to the
1970s. At that time, the first underground station at a German airport was opened under the newly constructed Terminal 1 – today this is
the airport regional station. When the AIRail Terminal was opened in 1999, the link was opened to the national and international long-distance rail network. The share of ICE traffic of total traffic for the passengers traveling to and from the airport rose by 3 percent in 1999 to
16.1 percent in 2014. In 2014, 31.1 percent of originating passengers used rail transport to travel to and from the airport (metropolitan
railway, regional trains, regional express, ICE, IC, long-distance trains). If buses are included, the share was 36.8 percent in 2014, whereas
this was only 23.6 percent in 1999.
Most public transport at our other airports where we hold a majority shareholding is provided by the use of buses.
Indicators on intermodality are included under Indicators, page 16 et seq.

Aspect “Intermodality”:

Status:

Information on intermodality was reported under the previous aspect “Transport”. Fraport is working to make the airport accessible to as
many passengers and employees as possible with public transport by networking with other carriers – also known as intermodality. We are
working very closely with other carriers to achieve this objective. For example in 2014, 31.1 percent of all originating passengers used the
train to travel to and from the airport. If buses are also included, the share was 36.8 percent. The challenge is to retain this value despite
the growing number of passengers. Fraport employees are motivated to use public transport with the Job Ticket provided free of charge.
This package was taken up by around 33.4 percent of the workforce in 2014.
We are also optimizing the airfreight logistics chain at Cargo City from ecological and commercial perspectives. Handling the traffic volumes
in and around the airport efficiently with minimum environmental impact means that all processes need to be increasingly coordinated
between all the players involved – cargo lines, freight forwarders, handling agents, customs, etc. Fraport has also launched a pilot project
with a number of partners directed toward developing an IT-based cargo community system. In 2011, the transport flows were analyzed
with a view to potential for optimization and the pilot project with everyday operation was started up at the beginning of 2012 (see
Environmental Statement 2011, page 23 et seqq. at http://www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/stakeholder-dialog/publications.html#_sustainability_stakeholder-dialog_publications__expandables_containe__items__expandable_item_1).
Most public transport at our other airports where we hold a majority shareholding is provided by the use of buses.

Overall:

46

Status:

The success of our company is measured by a number of factors including how we comply with our environmental responsibility in the air
traffic industry. This is why protecting the environment and the environmental compatibility of our activities are top priorities for us. The
focus of our actions is provided by measures to avoid, reduce, and mitigate environmental impacts that arise or could arise as a result of
the operation of the airport. The Executive Board of Fraport AG adopted an Environmental Policy for the entire Group in spring 2008. This
policy is based on the principles of the UN Global Compact. The policy commits Fraport to take an environmental approach in conducting
its business activities at all the sites it operates. Fraport AG strives to protect the environment and guarantee safe and healthy working
conditions for its employees. Our environmental management activities guarantee compliance with statutory legislation and regulations.
It also fosters continuous progress on all environmental issues. As we strive to meet our responsibilities to the environment, we motivate
our employees to take a responsible approach to natural resources at all our sites. Appropriate training measures support their actions. The
long track record of experience enjoyed by Frankfurt Airport in environmental protection over many years provides a tangible benefit for
all Group sites, for example in the form of training courses and technical support, including assistance on the ground. Our business model
fosters a caring approach to environmental problems while also taking account of aspects such as the cost efficiency, economic feasibility,
and sustainability of our environmental programs. We work toward developing and disseminating environmental technologies by applying ecological criteria to the selection of products and services. We publish an annual Environmental Statement about our environmental
activities and achievements. We make the Environmental Statement accessible to all our employees and other stakeholders.
Our comprehensive system of environmental management focuses on the issues of noise abatement, climate protection and energy efficiency, intermodality, air quality, and conservation of nature and resources with the issues of biodiversity, water consumption, wastewater,
soil and groundwater, hazardous goods and hazardous substances, and waste. Environmental management at Frankfurt Airport has been
validated in conformity with the European Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) since 1999. Our airport was the second in Germany
to open its doors to the critical scrutiny of independent experts – and this validation process has been repeated each year. Since 2002, we
have also received certification under the international environmental standard ISO 14001. The regular and comprehensive review expresses
our conviction that an airport of our size can only be competitive and successful in the long term if it transforms sustainable environmental
policy into reality and make this transparent in the public domain (see Environmental Statement 2014 at http://www.fraport.com/en/
sustainability/stakeholder-dialog/publications.html#_sustainability_stakeholder-dialog_publications__expandables_containe__items__
expandable_item_1). For targets and performance see “2014 Compact”, page 25 et seqq.

Aspect “Noise”:

Status:

On its own responsibility, Fraport already introduced noise-related landing and takeoff fees at Frankfurt Airport in 1993. Up to the year
2000, noise differentiation was based on the noise values in the noise authorization documents provided with aircraft. In 2001, the noise
differentiation was converted to type-specific noise values determined by the aircraft noise measurement system operating at Frankfurt
Airport. Since then, the differentiation and the range of charges has been gradually increased. Since January 2013, the aircraft types have
been divided into 16 noise categories and these categories have been managed separately for landing and takeoff. The differentiation of
noise classes is particularly evident at night because an additional night surcharge is payable for aircraft movements at night. This is even
higher in the night core time (11:00 p.m. – 4:59 a.m.) than in the marginal nighttime hours (10:00 p.m. – 10:59 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. – 5:59
a.m.). Additional high charges are intended to form an economic incentive for the deployment of quieter aircraft and to transfer aircraft
movements from the nighttime period to the day. On October 30, 2014, the Hessian Ministry of Economics, Energy, Transport, and Regional
Development approved the 2015 charge table for Frankfurt Airport. Within the context of the fee agreement concluded with the airlines
and valid until 2015, the noise-related takeoff and landing fees were raised by an average of 3.2 percent. Particularly loud aircraft were thus
subject to an above-average charge. For them, the fees rose by 8 percent, while those for the quietest aircraft only rose by 2.7 percent.
Already before the new Runway Northwest came into operation, flight procedures for reducing noise were being tested. The procedures
had been developed by a group of experts, made up of representatives from the local communities, aviation companies, air traffic control,
the airport (Fraport AG), politicians and academics, based in Forum Airport and Region (FFR). The aim of active noise abatement is to
reduce the noise directly at the source. The action plan comprises seven measures for reducing noise. These were expanded by a package
of 19 measures signed on February 29, 2012 and entitled “Together for the Region – Alliance for more Noise Abatement 2012” (http://
www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/aircraft-noise-infoservice/active-noise-abatement.html). Fraport took responsibility for the development and implementation of the measures “Dedicated Runway Operations – DROps” and “raising the approach angle by 0.2 degrees”
within the scope of continuous cooperation in the expert committee. The DROps procedure envisages bundling of takeoffs on defined
takeoff runways or departure routes depending on the direction of operations. The overall objective is to create selective noise breaks and
achieve a reduction in the noise nuisance to people living near the airport. The procedures were alternated with DROps being used on
uneven dates and the conventional operating concept being used on even dates. DROps has been in regular operation during the period
between 5 and 6 a.m. since June 28, 2013. Raising the approach angle by 0.2 degrees compared with the previous angle increases the
distance above the residential areas on the approach to the Runway Northwest. Fraport AG has equipped the Runway Northwest with two

GRI Report 2014

GRI Content Index / Ecological Performance Indicators

47

instrument landing systems for the approach angle 3.0 and 3.2 degrees. On approaches with a tailwind and poor weather conditions, the
previous angle of 3.0 degrees should initially be retained. The trial operation started in October 2012. The results of the test operation
were successful, and so the German Federal Ministry for Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI) has now approved regular operation
on Runway Northwest for an unlimited period of time. Analyses by the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) at a total of seven noise measuring
stations of Fraport AG and by the Environment and Neighborhood House (Umwelt- und Nachbarschaftshaus, UNH) showed a reduction
in the maximum noise level of 0.5–1.5 dB (A), depending on the position of the measuring station and the aircraft type. The values were
determined across the whole test operation.
From October 2012 to December 2014, there were around 145,000 landings on Runway Northwest with a sharper glide slope. These made
up 71 percent of all landings. During this time there was neither an increased number of overshoot procedures nor delays to incoming
aircraft. Capital expenditure for the additional instrument landing systems (ILS) and the relocation of the glide path transmitters amounted
to 3.2 million euros. Annual operating costs amount to around 300,000 euros per year.
Further measures from the list of measures for active noise abatement became routine operation in December 2014, such as relocating the
turning areas to ease the strain on Offenbach and Mainz.
Active noise abatement is supplemented by measures of passive noise abatement. On the basis of the Act for Protection against Aircraft
Noise, the Hesse State Government enacted a Noise Abatement Zone Directive for Frankfurt Airport. This defines noise abatement zones.
Furthermore, a comprehensive Regional Fund totaling some 265 million euros was set up to finance additional benefits providing private
households and eligible public institutions with passive noise abatement measures. Funds are also being provided from the Regional Fund
so that claims for passive noise abatement can be brought forward. This measure enables people entitled to reimbursement to submit their
claims now rather than in 2016 (statutory date for claims). The budget is provided by the State of Hesse and by Fraport.
As part of the Casa Program, Fraport AG is purchasing residential properties over which aircraft fly at a particularly low level, i.e. less than
350 meters, or is paying the owners compensation. The purchase price of the properties is set by independent experts based on the circumstances before the airport expansion. The alternative compensation depends on the location of the property and its distance from the
core area affected by low flying aircraft. The application deadline for the CASA property purchase program voluntarily offered by Fraport
was October 31, 2014. Up to then, 250 residential properties had been purchased as part of the CASA Program and 266 compensation
payments had been made. The volume of measures in the CASA Program amounts to around 100 million euros.
We have been measuring aircraft noise around the airport for exactly 50 years. Fraport currently maintains 28 measuring stations and three
mobile measuring stations. The results of aircraft noise measurement and further information about flight operations, such as route configuration or the use of the relevant operating direction of the takeoff and landing runways, are published on the Internet at www.fraport.com.
The measurement results also form the basis for calculating the noise-based charges to create incentives to use modern and quieter aircraft
in Frankfurt.
The new FRA Map application enables users to create an individual image of the local aircraft situation based on calculated values. The
interactive card gives access to information on all relevant topics and focuses specifically on the people affected since they can enter their
home address.
On December 17, 2014, Fraport published the latest noise abatement report on the recent summer flight plan period 2014. This details
the development of aircraft noise pollution in the region and presents the progress in noise abatement at Frankfurt Airport. In the recent
summer flight plan period 2014, the number of aircraft movements totaled around one percent less than the previous year’s figure. With
a concomitant rise in passenger numbers, this demonstrates the trend toward using larger, more modern, and thus quieter aircraft types
such as the A380, B747-800, or B777. The share of these aircraft types at Frankfurt Airport continues to grow. A reduction in continuous
noise levels can be seen at night at the measuring stations in the east. This is mainly due to the previously addressed fleet modernization
program. Current noise levels are below the forecasted values for the expansion.

Fraport AG is supporting the NORAH Noise Impact Study initiated by the Environment and Neighborhood House (UNH) and given academic support by the Darmstadt Eco Institute. The NORAH Noise Impact Study (Noise-Related Annoyance, Cognition, and Health) aims to
provide a maximally representative and evidence-based description of the impacts of noise from air, rail, and road transport on the health
and quality of life of residents. The results published for the first time in the fall of 2014 describe the effects of aircraft noise on the quality
of life and the mental development of elementary school children. Surveys were conducted in elementary schools near our airport. The
focus was on the impact of aircraft noise on the reading performance and language capabilities of elementary school children. The results
showed that the effect of aircraft noise on children’s reading ability is measurable, but relatively low overall. Other factors have a significantly more marked effect, such as socio-economic factors or educational conditions. The study also shows that aircraft noise has no effect
on the manifestation of basic skills, such as the understanding of words. Fraport is now using the results obtained to jointly assess with all
participants how they can be used to target the further alignment of the noise abatement program.
Further information on noise abatement is included in the report “2014 Compact”, page 24 et seqq. and in the Sustainability Program,
page 54 et seqq.

Status:

Fraport is a service provider and not a manufacturing company. The consumables used are entered under AO6 Aircraft and pavement
deicing/anti-icing fluid. See Indicators, AO6 Aircraft and pavement deicing/anti-icing fluid, page 16.
Our objective is to reduce the amount of hazardous substances used at the Frankfurt site. A product evaluation procedure was established
in 1990. This procedure is used to check whether the relevant hazardous substance can be replaced by a less harmful substance. An assessment is also carried out to see whether the relevant operational process can be discontinued or modified. This product evaluation is
also carried out by Fraport AG for other companies at the airport, for example, cleaning companies.
Our objective by 2015 is to reduce the paper consumption for each employee at the Fraport parent company by 25 percent compared
with 2009. We have developed a central printer concept with central print points to this end, most printers at individual workstations have
been discontinued. In September 2012, the preset print option was converted from single-page to printing on both sides. The savings
in paper consumption for each employee at Fraport AG accumulated over five years amounted to around 28 percent at the end of 2013.
This meant that we had already achieved our ambitious target in advance of the specified date. The percentage of recycled paper in the
total amount of copy paper was 99 percent.

The absolute amount of energy saved under “EN5 Energy saved due to conservation and efficiency improvements”, page 10, should
continue to be taken into account.

EN7 Initiatives to reduce indirect energy consumption

Status:

Since fall 2013, Fraport has gradually been introducing CO2 Controlling at the Frankfurt site. This is a controlling tool for measuring and
managing energy consumption. It creates transparency, helps to reduce energy costs, and hence to improve energy efficiency. This tool
enables us to monitor whether the strategic CO2 targets are being attained and to identify irregularities an early stage. At the same time,
CO2 Controlling facilitates the reduction of investment risks and allows successes in implementation to be communicated within the
company and in the public domain. The database is provided by the energy consumption data recorded in a highly nuanced approach for
the parent company on buildings, systems or equipment. All energy sources, such as electricity, district cooling, district heating, gas, and
fuel for vehicles and fuel for combustion are taken into account. Planning and construction based on life-cycle cost is implemented when
portfolio buildings are refurbished and energy efficiency is enhanced. This is also the case for new buildings. This results in optimization of
life-cycle costs and hence energy savings in the early phases of planning. The absolute amount of energy saved under “EN5 Energy saved
due to conservation and efficiency improvements”, page 10, should continue to be taken into account.
The strategic networking of the airport with other carriers, also called intermodality, has a long track record at Fraport extending back to
the 1970s. In 2014, for example, 31.1 percent of all passengers used the train (ICE, long-distance, and regional trains, or metropolitan railway) to travel to and from the airport. If all public transport is included, the share was 36.8 percent. The environmental program of Fraport
AG in 2008 projected a target value of 38.9 percent for the year 2020. The challenge is to retain this value despite the growing number
of passengers. Fraport is working together with German Rail (DB) and Deutsche Lufthansa AG to maintain the target that has been set,
with measures such as integrated travel packages and inclusion of air traffic in the network planning of German Rail. Fraport employees are
motivated to use public transport with the Job Ticket provided free of charge. This package was taken up by 33.4 percent of the workforce
in 2014. Journeys by passengers and employees to and from the airport are not the only trips to “go by rail”. Plans are also being made to
transfer cargo from road to rail. We are also optimizing the airfreight logistics chain at Cargo City from ecological and commercial perspectives
and transfer of the airfreight feeder service from road to rail is also a priority. In the last few years, we have worked on or initiated various
projects in this regard, such as the establishment of Air Cargo Community Frankfurt e.V. and the introduction of the IT platform Fair@Link
(project developer: Dakosy AG, Hamburg). Rules of cooperation have been defined and established on this basis, which should result in
freight flow and return being more coordinated and thus smoother than before, and the ability to avoid congestion.

Aspect: Biodiversity
EN11 Location in, or adjacent to, protected areas and areas of high biodiversity
value outside protected areas

Status:

A total area of owned land amounting to 22.96 square kilometers and an operational area of 18.17 square kilometers within that area means that
based on area our airport in Frankfurt/Main is one of the most compact major airports in the world. By making optimum use of our operational area,
we contribute to keeping the utilization of natural areas in the densely populated Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region as low as possible. Unoccupied
areas at the airport are landscaped wherever possible. Ecologically valuable areas are located in the areas bordering takeoff runway 18 (west)
with species-rich extensive meadowland, nutrient-poor grassland, sandy grassland adapted to dry habitats, and calluna (heather) heathland.
The areas between the takeoff and landing runways measure approximately 600 ha and they are arguably the biggest area of green space in
the region which is not used for agriculture. Apart from a substantial proportion of land with “minor biological value” (primarily sealed under
road surfaces), the airport has large areas of land which are used by animals and plants as habitats. Smaller species of birds, such as wheatears,
European stonechats, or whinchats, can be regularly found there, and in spring natterjack toads and populations of frogs can also be seen.
Precise details can be found under EN11 Location in, or adjacent to, protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value outside protected
areas, page 12.

EN12 Impacts on biodiversity

Status:

The environmental impact audit at Frankfurt Airport verified that overall no sustainable negative impacts were caused to directly adjacent
conservation areas. This has been verified since 2010 during the course of monitoring biotopes and species (see “List of areas with measures”
http://www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/stakeholder-dialog/publications.html#_sustainability_stakeholder-dialog_publications__expandables_
containe__items__expandable_item).

EN13 Habitats protected or restored

Status:

When construction work is carried out at the airport, the objective is to exert minimum impact on the natural environment and the landscape. However, if areas of land have to be developed, mitigation measures are necessary. However, with the extensive and comprehensive
ecological measures more than simple compensation is achieved (see “List of areas with measures” http://www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/
stakeholder-dialog/publications.html#_sustainability_stakeholder-dialog_publications__expandables_containe__items__expandable_item).
Regular monitoring of fauna and flora is a constituent element of the plan approval notice and it outsourced to an external agency.

EN14 Strategies for managing impacts on biodiversity

Status:

Our business activities and natural biodiversity can be harmonized. Areas that are close to nature and their inherent biodiversity are preserved and
promoted as far as this is possible within the operational constraints. Any impairments are kept as restricted as possible. Where substantial impacts
occur, at least equal mitigation or equivalent replacement is carried out and we ensure long-term preservation of function. Fraport has made a
commitment to long-term preservation of biodiversity at Frankfurt Airport and has also decided to promote projects beyond the confines of the
airport relating to the preservation of biological diversity in the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region and in Hesse through its Environmental Fund. The
orchard meadows in the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region are particularly worthy of protection. Orchard meadows in the State of Hesse have been
reduced by around 90 percent over the past 30 years. The meadows have a high level of species diversity and therefore play an important role
in retaining regional biodiversity. The Hesse Society for Ornithology and Nature Conservation (HGON) [link to “http://www.hgon.de/vor-ort/
hgon-vor-ort/unsere-arbeitskreise/frankfurt-am-main/”] in Frankfurt uses the financial support from Fraport to preserve valuable biotopes.
Our “Fraport Diversity Strategy” presented here explains our principles on this important and complex matter. It also documents diversity
projects at the airport and in the region which we are carrying out ourselves or funding with financial support. International agreements
for protection of biodiversity, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), European directives, such as the Fauna-Flora Habitat
Directive, and the Bird Protection Directive, and national legislation, such as the Federal Nature Protection Act are important foundations
in conjunction with the actions taken in our valuable areas of nature.

EN15 Red List species and national conservation list species

Status:

The activities of Fraport AG and its subsidiaries do not generally entail any hazards for endangered species of plants or animals. Hazards
of this nature only occur when the operational areas are expanded. In the European Union, an Environment Impact Assessment has to be
carried out when this occurs and appropriate mitigation or replacement measures have to be implemented.
Species on Germany’s Red List of endangered species exist at Frankfurt Airport. Plants and animals which are endangered at other locations have settled on the areas between the takeoff and landing runways or the taxiways due to the usage pattern. These areas of land in
the operating areas very seldom experience human activity and the kind of visitor pressure in nature conservation areas accessible to the
general public does not occur here.
The Group airports outside Germany are generally financed through international banks. An Environmental Management Plan has to be
submitted which is generally based on an Environmental Impact Assessment and defines how the consequences of intervention can be
minimized. No species on the relevant Red Lists of endangered species are registered by the Group airports.

See EN17 Other greenhouse gas emissions, page 13.
Air traffic in the landing and takeoff cycle up to an altitude of 3,000 ft. generates the greatest emissions (around 960 thousand t CO2). This
is followed by the transport of originating passengers to and from the airport (around 250 thousand t CO2), the energy consumption by
infrastructure and vehicles operated by third parties at the site (approximately 180 thousand t), and finally by the business journeys carried
out by staff members at Fraport AG (approximately 1 thousand t CO2). The airport charges based on NOx emissions also exert an indirect
impact on the emissions of air traffic. The unique intermodal link to the local metropolitan rail network and the national long-distance
transport by regional and long-distance trains means that passengers can be transferred from private transport and short-haul flights to
rail travel. Marketing by a Fraport subsidiary and selective stakeholder engagement exert an impact of the CO2 emissions of third parties.
Business trips are essentially necessary through air travel to our subsidiary companies.
In addition, scope 3 CO2 emissions are also calculated for the Group subsidiaries. Fraport AG and Antalya participate in the ACI’s Airport
Carbon Accreditation program. Further information can be found in the Environmental Statement 2014, Environmental aspect greenhouse
gases, page 15 et seqq. (see http://www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/stakeholder-dialog/publications.html#_sustainability_stakeholder-dialog_publications__expandables_containe__items__expandable_item_1) or for Antalya Airport at Airport Carbon Footprint Verification

EN18 Initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions

Status:

Climate protection is one of the most important challenges for the airtraffic industry. As an airport operator, we support the four-pillar
strategy of the airtraffic industry with measures for climate protection in air traffic. In this context, we focus our efforts on areas which we
are able to directly influence. These essentially relate to technical improvements in buildings and installations, process optimizations, and
economic tools such as airport charges dependent on noise and emissions (see “2014 Compact”, page 58 et seqq.).
Climate and environmental protection is identified as one of the areas of action highlighted in the Materiality Matrix as a top priority for
Fraport (see “2014 Compact”, page 16 et seqq.).

Furthermore, Fraport supports a number of industry-wide initiatives which are directed toward reducing CO2 emissions. Fraport is involved
in SESAR (Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research), an initiative by the European Commission, and EUROCONTROL, which
is intended to secure the future viability of European air traffic management with the involvement of all the players involved in air traffic.
The various action plans within the scope of this initiative include integrated planning of flights, i.e. all the players involved are working to
optimize the process from undocking the aircraft to reaching the target destination. This means that airports also become important players
in air traffic management. The advantage for passengers and the environment: shorter flight times and reduced emissions. The targets of
SESAR to 2020, set in 2005, comprise increasing capacities threefold, reducing CO2 emissions per flight by 10 percent, increasing safety
tenfold, and reducing air safety costs by half (http://www.sesarju.eu/).
As a member of the Air Transport Action Group (ATAG) through ACI, the global association of companies involved in air traffic, Fraport
supports their targets: reduction of CO2 by 1.5 percent per year by 2020 and carbon-neutral growth until 2050. This means a 50 percent
reduction in CO2 emissions in the year 2050 compared with 2005 throughout the sector (http://www.atag.org/). In 2010, the International
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) passed a resolution for an improvement in fuel efficiency of 2 percent per year for the airlines until 2050.
A further resolution was also passed with the objective of carbon-neutral growth from 2020. The environmental organization of ICAO,
the Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP), has also been given the task of proposing a global CO2 standard for aircraft
certification by 2013 (http://www.icao.int/).
Fraport participates in Airport Carbon Accreditation, an ACI program with the objective of making the maximum number of European airports carbon-neutral. Frankfurt Airport was the first airport to be audited in accordance with the rules of Airport Carbon Accreditation and
it was accepted into the program in 2009. The highest level of 3+ can be reached in four stages. Fraport has reached Level 3. Stakeholder
engagement is a key element of this stage. Our investment, Antalya Airport, has also reached Level 3. This was confirmed again for 2014
and 2015. Fraport also contributes its climate reporting externally to the “Carbon Disclosure Project” (CDP) (www.cdp.net), the world’s
leading climate reporting initiative in the financial industry. This index analyzes companies and their strategies on climate change and CO2
reporting. Since 2006, Fraport has been participating in the CDP and it was listed for the fifth time in succession in the Climate Disclosure
Leadership Index (CDLI). This index lists the best ten percent of the participating companies. Fraport is one of two companies from the
“Transportation” sector to be listed in this index.

EN19 Emissions of ozone-depleting substances by weight

Status:

Ozone-depleting substances are not produced or exported in the Fraport Group. The main application is in the cooling units of air-conditioning systems where the materials are located in a closed system. When maintenance work has to be carried out, the coolants are
collected and disposed of as waste. No intentional discharge of the materials occurs. Occasional losses due to leaks cannot be excluded,
but the amount of material involved cannot be reported.

EN20 NOx, SOx, and other significant air emissions

Status:

Fraport AG emits approximately the following amounts each year
NOX: 264 tons
Benzene: 0.4 tons
PM10: 9.3 tons
These data are derived from the zoning plan documents. Determining the data was extremely complex and expensive so that this procedure
has not been repeated again. In future, the data are to be subject to continuous reporting and the necessary processes are currently being
put in place. We are unable to influence other air emissions with our measures and they are therefore not significant.

EN26 Initiatives to mitigate environmental impacts

Status:

Our commitment to environmental protection and environmental compatibility is directed toward preserving the conditions necessary for
living in our natural environment. The focus of our actions relates to measures for avoiding, reducing, and mitigating the environmental
impacts that arise or could arise as a result of the operation of the airport. The content focuses of our environmental management are in the
areas of noise abatement, climate protection, and biodiversity. We have defined strategic targets to achieve these aims in our Sustainability
Program (see “2014 Compact” -> Sustainability Program -> Areas of action “Environment” and “Company”, page 25 et seqq. and page 28
et seqq.) and we pursue these targets by implementing various measures, for example, for climate protection (see “2014 Compact”, page
58 et seqq.), with our biodiversity strategy and within the framework of our global environmental management. We are also continuing our
efforts on noise abatement (see “2014 Compact”, page 24 et seqq. and http://www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/aircraft-noise-infoservice/
active-noise-abatement.html).
Since the end of 2013, there has been a return system for bottles and tins with refundable deposit in both terminals. Following a successful
test run, a total of 25 returnables machines came onstream. The amount for the deposit is donated to four charitable institutions. The individual decides which organization benefits from the deposit. People returning bottles can, for example, decide between the international
environmental organization World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF) and the German aid organization Wings of Help. Anyone who wants to
give the region a helping hand can either donate their deposit to round-table organization Frankfurter Tafel or the Franziskustreff shelter

Social Performance Indicators
Aspect: Labor Practices and Decent Work
Management Approach LA
Targets and performance:
We summarized our targets and the measures adopted to achieve them in the Sustainability Program under the areas of action “Appeal as
an employer”, “Employee Development”, and “Diversity and equal opportunities” (see “2014 Compact”, page 20 et seqq.).

Policy:
Pursuant to responsible corporate governance, we have made a commitment to compliance with internationally recognized standards
of conduct, such as those defined in the principles of the UN Global Compact, the OECD principles, and the ILO core labor standards.
In 2013, Fraport published two in-house codes of conduct to establish these principles even more firmly within the company. These two
codes commit employees and suppliers to compliance with these fundamental principles. The Fraport Policy forms the overarching structure for all commitments and the codes of the Group based on specific thematic areas (see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/
corporate-compliance/compliance-values-management.html).

Responsibility:
The highest level in the organization which bears responsibility for employee aspects is the Executive Director Labor Relations.

Training courses and awareness measures:
We are continuously developing our safety concepts on the basis of a systematic assessment of potential hazards. Alongside the technical
safety of workstations, the behavior of employees and their independent sense of responsibility plays an important role here. This is why
Fraport carries out regular training on occupational safety. In 2013, road safety training commenced for employees working on the apron to
avoid specific accident risks. Another event organized for this group of people was the lightning protection seminars. In these, employees
learned about electrostatic discharge, weather-related risks, and appropriate protective measures. The Annual Meeting for Safety Officers
in 2014 focused on the issue of “fitness and health”. In the context of a safety day, the first-year apprentices at Fraport AG were trained in
the subject of health and safety at work. Key topics included ergonomics and correct methods of lifting and carrying.

Monitoring and tracking:
We have made a commitment at all Group sites to compliance with internationally recognized codes of conduct – the principles of the UN
Global Compact, the OECD principles, and the ILO core labor standards. We use numerous management systems to ensure responsible
corporate governance in our business processes. These include environmental, health and safety, and quality management systems. In order
to identify effectiveness and any potential areas of improvement, the quality management system was successfully awarded certification
under the international standard ISO 9001 in 1996. From 2000, this certification also extended to Group companies and investments and
a certification group was formed under ISO 9001. Quality management aims to ensure the high quality and continuous improvement of all
key processes. Knowledge of the processes carried out in the company, their effectiveness, efficiency, and how they interact are essential for
the company’s long-term success. Regular internal audits are carried out in order to maintain the high level of process quality and to improve
this together with those responsible (see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/corporate-compliance/management-systems.html).

Key opportunities and risks:
The Fraport Group has a comprehensive risk management system. This ensures that material risks are identified, continuously monitored,
and delimited within the framework of the existing options (see Annual Report 2014, page 76 et seqq. at http://www.fraport.com/en/
investor-relations/events-und-publications/publications.html).

GRI Content Index / Social Performance Indicators

Aspect “Employment”:

56

Status:

Fraport is one of the biggest employers in the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region. Fraport AG also operates 14 airports on four continents in
the form of majority and minority shareholdings, as well as under management contracts (see “2014 Compact”, page 66 et seqq.). As a
company operating on the global stage, we are committed to the values and standards of conduct enshrined in the principles of the UN
Global Compact, the ILO core labor standards, and the OECD principles for multinational companies. We developed a Code of Conduct
in 2012 with the aim of making the associated obligations even more transparent. This code is binding on all employees of Fraport AG. At
the beginning of 2013, it came into force in the parent company and will gradually be introduced throughout the Group (see http://www.
fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/corporate-compliance/compliance-values-management.html).
Fraport has no guiding principles and programs relating to recruitment of local personnel by local airport operators and contractors,
measures for reducing the number of employees with access to the security areas of the airport, or measures which demand the loyalty
of employees to the immediate contractor.

Aspect “Labor/management relations”:

Status:

Fraport has a long tradition as a company with a social perspective and a partner-centered approach. Our aim is not simply to be a big employer in quantitative terms. We also want to be just and fair by rewarding our employees for performance and commitment. This involves
giving them fair wages and salaries, and a package of benefits that goes beyond pay. We offer a high level of job security, good working
conditions based on collective payscale agreements, career and personal development options, and a highly developed corporate ethic
defining the management style.
The operations of Fraport AG and its subsidiary companies are primarily carried out with the companies’ own employees. 99 percent of
these are employed and paid under collective agreements. The risk of strikes that could lead to disruption of the operation of the airport
is therefore extremely low. This also includes all areas relevant to security, such as security checkpoints, airport security, and operational
safety. We are unable to exert any influence on other contractual partners or on the customers of our airports in relation to work satisfaction.

Aspect “Occupational health and safety”:

Status:

Fraport has defined the objective of looking after the physical, emotional, and psychosocial well-being of its employees by a range of comprehensive measures directed toward promoting preventive health and safety over the long term. Another function relates to developing
holistic health concepts that are tailored to the specific needs of an aging workforce (see report “2014 Compact”, page 46 and http://
www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/employees/occupational-health-and-safety.html).
Fraport AG responds to all health and safety risks in relation to prevention activities within the framework of behavioral and situational
prevention.
Occupational noise and hazardous substances are defined as significant health and safety risks for all employees at Frankfurt Airport. Various
noise events are recorded and weighted against time in order to assess the noise exposure of employees. Apart from the background noise,
which is especially present during the continuous handling at the position, noise is mainly analyzed where it directly impacts members of
staff when they are carrying out their work. These individual “modules” can then be used to calculate individual stress profiles for workplaces
as well as for individual employees. This evaluation then identifies the extent to which measures are required to reduce the noise pollution.
The T-O-P hierarchy of measures is used to implement the measures. This means that application of technical and organizational measures
takes precedence over personnel measures.
Handling of hazardous substances by our employees – and by employees of third-party companies – is carried out in accordance with the
Hazardous Substances Directive in particular. In conformity with new regulations of the Hazardous Substances Directive and the Technical
Regulations for Hazardous Substances (TRGS), the previous hazard analyses (hazardous substance data sheets) have been revised and
adjusted to the statutory regulations. In 2014, the “Job Safety unit” carried out product assessments for approximately 140 chemicals. A
number of chemicals were rejected because they had a carcinogenic effect, were harmful to the environment, or could trigger allergies.
They were replaced by materials and products that did not have the hazardous properties. The assessments were based on the latest EC
and occupational safety regulations.
Construction sites continue to harbor high accident risks. For this reason, contractors and the companies involved are still required to be
fully alert to employee safety measures. The Job Safety unit provides advice for all construction projects throughout the entire period of the
project. The basis of the advice is the generally binding German Construction Site Health and Safety Regulations (Baustellenverordnung).
The occupational health and safety coordinators in the Job Safety unit monitor compliance with these regulations.

GRI Report 2014

GRI Content Index / Social Performance Indicators

Again in 2014, staff in the Job Safety unit performed a wide range of advisory services. In addition to supporting many small and medium-sized construction projects, their support for the project to construct the new Terminal 3 was a key focus. The design of facilities to carry
out servicing and maintenance activities in particular took a great deal of time, due to the size of the project.
Safety measures are agreed where Fraport works together with external companies. Causes of accidents are jointly analyzed and investigated,
and opportunities are explored to prevent and avoid accidents. The company has established effective processes in the past in this respect.
Established networking activities have also been successfully continued over the past few years. A large in-house trade fair took place in the
spring in this context. A number of external exhibitors took up the invitation from the Job Safety unit and took the opportunity to showcase
their products and services. In the second half of the year, an event was held with presentations and demonstrations on accident events,
focusing on the topic of ladders and scaffolding.
The accident figures show that our work is setting us on the right course. For this reason, we will continue down the same path in 2015.
On the apron, we operate a large number of vehicles for transporting freight and people. The focus is therefore on the area of “Internal
Transport and Traffic”. The driving safety of our personnel is therefore a top priority here in order to maintain the safety of all road users
on the airport site. Fraport therefore regularly carries out training courses for driving as well as “refresher” courses for drivers who have
infringed the traffic rules. We have clear evidence that this approach has succeeded in reducing the number of accidents causing damage
within the company.
The pandemic plan/plan for protection against infectious diseases of Fraport AG regulates the measures which Fraport AG takes at the
Frankfurt Airport site in accordance with the Infection Protection Act if highly infectious diseases occur. The main targets are securing safe
operation of the airport in conformity with standard operating procedures and protection of customers and employees.
The responsibility assumed by Fraport for occupational safety is also clearly defined in connection with temporary staff. They have an equal
priority alongside permanent employees when it comes to occupational safety and they pass through a professional induction phase at Fraport.
Fraport does not carry out any activities at airports in environments which are subject to explosions.

Aspect “Training and education”:

Status:

See report “2014 Compact”, page 46 et seqq. and http://www.fraport.com/en/careers/working-at-fraport/personnel-development.html.

Aspect “Diversity and equal opportunity”:

Status:

As a cosmopolitan company with an international perspective, Fraport is well aware of the diversity of its employees. Diversity enriches
cooperation and promotes innovation and creativity. This is why diversity is a strategic issue for Fraport which the Group systematically
fosters in its diversity management program. We respect and promote personal differences and work toward ensuring that this is reflected
in dealings with each other. The Group company agreement “Conduct of Partnership, Diversity, and Equality at the Workplace” formed the
platform for defined key principles such as freedom from discrimination and equal opportunities. For further information see report “2014
Compact”, page 48 et seqq. and http://www.fraport.com/en/careers/working-at-fraport/diversity.html.
In 2014, we also took numerous measures to further develop diversity management, including the following:
>> Fraport participated in the second German Diversity Day with an in-house diversity trade fair in which the six diversity dimensions were
brought to life.An LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) network, Rainbow at Fraport, was established.
>> In the “Women on the Up” workshop, women could exchange views on the subject of development, leadership, and specialist careers.
>> The target agreement “more women in leadership” was revised.
>> On International World Aids Day (December 1), the Rainbow network began a fundraising campaign at Frankfurt Airport together with
other LGBT networks.
Societal changes have also led to changes in role models and thus also to a greater employment of women in careers that were formerly
male-dominated. At the same time, demographic changes require us to look beyond today’s norms when seeking potential talent. The aim
of the project “Women in Ops” is to integrate more women in future into traditionally male-dominated operational careers in ground handling services. After women were employed in the Freight Transport Unit in 2013, the first women in baggage handling followed in 2014.

Aspect “Equal remuneration for women and men”:

58

Status:

In accordance with the collective agreement for public service workers, no gender-specific criteria may be taken into account when assessing
activities. Criteria such as knowledge and skills, responsibility, level of difficulty of the activity, or management responsibility must form the
basis for assessment. Only the actual job is assessed and not the person who is carrying out the activity. In 2013, we participated in a Logib-D
consultation promoted by the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women, and Youth (BMFSFJ) in order to review the actual
salary data of female and male employees. After the survey and analysis of the structural data, Fraport AG was given formal recognition at
the beginning of 2014 that the company had made equal pay a key strategic issue and that it acted as a role model.

Presentation of the indicators for the Group is currently not possible due to differing legal systems. It is not possible to collect data for the
number of employees who were still employed at Fraport AG twelve months after the end of their parental leave. We would like to address
this issue over the medium term.

LA4 Employees covered by collective bargaining agreements

Status:

In the Fraport Group, more than 99 percent of all employees are employed and paid under collective agreements. The remaining one
percent comprises the staff of smaller Group companies that are not subject to collective agreements. However, they mainly consist of
senior managers and employees not covered by collective agreements.

LA5 Minimum notice period(s) regarding significant operational changes

Status:

Fraport works closely together with the employees’ representatives in an atmosphere of trust. Pursuant to the Works Constitution Act,
the Works Council must be promptly and comprehensively informed about any changes in the business. This was not defined in detail
or restricted within the framework of the collective agreements. A notification obligation of three months is standard business practice.
42 meetings of the Works Council at the parent company were held in 2014, while the Group Works Council came together for ten ordinary meetings during the course of the year. Just as in Frankfurt, Fraport also ensures that employees have the basic right of freedom of
association and the right to collective bargaining payscale negotiations at international sites where Fraport has a majority shareholding.
We are committed to open cooperation in an atmosphere of trust with democratically elected employee representatives and we use this
process to work toward achieving a settlement that is fair for all interests.

LA6 Percentage of employees in job safety committees

Status:

An overview of the percentage of employees represented in job safety committees is provided in LA6 Percentage of employees in job
safety committees, page 22.
The employees at Fraport AG have an opportunity to contribute to company processes in the area of work and traffic safety. Fraport has a
system of committees in Frankfurt dealing with the areas of action job safety and traffic safety. Appointments to some of these committees
have equal employee and employer representation.

GRI Report 2014

GRI Content Index / Social Performance Indicators

59

The Job Safety Committee (JSC) deals with operational issues relating to job safety in the parent company. The permanent members of the
committee include representatives from the committee for disabled employees and the Works Council, the Senior Company Medical Officer,
the Senior Safety Expert, the Executive Director of Labor Relations, and five selected safety officers from the business units. The opinions of
experts for specialist technical departments and experts from the affected areas are sought on defined technical issues in specific instances
relating to job safety, health promotion, and environmental protection. In 2014, the committee met four times under the chairmanship of
the Executive Director Labor Relations.
In 2012, the Group Job Safety Committee (G-JSC) was also introduced at Group level. The function of the committee is to make fundamental decisions on standardizing processes in job safety and health promotion. One of the tasks of the committee was to develop the
overarching job safety goals in 2014 for the Group. Permanent members include the Senior Safety Expert, the Senior Company Medical
Officer, the Group Disabled Employees Representative, and the Group Works Council, as well as all executive managers from the majority
shareholdings at the Frankfurt site. The Executive Managements and Works Council Members of subsidiary companies with particularly
high numbers of employees are also represented in the committee as permanent members. In 2014, the Group Job Safety Committee met
twice. The Executive Director Labor Relations also chaired these meetings.
Fraport operates the Traffic Safety Committee as a third forum. Unlike the job safety committees, this body has equal employee and employer representation with representatives from the parent company and meets at least once a month. The Traffic Safety Committee focuses
primarily on increasing traffic safety in the operational and apron areas. A representative from each of the specialist departments is included
on this committee as necessary. The committee analyzes a variety of different problem areas, such as reported accident events or special
traffic problems. It then uses expert reports to make recommendations on improving the relevant situation to the company management.

LA7 Work-related fatalities and absenteeism

Status:

Comprehensive measures for preventive occupational and health promotion are intended to avoid work-related physical, mental, and psychosocial problems as far as possible, or at least reduce or compensate for the impacts. Recording, investigating, and evaluating accidents
at work is carried out in accordance with the Germany Occupation Safety Act.
A list of occupational diseases and absences can be found under LA7 Occupational diseases and absences, page 23.
A breakdown of the indicators by gender is not yet possible for the Group sites due to technical issues but the aim is to collect these data
in future. The same applies to the breakdown of the accidents by causes of injury.
Reporting of a breakdown of the indicators by regions is not yet possible because the data are not available for this. We would like to
address this issue over the medium term.

LA8 Education and training regarding serious diseases

Status:

The top priority of health promotion at Fraport is to promote and retain the health of all employees. With this objective in mind, health
management at Fraport AG therefore bundles numerous prevention programs and advice packages (see “Health management measures” at
http://www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/stakeholder-dialog/publications.html#_sustainability_stakeholder-dialog_publications__expandables_containe__items__expandable_item). Our employees not only benefit from regular health checks by the company medical service
but also from health injections free of charge and tailor-made prevention programs. They find out about measures providing protection
against noise and receive valuable information on issues like ergonomic design of computer workstations. Health promotion also addresses
the risks relating to personal lifestyles. Information on a generally healthy lifestyle, health hazards, for example, resulting from HIV/Aids or
noroviruses, and programs for giving up smoking is accordingly available.
The packages are available to members of staff at Fraport AG but not to family members and neighbors. Family members of an employee
are only entitled to be examined and receive advice if an employee has been posted abroad under examination G 35 (and amended H 35)
of an employer’s liability insurance in relation to the selected workplace or place of residence.
No workers are involved in operating activities that carry a particularly high risk of developing a specific disease or where a large number of
illnesses occur. All the measures for protection and prevention are taken through proper organization, provision of appropriate workwear,
work safety, and medical examinations.

Status:

In accordance with the collective agreement for public service workers, no gender-specific criteria may be taken into account when assessing activities. Criteria such as knowledge and skills, responsibility, level of difficulty of the activity, or management responsibility must
form the basis for assessment. Only the actual job is assessed and not the person who is carrying out the activity. In 2013, we participated
in a Logib-D consultation promoted by the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth (BMFSFJ) in order to review the actual salary data of female and male employees. After the survey and analysis of the structural data, Fraport AG was given formal

of conduct, such as those defined in the principles of the UN Global Compact, the OECD principles, and the ILO core labor standards.
In 2013, Fraport published two in-house codes of conduct to establish these principles even more firmly within the company. These two
codes commit employees and suppliers to compliance with these fundamental principles. The Fraport Policy forms the overarching structure for all commitments and the codes of the Group based on specific thematic areas (see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/
corporate-compliance/compliance-values-management.html).

Key risks and opportunities/Impact assessment:
The Fraport Group has a comprehensive Risk Management System. This ensures that material risks are identified, continuously monitored,
and delimited within the framework of the existing options available to an acceptable level. The risk assessment is carried out taking the
impacts of Fraport on the environment (Impact Assessment) into account (see Annual Report 2014, page 75 et seqq. at http://www.fraport.
com/en/investor-relations/events-und-publications/publications.html).

Responsibility:
The highest level in the organization which bears responsibility for human rights aspects is the Executive Board and its members.

Training courses and awareness measures:
The General Equal Opportunities Act (AGG) forms a platform for our dealings with members of staff. All managers of Level 1–4 and the
employees in human resource services receive regular training over the course of the year in relation to this legislation (see http://www.
fraport.com/en/sustainability/sustainability-management/werte-und-kodizes.html and http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/corporate-compliance/compliance-values-management.html). Fraport has developed e-learning courses since 2012 with the aim of meeting
the increased compliance requirements. Introduction of these courses commenced in February 2013. They are intended to support the
positive Fraport culture of values and assist our members of staff in correct conduct. They also serve to inform them about the wide range
of topics in the area of compliance.

Monitoring and tracking:
We have made a commitment at all Group sites to compliance with internationally recognized codes of conduct – the principles of the UN
Global Compact, the OECD principles, and the ILO core labor standards. We use numerous management systems to ensure responsible
corporate governance in our business processes. These include environmental, health and safety, and quality management systems. In order
to identify effectiveness and any potential areas of improvement, the quality management system was successfully awarded certification
under the international standard ISO 9001 in 1996. From 2000, this certification also extended to Group companies and investments and
a certification group was formed under ISO 9001. Quality management aims to ensure the high quality and continuous improvement of all
key processes. Knowledge of the processes carried out in the company, their effectiveness, efficiency, and how they interact are essential for
the company’s long-term success. Regular internal audits are carried out in order to maintain the high level of process quality and to improve
this together with those responsible (see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/corporate-compliance/management-systems.html).

Aspect “Investment and procurement practices”:

Status:

Significant factors for selection of suppliers include the principles for awarding orders based on Article 97 of the Act against Restraints on
Competition (GWB) of the Federal Republic of Germany. When services are put out to tender, Fraport AG guarantees compliance with
national and international laws. This is again confirmed in legally binding terms when the contract is signed.
Since the beginning of 2013, we have supplemented this with a Code of Conduct for Suppliers of Fraport AG and we expect our suppliers
to comply with this code. It is based on the principles of the UN Global Compact and is a constituent element of all tenders and contracts
(see http://www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/sustainability-management/werte-und-kodizes.html).

Aspect “Non-discrimination”:

Status:

As a cosmopolitan company with an international perspective, Fraport is well aware of the diversity of its employees. Diversity enriches
cooperation and promotes innovation and creativity. This is why diversity is a strategic issue for Fraport which the Group systematically
fosters in its diversity management program. We respect and promote personal differences and work toward ensuring that this is reflected
in dealings with each other. The Group company agreement “Conduct of Partnership, Diversity, and Equality at the Workplace” formed
the platform for defined key principles such as freedom from discrimination and equal opportunities (see http://www.fraport.com/en/
sustainability/employees/diversity.html).

Aspect “Freedom of association and collective bargaining”:

Status:

Fraport respects the basic right of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining negotiations under national agreements. We
also recognize the right to open cooperation in a spirit of mutual trust with democratically elected employee representative bodies directed
toward a fair settlement of interests. Over 99 percent of the employees in the Fraport Group are covered by collective pay agreements.

Aspect “Child labor”:

Status:

The Fraport Group rejects any form of forced labor and is committed to the abolition of child labor. The minimum age permitting full-time
employment in compliance with the relevant national regulations is observed within the Fraport Group.

GRI Report 2014

Aspect “Prevention of forced and compulsory labor”:

62

Status:

The fundamental responsibility for combatting human trafficking or smuggling of migrants is with the Federal Police. Fraport provides
support here as far as possible, for example by making appropriate video analyses of security-relevant video analyses available. Knowledge
about matters relevant to security is exchanged in meetings held to ensure that all the organizations and authorities working on security
issues provide mutual support. Before any data are exchanged, the relevant data protection officers are asked to review the data and approve the transfer.
At the request of the government agencies, various security systems are in place depending on the infrastructure, processes, and risks. One
example is short-term identification blocks (10 minutes). This procedure prevents repeated use of an ID card at the gates. Where possible,
employee transfers between Schengen and non-Schengen zones are installed very close to border control posts.
Clear guidelines and regulations on misuse for all ID card holders are provided in the Airport Use Rules and the ID Card Rules. These include
withdrawal of ID cards/access authorizations.

Aspect “Security practices”:

Status:

The Air Security Act (LuftSiG) came into force in 2005 and regulates the checks carried out on air passengers and their baggage (Article 5).
It also defines the security measures that have to be taken by airport operators (Article 8) and the airline companies (Article 9).
The air security measures in accordance with Article 5 LuftSiG are the responsibility of the Federal Police. The police have appointed Fraport
AG, FraSec GmbH, and another service provider to carry out the air security checks. This primarily includes personal and hand baggage
checks, and the checks carried out on baggage checked in.
The security obligations of the airport operator related to maintaining security and order on the site of the airport are a prerequisite for
guaranteeing unimpeded operation workflows. The entire airport site must satisfy the defined safety standards. These are based on the
requirements of the Air Security Act (LuftSiG) and the applicable EU directives and are divided into different areas for security purposes
depending on their criticality. The airport operator is responsible for carrying out pedestrian and vehicle access checks and for enforcing
checks on people and goods at access points to critical parts of the security zone. These include checking so-called airport deliveries (deliveries of goods into the critical parts which are not used on board aircraft) and checks on taking prohibited items on board. This means
that such operations have to be carried out in the security zones themselves. Fraport AG has commissioned FraSec GmbH to carry out the
checks. Fraport AG must show the regulatory instructions it is subject to under Article 8 LuftSiG in an aviation security plan. This must be
approved by the Hessian Ministry of Economics, Energy, Transport, Urban, and Regional Development as the responsible regulatory authority.
In a task group made up of employees from Data Protection, Product Management, and Video, the departments responsible for managing
user requirements, as well as Corporate Security, and with the involvement of the Works Council, Fraport AG has developed and further
optimized a role and authorization concept for the deployment of video technology on the entire airport site. The use of Fraport video
technology by the authorities is also regulated through this.
The concept provides clear specifications based on the relevant purpose and requirements under data protection legislation to users and
internal installers relating to the installation, configuration, and use of all video data.
Furthermore, a new approval process has been established which is primarily based on the appointment of video officers (VB) by the areas
deploying this technology. The VB for the strategic business unit “Airside and Terminal Management, Corporate Safety and Security” (FTU)
has been tasked by the Executive Board with the central coordination of video officers from the units. All matters concerning the authorities
will also be managed by the FTU VB.
These measures continue to ensure that the requirements for video monitoring are harmonized with the individual rights of passengers,
visitors, and employees.
Boarding cards have included 2D bar codes for some time now and these store personal data about the passengers. The systems for
processing the data were developed by Fraport in cooperation with customers and data protection and they were implemented so that
personal data are only displayed to the inspecting personnel for checking purposes but are not stored, or otherwise processed, or used
for any other purpose. This is not necessary for the operation of the airport.

GRI Report 2014

63

In order to be in a position to guarantee safety at airports, one of the measures required is that personal access rights must be administered
and checked. At Frankfurt, this is carried out using a new ID card administrative system and new access checking systems are used for the
gates and for all other access points to operational and security areas. Fraport AG has implemented organizational and technical measures
directed toward the protection of data, in order to keep data secure against misuse. Alongside conclusion of an operating agreement to
regulate the handling of data, all changes in use must be agreed with the Data Protection Officer and the Works Council. Accesses to the
system are only permitted for a very limited group of people for a concretely defined function and these accesses are documented so that
any misuse is excluded as far as possible but any misuse occurring can also be identified and tracked.
All security staff must be trained in the statutory regulations and be approved by the authorities. In addition, all employees with access to
security areas must undertake security awareness training at regular intervals.

Aspect “Indigenous rights”:

Status:

Fraport respects the rights of indigenous people. During the reporting period, there were no incidents affecting the rights of indigenous
people (see HR9 Incidents of violations involving rights of indigenous people, page 65).

Assessments:

Status:

We have made a commitment at all Group sites to compliance with internationally recognized codes of conduct – the principles of the
UN Global Compact, the OECD principles, and the ILO core labor standards (see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/corporate-compliance/management-systems.html).

Remediation:

Status:

During the reporting period, no complaints were being pursued at Fraport AG or its subsidiaries in relation to human rights which were
submitted by formal, organizational complaints mechanisms (see HR11 Number of grievances related to human rights, page 65). For this
reason, no improvements had to be made.

HR1 Investment agreements that include clauses incorporating
human rights concerns

Status:

During the reporting period, major investment agreements were concluded as a result of which Fraport acquired shares in another organization or through which an investment project was initiated that was material for the balance sheet. Specifically, along with a consortium
partner, Fraport was nominated as preferred investor for the 40-year concession to operate 14 Greek regional airports. The deal is expected
to be closed in the fall of 2015.
When services are put out to tender, compliance with national and international laws is guaranteed. This is again confirmed in legally
binding terms when the contract is signed.
Fraport complies with its responsibility in the supply chain and also expects the same compliance from its suppliers and service providers.
Our Code of Conduct for Suppliers formulates rules for business relationships with the companies of Fraport AG and applies to all suppliers
and service providers with which there is a direct business relationship (see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/corporate-compliance/compliance-values-management.html).

HR2 Suppliers that have undergone human rights screening

Status:

During the reporting period, no contracts with major suppliers and contractors were rejected on account of human rights aspects or came
into being only on the basis of incorporating additional framework conditions.
Contrary to a manufacturing company, Fraport AG has a heterogeneous requirement structure. The needs of Fraport AG range from
architectural services, through erection of complete buildings to their repair, from office materials through computer center services, to
aircraft tow-tractors. Fraport ensures when putting individual services out to tender that national and international laws and agreements are
applied. This is again confirmed in legally binding terms when the contract is signed. Fraport complies with its responsibility in the supply
chain and also expects the same compliance from its suppliers and service providers. Our Code of Conduct for Suppliers formulates rules
for business relationships with the companies of Fraport AG and applies to all suppliers and service providers with which there is a direct
business relationship (see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/corporate-compliance/compliance-values-management.html).

HR3 Total hours of employee training concerning aspects of human rights

64

Status:

The objective of the General Equal Opportunities Act (AGG) is to prevent or eliminate any disadvantages being suffered by employees for
reasons of race or on account of ethnic origin, gender, religion or beliefs, a disability, on account of age or sexual identity. The managers
of levels 1–4 and the employees in human resource services are therefore regularly trained over the course of the year in relation to the
General Equal Opportunities Act (AGG). Apprentices and trainees should also be comprehensively informed about the AGG (see http://
www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/corporate-compliance/compliance-values-management.html).
A quantitative statement on the hours which are expended overall in relation to training measures relating to guidelines and procedures
on human rights aspects and the percentage of trained employees is not currently possible.

HR4 Incidents of discrimination and corrective actions taken

Status:

During the reporting period, no legal actions were filed in relation to the General Equal Opportunities Act (AGG).

HR5 Freedom of association and collective bargaining

Status:

During the reporting period, it is assumed that the rights of employees to exercise freedom of association and collective bargaining are
not violated in any business activity and with no major supplier.
In accordance with Fraport’s fundamental values of probity, integrity, trustworthiness, responsibility, transparency, loyalty, and fairness,
we aspire to act with social, economic, and ecological responsibility in our business dealings. Our Codes of Conduct commit our own
employees and all the suppliers and service providers of the Group to these standards (see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/
corporate-compliance/compliance-values-management.html).

HR6 Operations and measures to contribute to the effective abolition of child labor

Status:

During the reporting period, it is assumed that there is no substantial risk of child labor in any business activity and in any major supplier.
The Fraport Group is committed to the abolition of child labor. The minimum age permitting full-time employment in compliance with the
relevant national regulations is observed within the Fraport Group. Fraport has made a commitment to compliance with the most important
internationally recognized codes of conduct to promote responsible corporate governance at all Group sites – the principles of the UN Global
Compact, the OECD principles, and the ILO core labor standards. We are consistently working to integrate the internationally accredited
standards in the areas of human rights, work, environmental conservation, and anticorruption within our processes. This is why we decided
in 2012 to develop the conduct rules underlying the Values Management System into Codes of Conduct for Employees and Suppliers
and to complement them with the additional principles of the US Global Compact. Our Code of Conduct for Suppliers formulated rules
for business relationships with the companies of Fraport AG and applies to all suppliers and service providers with which there is a direct
business relationship. Similar to the Code of Conduct for Employees, this code addresses the issues of compliance, working conditions,
and human rights and was supplemented by the aspects of environmental conservation and climate protection (see http://www.fraport.
com/en/the-fraport-group/corporate-compliance/compliance-values-management.html). At the beginning of 2013, these were initially
introduced to the German companies of the Fraport Group and they were then gradually rolled out in the majority shareholdings abroad.
The Group codes were introduced as a dedicated code for each subsidiary company of Fraport AG. Existing conditions and regulatory
documents were incorporated if possible.

HR7 Operations and measures to contribute to the elimination of all forms of
forced or compulsory labor

HR9 Incidents of violations involving rights of indigenous people

Status:

Fraport respects the rights of indigenous people. During the reporting period, there were no incidents affecting the rights of indigenous
people.

HR10 Operations that have been subject to human rights reviews

Status:

The total number of investment companies of the Fraport Group classified by countries can be found here (see http://www.fraport.com/
en/the-fraport-group/fraport-worldwide/subsidiaries-investments.html).
During the reporting period, none of the investment companies were the subject of a review and/or impact assessment relating to human
rights.

HR11 Number of grievances related to human rights

Status:

During the reporting period, no grievances related to human rights were made against Fraport AG and the investment companies which
were submitted through formal, organizational grievance mechanisms.

Aspect: Community
Management Approach SO
Targets and performance:
We summarized our targets and the measures adopted to achieve them in the Sustainability Program under the areas of action “Noise
abatement”, “Air quality”, “Compliance/Governance”, and “Regional engagement”. See report “2014 Compact”, page 17 et seqq.

Policy:
The material field of action here is noise abatement, see report “2014 Compact”, page 54 et seqq. and http://www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/aircraft-noise-infoservice/active-noise-abatement.html.

Responsibility:
The highest level in the organization which bears responsibility for community aspects is the Executive Board and its members.

Training courses and awareness measures:
A key area of action for Fraport is noise abatement. Fraport AG has an “Info Mobile” in order to engage in dialog with local residents,
which traveled around in the area surrounding the airport. Fraport employees acted as ambassadors and took part in campaigns held in
the region. The main focus of campaigns is on holding training courses which provide information on the issues of noise, flight routes,
and noise abatement.

GRI Report 2014

GRI Content Index / Social Performance Indicators

66

Monitoring and tracking:
A material area of action is noise abatement. For more information on aircraft noise monitoring see http://www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/
aircraft-noise-infoservice/active-noise-abatement.html and report “2014 Compact”, page 54 et seqq.

Key opportunities and risks:
The Fraport Group has a comprehensive risk management system. This ensures that material risks are identified, continuously monitored,
and delimited within the framework of the existing options available to an acceptable level (see Annual Report 2014, page 75 et seqq. at
http://www.fraport.com/en/investor-relations/events-und-publications/publications.html).

Aspect “Local communities”:

Status:

With around 60 million passengers each year and 21,000 employees, Fraport AG operates a leading international air-traffic hub in Frankfurt
and therefore makes a major contribution to the economic power and prosperity of Germany and the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region. Fraport
Airport is Germany’s biggest workplace with around 78,000 employees (as at 2012) and it creates employment opportunities for many
thousands of additional jobs in the region. At the same time, aircraft noise negatively impacts on the people who live near the airport. Both
positive and negative aspects provide the reasons for our significant social responsibility (for more information see report “2014 Compact”,
page 54 et seqq. and 62 et seqq., and http://www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/social-responsibility-ii/voluntary-commitments.html and
http://www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/aircraft-noise-infoservice/active-noise-abatement.html).

Aspect “Corruption”:

Status:

Fraport has been operating a web-based compliance system based on prevention for ten years. The initial emphasis here was a focus on
anticorruption as a result of the expansion of the airport.
An organizational structure with new content was only developed in 2012 as a consequence of the much more broadly based development
into a comprehensive compliance and risk management system. The content focus in 2014 was the adoption of the Group policy on the
compliance management system, the revision of the set of policies, the development and implementation of three e-learning modules,
and a broad training program for insider training. The preventive nature of the existing compliance, values, and risk management approach
was mainly directed toward strengthening the compliance culture of our company and ensuring proper governance.
Fraport has implemented a whistle-blower system at many of its sites. This is an important tool for identifying or uncovering breaches in
codes. In 2009, Fraport introduced the electronic whistle-blower system BKMS® (see https://www.bkms-system.net/bkwebanon/report/
clientInfo?cin=6fra1&language=eng) in the parent company. Fraport employees, business partners, and customers have the opportunity
to submit confidential reports about irregularities around the clock using an Internet-based communication platform. Access to the system
is provided through the Fraport website. This means that information on corruption, economic crime, and infringements of standards of
conduct can be notified in confidence throughout the world at any time. The whistle-blower system was implemented at our Group subsidiary Fraport Twin Star Airport Management AD in 2009, at our Antalya site in 2010, and in Lima in 2011.
Fraport has also appointed an external lawyer as an ombudswoman. She additionally accepts reports on company-related crimes, inadmissible business practices, and serious infringements of regulations. Since 2003, employees at the Frankfurt site have also had an internal
ombudsperson they can turn to. You will find additional information on the whistle-blower systems at http://www.fraport.com/en/thefraport-group/corporate-compliance/reporting-systems.html.

Aspect “Public policy”:

Status:

Fraport has a broad network of institutionalized, structured communication media to promote dialog and a regular exchange of views with our
stakeholder groups. These include carrying out regular surveys and operating systematic feedback management for our passengers, as well
as ongoing dialog with local communities and citizens on airport-related topics. See also SO5 Public policy positions and lobbying, page 68.

Aspect “Anti-competitive behavior”:

Status:

“Ensuring sustainability” is one of the five core elements of Agenda 2015 (see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/about-us/
visions-goals-strategy.html). Sustainability management at Fraport is based on internationally accredited standards such as the principles of
the UN Global Compact, the OECD principles for multinational companies, and the core labor standards of the International Labour Organization. Fraport’s own principles and internal guidelines are also binding, for example, Codes of Conduct for Employees and Suppliers and
the Fraport Corporate Governance Code (see http://www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/sustainability-management/werte-und-kodizes.html).

GRI Report 2014

Aspect “Compliance”:

67

Status:

The Supervisory Board of Fraport AG adopted the Corporate Governance Code of Fraport AG as early as 2002. The code describes the essential
principles for the management and monitoring of the company and includes internationally and nationally recognized standards for good
and responsible corporate governance. The Fraport Code also includes the essential rights of the shareholders who provide the company
with the necessary equity capital and bear the entrepreneurial risk. The Fraport Code is firmly based on the German Corporate Governance
Code and is regularly reviewed and revised to meet the recommendations and ideas of the government committee. The last revision was
carried out on June 1, 2014. On behalf of and acting for the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board of Fraport AG submits a declaration on
corporate governance pursuant to Article 289a German Commercial Code (HGB) (including a detailed Corporate Governance Report) and
publishes it in the Annual Report. The Annual Report also contains the report of the Supervisory Board together with other statements on
corporate governance (see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/corporate-compliance/integrated-management-systems.html).

SO1 Operations with implemented local community engagement

Status:

Frankfurt Airport is a key business location. Frankfurt Airport is an outstanding economic and location factor for the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main
Region and beyond. The airport is a magnet attracting companies and a training center. It is also the biggest workplace in Germany with a
workforce of 78,000 employees (as at 2012). Many export-oriented companies and German or European branches of major international and
multinational companies – more than 500 in total – have selected the area around the airport as their location. The companies in turn attract
numerous service providers who create further employment. We offer the 38 million consumers living within an area of 200 kilometers around
the airport opportunities to travel to 250 destinations throughout the world (for more information see “2014 Compact”, page 43 et seqq.)
Fraport AG makes an important contribution to creating regional value and to social stability at its sites. In 2014, we paid our employees
around 970.4 million euros in wages and salaries and deducted approximately 132.5 million euros in direct taxes. In the business year 2014,
we generated total revenues amounting to around 2.395 billion euros. 73 percent (520 million) of our orders with a total volume of 712
million euros were placed with companies in the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region. It is important to remember here that airport operators are
sector contractors and are precluded on legal grounds from granting preference to companies from the surrounding area when they place
orders (see “2014 Compact”, page 43 et seqq.).
We are positioned in a field of tension at our main location in Frankfurt. On the one hand, we are responsible for tens of thousands of jobs,
the economic importance of the biggest airport in export nation Germany and the prosperity of the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region. On the
other hand, the downside to this is the noise impact for those sections of the population who live in the region around the airport.
We are committed to taking responsibility and we incorporate all the aspects of this field of tension within our entrepreneurial actions to
maximum possible effect. This is particularly important against the background of a foreseeable increase in the volume of traffic. We therefore defined concrete goals for noise abatement, such as improving the noise situation in the neighboring residential areas and reducing
the number of people impacted by noise, and initiated further measures in 2014 (for more information see “2014 Compact”, page 54 et
seqq. and http://www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/aircraft-noise-infoservice/active-noise-abatement.html).
We also make a contribution toward creating regional value at all our other airports where we have a majority holding, see “2014 Compact”,
page 50 et seqq. This corresponds to a share of 100 %.
Fraport regularly has open stakeholder dialogs (see “2014 Compact”, page 66 et seqq.)

SO9 Operations with significant potential or actual negative impacts
on local communities

Status:

Airports make a significant contribution to economic prosperity through jobs, tax receipts, and first-class transport connections. However,
their business activities also have disadvantages which exert negative impacts on the local communities (see “2014 Compact”, page 43 et
seqq.). A material aspect here is noise abatement (see also “2014 Compact”, page 54 et seqq. and http://www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/
aircraft-noise-infoservice/active-noise-abatement.html).

AO8 Number of persons displaced by the airport operator

Status:

During the reporting period there were no cases in which persons were displaced either willingly or unwillingly.

SO2 Percentage and total number of business units analyzed for
risks related to corruption

Status:

The Internal Audit Department audits all key business units of the parent companies, subsidiary companies and joint ventures, and investment companies on the basis of an audit plan adopted by the Executive Board. The key emphasis of the audits also involved regularity
audits which include aspects of the audit relating to corruption risks. The focuses of the audit are developed on the basis of a standardized,
risk-oriented planned approach for the annual program planning and the number of regularity audits can therefore vary between 15 and
25 audits each year.

SO3 Percentage of employees trained in anticorruption policies and procedures

Status:

In 2014, central compliance training on the code of conduct “Giving and accepting gifts and invitations” (anticorruption) was conducted
via e-learning. The training concept involved different management levels and functions having the same obligation to undergo training.
A total of 3,379 people were obliged to undertake the anticorruption training in 2014 (33 percent of the 10,219 permanent staff). The
anticorruption module “Accepting gifts” was completed by 83 percent of managers at levels 1–5 and 82 percent of employees with no
management responsibility who were required to undertake training. The anticorruption module “Giving gifts” was completed by 81
percent of managers at levels 1–5 and 80 percent of employees who were required to undertake training.
Classroom training courses were also run for managers at levels 1–3 during the reporting year. In these, 231 managers with inside knowledge were trained in insider regulations in nine events. From October 2014, employees on the insider list were also offered an appropriate
e-learning training course.
In addition, 40 executive managers and the managing directors of the German investment companies received training on compliance
issues at a senior management event.

SO4 Actions taken in response to incidents of corruption

Status:

In 2014, ten allegations of corruption were made at the Fraport parent company and the Fraport subsidiaries. Investigations were carried out
into these allegations. In two cases, the allegations could not be confirmed. Five investigations into the facts have not yet been completed.
The allegation of corruption could not be confirmed in the other three cases following an appraisal of the evidence.

SO5 Public policy positions and lobbying

Status:

Fraport has a broad network of institutionalized, structured communication media to promote dialog and a regular exchange of views with
our stakeholder groups (see “2014 Compact”, page 10 et seqq.).

of the German Air Traffic Industry (BDL) (see http://www.bdl.aero/en/). BDL focuses on the importance of air traffic as an economic factor
for Germany and has defined its target as highlighting its contribution to safety mobility, climate, and environmental protection. We are
working together with the bodies there to prepare positions on the issues of air traffic. They also include positions on projected legislation
and political initiatives. Working with trade organizations is a top priority for Fraport. Involvement in the trade organizations promotes
exchange of information and cooperation with other airports on current issues relating to traffic policy and sector specific matters. ADV
focuses on Germany’s importance as a traffic hub. ACI EUROPE and ACI WORLD address issues relating to European and international air
traffic. In Europe, exchange of ideas between hub airports is particularly important because this enables common positions, strategies,
and initiatives for solutions to be agreed. Work with trade organizations involves a range of different specific issues (e.g. environmental
policy, safety measures, passenger rights, Single European Sky, etc.). The Fraport Executive Board plays an active role in the management
bodies of the trade associations.

Aspect: Product Responsibility
Management Approach PR
Targets and performance:
We summarized our targets and the measures adopted to achieve them in the Sustainability Program under the areas of action “Safety and
security in air traffic” and “Product quality and customer satisfaction” (see “2014 Compact”, page 16 et seqq.).

Policy:
We always focus on the responsibility for our product when analyzing all the development options and growth plans. The obligation to our
customers, the community, and the environment does not come to an end when we complete a new terminal, build a new runway, or the
passenger goes through the gate and gets onto a plane. Our quality management and control systems, security management, and many
of our services are directed toward ensuring that airlines, passengers, tenants or visitors can look back on an enjoyable and streamlined stay
in the environment of Frankfurt Airport at the end of the day. Fraport is pursuing with the project “Great to have you here!” the objective
of making Frankfurt Airport even more attractive to transit passengers and ensuring that all passengers have an enjoyable travel experience
(for more information see “2014 Compact”, page 51 et seqq.).

Responsibility:
The highest level in the organization which bears responsibility for product responsibility aspects is the Executive Board and its members.

Training courses and awareness measures:
In order to ensure adequate preparation for emergencies, a range of different emergency exercises are regularly carried out at Frankfurt
Airport, for example
>> Planned exercises
>> Firefighting and rescue exercises
>> Exercises for informing relatives, affected airlines, media, and the general public
>> Exercises providing initial counseling for uninjured survivors of an accident, their relatives, and people giving assistance.

Alongside smaller exercises, e.g. evacuation of persons from the Skyline, a full exercise is carried out at Frankfurt Airport every two years in
accordance with statutory regulations and the international ICAO guidelines. This major exercise involves practicing complex emergencies.
The primary focus is on effective cooperation between internal and external emergency services. The Fraport Emergency Orders (BA-NOT)
form the basis for planning and coordinating these exercises. The exercise scenarios are planned and carried out as near to reality as possible,
in order to ensure that all the parameters contained in the alarm plan are reviewed – the functionality and effectiveness of organizational,
personnel, and material precautions, as well as the qualifications of the emergency and support personnel. Special training and career
development courses are held for employees at the Emergency Information Center and in Special Assistance Teams (SAT) (see http://www.
fraport.com/en/our-expertise/aviation-services/SafetyandSecurity.html).

Monitoring and tracking:
The satisfaction of our customers is a top priority in our Materiality Matrix. We are continually working on improving our tested service
profile in order to retain and further enhance customer satisfaction. Specifically, we have decided to provide more comfort to around 60
million passengers traveling through Frankfurt every year. The corresponding activities were bundled in the initiative “Great to have you
here!”. For more information see “2014 Compact”, page 51 et seqq.

Key opportunities and risks:
The Fraport Group has a comprehensive risk management system. This ensures that material risks are identified, continuously monitored,
and delimited within the framework of the existing options (see Annual Report 2014, page 75 et seqq. at http://www.fraport.com/en/
investor-relations/events-und-publications/publications.html).

Aspect “Customer health and safety”:

Status:

The key issue for air traffic above all others is safety (see “2014 Compact”, page 16 et seqq.). We want to retain the high standard of safety
at Frankfurt Airport. A continuous review of all processes governing safety, training of personnel deployed, and a safety management system
enable us to make a significant contribution to safety. Increasingly advanced technologies and more and more personnel are being deployed
to guarantee the security of passengers, baggage, and cargo (see “2014 Compact”, page 18 et seqq.).
Another key area of action is noise abatement (see “2014 Compact”, pages 24 and 54 et seqq.). We are committed to taking responsibility
and we incorporate all the factors operating within this field of tension in our entrepreneurial actions to maximize the possible effect. Our
concrete goal is to keep below the noise values projected in the approval procedure for the airport expansion by taking measures within the
scope of active noise abatement. Active noise abatement reduces the noise directly at the source or brings about improvements along the
distribution pathway. Passive noise abatement is targeted toward reducing noise at the location where the noise pollution is experienced.
We tackle this issue by financing building measures for noise abatement which go beyond the statutory regulations.
A bird strike management system is in place in order to prevent the risk of bird strike at Frankfurt Airport and at the Group airports. A wildlife
control manual regulates measures, responsibilities, and information pathways which are primarily directed toward reducing the potential
risk of bird strike. A bird strike officer has been appointed specifically dedicated to the issue of bird strike at the airport. Bird control is
operated throughout the day on the airport site and in the area surrounding the airport. Bird control at Frankfurt Airport was extended to
include the aircraft movement area at the Runway Northwest and applies throughout the airport site and the area surrounding the airport.
The functions of Bird Control include regular bird surveys and documentation of the results, general monitoring of the airport site to identify
any occurrences of birds relevant to aircraft safety, and bird clearance. Management of landscaped areas plays a key role here. When species of shrub and tree are being selected, species attractive to birds, in particular those bearing berries are prohibited. Cultivation of long
grasses (standard species height at least 20 cm) is a basic specification for grassland areas throughout the apron area to avoid attracting
birds that breed on the ground. Areas of water that are permanently open are not allowed throughout the aircraft site and large areas that
become covered in water have to be cleared.
The MIVOTHERM system for monitoring bird flight movements was introduced along the Main River when the new Runway Northwest started
operating. It uses thermophotographic technology to record and identify flocks of birds by means of high-resolution stereoscopic thermal
imaging cameras. A range of parameters, such as flight altitude and flight speed can be precisely determined alongside the size of the bird
flock. An opaque curtain was also erected on the south bank of the Mönchwaldsee lake with the aim of keeping birds off the landing runway.
At the same time, the curtain is intended to minimize the optical signals offering disruptive stimuli generated on the Mönchwaldsee lake.

Aspect “Product and service labeling”:

71

Status:

The ongoing economic success of our company depends on the satisfaction of our customers and employees. Competitive prices, quality of
services, and the security of procedures and workflows are key factors for this. Environment, job safety, and quality management have been
merged together in a management systems (MS) network in order to show the effectiveness of the procedure and identify any potential need
for improvement (for more information see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/corporate-compliance/management-systems.html).
Numerous international and national guidelines and laws regulate air traffic. The Airport Users Directive (see http://www.fraport.com/en/
our-expertise/business-services/policies-and-payment-terms.html) also applies. The EU “Rights of Passengers” (See http://www.eu-info.de/
static/common/files/view/1294/Amtsblatt_Fluggastrechte_04.pdf) are also applicable. Fundamental principles are also defined in extensive
ICAO regulations governing air traffic and ground handling services (see http://www.icao.int/). The Air Security Act came into force in 2005
and regulates the checks carried out on air passengers and their baggage (Article 5). It also defines the security measures that have to be
taken by airport operators and the airline companies (Articles 8–9).
The satisfaction of our customers is a top priority in our Materiality Matrix. We are continually working on improving our tested service
profile in order to retain and further enhance customer satisfaction. Specifically, we have decided to provide more comfort to around 60
million passengers traveling through Frankfurt every year (see “2014 Compact”, page 73). The relevant activities are included in the “Great
to have you here!” initiative. For more information see “Management Approach PR -> Aspect “Service quality”, page 72.

Aspect “Marketing communications”:

Status:

Fraport is committed to self-regulation on advertising when making promotional statements and complies with the regulations laid down by
the German Advertising Council. Accordingly, Fraport avoids any form of discrimination, anticompetitive behavior, and misrepresentation in
the advertising material it publishes. Fraport takes particular account of the rules of conduct promulgated by the German Advertising Council
for advertising that involves or is accessible to children, and operates within the prevailing standards of convention, decency, and morality.

Aspect “Customer privacy”:

Status:

The ongoing economic success of our company depends on the satisfaction of our customers and employees. The security of procedures
and workflows are key factors for this. Environment, job safety and quality management have been merged together in a management
systems (MS) network. This serves as a platform for maintaining and developing a legally compliant and process-oriented organization
and is intended to assist in implementing the vision and goals (value added, strong performance, and sustainability) of our company (see
http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/corporate-compliance/management-systems.html).

Aspect “Compliance”:

Status:

We include observing laws and internal rules under the term compliance. In 2011, we started to implement an integrated system for compliance management, risk management, and the internal control system. The preventive character of the Values Management System successfully
introduced in 2003 is supplemented by the more comprehensive Compliance Management System (CMS). The further development of
the CMS is based on the new auditing standard promulgated by the Institute of German Auditors (Institut der Deutschen Wirtschaftsprüfer,
IDW), PS 980, which defines the conditions for an appropriate framework document and provides the necessary fundamental elements.
Fraport pursues an integrative, risk-based approach in developing solutions for more in-depth links between the subsystems compliance
management, risk management, and internal control system. This approach is based on the internationally recognized COSO II Framework.
For this purpose, a supporting IT Tool was introduced at Fraport AG in 2012. Networking of the individual subsystems in organizational
terms will be guaranteed by the bodies Risk Management Committee and Compliance Board. The latter will formulate uniform specifications
and will address concrete compliance incidents. The Compliance Board reports to the Executive Board which also regularly receives an
overview of the material Group risks. The Executive Board uses this information to inform the Supervisory Board.
Since October 2012, the central unit Corporate Compliance, Values, and Risk Management (CWR) has been responsible for the development, setup, reporting, and organization of the routine operation of the compliance management system at Fraport AG. It reports at
regular intervals through the Chief Executive Officer to the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board on issues relating to compliance,
including information obtained from the whistle-blower systems and details of compliance breaches dealt with by the CWR. The focus in
2014 was the more intense networking of local compliance officers within the different Fraport business areas and majority holdings. The
Compliance Relevance Analysis is carried out on a rolling basis.

GRI Report 2014

The Compliance Board supports the CWR management in structuring, operating, and developing the CMS. It is the central body for networking technical and interface issues. The work of the CMS relates to dealing with important breaches of compliance.

Aspect “Business continuity and emergency preparedness”:

Status:

Fraport AG currently already has an emergency management system spanning all departments which was installed on the basis of the
Operating Instructions for Emergencies (BA NOT) and applies this for all emergency incidents. Each individual incident and the measures
taken are documented. Apart from routine everyday business, winter services and strikes were a particular issue on the agenda last year.
The crisis staff were also activated on this matter in our ERIC (Emergency Response and Information Center). Stranded passengers were
supported by SAT Team (Special Assistance Team) on standby. This team consists of volunteer employees of the Fraport Group who act as
first-aid counselors and as a care team.
The emergency and crisis management comprises the following elements (see http://www.fraport.com/en/our-expertise/aviation-services/
SafetyandSecurity.html):
>> Emergency planning
>> Crisis preparation
>> Emergency Response and Information Center (ERIC)
>> Emergency Information Center (NIZ)
>> Special Assistance Team (SAT)
>> Basic Assistance Team (BAT)
>> Emergency exercises
>> Airport Fire Brigade
>> Airport safety
>> Security Control Center
>> Medical Services
The Fraport Group has a comprehensive risk management system. This ensures that material risks are identified, continuously monitored,
and delimited within the framework of the existing options available to an acceptable level.
The events which can impair the service quality at the airport include a breakdown of the Central Airport Information System (INFOplus) or
of the electronic gate management system. All the standard operating procedures intended to overcome any failure, including deployment
of personnel, are defined in the Management Systems Manual of Fraport AG.

Aspect “Service quality”:

Status:

The service quality is being increased by the following tools:
1. Fraport passenger survey
>> Each month around 2,400 passengers are asked about their satisfaction with Frankfurt Airport overall and about their satisfaction with
individual criteria (e.g. waiting time at the security checks or friendliness of employees at the information desks). The survey is carried
out at the gates and is linked with the frequent flyer survey “Fraport Monitor”.
>> Analysis: In each case, an evaluation for global satisfaction and the individual aspects is carried out for the proportions of passengers (on
a scale where 1 is best and 6 is worst) which selected one of the best assessment options (so-called “Top Box”). Example: The global
satisfaction determined on the basis of this method amounted overall to 80 percent in 2014, i.e. 80 out of 100 respondents gave a score
of 1 or 2 to the question “How satisfied were you overall with Frankfurt Airport?”.
2. ASQ (Airport Service Quality) Survey
>> ASQ is a passenger satisfaction study initiative by the international airports association ACI. Over 200 airports worldwide take part in this
study. Passengers also have the option here assessing their overall satisfaction with the airport in the course of a survey in the gate area
and with specific services at the airport. The survey is carried out in the form of a questionnaire.
>> Analysis: The trend of an individual airport’s survey results is tracked over time and the relevant position of Frankfurt in comparison with
comparable airports is also assessed.
We are also in continuous dialog with our business customers and partners. Our regular customer advisory councils and task forces form
part of the ongoing process of dialog. Additionally, numerous ad-hoc meetings take place to discuss specific subject areas. We also have
a close, continual exchange of ideas with government agencies.

FraCareServices GmbH is a subsidiary company of Fraport AG and Deutsche Lufthansa AG which is based at Frankfurt Airport. FraCareServices
GmbH offers services to people with restricted mobility and special needs pursuant to the provisions of the EU Directive (EC) 1107/2006.
This service is the response by Fraport AG taking account of the EU Directive. Responsibility for providing assistance service at the airport
has been transferred by the airline companies to the airport operators in order to ensure a uniform quality standard for the assistance service
to passengers with special needs and restricted mobility. FraCareServices GmbH has specially trained employees and looks after passengers
requiring support in making their way to and from the aircraft (for more information see http://www.fracareservices.com/english/).

PR1 Life cycle stages in which health and safety impacts of products and
services are assessed for improvement

Status:

The key issue for air traffic above all others is safety. A continuous review of all processes governing safety, training of personnel deployed,
and a safety management system enable us to maintain the high safety standards at Frankfurt Airport. Increasingly advanced technologies
and more and more personnel are being deployed to guarantee the security of passengers, baggage, and cargo (see “2014 Compact”,
page 18 et seqq. and http://www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/our-customer-commitment/air-safety.html).

See also DMA PR – Business continuity and emergency preparedness and “2014 Compact”, page 18 et seqq.

PR5 Customer satisfaction

Status:

We carry out monthly passenger satisfaction surveys. These are supplemented every quarter by comparative values from other airports
from the international survey ASQ (“Airport Service Quality”).
Fraport also has a comprehensive feedback and complaints system so that our customers can tell us about their experiences. We are totally
accessible to our customers. They can contact us by Facebook, Twitter, email, phone, letter, in person, or using our feedback terminals. The
aim is to ensure that every complaint is answered within the space of five days. In 2014, around 4,700 complaints were received, compared
to 4,200 complaints in the previous year. The increase in complaints is especially due to recording feedback through social media channels,
which were first systematically recorded in the feedback database in 2014. The complaints are dealt with by the relevant departments and
provide ideas for improvements. We are also in continuous dialog with our business customers and partners. Our customer advisory councils
and task forces meet regularly with the airlines in an ongoing process of dialog within a structured schedule and framework. Additionally,
numerous ad-hoc meetings take place to discuss specific subject areas. We also have a close exchange of ideas with government agencies.

Reporting Principles
Through the “2014 Compact – Fraport. Finance. Sustainability” report,
we inform our stakeholders and the interested public of the economic
development of the Fraport Group as well as its goals, activities, and
advancements in the area of sustainability in a compressed form. We
publish further information in accordance with the Global Reporting
Initiative standard (GRI) in a separate report in version G 3.1, including
the additional industry-specific indicators for airport operators, on our
home page at www.fraport.de/sustainability. The GRI report meets
the requirements for “Application Level A+” and therefore fulfills the
application level of the guidelines.
The content of the report is chosen on the basis of regular exchange
with our stakeholder groups and a comprehensive materiality analysis.
In this respect, we have defined the major areas of activity for Fraport
and have positioned them in a Materiality Matrix according to their
significance for the stakeholders and the company. As part of the
sustainability program, Fraport has set targets for all areas of activity
and defined measures to achieve these goals.

Our reports appear annually in German and English and cover the
reporting period from January 1 to December 31 of the respective
year. The editorial deadline for this 2014 report was in April 2015. The
previous report was published on April 16, 2014.
The information in “2014 Compact” comprises all of the Group’s
activities, products, and services, as well as all companies that we
have included in the scope of consolidation in accordance with the
financial reporting regulations valid on the relevant balance sheet
date, as well as those that have a considerable environmental impact
in this respect. As the largest site in the Group by far, Frankfurt forms
the focus of our reporting. More detailed information as to how we
collect data can be found in the GRI report.

Where statements in this document relate to the future, these statements are based on a number of assumptions about future events and
are subject to a number of uncertainties and other factors, many of
which are beyond the control of Fraport. This may lead to the actual
results deviating considerably from the forecasts and statements made
Fraport observes and supports the ten principles of the UN Global in the report.
Compact, develops and implements measures for their implementation and contributes to their recognition, including beyond the
boundaries of its own company. Together with the GRI report,
this publication also serves as a progress report with regard to the
implementation of the ten principles of the UN Global Compact in
corporate management.

Foreword

Foreword
Dear Readers,

Fraport AG helped millions of people to reach their destination last year; either via the Frankfurt
hub or via one of our airports worldwide. Airports enable global mobility, promote the exchange
of knowledge and culture, and are indispensable for a flourishing economy, both nationally and
globally. Following the successful conclusion of the financial year, Chairman of the Executive Board,
Dr Stefan Schulte, and Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Karlheinz Weimar, discussed the events
of the year 2014.						 					 >>>

Foreword

Weimar: It’s hard to believe that Terminal 2
is already more than 20 years old. After all,
it had a forward-looking concept even back
then and was suitable for the new generation
of wide-bodied aircraft.
Schulte: Yes, our Terminal 2 was designed
for these types of airplanes in 1994, and today can also accommodate the Airbus A380.
The dimensions of aircraft have changed
considerably over time, and our long-term
plans have paid off once again: while we
used to welcome around 96,000 passengers
to Frankfurt on an average day, this figure had
risen to more than 160,000 by last year. This
means almost 70 % more passengers flying
each day.
Weimar: At these numbers, any disruption in
airport operations also leads to considerable
inconvenience for our passengers.
Schulte: Unfortunately that is true and cannot
always be prevented. For example, around
half a million people were not able to make
their flights or were delayed due to strikes in
2014. This was largely due to disagreements

2014 Compact

Schulte: A positive contribution has certainly
also been made thanks to fewer and fewer
passengers suffering under the strict night
flight policy. Together with our partners, we
Weimar: Nonetheless, we were able to report have made great strides and been able to
a record number of passengers in Frankfurt significantly improve and stabilize processes

Fraport (hereinafter also referred to as: the
Fraport Group or “our” Group) is among the
leading global airport operators with its international portfolio of airport and airport-related
investments. The Group encompasses all
services of airside and terminal operation and
associated services. The further development
of airports into integrated mobility, event, and
real estate locations additionally represents
a broad revenue and earnings basis for the
Group.
The Group’s key driver of revenue and
earnings is Frankfurt Airport, one of the
largest passenger and cargo airports in the
world. In contrast to time-limited concession
models, the Fraport Group parent company,
Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide (hereinafter: Fraport AG), wholly owns
and operates Frankfurt Airport with no time
limits. In addition to Frankfurt, Fraport was
active at a further 14 airports on four continents at the end of 2014.

The Group companies included in accordance
with IFRS and their 20,395 employees generated revenue amounting to €2,394.6 million
and EBITDA of €790.1 million. Including further investments, Fraport generated a Group
result of €251.8 million in 2014. While the
Frankfurt site made up around two-thirds of
the earnings, Fraport generated around onethird outside of Frankfurt.
Through successful acquisitions, Fraport expanded the Group with the new investments
of AMU Holdings Inc. in the USA and the airport of Slovenia’s capital city of Ljubljana over
the previous financial year. While the investments held by AMU Holdings Inc. operate and
develop commercial terminal areas at the four
US airports in Pittsburgh, Boston, Baltimore,
and Cleveland via concession agreements,
the investment at Ljubljana Airport comprises
all services of airside and terminal operation
at the site.

“E-PORT AN” wins GreenTec Award

Fraport acquires AMU Holdings Inc.

The joint project of Fraport, Lufthansa, the State of Hesse, and the
“E-PORT AN” Rhine-Main electromobility model region won the
GreenTec Award in the air traffic category in April. The goal of the
various projects bundled under “E-PORT AN” is to reduce ground
emissions when handling aircraft on the ground at Frankfurt Airport
by using electric vehicles and drive technologies. The GreenTec Award
is Europe’s largest environmental and business award.

In August, Fraport acquired 100 % of the shares in AMU Holdings
Inc., USA. The investments held by AMU Holdings Inc. operate and
develop commercial terminal areas at the 4 US airports in Pittsburgh,
Boston, Baltimore, and Cleveland via concession agreements. This
acquisition is Fraport’s first step on the North American airport market.

comparison to the previous month, this was an increase of 5.4 %.
Overall, the limit of 200,000 passengers per day was exceeded
13 times in August – this value had previously only been exceeded on
4 days in the history of the airport. The day with the highest number of
passengers was August 17, 2014, which saw 210,599 air passengers.

At the 13th AGM, the shareholders ratified the Executive Board and
Supervisory Board with a large majority for financial year 2013 (99.94 %

properties in the vicinity of the airport that were on the flight path of
particularly low-altitude flyovers (i.e. less than 350 meters), or paid
compensation to the owners. Fraport bought 250 residential units by
the end of 2014. In addition, a total of 122 compensation payments
were made in Raunheim, with this number previously being 144 in
Flörsheim. Further applications are still being processed.

Building permit for Terminal 3 granted

In November, Fraport and the Copelouzos Group were both named
as the preferred investors for two concession agreements to operate
14 regional airports in Greece. The 40-year agreements comprise the
mainland airports of Thessaloniki, Aktio, and Kavala, and the island
airports of Chania on Crete, Kefalonia, Kerkyra on Corfu, Kos, Mykonos,
Lesbos, Rhodes, Samos, Santorini, Skiathos, and Zakynthos. The purchase price for the concessions is made up of a one-time payment in
the amount of €1,234 million as well as an annual minimum concession
payment of €22.9 million plus an inflation-dependent adjustment.
The consortium in which Fraport holds the majority interest is also
obliged to invest in the airports. At the time of the editorial deadline,
Fraport is assuming that the transaction will be concluded and that
operation of the airports will begin at the end of 2015/start of 2016.

2014 Compact

Situation of the Group
Division of management and control
Fraport AG is a public company limited by
shares (Aktiengesellschaft) in accordance
with German law – with the management and
control being divided over 2 independent
bodies (two-tier board). While Fraport’s Executive Board is responsible for management
and leads the Group, the Supervisory Board
monitors this activity.
The Executive Board, which is appointed by
the Supervisory Board, was composed of the
4 members Dr Stefan Schulte (Chairman),
Anke Giesen (Operations), Michael Müller
(Director of Labor Relations), and Dr Matthias
Zieschang (Controlling and Finances) at the
end of 2014. In accordance with German law,
the Supervisory Board consists of 20 members
and is elected equally by the shareholders and
the employees of the company. In the event
of a tie vote in Supervisory Board resolutions,
the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, who
must be from among the shareholder representatives, is entitled to a second vote.
As an additional decision-making and supervisory body, the shareholders of Fraport AG
exercise their right to a voice and a vote at
the AGM. The ordinary AGM of Fraport AG is
held in the first 6 months of the financial year

and makes decisions concerning the tasks
assigned to it by law, such as the appropriation
of profits, election and approval of the actions
of the members of the Supervisory Board, and
approval of the actions of the Executive Board.
Each share entitles the owner to one vote. The
shareholders can exercise their voting right
themselves or via an authorized third party.
There are no differing classes of shares.

Strategy oriented toward long-term market
development
The Group strategy is oriented toward the
long-term forecasted development of the
global aviation market and its market trends.
Despite short-term negative effects from
political and economic crises, the financially
uncertain situation of various airlines, and
unilateral national and international burdens
from legislation, aircraft manufacturers, and
aviation associations expect long-term stable
growth rates in the aviation market.
This forecast is derived from expected global
economic growth as well as the growth of
the middle class throughout the world. The
continuing internationalization of work and
education continues to support this. An increase in traffic is also to be assumed as a result
of expected sustained migration and tourism.
Air traffic is set to develop disproportionately
well in emerging companies in Asia/Pacific,
Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East.

Risk and opportunities management
The Fraport Group has established a comprehensive, Group-wide risk and opportunities
management system, which makes it possible
for risks to be identified and analyzed at an
early stage, and to control and limit those risks
using appropriate measures. Opportunities
management helps companies to recognize
opportunities at an early stage. Risk and
opportunities management is a continuous
system with defined notification thresholds,
and at the same time comprises risks that
result from compliance violations.
Further information on risk and opportunities management can be found in the most
recent annual report at www.fraport.de in
the “Investor Relations” section. The risk
and opportunities report also contains an

Situation of the Group

Stakeholder dialog
Airports are of great interest to the public.
They give rise to regular industrial and political
debates; of course, this is also the case for
Frankfurt Airport. As operator of one of the
largest hubs in Europe, Fraport AG is caught
between the crossfires of a number of very
different demands.

Lars Mosdorf
Head of Remuneration and Concessions
As Head of Remuneration and Concessions,
Lars Mosdorf holds consultation meetings between
Fraport and airlines.

For some of our stakeholders, global challenges such as climate change are at the forefront
of discussion, while aircraft noise is the most
important issue for many people in the vicinity
of airports. Other groups of persons pose
questions regarding the economic value creation of the airport and its competitiveness,
as well as the retention and creation of more
secure and attractive jobs. The things asked
of us are extremely varied and sometimes
incompatible or even contradictory.
We are able to implement many suggestions,
but not all of them. We are nevertheless
convinced that the exchange of information
contributes to mutual understanding and
the processing of solutions that find broad
acceptance.
Through its stakeholder dialog activities derived from the company’s most relevant areas
of activity as defined in the Materiality Matrix
(p. 14), Fraport is actively targeting all of the
company’s major stakeholder groups. These
include passengers and airport visitors, business partners, potential investors and owners,
the public, politicians, and authorities. Particular attention is paid to neighbors of our sites
affected by aircraft noise and the more than
78,000 employees (as of 2012) at Frankfurt
Airport, the largest workplace in Germany,
including in particular Fraport employees for
whom we are directly responsible. The Fraport
Group also stays in intensive contact with
its main customers, the airlines, in order to
regularly exchange information on a variety of
issues and coordinate operational measures.
We see dialog as an important instrument for
us to obtain suggestions for the strategic direction of the company and indications for risk
management. As a “learning organization”,
we also focus on advancements in science
and technology.

“Of course, airlines are one of our most important customer
groups as an airport operator. In order to always be able
to closely coordinate all relevant operational and strategic
issues, we remain in constant exchange with them. For example, we consult with users on the topic of airport charges
each year. In addition, further working group meetings are
held. An external authority, in our case the Ministry of Economics of the State of Hesse, approves the airport charges
in accordance with Section 19b of the German Air Traffic
Act. This means that we can demonstrate institutionalized
liaisons and a transparent exchange of information with
this group of customers.”

Materiality Matrix
In addition to the internal risk and opportunities management system, the Materiality Matrix
helps us to identify and take account of risks
and opportunities for the benefit of Fraport, or
to avoid impacts as appropriate. The systematic exchange of information with the most
important internal and external stakeholders
enables us to develop perspectives for the
strategic alignment of the company. We
report major opportunities and risks in the
most recent annual report at www.fraport.de
in the “Investor Relations” section.

Organization of sustainability
management

We first developed a Materiality Matrix in
2010. The result was 17 areas of action, which
we developed from all the most important issues for Fraport on the basis of the Guidelines
of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and
in interactive dialog with the most important
stakeholder groups of the company. The matrix reflects Fraport’s broad understanding of
sustainability which is not simply restricted to
environmental factors but also encompasses
economic and community or social aspects.

Fraport sets targets for strategically important
issues and defines the measures necessary
to meet them as part of the sustainability
program. A corresponding program was
developed for the first time in 2010. It is
structured analogously to the areas of activity
of the Materiality Matrix. The content is reviewed and carried on each year, including in

a rise in demand for tourist destinations, the
inclusion of new destinations, more frequent
services, the moderate summer weather in
August 2014, and the booming cruise market
all played a role here. Although strike and
weather-related flight cancellations affected
domestic traffic in particular, destinations
within Germany still grew significantly by
2.1 %. In intercontinental traffic (– 0.5 %),
increases in the flight schedule and the rise in
seat capacity were comparatively low. However, a recovery in traffic in Asia, North Africa,
and North America was observed from August

Despite a number of flight cancellations as a
result of strikes, passenger traffic grew in financial year 2014 and reached an annual high at
almost 59.6 million passengers. This increase
was particularly strong in the months from
May through September, which recorded
significant growth – also due to high tourist
demand. Without the strikes or weather-related flight cancellations, growth in passenger
traffic of around 3.9 % to approximately
60.3 million passengers would have been
possible in financial year 2014.

59.6 million
passengers in Frankfurt in 2014 boarded,
departed or transferred, approximately
1.5 million more than in the previous year.

With a growth rate of 1.8 %, cargo volume
increased moderately in 2014 to about
2.1 million metric tons. Following notable
rates of growth in the first quarter, momentum
slowed in the following quarters. This also
reflected the sluggish development in the
global economy. Chinese traffic proved to be a
significant driver of growth for cargo development in Frankfurt, with a significant increase in
cargo tonnage. The remaining higher volume
countries in the Far East reported declines,
however. Moderate tonnage increases by
1.7 % were achieved on connections to and
from Europe. Business stagnated in highvolume North American traffic.
Due to strike-related cancellations and the airlines’ continuing conservative supply behavior, the number of aircraft movements fell by
0.8 % in the reporting period to approximately
469,000. Without the strike effect, growth of
around 0.5 % could have been achieved. Due
to sustained consolidation measures (use of
larger planes and increase in seat capacity) for
various airlines, the maximum takeoff weights
increased by a further 1.9 %. Had the cancellations not occurred, a higher growth rate of
around 3.0 % would have been possible here
as well. The proportion of transfer passengers
remained high at around 55 % .

passenger growth at the
new Group company in Ljubljana

In the last financial year, passenger figures rose
by just under 40,000 to just over 1.3 million
(+3.1 %) at the airport in the Slovenian capital
Ljubljana. Important reasons for the increase
were more passengers on routes to and from
Belgrade, as well as Tirana.

At Lima Airport, passenger volume increased
by 5.0 % in 2014 to around 15.7 million. Both
domestic (+7.1 %) and international traffic
(+2.7 %) grew in the reporting period. Cargo
throughput increased by 2.0 % to approximately 302,000 metric tons.
The Bulgarian airports at Varna and Burgas
carried more than 3.9 million passengers
in the reporting period, and thus around
119,000 more than in the previous year
(+3.1 %). The Burgas site reported an increase
of 2.0 % to a good 2.5 million passengers.
Varna Airport showed growth of 5.2 % and
achieved just under 1.4 million passengers.

“Our Group companies abroad form an important part of our Group,
which have once again gained in significance in 2014. We have acquired 2 further Group companies in the form of AMU Holdings Inc.
in the USA, which specializes in retail concessions, and the operating
company Ljubljana Airport in Slovenia. Through the acquisition of AMU
Holdings Inc., Fraport AG has established a foothold in the largest aviation market in the world. The market for retail and food and beverage
concessions at airports is developing gradually in the USA; there is a
need to catch up with other countries. Ljubljana is a well-managed
airport with a high proportion of business travelers. Slovenia also
has considerable potential as a tourist destination, which has still to
be exploited. We have also won the contract to operate a total of 14
regional airports in Greece, and expect this to be concluded in late
2015/begin of 2016.
Our portfolio of Group airports is heterogeneous in many respects:
Construction and maturity phases alternate at various sites. Airports
in established European markets – such as Ljubljana – complement
rapidly growing markets such as Xi’an, China. Smaller hubs, for example,
Lima, are also represented, as are mainly tourist airports with major
seasonal peaks, such as Antalya. As a result, our international airport
business is diversified and exploits stable earnings potential as well as
growth opportunities.”

The positive EBITDA development allowed
the Group result to grow by €16.1 million to
€251.8 million in financial year 2014, in the
face of higher depreciation and amortization,
a constant financial result, and higher income
taxes. While the increase in depreciation and
amortization was primarily due to the terminal inaugurations in Varna and Burgas at the
end of financial year 2013 as well as the new
Group companies AMU Holdings Inc. and
Ljubljana, the investment in Antalya was the

main positive highlight of the financial result
and increased its result contribution from
€28.1 million to €38.3 million. A negative
contribution primarily resulted from the market valuation of derivatives (2014: -€8 million
against 2013: +€11 million) and a decline in
the interest result by €5 million. The tax rate
increased from 29 % to 33 % among others
as a result of higher tax provisions. Overall,

Financial position
At the end of financial year 2014, Fraport’s
total assets reached a value of approximately
€9 billion, and were therefore some €196 million
above the level of the previous year. The
reason for the increase was the rise in noncurrent assets. On the liabilities side, the
greatest increase was seen in shareholders’
equity. While the proportion of non-current
assets grew from close to €7.7 billion to
around €8.1 billion on the assets side of the
balance sheet, current assets decreased by
17.6 % to €932 million. The capital expen-

diture at the Frankfurt site and the inclusion
of the new Group companies Ljubljana and
AMU Holdings Inc. were the major reasons
for the increase in non-current assets. The
decline in current assets was primarily a result
of the purchase price payments for the new
Goup companies of AMU Holdings Inc. and
Ljubljana as well as the repayment of financial
liabilities and the distribution of dividends
for financial year 2013. Despite the dividend
payment, shareholders’ equity increased by
€187 million to almost €3.3 billion – due to

the positive Group result. At €4.9 billion, noncurrent liabilities remained almost unchanged
compared to the 2013 balance sheet date.
Lower financial liabilities stood in contrast to
a larger position for deferred tax liabilities.
At €819 million, current liabilities met the
previous year’s level. Slightly higher financial
liabilities were almost entirely offset by lower
trade accounts payable.

Statement of cash flows
In the previous financial year, Fraport generated operating cash flow (cash flow from operating activities) amounting to €506.2 million.
In comparison with the previous year, this was
a considerable improvement of €52.0 million,
which was primarily the result of the positive
development of the operating business and
earnings as well as a lower decline in liabilities.

The positive development of operating cash
flow and lower capital expenditure in property, plant, and equipment and airport operating projects led to a significant increase in free
cash flow, which improved from €34.3 million
to €246.8 million in the previous financial year.

EBIT of €275.0 million, representing an €8.0

Ground Handling
The higher passenger number and the increase in infrastructure charges led to a growth
in revenue by €7.2 million to €656.2 million in
the Ground Handling segment. Whereas personnel expenses rose because of increases in
pay under collective bargaining agreements,
material and other operating expenses fell.
Overall, the segment EBITDA saw growth of
€10.1 million to €44.3 million. A slight decrease in depreciation and amortization led
to a segment EBIT of €7.5 million. Compared
with the previous year, this meant a significant
improvement of €11.9 million.

External Activities & Services
The revenue of the External Activities & Services
segment decreased in 2014 by €18.4 million
to €398.5 million. Adjusted for the recognition of earnings-neutral capacitive capital
expenditure in the Group companies Twin
Star and Lima (IFRIC 12), revenue grew
from €351.2 million in the previous year to
€387.7 million in the period under review.
The reason for the increase in revenue was
largely the positive development in the existing Group companies in Varna and Burgas
as well as in Lima. The newly acquired Group
companies AMU Holdings Inc. and Ljubljana
also led to a rise in revenue. Overall, the
segment EBITDA improved by €11.3 million
to €152.4 million as a result of the positive
underlying revenue increase as well as the
new investments. An increase in depreciation
and amortization led to a segment EBIT of
€84.8 million, thereby equaling the previous
year’s level.

The challenge of
personnel management
Our personnel management increasingly
focuses on sustaining the motivation, health,
performance, and therefore productivity of
our employees in the long term in light of the
changing age structure in the Group. Against
the backdrop of growing challenges such
as international competition in the aviation
industry, the demanding expectations of our
passengers and airlines, and consistent focus
on earnings, the explicit goal is to harmonize the requirements placed on employees
with their personal, professional, social, and
methodological skills as well as their personal
health status. This allows us to guarantee the
high level of quality of our services and to
safeguard attractive jobs in the long term.

Internal training to combat the skills
shortage
In a working environment as specialized as
the management and operation of an airport,
well-trained professionals are necessary. We

therefore offer our employees a varied range
of opportunities for further training. Since
2014, all employees have been able to apply
for support for professional requalification, for
example, via the newly introduced training
budget, provided that this is in the interests
of the company. In addition, Fraport relies
on its own junior staff. We provide training
in 19 commercial and technical units, such
as in IT, mechatronics, and cleaning services.
This is in addition to 8 dual study courses,
including industrial engineering and air traffic
management. In tests by the Frankfurt Chamber of Industry and Commerce, our trainees

through a two-year qualification program in

relationship. Our second project in this area
is called “Ready for Takeoff”, which was
established in 2012, and each year aims to
help up to 14 young people who do not yet
meet all the requirements for direct entry into
training through an eight-month qualification
program. Assuming personal and professional
suitability, the successful graduates then start

Safety takes priority
Fraport guarantees high occupational safety standards. Comprehensive measures
are required in areas such as the handling of hazardous substances, in ground
handling services, in maintenance, in internal transport and traffic, as well as
infrastructural construction measures. This should steadily reduce the number
of work accidents and the resulting days missed due to accidents. We failed to
meet this goal in 2014, when the number of accidents in the Group increased to
1,473 (previous year: 1,342). We analyze the reasons for this in detail and develop
corresponding measures.
not able to fully reach our goal of hiring 110
new trainees each year, despite intensively
searching for suitable applicants.

Promoting health competence from the
outset
Increasing efficiency and flexibility requirements as well as physically demanding activity
in operating units may present issues that
need to be tackled at an early stage. The increasing age of employees presents a further
challenge. By informing our employees about
health-maintaining measures and behavior as
well as designing ergonomic workstations, we
are aiming to stabilize the attendance ratio in
the medium term and increase it in the long
term. In 2014, the ratio amounted to 92.7 %.

In close cooperation with the subsidiary companies, we consistently implement
the relevant statutory occupational safety requirements and also include external
service providers and temporary employees. For example, this concerns the
realization of building projects in cooperation with external service providers.

Focus on diversity
The international orientation of our business
means that daily business at Fraport has been
characterized by diversity since the very start.
We see the different cultural backgrounds,
experience, and language skills of our employees as an opportunity to respond flexibly
and creatively to changing requirements on
the international markets and to benefit from
them. Through our diversity management, we
therefore specifically promote the establishment of diverse teams, among other things.
The guaranteeing of equal opportunities for
different groups of employees is required here
and will continue to form the focus at Fraport
in future. We have recognized the “Charter of
Diversity”, a corporate initiative to promote
diversity in companies and institutions, since
2007. This charter emphasizes the importance
of recognizing and valuing diversity and incorporating it into corporate culture.
By 2018, we aim to increase the proportion of
women in management positions from 24.3 %
(2014) to between 25 % and 35 % within the
Fraport parent company, differentiated by
business, service, and central units.   Specific
training sessions have been directed toward
this goal, for example, our mentoring programs and seminars for female specialist staff
and managers. In addition, we analyzed the
salary development of our female employees
in 2014 in cooperation with the Cologne
Institute for Economic Research. The results

Measuring the mood
Using the “Fraport barometer”, we have been able to determine employee satisfaction in the Group. In 2014, the value increased to 2.89 (2013: 3.02; whereby
1 = very good and 5 = inadequate). The average employee satisfaction score in
the parent company amounted to 3.14 in the previous financial year and was
therefore largely stable compared to the previous year (2013: 3.12). Over 150
individual measures designed to improve employees’ immediate working environments were introduced in 2014. This allowed certain aspects of employee
satisfaction to be improved despite continuing tricky conditions.
Fraport aims to increase employee satisfaction to an average value higher than
3.0 in the long term. Both company-wide and department-specific measures
and their evaluation will contribute to this. From financial year 2015 onwards,
employee satisfaction will be determined by means of an online survey.

an immigration background and German passport.

“I have been working at the airport for 24 years. I came to Germany
from Greece in 1989. A neighbor, who at the time worked in the management office, asked me whether I was interested in a job. I’ve been
here ever since. At first, I worked for Piepenbrock, they changed to Pedus
in 1994 and GCS in 1998 (Gesellschaft für Cleaning Service mbH &
Co. Airport Frankfurt/Main KG). I had no experience in cleaning and
received training. I started off as a special cleaner, and then a driver of
wet floor scrubbers. There, I cover around 22,000 square meters in a
shift – almost the size of 3 soccer pitches. I always work the night shift
from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. Working night shifts pays better than day shifts.
It doesn’t take long to get from my apartment in Raunheim to the
airport on the train. Working conditions are good: I always work inside
the terminal. GCS offers further training and German courses every
year. My uniform is provided and I have a Job Ticket. And they pay
on time – which is not always the case in other cleaning companies.
I also get on very well with my bosses and colleagues. It’s never even
occurred to me to work somewhere else.”

Customers

Prerequisite for our success:
Customer satisfaction
At an international hub such as Frankfurt Airport, we as operator must meet or exceed the
expectations of our various customers every
day. Passengers primarily want an airport
that is easy to navigate, short waiting times,
and clean infrastructure. Airlines demand
seamless, on-time handling on the ground
and flawless interfaces. For cargo customers
and transport companies, short distances, the
best possible connection to different modes
of transport, and the central implementation
of all security measures are crucial. Operators
of shops and restaurants at the airport expect
route planning based on modern infrastructure, which gives passengers easy access to
their product ranges. On behalf of the security
authorities, around 2,000 Fraport employees
and some 700 employees of an external security provider (I-SEC) implement statutory
requirements during passenger, baggage,
and goods checks. We provide attractive areas
in Arrivals for car rental companies. Their cars
are housed in parking areas that are as close as
possible for passengers. In addition, Fraport

cooperates with a number of taxi companies
that use assigned parking spaces directly in
front of both terminals. Regional bus companies benefit from the spacious stops outside
of Terminal 1.

as well as “Home to Gate” – a service that

the atmosphere of the terminal.

service initiative to changing passenger requirements in 2014. In 5 subprograms, we
plan to significantly improve signposting, the

entertainment opportunities. Among other
things, the airport’s provision of Wi-Fi was
expanded in 2014, and the Wi-Fi can now be
used by passengers and visitors free of charge

Frankfurt as a transport hub
The interconnection of various modes of
transport is a further key activity that increases
the attractiveness of Frankfurt Airport. We wish
to further expand the airport’s catchment area
and increase the proportion of passengers
arriving and leaving via public transport. The
combined usage of the ticket and departure
control systems by the modes of transport
involved makes the transfer process easier
for passengers. For example, we offer a
dedicated AIRail terminal for Lufthansa and
Deutsche Bahn’s (DB) AIRail service, in order
to facilitate travel to the check-in counters
there and make it more attractive by providing shorter routes. Since 2014, airlines such
as Air China have been offering a codeshare

agreement with DB for the booking of trains
with flight numbers to Cologne, Dusseldorf,
and Hanover via its global reservation system.
The boarding pass for the flight is then also
valid for the journey via train. For routes to
Saarbrücken, Kaiserslautern, and Strasbourg,
Lufthansa offers daily bus connections that
are also integrated into the three-letter code
system. In addition, coaches regularly connected 20 major cities with Frankfurt Airport in
2014. In order to promote reasonably priced

departure and arrival options for passengers
and to connect the airport with locations that
are not well-connected to the rail network,
Fraport is building a central coach station near
to Terminal 1.

Nighttime flight ban – when planes are grounded
Fraport is fully committed to the results of
the mediation proceedings for the construction of Runway Northwest. This expressly
also includes the ban on nighttime flights
between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. Our ground
handling team, employees in the terminals,
and all technical processes are geared toward ensuring that each and every plane
reaches the takeoff runway on time. However, it is not possible to avoid very late planes
being affected by the nighttime flight ban.
In addition to strikes, inclement weather in
the afternoons and evenings represents the
greatest risk factor here. In the event of heavy
snow, fog, strong winds, or violent summer
storms in the region, flight operations may
need to be discontinued temporarily or the
number of takeoffs and landings reduced.
But there are also other challenges: In 2014,
3 aircraft bombs from the Second World War,
which were found during construction work
on Autobahn 3, in the new airport district
Gateway Gardens and Offenbach offshore
port were responsible for operation stoppage that lasted hours. The places where

the bombs were found were located directly
below the takeoff and landing routes, which
had to be disabled while the bombs were
defused by the bomb disposal team.

Camp beds and toothbrushes
Should the reason for the delay not be within
the sphere of influence of the airline, special
permission* may be requested. Should this
not be granted, passengers must spend the
night in Frankfurt until the first possible takeoff
the next morning. The airlines usually accommodate them in hotels in the surrounding
area. Should multiple aircraft be grounded
and there not be any free beds, we provide
sleeping areas in various parts of the terminal.
In general, passengers do not leave the transit
area and are accompanied into the C/D connecting passage in order to be able to spend
the time before takeoff as comfortably as
possible. Provision stations with small snacks
and drinks are provided here. Camp beds are
set up, and soft covers, sheets, and pillows

are passed out. Some airlines provide their
passengers with vouchers so that they can
eat in the restaurants open around the clock
in the terminals.
The terminal duty manager on duty is responsible for organizing emergency care. Along
with a small team of night-shift employees,
he or she looks after the involuntary overnight
guests and tries to make this unfortunate situation as pleasant as possible. Every passenger
receives an “overnight kit”, which includes
items such as a toothbrush, shower gel, and
a hand towel. Diapers and baby food are
provided for babies. Up to 500 people can
be accommodated in the areas available for
this purpose.

Care team for special cases
In order to support passengers as best as possible in exceptional situations – if
planes cannot take off due to inclement weather or strikes, for example – we have
developed a “hall color concept” for Terminal 1 in conjunction with Lufthansa.
Each color represents a clearly defined ground service process. Our basic assistance team assists terminal operation employees in such special situations. Airport
employees wear colored vests corresponding to the color code in Terminal 1
– or magenta-colored vests in other areas – and help travelers to get to where
they need to be. Further employees form part of the special assistance team.
They provide initial psychosocial counseling for (uninjured) passengers and
people who want to meet them directly affected by aircraft accidents, as well as
catastrophes in vacation destinations, such as the tsunami in the Indian Ocean in
2004 or the Costa Concordia disaster in 2012, as well as pass on information or
important contact details. All teams are part of what is known as the care team,
a component of Fraport’s emergency management. It is made up of around 200
voluntary employees from all units and the subsidiary company Fraport Security
Services GmbH (FraSec). They work beyond their original area of responsibility
to ensure the operation of the airport during emergency and special situations.
They are released from their positions for this purpose as well as for the training
required in advance.

* Special permission for a takeoff between 11 p.m.
and 12 a.m. is granted by the Hessian Ministry
of Economics, Energy, Transport, and Regional Development. The reason for the delay therefore may not
be within the sphere of influence of the airline, and a
technical defect is therefore not sufficient. After midnight, no delayed landings or takeoffs are permitted;
early landings before 5 a.m. are also not allowed.
Exceptions only apply for medically necessary flights,
such as organ transport and emergency landings.

2014 Compact

Pets spend the night in the Animal Lounge
Should a cargo flight be affected, the process
is similar to that for passenger planes. The
airline has to decide whether it will apply for
special permission. Should the plane remain in
Frankfurt, the cargo is generally not unloaded,
wherever possible. The crew travels to a hotel
and, depending on the new flight schedule
and the staff’s resting hours, the flight will
continue the following day. This is not the case
for special cargo. In particular, this includes
live animals and goods that cannot stay in the
aircraft overnight, such as foodstuffs. Should
such cargo be on board, it will be unloaded
again at the instruction of the airline representative and brought to the intended location.
Animals spend the night in the Animal Lounge
at Frankfurt Airport, and perishable goods
are stored in the Perishable Center. At both
locations, we ensure the spatial and climatic
conditions that are required for expensive
racehorses or delicate fruit. This ensures that
the special cargo can be reloaded onto the
plane on the following day and can reach its
destination without incident.

Noise abatement

Reduce noise,

Civil air travel enables global mobility, enables
the fulfillment of a variety of requirements,
and is of fundamental importance for the
economy, both nationally and globally. However, an airport located close to an urban area
means irritation for nearby residents. We are
positioned in a field of tension at our main
site in Frankfurt. On the one hand, we are
responsible for tens of thousands of jobs, the
economic importance of the biggest airport
in the export nation of Germany, and the
prosperity of the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region.
On the other hand, the downside to this is the
noise impact for those sections of the population who live in the region around the airport.
In order to quantify the impact and to verify
the effectiveness of countermeasures, Fraport
has been documenting aircraft noise for the
past 50 years. A total of 28 stationary measuring stations and 3 mobile stations provide
an important set of data for assessing noise

impact in the surrounding areas. Our goal is
to stay below the noise values projected in the
approval procedure for the airport extension
by taking measures within the scope of active
noise abatement. Active noise abatement reduces the noise directly at the source or brings
about improvements along the distribution
pathway. Passive noise abatement is targeted
toward reducing noise at the location where
the noise pollution is experienced. We tackle
this issue by financing building measures
for noise abatement which go beyond the
statutory regulations.

German Air Navigation Services (DFS) and
Lufthansa, are expecting GBAS to make a
major contribution to greater efficiency and
low-noise approach procedures. Up to 49
different approach routes on our 3 landing
runways are supported by just one GBAS
station. This opens up new opportunities
to relieve the burden on heavily populated
areas. In order to use the system, aircraft must
have the relevant equipment in addition to
the technology on the ground. In 2013, this

Active noise abatement
1

Creating breaks in noise
Thanks to the DROps procedure, heavily burdened residential areas are
provided with relief at particularly sensitive times. Takeoffs on certain runways or routes are bundled together to achieve this.

2

Flying around urban areas
In order to lighten the burden on as many areas as possible, takeoffs and
landings have been optimized or reorganized. This is also supported by
the installation of a satellite-assisted, precision ground-based augmentation
aid to enable higher and quieter landing approaches.

3

Flying higher
Downwind approaches are raised from 3.0° to 3.2°. Noise is reduced
through the raised gliding angle.

4

Flying more quietly
Noise-based fees for takeoffs and landings create incentives to use quieter
aircraft.

Passive noise abatement
5

Passive noise abatement measures include the conversion of windows,
shutters, roofs, walls, and the installation of fans. The implementation of
the potential measures depends upon the structural requirements of the
property.

In the form of MAR, DFS has been testing a
further approach procedure at Frankfurt Airport since 2014. This abbreviation stands for
“modified arrival routes”. The new procedure
involves the raising of minimum flight altitudes
before and in the first part of the northern
and southern downwind approach routes by
up to 2,000 feet (approximately 600 metres).

in the form of the “noise breaks model” is
expected to be introduced into trial operation
in April 2015. This should facilitate relief from
noise during the night through the alternating use of runways – including for landings.
However, operational or infrastructural requirements may also lead to the suspension
of the procedure.

One problem – many solutions

Measuring the influence of flight noise
On behalf of Gemeinnützige Umwelthaus GmbH (UNH) in Kelsterbach, a
subsidiary of the Federal State of Hesse, experts have been investigating the
effects of traffic noise since April 2011. The NORAH (Noise-Related Annoyance,
Cognition, and Health) study is financed by the Federal State of Hesse, local
communities, Deutsche Lufthansa, UNH, and Fraport AG. As part of the third
module, the impact of aircraft noise on the reading abilities of children was determined – independent from other factors such as the socio-economic status
of parents or quality of education. This study found that aircraft noise has a low
but discernible influence on reading performance, which is nonetheless within
the national average. A direct effect of aircraft noise on abilities prior to reading,
such as listening comprehension, was not found.
Overall, children and parents assess the health-related quality of life and well-being
in the region as very high. The study found that children in all of the locations
investigated feel well, are healthy, and are happy to go to school. This also applies
for children in areas with comparatively high aircraft noise. However, teachers
stated that aircraft noise does affect classes. Over a third of children at such
schools sometimes have difficulty understanding their teachers. The study did not
consider the fact that Fraport has been further developing and expanding active
and passive noise abatement in conjunction with its partners since the data was
collected in 2012. The new knowledge obtained from the NORAH study is now
being used to narrow the focus of the various measures even further.

Further information can be found online at
www.fraport.com/sustainability under
“Aircraft noise abatement”.

Who is offended by aircraft operations complains about aircraft noise. Each day, around
7,250 complaints are received as part of
Fraport’s neighbor dialog. 95 % of these are
automatically generated verification requests,
i.e. they are automatically sent online by a
piece of software. The rest is sent personally
– usually via email. Fraport deals with each
individual message and also investigates conspicuous flights on its own initiative. All questionable aircraft movements are compared
with the values from noise measurement
points and with flight plan depictions from
German Air Navigation Services (DFS), where
required. Should prescribed flight routes not
be complied with, for example, we pass on
the information to the aircraft noise protection
officer of the Hessian Ministry of Economics,
Energy, Transport, and Regional Development
(HMWEVL). Route precision and altitude are
also verified here. In addition, it is determined
whether noise-reducing takeoff and landing
approaches at Frankfurt Airport have been
complied with. If the pilot has acted incorrectly, DFS applies for summary proceedings
at the Federal Aviation Office.
The employees on the noise abatement team
handle queries regarding passive noise abatement. The goal of this is reducing the noise
level within buildings by means of structural
measures. Fraport has comprehensive statutory obligations for some 86,000 households
at the Frankfurt site. These are located in a
specific noise abatement area, giving them
a defined entitlement to submit claims for
passive noise abatement measures, which has
been determined by Hesse State Government
in accordance with the most stringent noise
abatement regulations. We comply with the
full scope of these claims. Furthermore, we
have joined with the Hesse State Government
in setting up a Regional Fund that provides
between €265 million and €270 million to
finance further measures.
A consequence of the expansion of Frankfurt
Airport by Runway Northwest is the introduction of additional takeoff and landing routes.
Owners who bought or constructed a property before the zoning decision and whose
house or apartment lies within the approach
flight path of the new landing runway are
particularly affected by this. Fraport has therefore launched the Casa program and offered
compensation payments to the owners of residential properties in Raunheim that are on the
flight path of particularly low-altitude flyovers
(i.e. less than 350 meters). Fraport also offered
to buy residential properties in certain areas

2014 Compact

in Flörsheim and Kelsterbach, where aircraft
approach the new Runway Northwest at an
altitude of less than 350 meters. In 2012, we
expanded the scope for the purchase option
to include transition zones as part of the “Alliance for More Noise Abatement 2012”. The
volume of measures was increased to over

€100 million for this purpose and the application deadline was extended to the end of

3 questions for Manfred Ockel
> Mayor of Kelsterbach
> Board member of the Aircraft Noise Commission

in the Airport and Region Forum
> Member of the Administrative Board of Gemeinnützige
Umwelthaus GmbH (Environment and Neighborhood House
Kelsterbach)

Why are you committed to noise abatement?
Mobility is an important driver of our economy and a basic human
need. However, traffic does cause many problems that harm people
and the environment. Air traffic plays a major role in the Frankfurt
urban area. Due to the extent of the traffic, noise abatement is a social
responsibility for me. That means that all parties involved are required
to cooperate. As representatives of cities and local communities, it is
therefore our responsibility to work together on this task in order to
strike a comfortable balance between mobility and noise abatement.
The utmost goal must be ruling out potential health risks.

What do you bring to the numerous committees?
First of all, committee work in the “Aircraft Noise Commission” as well
as in the “Airport and Region Forum” and especially in the “Active
Noise Abatement expert group” makes it clear that noise abatement
is a highly complex issue. Simple solutions are hard to find, however.
I therefore find it important to take a deep breath when it comes to
noise abatement; continuously address issues and problems, support
and motivate the relevant actors from air traffic control, airlines, airport
operators, and the authorities to develop suggestions and solutions to
reduce noise pollution from air traffic.
How do airport neighbors and citizens of Kelsterbach benefit from
your commitment?
This is a tricky one to answer, and it’s hard to achieve anything on your
own when it comes to noise abatement. But I do believe that we have
managed to increase the significance of noise abatement in Frankfurt
overall over the past few years. Frankfurt has played a pioneering role
in many issues surrounding active noise abatement. We can see this in
the requests we receive from other airport sites that want to find out
about developments in Frankfurt. Even if these efforts are not always
perceptible to the residents, I still see the opportunities and possibilities
offered by committee work to reduce noise pollution for the people living
around Frankfurt Airport.

Environment

Energy-efficient
climate protection
Around 2 % of the CO2 emissions caused
by humans worldwide are ascribed to civil
aviation by the International Energy Agency.
In contrast to air carriers – i.e. the airlines
– airport operation itself only makes up a
very minor proportion of this. Responsibility
for the rise in average temperatures on the
earth has been attributed to the increasing
concentration of CO2 and other greenhouse
gases in the atmosphere, with recognized
drastic consequences for humans and nature.
Even the smallest measure helps to reduce
CO2 emissions and therefore protect the
environment and our living spaces. Even at
an international air traffic hub such as Frankfurt Airport, small measures can allow many
thousands of tons of the greenhouse gas to
be saved. Using energy efficiently, reducing
consumption, and therefore making a contribution to environmental protection has been
important to Fraport for some time. In figures,
this means reducing the CO2 emissions that
Fraport AG itself is responsible for by 30 % per
passenger or 100 kg of cargo at the Frankfurt

aircraft on the ground. Alternative drive technologies will be tested. The scope ranges from
aircraft tow tractors with diesel-electric hybrid
drives to purely battery-powered pallet loaders
for plane loading, as well as electric vans and
even solar-powered airstairs. In addition, a total
of 21 electric cars were included in employee
car pools. A photovoltaic facility integrated into
the facade of the Fraport corporate headquarters provides power for the electric vehicles
parked in the car pool there.

Energy management in terminals,
buildings and facilities
Our plans for energy costs in our terminals are ambitious. The increase in energy
efficiency in the operation of the terminals, buildings, and equipment is crucial for
achieving this goal – around 86 % of the CO2 emissions at Fraport AG stems from
these areas. That is why we have gradually been replacing the air-conditioning
systems in Terminal 1 since 2007. By 2020, we will have exploited the majority
of the total savings potential of Fraport AG for this period at 5,500 metric tons
of CO2. The energy optimization of service and administrative buildings saves
around 4,000 metric tons of CO2. Further energy-saving methods include usage-dependent control of terminal lighting, the use of LED lamps in the cargo
handling hall of the subsidiary Fraport Cargo Services, and the optimization of
the 80 kilometer-long baggage conveyor system. Energy consumption here has
been lowered in a number of ways including by reducing the frictional forces
generated by the belts, using more efficient drives, and partially shutting down
some parts of the conveyor system when there is no baggage to transport.
Following the conclusion of the measures in 2018, we expect savings of 2,000
metric tons of CO2 emissions from the baggage conveyor system.

Red de-ices, green protects
The Fraport investment company N*ICE Aircraft Services & Support GmbH
(N*ICE), a joint venture of Fraport and Servisair, which is responsible for deicing aircraft, uses a mixture of propylene glycol and various proportions of water
in order to de-ice aircraft. The red liquid removes ice and snow from surfaces
and control elements, and the green liquid provides the aircraft with refreezing
protection, which, depending upon the outside temperature and potential
rainfall, lasts until takeoff. When it is very cold and the lead time of the refreezing
protection has expired, the protection must be reapplied. In order to give even
further consideration to environmental concerns, N*ICE has been applying the
innovative N*ICE Advanced De-Icing System (NAD) from all 58 vehicles since
winter 2012/13. With separate tanks for water and de-icing agents as well as a
modern mixing system, the mixture used for de-icing and anti-icing can be adjusted to the prevailing conditions depending on the temperature. Fraport uses
a potassium formate in a dosage corresponding to the weather conditions to
de-ice flight operating areas at Frankfurt Airport. All agents biodegrade quickly
and comply with strict environmental requirements.

Use rainwater, save groundwater
The operation of a large airport results in high
water requirements as well as a large quantity
of wastewater. When handling the precious
commodity of water, Fraport observes all
aspects of modern water management. This
concerns not only water consumption but
also the quality of the water that is introduced
into the ecosystem via the airport area. Using
over 550 groundwater measurement points at
Frankfurt Airport and in its immediate vicinity,
we monitor the quality of the groundwater
and ensure compliance with prescribed
threshold levels in conjunction with the
authorities.
The drinking and service water network at
Frankfurt Airport is 130 kilometers in length
in total. Drinking water is sourced from the
Hinkelstein well system, located around 3 kilometers to the north of the airport. We acquire
service water from rainwater treatment facilities in CargoCity South, in Terminal 2, as well
as at Pier A-plus, in addition to from our own
groundwater wells and treated water from the
Main River. We use it in sprinkler systems, toilet
flushing systems, and to irrigate green areas.
The service water supply system in CargoCity
South has been extensively expanded. In the
north, Terminal 2 is already supplied with
service water, while 70 % of Terminal 1 and
the neighboring office buildings have access
to this supply. Comprehensive supply to all
areas is planned to be finished by 2016.

We do not merely want to replace drinking
water with service water, but also use water
in a fundamentally frugal way. The greatest
savings achieved to date have been consistent
use of water-saving techniques in wash basin
fittings and toilet flushing. In technical areas,
water is saved through methods such as the
use of circulation systems in vehicle washing
systems.

300 kilometers of channels for sewage and
rainwater
Fraport operates 2 separate sewer systems
for wastewater and rainwater. This allows us
to avoid the overloading of water-treatment
plants in the event of heavy rainfall. The waste
water system has a sewer length of approximately 100 kilometers and contains wastewater from toilet facilities, canteens, restaurants,
vehicle washing systems, plane toilets, and
water used to clean aircraft. Wastewater from
the northern section of the airport is purified in the water-treatment plants in Frankfurt-Sindlingen and Frankfurt-Niederrad. In
the southern section of the airport, Fraport
operates its own water-treatment plant. A
further 200 kilometers of sewers collect the
rainwater from the apron, aircraft positions,
de-icing pads, roads, parking spaces, and
roofs, for example. It flows through a number
of safety facilities and filer systems and is then
led into the Main River, the Gundbach River,
or infiltration systems.

Over the past 14 years, the proportion of
service water in Fraport AG’s overall water
consumption at Frankfurt Airport increased
from 11 % to 24 % in 2014, and in 2011
and 2013 to as high as 25 %.

Active for the region

At the Frankfurt site, Fraport feels a particular
commitment to the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region. That is why we support regional children
and youth projects, initiatives for people with an
immigration background, ethnic minorities, and
the socially deprived, among others. Fraport is
particularly active in places where associations
and voluntary organizations are dependent
upon help in order to carry out their work. We
have been providing financial support for many
different social, sports, and cultural projects in
the region around Frankfurt Airport under our
motto “Active for the Region” for many years.
The so-called “Neighborhood Framework”
forms the geographical limit for our sponsorship activities. The corresponding area has
increased as new flight routes have come into
operation. In 2014, we supported more than
1,600 projects of various clubs and associations,
with donations or sponsorship amounting to a
total of €5.2 million.

we support not only the Bundesliga teams but
also young talent, as well as projects promoting
motor skill development and the social integration of children.

Creativity in the “Children’s Art Club”
In the areas of culture and education, Fraport
supports initiatives such as the Rheingau Music
Festival and the Weilburger Castle concerts.
Through long-term partnerships with some
of Frankfurt’s cultural institutions, including
Städel Museum, Schirn Art Gallery, and the

Recreation in urban areas
The provision of funding for the RhineMain
Regional Park is a contribution from Fraport to
building up a relaxation and adventure environment in the middle of an urban cityscape.
Different features have been gradually melded
together over the years, connecting up the
landscaped areas, historic gardens, monuments
of industrial culture, and parks in a network of
paths and trails. In addition, this local recreational area enhances the leisure value of the region.
Visitors can discover the Frankfurt area on foot
or by bike. The “Fraport Regional Park Open”
mobility festival has taken place yearly since
2012. In 2014, the focus was on cycling mobility
and therefore on the question as to what role
bicycles will play in the future in the urban and
recreational space of the Rhine-Main area. The
RhineMain Regional Park has been sponsored
using resources of the Environmental Fund,
which Fraport has used since 1997 to support
environmental conservation projects, research,
and environmental educational projects. Since
the Environmental Fund was established, more
than 850 projects have been sponsored with
funds adding up to nearly €35 million.

Parcels for children in Hungary and Romania
For a number of years, Fraport employee Helmut Hofmann has traveled to
children’s homes in Hungary and Romania to offer his help. Traditionally, Fraport
employees send parcels to children in orphanages, facilities for the disabled, and
poor families in the 2 countries each year at Christmas time. In 2014, a total of
7,025 parcels was sent, not least thanks to the participation of the employees of
the Hesse Broadcasting Service and ZDF, Kaltenhof workshops for the disabled,
as well as some day care centers and schools in the region. Hofmann took the
Christmas parcels to the children on a number of trips. Fraport paid for the gas
required and provided some of the vehicles. On his trips, Hofmann was often
accompanied by other Fraport employees, including members of the Executive
Board.

The many aspects of responsibility
Frankfurt Airport is a leading international air
traffic hub. The Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region
has very high locational quality and an excellent transport infrastructure. This is particularly
important for companies which depend on
global networking. 5.5 million people living
in the metropolitan area around Frankfurt also
benefit from this. They enjoy the advantages
of traveling a short distance to the airport
when they go on holiday, and a lot of people
work for companies that benefit from their
close proximity to the airport.
Airlines, logistics companies, and not least
passengers appreciate the airport for its
central location in the heart of Europe. High
demand has led to more international and
international destinations being served here
than from many other airports worldwide.
Its role as a hub plays a crucial role here: As
connections to the entire world are very good
here, airlines offer additional flights to new
destinations. More than half of air passengers
transfer to another flight in Frankfurt.
The airport’s role as a hub makes it an attractive
cargo shipment terminal. Around half of the
over 2 million metric tons of cargo transported
each year are carried in the hold of passenger
aircraft. Cargo shippers take advantage of the
extensive connection options at Frankfurt
