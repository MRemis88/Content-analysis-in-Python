About this report

"Act responsibly. Enable sustainability.“ is the title of our latest CR
report. We chose this title to emphasize our commitment to sustainable
activity along the entire value chain and to highlight the potential that
our products and services hold when it comes to addressing environmental, economic and social challenges.
Deutsche Telekom has been involved in CR reporting for 20 years. The
CR report is a central communication tool for keeping our internal and
external stakeholders informed of the challenges we face and the progress we have made as a responsible company committed to sustainability. The latest report focuses on the key activities and developments
for the period from March 2015 to February 2016 as well as the targets
we have set for the future.
Reporting period, scope of application and
target groups
We report all relevant events and activities that took place between
March 1, 2015, and February 29, 2016. All quantitative data and
indicators, however, refer to the 2015 calendar year. Any deviations
are marked accordingly. The 2015 CR Report is a Group report that
includes many national companies in which Deutsche Telekom holds
a majority stake. This report also ties in with the 2014 CR Report.
The current report specifically addresses Deutsche Telekom's stakeholders. These include analysts and investors, CR ranking and rating agencies and NGOs as well as customers, employees, business partners and
representatives from the worlds of business, science, research, education and politics.
20 years of CR reporting at Deutsche Telekom
Deutsche Telekom has been reporting on its sustainability activities
in various publications since 1996. From 2003 through 2006 we published a combined annual HR and Sustainability Report. An interim report
issued in 2007 formed the transition to our current CR reporting. Since
2008 the Telekom Group has been publishing a comprehensive CR
Report each year.
Online report: Focus and context
We have been publishing our CR Report exclusively online since the
2010/2011 reporting year to meet the increasing requirements and
changing user preferences of our stakeholders. The online 2015 CR
Report has been available since May 17, 2016 in German and English.
Interest in our CR report is high. This can be seen in many ways including the fact that more than 2,600 people accessed our report even in
March 2016, one month after the current reporting period had ended.

The start page highlights how Deutsche Telekom's products and solutions can contribute to sustainability (e.g., added value, savings effects
and improving efficiency). In order to clarify the dimensions involved
here, we have related the impact of our products and services to what
happens every second. This is followed by three Deutsche Telekom
employees sharing their experiences on data privacy, M2M solutions
and Deutsche Telekom's involvement in refugee aid activities. Sarah
works to guarantee a secure network in the Cyber Defense Center;
Cornelia accompanies farmers along the road to digitization; Tamim
from Afghanistan works at a T-Shop. Other essential content of the
CR report is also introduced briefly on the start page in the context of
how each topic contributes to sustainability every second, guiding our
readers to the different sections of the report.
The initial pages of each section start with an introduction and an overview of the key events and developments on that topic. The subsequent
pages are structured as follows:
 Sustainability relevance: This explains what makes the topic
significant to sustainable development and to Deutsche Telekom's
long-term business success.
 Management approach: This section starts with an overview of the
key goals, measures and monitoring activities summarized in a
table. It then goes on to explain how Deutsche Telekom approaches
key sustainability topics, what its goals are and how it intends to
achieve them. The management tools, policies and guidelines used
to this end are presented, internal and external standards listed and
the latest organizational developments explained.
 Progress: Examples demonstrate how Deutsche Telekom has
contributed to positive development in the the reporting period and
worked to prevent or reduce negative impacts.
The report also includes information on "CR facts" as well as special
pages for investors and rating agencies. These provide background
information on a variety of topics that can be accessed directly from the
text via links. Readers can also access the "CR facts" section at any time
by clicking in the footer. A download area, search and dialog functions
and an interactive benchmarking tool make it even easier to navigate
the report. Moreover the info cart lets readers select different content
and create a customized PDF file.
This year we will again be publishing a CR brochure on selected areas
in which we made progress during the reporting period. We have been
using the regularly published We Care app magazine to get a broad
target group interested in corporate responsibility and motivate them to
participate.

additional souRces foR cR-Relevant content
in addition to the 2015 Cr report we also use our Annual report and
our data privacy and data security report to provide information on our
corporate responsibility. we also report on deutsche Telekom's current
Cr activities on the deutsche Telekom group's website under the heading, Corporate responsibility. The national companies provide information about their Cr commitment on their internet portals and in their
own publications.
we have added links to other internal and external websites in order to

provided by our national companies on their profile pages in the 2015
Cr report, for example.

selection of key topics foR the 2015 cR RepoRt
we conducted a multi-stage materiality process to help us identify
material issues to be addressed in the report. The process is a regular
component of our annual Cr reporting activities that helps us identify
the topics with maximum relevance for us and our external stakeholders.
stRuctuRe of the cuRRent RepoRt
The online 2015 Cr report has been structured as a progress report.
it focuses on the essential developments during the reporting period,
which are discussed in five central reporting sections. we incorporated
the networks section from the 2014 Cr report into the Customers and
products section in the 2015 Cr report because our network expansion activities are particularly relevant to our customers and our network
infrastructure forms the basis of our products and services. readers can
access the different sections using the navigation bar:

assuRance engagement
selected kpis in the 2015 Cr report from germany as well as from our
national companies T-hT hrvatski Telekom (Croatia), magyar Telekom
(hungary), oTe and Cosmote (greece) and T-mobile usA were the subject of an assurance engagement by auditing firm pricewaterhouseCoopers (pwC).
based on the guidelines of the internationally recognized gri-g4 (core)
standards published by the global reporting initiative, all of the indicators marked in the gri content index have been reviewed by an independent auditing firm. The independent assurance report can be found
under the assurance report menu item. All reviewed content of this
report is marked with the symbol and will remain effective until the
next Cr-report is published.
implementation of high inteRnational RepoRting standaRds
deutsche Telekom’s 2015 Cr report complies with the guidelines
(g4 core) of the global reporting initiative (gri). it also serves as a
Communication on progress (Cop) from deutsche Telekom as part
of the united nations global Compact. The global Compact Cop
provides an overview of specific measures used to put global Compact
principles into practice. deutsche Telekom also publishes an extensive
annual declaration of conformity regarding the german sustainability
Code.

About this report
independenT AssurAnCe reporT

independent assuranCe report

independent prACtitioner’s limited AssurAnCe report
to deutsche telekom Ag, bonn
we have been engaged to perform a limited assurance engagement
on selected sustainability information marked with a symbol in the
Corporate responsibility report of deutsche Telekom Ag, bonn (hereafter the “Company”) for the period from 1 January to 31 december
2015 (hereafter “Cr report”).
management’s responsibility
The Company’s management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Cr report in accordance with the criteria as set out in
the g4 sustainability reporting guidelines of the global reporting initiative (gri) (hereafter the “gri-Criteria”) and for the selection of the
information to be assessed.
This responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate
methods to prepare the Cr report as well as the use of assumptions
and estimates for individual sustainability disclosures which are reasonable in the circumstances. furthermore, the responsibility includes
designing, implementing and maintaining systems and processes
relevant for the preparation of the Cr report, which is free of material
misstatements due to intentional or unintentional errors.
Audit Firm’s independence and Quality Control
we have complied with the german professional provisions regarding
independence as well as other ethical requirements.
The audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional
standards – in particular the professional Code for german public
Auditors and german Chartered Auditors (“berufssatzung für wirtschaftsprüfer und vereidigte buchprüfer“: “bs wp/vbp”) as well as the
joint opinion of the wirtschaftsprüferkammer (Chamber of german public Auditors; wpk) and the institut der wirtschaftsprüfer (institute of public Auditors in germany; idw): requirements to quality control for audit
firms (“gemeinsamen stellungnahme der wpk und des idw: Anforderungen an die qualitätssicherung in der wirtschaftsprüfer-praxis”: “Vo
1/2006”) – and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding
compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
practitioner’s responsibility
our responsibility is to express an opinion on selected sustainability
information marked with the symbol in the Cr report based on our
work performed.
within the scope of our engagement we did not perform an audit on
external sources of information or expert opinions, referred to in the
Cr report.

we conducted our work in accordance with the international standard
on Assurance engagements (isAe) 3000 (revised): “Assurance
engagements other than Audits or reviews of historical financial
information” published by iAAsb. This standard requires that we plan
and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance
whether any matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe
that the sections marked with in the Cr report has not been
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the gri-Criteria.
in a limited assurance engagement the evidence-gathering procedures
are more limited than for a reasonable assurance engagement and
therefore significantly less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable
assurance engagement. The procedures selected depend on the
practitioner's judgement. This includes the assessment of the risks of
material misstatements in the Cr report with regard to the gri-Criteria.
within the scope of our work we performed amongst others the following procedures:
 obtaining an understanding of the structure of the sustainability
organization and of the stakeholder engagement;
 inquiries of personnel involved in the preparation of the Cr report
regarding the preparation process, the underlying internal control
system and the selected sustainability information;
 examination of selected quantitative information for following
international group companies:






oTe A.e, greece
Cosmote mobile Telecommunications s.A, greece
magyar Telekom group, hungary
slovak Telekom, bratislava, slovakia
T-mobile us, usA

 Analytical procedures on selected information of the Cr report;
 Comparison of selected sustainability information with corresponding data in the consolidated financial statements and in the group
management report ;
 Assessment of the presentation of selected sustainability information regarding the sustainability performance;
 gaining further evidence for selected data of the Cr report due to
inspection of internal documents, contracts and invoices/reports
from external service providers.

Conclusion
based on our limited assurance engagement, nothing has come to our
attention that causes us to believe that the sustainability information
marked with the symbol in the Cr report of the Company for the
period from 1 January to 31 december 2015 has not been prepared,
in all material respects, in accordance with the gri-Criteria.
emphasis of matter – recommendations
without qualifying our conclusion above, we make the following recommendations for the further development of the Company's sustainability
management and sustainability reporting:
 further development of the indicator-oriented system for the groupwide steering of the Cr strategy and of the respective reporting
based on esg kpis. for this purpose, we recommend a periodic
review of the esg kpis regarding their coverage of core topics as
well as the continuation of their group-wide implementation.
 further standardization of reporting processes on esg data and
esg kpis in the national Companies as well as formalization of the
respective internal controls system.

Statement by the Chairman of the Board of Management

Statement by the Chairman of the
Board of Management
"Our business revolves around people"
Machine-to-machine communication, M2M, gives companies growth
perspectives. But how does it impact people and the environment?
M2M gives companies tremendous optimization potential while helping
to conserve resources at the same time. M2M makes work processes
more efficient, enhances peoples' lives and protects the environment.
We help everyone at the Port of Hamburg, for example, from logistics
companies and port operations managers to truckers, get the freight
to its destination faster, more direct and with a smaller carbon footprint.
What needs to happen to keep Europe's industry a technological
world leader?
Availability and network speed need to be the main focal points. In
2015 the number of high-speed broadband connections we provide
in Germany grew in the double-digit range. We rely on connectivity
combined with responsibility in these activities. More data shouldn't
mean higher energy consumption and CO2 emissions, which is why
the energy efficiency of our networks and data centers is so important.
More data traffic means higher security risk.
What do you do to keep people's personal information safe?
Deutsche Telekom stands for the highest data privacy standards
worldwide. We offer our customers particularly secure data centers,
emphasize end-to-end encryption and make sure that data travels from
the sender to the recipient using the shortest route possible, preventing
detours into other jurisdictions.

Timotheus Höttges, Chairman of the Board of Management, Bonn, Germany

With this publication, you are specifically asking people to engage
in dialog about Deutsche Telekom's corporate responsibility.
Why?Sharing thoughts and feelings with others is what people do –
and our core business, digital communication, revolves around people.
Digitization will change our society. We should talk about it so that we
share responsibility for how we work, live and treat the environment.
This publication gives people a reason to start.

What does digitization mean to our society when it comes to jobs
and social security systems?
Initially, a lot of good. Digitization means new jobs that are more
meaningful and involve less manual labor because it creates more flexibility. Many jobs, for example, can be done from anywhere on earth. But
in the medium to long-term we could see increasingly intelligent machines and robots taking over more jobs than are being created. Human
labor will also play a lesser role when it comes to productivity. If that
happens, we will need to think about our social systems. We shouldnâ't
think of tools that today seem useless as automatically unviable in the
future, e.g., the concept behind having a universal basic income.
You work resolutely to push digitization.
What are your main areas of focus?
We invested more than four billion euros in 2015 in areas such as highspeed fiber optics and state-of-the-art transmission technology, and we
are switching our fixed network over to IP technology with the goal of
creating a pan-European network by 2020. In the area of mobile communications, we were a leader in the LTE (4G) breakthrough throughout
Europe and are currently working on 5G technology with transmission
rates of 10 Gbit/s.

Statement by the Chairman of the Board of Management

Not everyone is excited about the digital revolution.
How does Deutsche Telekom address peopleâ's concerns?
Digitization affects all areas of our life including the question of to what
extent machines will take over tasks currently being done by people. It's
normal to have concerns. We can address many of these concerns by
providing sound information and demonstrating that everything revolves
around people, even when it comes to smart machines.
What does corporate responsibility mean to you personally
in terms of digitization?
A very important point is looking at the possible consequences of
digitization . We need to find answers when it comes to opportunities
and risks. And, in the end, this development needs to be a positive one
for society as well as for our own business interests. However, we can
only achieve digital responsibility by working together in society. And
Deutsche Telekom does much more than just take on responsibility for
digitization. We also work to protect human and employee rights in the
supply chain as well as the climate and environment and engage in responsible corporate governance practices. With this in mind, I would
once again like to underline our commitment to the principles of the
United Nations Global Compact and the German Sustainability Code.

Strategy & management
Values and Guiding Principles

Values and Guiding Principles

Corporate responsibility (CR) is based on shared values. We communicate our fundamental values to our employees within the scope of our
binding Guiding Principles as a way to effectively integrate these values
into our corporate culture. According to our pulse survey in November
2015, 69 percent of employees feel that the Guiding Principles are
being applied in day-to-day work (previous year: 70 percent).
The Code of Conduct and our Social Charter provide additional tools
that we use to guarantee responsible conduct at the Group and among
our partners. Our compliance management system, which makes sure
that our business activities are in compliance with laws and regulations,
is based on these documents.
6th Guiding Principles Day: Best place to perform
and grow
Deutsche Telekom held its sixth Group-wide Guiding Principles Day on
September 24, 2015. All of our employees were called upon to think
about the Guiding Principles and come up with ideas on how to
implement them in day-to-day work. The focus was on Guiding Principle
no. 4: Best place to perform and grow. Each year on Guiding Principles
Day employees at numerous Deutsche Telekom locations worldwide
participate in activities revolving around our corporate values.
For example, employees discussed innovative, agile work methods at
a shared Guiding Principles Day event, which was held in Bonn and
Budapest and broadcast digitally. Under the slogan, "Create the best
place to perform and grow," around 400 employees engaged in discussions in workshops and at open-space sessions at Group Headquarters
for instance. Chief Human Resources Officer Christian Illek and expert
Niels Pfläging set the tone with their presentations. The numerous
employees who attended the event contributed 29 papers containing
ideas on the topics of agility and corporate culture.
Code of Responsible Conduct for Business
Deutsche Telekom was among the first to sign the German Code of Responsible Conduct for Business, which was presented to the public in
November 2010. All of the members of our Board of Management signed the code, making an express commitment to responsible corporate
governance in line with the principles of the social market economy, to
fair competition, cooperation with employee representatives, business
excellence and sustainability. We have incorporated this commitment
into our governance principles and have assumed a leading role in putting our commitment into practice.
The code asks that we engage in sustainable business practices and
responsible corporate governance for the good of the people. Deutsche
Telekom consistently addresses these requirements in its core business

and along its supply chain and takes responsibility for its employees
and in society. We work to guarantee respect for human rights without
exception.
Our products and services connect people and increase the productivity
of numerous processes, helping make Germany and Europe effective
in international competition and promoting prosperity. Our smart, digital
solutions create new ways to effectively address social challenges
such as climate change and to simplify our lives for the long term. Our
network is the backbone of our efforts: fast, reliable, secure and accessible to everyone. These efforts, just like all of our activities, are focused
on people. We provide transparent information on our plans and technologies, engage in fair practices and are always open to dialog.
In line with the code, we also continue to expand our leading position
as a sustainable company as well as our ongoing efforts to optimize
our value-added processes. We are making our networks, products and
services more energy and resource-efficient and reducing the environmental impact and carbon footprint of our business activities. In 2014
our Board of Management approved a Group-wide climate protection
target for 2020. Based on this target, we developed an integrated
climate strategy in 2015 with the aim of further improving the energy
and resource efficiency of our networks, services and products. We
also offer our customers sustainable products and services and encourage our over 30,000 suppliers to do business with an equal focus on
sustainability. To assist this process, we engage in various activities
such as a systematic supplier development program, audits and prequalification measures. In these efforts – just like in everything we do involving our diverse stakeholders – we primarily rely on partnership and dialog.
As a responsible employer we give our employees the opportunity to realize their potential and to contribute their individual strengths and ideas
within our Group. In view of the increasing significance of digitization, we
promote virtual collaboration and new forms of work. We are increasingly turning to digital learning methods when it comes to training and
skills development. A good example is our MagentaONE course offer,
which provides information on our new rate plans. Dealing with big data
and IT security are two more key topics for which we continue to expand
our digital course offers. 30 percent of all formal learning hours in our
Group are now in digital format, and the trend is rising. Our
Telekom Social Network, for example, offers new forms of collaboration.
In the network, we pursue open dialog and productive exchange with
our employees. Our Group-wide ideas management activities are a key
tool in encouraging employee involvement. Twelve ideas were submitted
in 2015 for every 100 employees, the highest participation rate ever
recorded.

Our social commitment, however, is not just to our customers, partners
and employees. We feel it is our responsibility to support the development of media skills in our community and help young people become
more confident. Our efforts in this area include the Teachtoday initiative,
which promotes safe media proficiency. In 2015, over 4,900 school students took part in our media obstacle course in Germany, for instance.
We have also been involved in the "Yes, I can!" initiative for several years
now. Since 2009 this initiative has given more than 75,000 children and
young people from disadvantaged backgrounds an opportunity to learn
key skills for an independent and confident life.

CR strategy

Deutsche Telekom aims to be the leading telecommunications provider
in Europe. This corporate vision is the basis for our approach as a responsible company (CR approach) and our CR mission, which is:

The CR unit and the HR LT are advised and supported by the CR Board
when it comes to CR management and strategy enhancement.

We take responsibility. We enable sustainability...
… in our processes
… with and for our employees
… for our customers
… in society
Our Group CR strategy also provides our national companies with a
framework for their sustainability measures. This strategy revolves
around our three CR action areas:
 Connected life and work – enabling a sustainable lifestyle
 Connecting the unconnected
 Low-carbon society
They provide a framework for the focal topics of our sustainability
management activities regarding data security and data protection,
digitization, sustainable supply chain, human rights, circular economy,
resource conservation and a responsible employer approach. Our
CR program states which specific goals we wish to achieve with which
measures. We monitor our progress using key performance indicators
(KPIs).
An integrated governance structure helps us to closely interlink strategic
management and operational implementation of our CR strategy
throughout the Group. Overall responsibility for sustainability lies with
the Deutsche Telekom Board of Management.
Current organizational structure
As a driver of transformation at our company, the CR unit is part of
Group Transformational Change & Corporate Responsibility (GCCR).
GCCR, which directly reports to the Member of the Board of Management responsible for Human Resources, is charged with advancing our
corporate culture with a focus on innovation, individual responsibility,
entrepreneurship, and social responsibility.
Another pillar of our CR governance structure is the HR Leadership
Team. The team is an advisory and decision-making body for the
Human Resources (HR) Board department. It is made up of managers
reporting directly to the Board Member for HR and makes decisions
regarding Group-wide policies and guidelines, CR positioning and the
strategic focus of the CR department.

The CR managers from the different business units and national companies are responsible for operational implementation of the CR strategy.
They collaborate intensively within the international CR Manager Network where they coordinate their activities and share best practices.
CR Policy: international roll-out continues
Our CR Policy provides the mandatory framework for the sustainability
management activities at all Group units. After rolling out the policy at
Group Headquarters, Telekom Deutschland and T-Systems in 2014,
we introduced the policy at other major European national companies
in 2015, including OTE in Greece, Magyar Telekom in Hungary, Hrvatski
Telekom in Croatia and T-Mobile Poland.
Certified health, safety and environmental
management system: nearly all workplaces covered
98.5 percent of our employees outside of Germany work at offices and
facilities covered by our certified health, safety and environmental (HSE)
management system. These results put us just short of our goal of
having all national companies outside of Germany with more than 50
employees certified by the end of 2015. We use internal and external
certificates (see diagram) and are going to have more companies certified in 2016, putting certification at 100 percent.
The HSE management system calls for systematic planning, implementation and optimization of operational processes in the areas of health,
safety and environment. This promotes the health of our employees and
has a positive effect on their performance. It is also beneficial when it
comes to bidding on new projects since an increasing number of potential customers now require their suppliers to provide HSE certificates.

got together in small groups to discuss topics such as shared crisis
management, handling environmental impacts and working on international projects. Work on these topics will start in 2016. The second day
of the meeting focused on communicating international sustainability
activities to the public.
One example of the commitment of our national companies was their
response to the refugee crisis in Europe. All international CR activities
conducted during the reporting period can be found in the section on
national companies.

CR Controlling helps steer our activities
Deutsche Telekom's CR controlling system plays a key role when it
comes to steering our CR activities. It has been supported by an ITbased data collection system for the past six years. The system guarantees transparent reporting on ESG (environmental, social, and governance) data and KPIs. It supports standardized, mandatory processes at
the Group and national level and enables Group-wide benchmarks. This
IT support gives us additional capacities to conduct extensive analyses
of ESG data. It makes it easier for us to assess whether we have achieved our CR targets.
We especially use ESG data to calculate our ESG KPIs, which we use to
measure and steer our CR performance throughout the Group CR Controlling is also responsible for recording our other sustainability indicators. In 2015 we added new indicators in the areas of energy consumption and emissions: A number of our national companies are already
using the interactive benchmarking tool to report on the share of renewable energy they generate themselves as well as the electricity and
heating energy they purchase. We have expanded our recording activities for Scope 3 emissions; most of our national companies are now
reporting basic data that can be used to centrally calculate Scope 3
emissions. This data includes Scope 3 emissions from business trips,
hotel accommodation, commuting and using products and services. As
of our 2015 CR Report, we began reporting this basic data and the
Scope 3 emissions calculated from it in our interactive benchmarking
tool.

Our contribution to the Sustainable Development
Goals
On September 25, 2015, the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development along with 17 Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs). These goals are based on the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) and will be effective as of January 1, 2016, for a 15-year
period.
Information and communication technology has the potential to contribute to each goal. It can help achieving the goals faster, e.g., through
connected agriculture.
Deutsche Telekom supports the SDGs, for example as part of several
initiatives such as the UN Global Compact. The following overview
illustrates our contribution to achieving the goals and refers to specific
examples from the current CR Report. In some areas this contribution
is especially significant. They are: Good health and well-being, quality
education, gender equality, decent work and economic growth, innovation and infrastructure, reduced inequalities, responsible consumption
and climate action. We highlighted the respective lines in green.
Overview: Our contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals

Achieving more together: international
collaboration
How can international corporations put sustainability strategies into
practice across borders? Deutsche Telekom employs CR managers for
the relevant business segments and national companies to reach this
goal. Through the CR Manager Network, CR managers have been attending regular face-to-face and online meetings since 2008 to share ideas
and promote essential CR topics.
In 2015, one of the questions addressed by the CR Manager Network
was how CR managers can cooperate more efficiently and work in
closer collaboration across borders. In line with this topic, the 15th CR
manager meeting, which took place in Poland on November 23 - 24,
2015, was held under the slogan "Achieving more together." Internal
cooperation was at the top of the agenda on the first day. Participants

ESG key performance indicators

ESG key performance indicators

The ESG KPIs help us steer our CR activities. We use them to systematically improve our performance and include them in our Annual Reports
due to their relevance in generating added value. For the purpose of
integrated financial and sustainability reporting, the KPIs map the six
types of capital addressed in these reports and therefore also reflect
the essential aspects of the sustainable value of our company (see diagram).

It is mandatory for all Deutsche Telekom national companies that participate in the data collection process to record the Group-wide ESG
KPIs. These represent 99 percent of the Group's net revenue.
We are able to provide an updated value for the Employee Identification
with CR Commitment ESG KPI in this report, having conducted our
employee survey, which provides the required information, in 2015. The
next survey is scheduled for 2017.
As of this report, we will only be reporting on the Used Cell-Phone Collection ESG KPI based on the new definition. The reference parameter
used to calculate the ESG KPI was changed during the previous year
from "number of customers" to "number of cell phones in circulation."
We conducted successful pilot tests of new ESG KPIs to measure the
effectiveness of our social commitment (Community Investment, Beneficiaries and Media Literacy) in the previous year and then included them
as a permanent part of our ESG KPI set. Our stakeholders responded
particularly well to the focus on effectiveness and clear relevance of the
Media Literacy ESG KPI to our core business. The PwC audit company
also conducted an independent assurance engagement of the three
new ESG KPIs, initially for Germany.
We launched an internal pilot project at the end of 2015 to push the
revision process for the Energy Consumption ESG KPI. The model
currently favored is to stop using revenues as a reference value. The
relationship between revenues and energy consumption is not direct
enough and is subject to a number of different factors such as regulation, competition and market saturation.

ESG KPIs
In order to steer its CR performance, Deutsche Telekom uses eleven
ESG key performance indicators (ESG KPIs) that apply throughout the
Group:











Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) ESG KPI
Sustainable Procurement ESG KPI
CO2 Emissions ESG KPI
Energy Consumption ESG KPI
Used Cell-Phone Collection ESG KPI
Community Investment ESG KPI
Beneficiaries ESG KPI
Media Literacy ESG KPI
Social Commitment ESG KPI
Employee Identification with CR Commitment ESG KPI

All ESG KPIs will be systematically reviewed in 2016, just like they were
last in 2014. We will be analyzing any need for adjustment based on
changing internal and external general conditions. Key internal criteria
are the relationship to our core business and strategy, but also steering
relevance, i.e., the question to what extent the ESG KPIs can help us
effectively assess the success of key sustainability topics. External factors such as SRI ratings, the United Nations' Sustainable Development
Goals and implications taken from other general guidelines are taken
into consideration as well.We also expect the significance of impact
measurements both at and outside our company to grow. We have been
conducting these types of measurements with our Media Literacy ESG
KPI, for example.There are also plans to expand our Sustainable Procurement ESG KPI since we achieved and even exceeded the target associated with this KPI in 2015. We will involve our national companies in
the review process right from the start. When the German and international CR managers meet at the CR Managers Meeting in spring 2016, the
ESG KPI review will be on the agenda. Similar to the last review, an inter-

Deutsche Telekom - Corporate Responsibility Report 2015

Strategy & management
CR strategy
ESG key performance indicators

nal pilot test of the new KPIs will be conducted and these will be
in-corporated into our regular data processes based on the results.
The new KPIs will then be gradually included in our external reporting
activities.
ESG KPI reporting in the Annual Report
We also report on selected ESG KPIs in the Deutsche Telekom Annual
Report. Forecasts on the further development of three ESG KPIs
(Energy Consumption, CO2 Emissions and Sustainable Procurement)
according to German accounting standard DRS 20 are also included in
the report. We reviewed the forecasts made in the 2014 Annual Report
for our 2015 Annual Report.

30

The trend in the Social Commitment ESG KPI reflects the German
public's growing expectations of our company's social commitment,
whereas Deutsche Telekom's performance receives the same rating
as the previous year. Public expectations of our commitment have increased significantly – influenced primarily by the issue of refugees, which
is the subject of heated public discussion at present.
We use the Employee Identification with CR Commitment ESG KPI to
determine the degree to which our staff identify with, or how satisfied
they are, with our CR commitment. It is based on our Group-wide employee survey, which is carried out every two to three years.
Evaluation of the survey showed a marked upward trend in both areas.

As expected, the figure for the Energy Consumption ESG KPI decreased
in the reporting year compared with 2014, a trend that is even stronger
than anticipated. As revenues increased, electricity consumption
throughout the Group remained stable, and actually fell in Germany, in
2015. In view of the lightning rise in worldwide data traffic and the continuing network build-out, this stable trend is a success and has only
been possible due to the progress we have made in energy efficiency.
We had assumed there would be a slight decline in the CO2 Emissions
ESG KPI for 2015, i.e., a slight improvement. This is consistent with the
actual trend, which is in particular due to the aforementioned stable
development in electricity consumption and the slight fall in emissions
from fuel and natural gas consumption. In the case of the Sustainable
Procurement ESG KPI, which stands at 78 percent, we actually exceeded the target forecast for 2015. In 2016 and 2017, we expect these
ESG KPIs to develop as follows:
 Over the next two years we expect our Energy Consumption ESGKPI
to fall, i.e., a positive development. This trend is based on the ratio
between the slight savings in power consumption and increasing
revenues. We expect the reductions in power consumption in particular as a result of our network migration to IP technology in Germany, improved network utilization in general, and the consolidation
of T-Systems data centers in various countries. These savings are
expected to be partly counterbalanced by the expansion of T-Mobile
USA and the accompanying rise in electricity consumption.
 The developments in electricity consumption are also the main
drivers of the trend in our CO2 emissions. We therefore also expect
our CO2 Emissions ESG KPI to fall slightly in 2016 and 2017. Our
expectation for the Group units participating in the climate protection target is that, in 2020, CO2 emissions will lie 20 percent below
the rate of the base year 2008 (excluding T-Mobile USA).
 In the coming years we expect our Sustainable Procurement ESG
KPI to rise slightly above the figure achieved in the reporting year.

Strategy & management
Sustainable Finance

Sustainable Finance

Companies that rely on sustainable business practices are more competitive in the long term, which is why investors who are interested in sustainability tend to focus on long-term yields instead of short-term profit.
Socially responsible investment (SRI) can be an important
component when it comes to securing capital for Deutsche Telekom AG
in the long term.
SRI investment products consist of securities from companies that have
passed an audit conducted in accordance with environmental, social,
and governance (ESG) criteria. This is why the development of demand
for T-Shares from socially responsible investors serves as an indicator
for assessing our sustainability performance. With our Socially Responsible Investment ESG KPI we measure how the financial markets
perceive our CR activities. Investors concerned with sustainability often
refer to ratings published by specialized SRI analysts. For this reason
the rating given to our company by SRI analysts has an impact on our
ability to win over and retain socially responsible investors and achieve
our goal of keeping our company's medium and long-term cost of
capital at a low level.
We use different formats – both in our reporting as well as in direct dialog – to inform SRI analysts and investors of our CR activities.
Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) ESG KPI
At the end of 2015, around 21 percent of T-Shares were owned by
investors who consider SRI criteria in their investment decisions at least
to some extent. Two percent of T-Shares were held by investors who give
priority to SRI aspects when managing their funds. Increasingly, our
efforts toward more sustainability and social commitment therefore pay
off in terms of reputation.
Investor communication expanded
We have been publishing relevant Deutsche Telekom ESG KPIs in our
Annual Report for several years now, also providing forecasts regarding
their future development. Financial market players interested in sustainability can also review ESG information in the Socially Responsible
Investment (SRI) section of our investor relations portal. Interested
parties can also find additional information on these topics in the SRI
facts info box provided as a supplement to this CR report.
In addition to our reporting activities, we also engage in targeted dialog
with investors. Our CR and Investor Relations (IR) units, for example,
conducted joint SRI roadshows on the topic in June and December
2015. They also held special conference calls to keep interested investors informed and responded to numerous direct requests for information made by analysts and investors, covering the entire spectrum of
ESG criteria, from climate protection and human rights to data privacy
and diversity.

Current position in rankings and ratings
Deutsche Telekom's ESG (environmental, social and governance) performance is assessed within the scope of CR ratings, which provide
investors with valuable information for their investment decisions. As in
previous years, the T-Share was once again listed in important sustainability ratings in 2015. We appeared in RobecoSAM's DJSI World and
DJSI Europe Index for the first time since 2012. In addition, rating
agency oekom singled us out as the world's best telecommunications
company in terms of ecological and social performance in 2015. A top
score of 100 points can be achieved in the CDP Carbon Disclosure Leadership index. We improved slightly once again from 98 to 99 points,
thereby gaining a firm foothold as industry leader for the DACH region
(Germany, Austria, and Switzerland). We were also listed as industry leader in the Carbon Performance Leadership Index in 2015. The STOXX
Global ESG Leaders Index listed Deutsche Telekom for the
fifth year in a row. During the last financial year we ranked 2nd in the
telecommunications industry and 3rd among all German companies
in the ranking conducted by rating agency Sustainalytics, on which this
index is based. Once again, our share was listed on the FTSE4Good
index and the UN Global Compact 100 index in the reporting year.
Integrated reporting
More and more people are recognizing the significance of CR for a
company's core business. This can also be seen in the international
trend toward tighter integration of financial and non-financial reporting.
Sustainability aspects that are very important to corporate added value,
such as environmental protection, employee needs and sustainable products, are being included in traditional management reporting.
Deutsche Telekom has been working on integration in its annual report
for several years now. These efforts can be seen in the increasing inclusion of CR topics in central business processes such as procurement,
product development and innovation. In this context, we are also working on a more standardized format for reporting on our company's
financial and non-financial performance. This is in line with SRI investor
expectations, and our efforts received the Econ Award for Corporate
Communications in 2015. Our report received Gold in the Annual
Report category in 2014. One decisive factor in the jury's decision was
effective integration of the topic of sustainability.
Various sections of our Annual Report make reference to how sustainability contributes to value creation in our corporate processes. We have
been reporting on our ESGKPIs in our Annual Report since 2011. Additional qualitative trend forecasts for the following two financial years
have been included for our Energy Consumption, CO2 Emissions and
Sustainable Procurement ESG KPIs since 2013. As a result, we were
once again in a position to compare forecasts and actual KPI trends in
our 2015 Annual Report and in this year's CR Report. Further information on this can be found in the ESGKPIs section.

To further push integration, we evaluated sustainability topics in this
year's materiality process based on their significance for the success of
our business. In addition to assessing their impact on sales and revenues, we analyzed their influence on the efficiency of our business processes, employee productivity, our ability to innovate and improving our
reputation. As a result, we identified 18 sustainability topics that are
highly significant to the success of Deutsche Telekom's business. These
topics were integrated even more tightly into key sections of our Annual
Report.
Tax policy guidelines
The Group Tax department is responsible for ensuring that the Deutsche Telekom AG Group pays taxes and duties at national and international level in accordance with the applicable statutory provisions. This
involves utilizing the scope available for optimizing taxes on the one
hand, and living up to the social responsibility of a multinational company on the other.Group Tax makes sure that the Deutsche Telekom
Group complies with all its tax obligations in Germany and abroad, in
particular that it pays the taxes in accordance with the local laws and
regulations applicable to the individual Group entities. This includes
the Group's income taxes, which must also be regularly reported in
our IFRS financial statements, as well as VAT and income tax on salaries
payable within the context of customer transactions and for Group
employees. Group Tax also ensures that the corporation has an efficient
tax structure within the framework of German and foreign tax law as
applicable in each country, i.e., that the Group does not carry any unnecessary tax burden. The goal is to achieve sustainable tax efficiency for
the Group, something in which transparent, reliable cooperation with
local tax authorities is deemed to be indispensable.
In addition, Group Tax also has the ambition to contribute as much
as possible to the success of Deutsche Telekom's operations, e.g., by
providing detailed tax advice regarding new business models or innovative technological developments. In such matters, the department is
particularly focused on immediately clarifying any unresolved tax
law-related issues as well as providing practical solutions to meeting
all applicable tax requirements.

Added value and materiality

Which sustainability topics are relevant for our revenue development,
capacity for innovation and reputation? Which topics matter to our
stakeholders, including our shareholders, customers and employees
as well as the public? In what areas and in what ways do our business
operations impact society and the environment? Being familiar with key
economic, environmental and social issues is fundamental to our success in these areas, which is why our materiality process is not solely
based on our own perspective but also takes into account the opinions
of our stakeholders.

The fixed-network business encompasses all voice and data communications activities based on fixed-network and broadband technology.
This includes the sale of terminal equipment and other hardware, as
well as the sale of services to resellers. Our mobile communications
business offers mobile voice and data services to consumers and business customers. When marketing these services, we also sell mobile
handsets and other hardware. In addition, we sell mobile services to
resellers and to companies that buy network services and market them
independently to third parties (mobile virtual network operators, or
MVNOs). Drawing on a global infrastructure of data centers and networks, our corporate customer arm, T-Systems, operates information
and communication technology (ICT) systems for multinational corporations and public-sector institutions. As illustrated in the diagram, our
Group consists of four operating segments. The 2015 Annual Report
provides more in-depth data regarding our business development.

Materiality process better tailored to ICT
requirements
Every year we identify which topics are the most material in defining
Deutsche Telekom's sustainability management and sustainability
reporting focus from the perspective of our stakeholders as well as from
an internal corporate perspective.
We structured this materiality process in 2015 in accordance with the
methods defined by the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI). The
GeSI analysis covers 55 topics that are material for the ICT industry.
These can be placed in nine categories: digital inclusion, employee relationships, climate change, circular economy, sourcing and manufacturing, customer relationships, privacy and freedom of expression, governance, and local community and environment impacts. The advantage
is that, by switching our materiality process over to the GeSI method, the
process is now even more focused on our core business as an ICT service provider.
For internal purposes we included all 55 topics in the weighting process. To map the stakeholder perspective, we first needed to compare
the results of the earlier stakeholder survey with the aspects defined by
GeSI.
Internal workshop identifies material aspects for the success
of our business
At a workshop that we held on November 11, 2015, experts from different Deutsche Telekom departments including Human Resources, Innovation and Communications, looked at 55 topics and identified those
that have the largest impact on five main value drivers behind business
success from a corporate perspective. These value drivers were also
adopted from the GeSI method (a link has been added to examples of
material aspects):
 Technology and innovation: Increasing customer demands for
secure, encrypted services mean that topics such as data security
and cyber security are among the primary drivers behind innovation.
 Revenue growth: With network expansion, Deutsche Telekom can
tap new markets and access new customers. High service quality is
decisive for customer satisfaction and has a direct impact on customer acquisition and customer loyalty. Customer inquiries regarding
sustainable products are still limited in number but continue to
grow, which is why this topic has been identified as an important driver.
 Business operations: Which topics have a positive impact on
business processes or help reduce costs? These include excellent
employee involvement and basic standards such as data security,
service quality, stakeholder engagement and compliance.
Deutsche Telekom - Corporate Responsibility Report 2015

Strategy & management
Added value and materiality

 Employee relationships: The following topics have considerable
impact on employee satisfaction and productivity: talent acquisition,
retention, development and staff reduction, employee involvement,
employee health, safety and wellness and employee diversity and
anti-discrimination. Having a service-oriented corporate culture (service quality), ethical business practices and transparency also have
a favorable impact on employee relationships.

34

Material topics for a sustainable development
Topics were rated as "very relevant," " relevant," "less relevant" and "not
relevant" at internal workshops and in the stakeholder survey. We then
transferred the weighting over to a 100-point scale. All topics that earned more than 60 points in the materiality process both from a corporate perspective as well as a stakeholder perspective are considered as
very relevant and therefore material. These are depicted in the diagram
below. You can find the overall results here.

 Reputation: High service quality and transparency as well as extensive reporting strengthen trust in Deutsche Telekom. In contrast,
topics such as business practices, privacy and supply chain labor
standards can also pose risks to our reputation. Having our brands,
products or services portrayed negatively in the media in connection with these aspects can significantly damage our reputation.
Ongoing survey weighs topics from stakeholder perspective
To help us identify which aspects are most material for our stakeholders,
we assessed the results of our ongoing online stakeholder survey from
the period from December 17, 2014, through December 7, 2015. The
survey covered 74 aspects. The assessment was based on evaluations
submitted by 312 people:
 125 customers
 121 employees and potential employees or employee
representatives
22
analysts and investors

7
participants
from the worlds of science, research and education

5
NGO
representatives

 5 suppliers
 2 representatives from regulatory authorities and political
decision-makers
25
participants who associated themselves with none of the

groups mentioned
In order to be able to compare the 74 topics from the stakeholder survey, we matched them with the 55 aspects based on the GeSI method
as far as possible. For 21 of the GeSI aspects none of the topics from
the previous year's survey were an adequate match. In these cases we
only took internal weighting into consideration. This can be particularly
attributed to the different logic used by the surveys. Our previous surveys were more specifically targeted at assessing the approach, e.g., a
distinction was made between different internal and external management tools. The GeSI method, however, primarily differentiates between
factual aspects. We recently revised our stakeholder survey in line with
the GeSI method. It includes weighting issues, performance assessment
and open questions. Feedback from our stakeholders during the
reporting period can be found here.

Stakeholder management

Companies are constantly balancing the expectations of a variety of stakeholders when managing their business. That is why a company's success depends on recognizing the interests and demands of its stakeholders and meeting and addressing these whenever possible and reasonable. Stakeholders also expect to be kept informed of how companies
are responding to their demands. Deutsche Telekom goes even further
by actively surveying its stakeholders and involving them in its management processes.
Engaging in dialog with our stakeholders helps us identify trends early
on, which fosters our innovation processes (click here for current
examples). At the same time, this strengthens existing alliances and
creates new opportunities for partnerships. This is particularly important in terms of our sustainability targets, which we can only achieve in
collaboration with partners from the worlds of politics (political advocacy), society, science and research, and industry.

Guaranteeing stakeholder engagement
We systematically encourage stakeholder engagement in our corporate
activities. In 2011 we developed a strategy for stakeholder engagement
in order to manage our various activities throughout the Group. The strategy is based on the three AA1000 Principles developed by the NGO
AccountAbility: materiality, inclusivity, and responsiveness.
We have defined three types of stakeholder engagement: Information,
dialog and participation. These are based on six principles for interacting with stakeholder.

Petition: MagentaMobil Happy
In February 2016, our MagentaMobil Happy offer was discussed in
social media. In a petition addressed to Deutsche Telekom, we were
asked to withdraw this option - as it supposedly supports the accumulation of smartphones that are no longer being used. We would like to
address these concerns.

Why do we have this offer?
We provide our customers with solutions that meet their expectations.
Several market surveys have shown that there are customers who want
to always have the latest end device. The offer is targeted at these customers. It is safe to assume that customers will find a way to fulfill this wish
regardless of what Deutsche Telekom offers. Just like our offer for this
target group, we also offer plans directed at other target groups. Customers can always opt out of receiving a new smartphone and switch to a
cheaper plan instead.
What we do:
We take our economic and social responsibility just as seriously as our
environmental responsibility and try to promote resource awareness
among our customers. This is shown by the examples below:
 In cooperation with Deutsche Umwelthilfe e.V., we have been raising
general public awareness of conservative use of valuable resources
such as gold, silver, copper and platinum with our used-cell phone
collection campaigns for more than 13 years. In order to simplify the
collection of used cell phones and smartphones, we have created
the Handysammelcenter online collection portal. Since introducing
the program in 2003, Telekom Deutschland has helped conserve
resources by reusing or recycling more than two million used cell
phones in cooperation with our partners Teqcycle and Deutsche
Umwelthilfe e.V. Our used cell-phone collection process has been
certified by DEKRA for secure data deletion. Depending on the condition of the device, the collected cell phones and smartphones are
reused or properly recycled in line with environmental standards.
Telekom Deutschland donates any profit generated to Deutsche
Umwelthilfe e.V and has thus supported more than 770 environment
and nature conservation projects to date.
 Another one of our offers is called "Don't buy, rent". This offer leads
to prolonged average utilization periods of routers and media receivers. If a customer decides to cancel the service, they return the
device, which is then either repaired and reused or properly recycled.
What our customers can do:
If a customer opts for a new device, they can, for example, give their
previous smartphone to a family member or friend, extending the
device's operating life. This extension of the device's life has a favorable
impact on its carbon footprint. Anyone who does not wish to continue
using their high-quality used device - whether a tablet or a smartphone can exchange it for a voucher at any Telekom Shop with our "Handyankauf" cell-phone trade-in service. Users can get an estimate of the value
of their device online in advance. If the device is not suitable
for reuse, it can be turned in at any Telekom Shop or at a local public
collection point for proper recycling. You can find a map of these
collection points here. End devices should on no account be disposed
of in domestic waste as that would mean losing valuable resources.
In order to convince the general public of a sustainable lifestyle, we
provide useful tips and tricks on green surfing and energy-conscious
driving in our "We care" app magazine. The app can be downloaded
for free from iOS and Android stores.

Stakeholder involvement

The type and extent of our stakeholder engagement is based on the
results of a case-related relevance analysis. The more relevant a stakeholder group is to the topic or project concerned, the more intensive stakeholder engagement can be. Depending on the intensity, we make a
distinction between three types of engagement: information, dialog, and
participation.

into the process. The collaboration resulted in a matrix containing clear
criteria on what must and what may be implemented, which we use as
a basis for selecting projects for our social commitment activities. These
projects must be relevant to society, i.e., promote confident use of ICT
img, contribute to solving social issues or effectively reach a large number of people.
We use this list of criteria to make sure that our commitment activities
reflect our core expertise more accurately, are in line with our compliance standards and also sets us apart from the competition in terms
of our project activities.

Telekom Social Network – information, discussions
and raising awareness
The Telekom Social Network (TSN), puts an end to e-mail ping pong.
Employees can share and jointly work on content on Deutsche
Telekom's largest communication platform. The platform was introduced four years ago and more than 100,000 employees currently
take advantage of it in their everyday work.
More and more people are discussing CR projects and their enhancement on TSN. In the CR group, the CR department provides information
on its latest initiatives and progress, e.g., concerning our supplier development program. It also uses the platform to get employees involved:
2015 was dedicated to refugee aid. TSN made it possible for us to reach
a large number of people in a short time, organize campaigns such as a
charity run and put employees who would like to help with interpreting,
for example, in touch with the respective contacts.

Focus on social commitment
We reviewed our approach to social commitment and our respective
portfolio of measures in 2015. Our goal was to further align our activities with our CR approach and core expertise while at the same time
being flexible enough to cover a wide range of issues.
In addition to six Deutsche Telekom Group departments (Group Corporate Responsibility, Group Communication, Group Strategy, Investor
Relations, Sponsorships, Human Resources Development), participants
included members of the Deutsche Telekom Stiftung foundation and of
the non-profit consulting company Phineo gAG. This guaranteed that
different perspectives, both internal and external, were incorporated

In the second half of 2015 alone, CR group content was viewed more
than 12,000 times. In addition, many TSN groups post the latest information on sustainability issues and aspects, for example on how shutting down old technology saves energy and protects the environment.
Impressing customers with "wow" products
Which products can we introduce to create the best customer experience? In order to answer this question, we invited 60 customers to the
Telekom Design Gallery – our future forum at our Group Headquarters
in Bonn – to evaluate five new products in January 2016. The 60
customers were selected based on market research results. We had
previously asked international design agencies to develop a "wow"
product in cooperation with our Telekom Design department: a product
that delights our customers and makes their lives easier. The agencies
presented their innovative products to customers and the Deutsche
Telekom design team. One example was a digital pin board: Post-its,
notes and photos analogously attached to the pin board are automatically digitized by a camera and transferred to a tablet.
The invitation to our T-Gallery was the kick-off event for our monthly
Telekom Design Customer Labs. We invite customers to these Customer
Labs to ask them to assess the concepts created by Telekom Design
and other departments.

Involvement in product labeling
In March 2015 the Deutsche Umwelthilfe environmental organization
and Telekom Deutschland jointly held an expert discussion with important stakeholders on the topic of labeling mobile communication
devices as sustainable. In addition to several NGOs, representatives
from the German Federal Ministry of the Environment, scientists and
other telecommunications companies also took part in the event. The
NGO "Forum for the Future" used this opportunity to present its Eco
Rating model. Eco Rating aims to illustrate a number of sustainability
aspects involved in smartphones to enable customers to make a comparison between different devices. At the end of the discussion it was
very clear that the stakeholders are very critical of any environmental
labeling primarily initiated by the industry. A credible environmental
labeling concept requires the establishment of an independent expert
board, e.g., Environmental Label Jury, which can determine and continue to adapt the relevant criteria.

We Care – new issue of app magazine published
In January 2016, the third issue of our We Care app magazine was
published under the heading "mobility." This issue contains information
on why bicycles are going online and shares some simple tricks that
help reduce fuel consumption and protect the environment.
We Care has been providing useful and entertaining information on
the topic of sustainability since 2014. The latest issue explains how long
it takes for a tree to restore the CO2 imbalance generated by a single
flight from Bonn to Berlin and how tablets for doctors can facilitate
hospital stays. The We Care app magazine is available for free at the
App img Store for all Android and iOS smartphones and tablet PCs.
The latest issue of the app magazine had already been downloaded
around 70,000 times by the end of March 2016.

Telekom Deutschland GmbH, supported by Deutsche Umwelthilfe, also
uses product labeling for its fixed-line phones from independent institutions advised by expert bodies. Deutsche Telekom is the only company
to have its fixed-line phones certified by the Blue Angel environmental
seal.
Round-table discussion on more sustainable
products and rate plans
In June 2015, Telekom Deutschland GmbH, together with representatives of Deutsche Umwelthilfe environmental organization, Germanwatch
and the Verbraucherzentrale North Rhine-Westphalia consumer organization among others, hosted a round-table discussion on how to make
products and rate plans more sustainable. Guests exchanged views with
product and rate plan managers at Telekom Deutschland, focusing on
means of using resources more efficiently in the production and operation of information and communications technology.
Telekom's commitment in collecting and recycling used cell phones
was praised. At the same time, participants expressed their expectation
that Telekom do more to promote the principles of the circular economy
in the ICT img sector in the future.
Sustainability workshop with young journalists
A sustainability workshop with young journalists was held in July 2015
on the initiative of the econsense business forum in cooperation with
the school of journalism, Deutsche Journalistenschule. At this workshop,
Deutsche Telekom and three other companies answered critical questions from future journalists. The journalists were then invited to deepen
their insights at a company event the following day hosted by Deutsche
Telekom at the Munich Innovation Center. The students had the oppportunity to find out about energy-efficient data centers and special climate-friendly customer solutions. Their experiences from the workshop
and the company event were used for their degree theses, in this case
radio broadcasts.

Political advocacy

The political sector and regulatory authorities influence the development and availability of the network infrastructure, technologies and
services. This directly impacts the competitiveness of telecommunications companies as well as business in general, which relies on having
a fast network infrastructure as well as state-of-the-art telecommunications services. Networks and services are also of considerable importance for maintaining a sense of community in society, which is why we
engage in active, ongoing dialog with all interested stakeholders from
the spheres of politics and society.
Instruments
Our partners from parliaments, governments, and non-profit organizations need to uphold their independence and integrity. This principle is
codified in Deutsche Telekom's Guiding Principles. Donations to political institutions, parties and political representatives are not allowed,
for example. Instead, we place importance on factual communication,
competence, credibility and integrity. As a result, politicians and stakeholders feel that the information we provide is authentic and credible
and refer to this information when forming their own opinions. Deutsche
Telekom is registered in the official transparency register for lobbyists in
Brussels. Within the context of our collaboration efforts in associations
and other bodies, we feel that we are under the obligation to comply
with all ethical codes and legal provisions.
Investment incentive needed for broadband networks
Having a high-performing, reliable and secure broadband infrastructure
is the basis of success for all business sectors and is a key factor in
making a business location attractive. Deutsche Telekom has been
investing extensively in infrastructure for fixed-line and mobile Internet
for years, making a considerable contribution and showing more
commitment than any other company to providing full-area coverage,
particularly in rural areas.
In view of the ambitious broadband goals at both the national and
European level, the main purpose of telecommunications and regulatory policies needs to be improving planning security and, in particular,
the financial power of companies willing to invest in the market. This
is the only way to fully tap private network build-out potential using
all available technologies. In areas where broadband roll-out is not
economically feasible, it is up to the public sector to develop technology
and provider-independent incentive programs to help finance these
efforts. Forward-thinking regulatory policies need to actively support
investment in modern broadband networks and prevent unnecessary
financial burdens and red tape for the network operators investing in
networks.

Regulatory intervention needs to be restricted to proven market failure
to keep it from unnecessarily limiting innovation. Open access must be
embraced as a basic principle so that competition and free choice for
consumers are guaranteed in connection with all network build-out projects.
In view of the fact that the Internet and telecommunications market are
converging rapidly and in light of the growing market power of a few global Internet players, sector-specific regulation of telecommunications is
creating more and more of an imbalance. The same laws and regulations that apply to telecommunications companies also need to apply to
Internet companies providing the same services. The objective here
must be to create equal competitive conditions and enable fair distribution of the financial burden involved in broadband build-out.
Protecting the open Internet
As part of the EU telecoms package, regulations on network neutrality
were adopted at EU level and went into effect on April 30, 2016. The
new regulations particularly address permitted traffic management,
once again raise transparency requirements and limit commercial product and service differentiation on the Internet.
Deutsche Telekom remains committed to preserving an open Internet.
Content and services will continue to be available online in accordance
with the best effort principle, meaning they will be available to the extent
permitted by the available resources. Deutsche Telekom will continue to
expand and optimize its infrastructure so that we are able to cope with
rapidly increasing amounts of data traffic and constantly upgrade our
network. This is the only way for us to meet our customers' increasing
demands and live up to the requirements of online content and application providers who also want to provide their services in high quality in
the future. However, telecommunication networks cannot be operated
without an effective network management system.
That is why Deutsche Telekom is developing business models based on
the "best effort" Internet principle that online businesses can use to offer
innovative services that pose specific demands on transmission quality
and quality of service. This will include managing the rapidly growing
volumes of different types of data streams in the net. Content will in no
way be controlled. Deutsche Telekom supports the freedom of the Internet and does not influence user or provider content in any way. Deutsche Telekom will continue to take a non-discriminatory approach to
marketing services with different quality-of-service levels in competition
with other network operators. This gives consumers greater choice and
guarantees a high quality level.

Consumer dialog
One of Deutsche Telekom's aims is to become the most highly regarded
service company in the industry. That is why we again gave high priority
to consumer-related topics in 2015.
Main topics included:
 Maintaining consumer data privacy, for example in the online advertising business,
 Improving comprehensive, cross-technology protection of young
people at national and EU levels (in particular by advancing a
comprehensive, Group-wide minimum standard within the EU and
ongoing dialog with organizations involved in the protection of
minors both nationally and at EU level)
 Improving customer service standards,
 Improving consumer protection in telecommunications, e.g., when
switching providers for fixed-line and mobile connections
 and our efforts to provide better transparency for our customers.
Deutsche Telekom once again made progress in 2015 in regard to switching fixed-network providers - both internally as well as in collaboration
with other telecommunications providers in Germany. The goal is to
make it easier for both fixed-network and mobile consumers to switch
providers without any service interruptions. In all these areas, Deutsche
Telekom stands for a constructive and solution-oriented approach that
is geared to both the consumers' interests and the interests of our
company.

Compliance

Compliance

At Deutsche Telekom AG we feel it is highly important that all of our
employees and governance bodies comply with our values, rules of
conduct and applicable laws at all times. Deutsche Telekom's central
compliance organization (Group Compliance) plays a key role in establishing corporate governance structures and a corporate culture that are
based on integrity. It promotes a culture and a set of values characterized by compliance at the company and and encourages managers
and employees to fill these values with life. As a result, Deutsche
Telekom's understanding of what compliance means far exceeds pure
legal compliance in business activity, i.e., compliance with laws and
internal
regulations, and focuses on the integrity of employees and governance
bodies.

system and heads the Group Compliance unit. We also have compliance officers at our operating segments and national companies who
are in charge of local implementation of the compliance management
system and compliance targets.
Goals of the compliance management system (CMS)
At Deutsche Telekom, compliance refers to following the rules and
doing the "right thing," which means compliance requires all Deutsche
Telekom employees to act with integrity. Within the meaning of our five
Guiding Principles and Code of Conduct, integrity, and therefore compliance, forms the basis of all our business decisions and activities. It
defines the behavior of all our employees when dealing with customers,
employees and colleagues, investors, managers and Deutsche
Telekom's general environment.
The goals of our compliance activities are based on these principles,
the relevant regulations and legal standards as well as on Deutsche
Telekom's strategic objective of becoming the leading European telecommunications provider. More specifically, the aim is to prevent compliance violations and non-ethical business decisions and to integrate
compliance permanently into business processes at an early stage.
This reduces risk of liability for the company and supports customer
perception of Deutsche Telekom as a reliable partner. Group Compliance implements overarching compliance goals in business activities
by systematically applying the compliance management system in the
areas of prevention, identification and response.

Ensuring integrity and compliance
Deutsche Telekom has clearly expressed its commitment to complying
with ethical principles and current legal standards. This commitment
has been incorporated in our Guiding Principles and Code of Conduct.
We have introduced a comprehensive compliance management system
to effectively combat risks and make sure conduct throughout the
Group is based on integrity and complies with our principles and
regulations. All compliance management activities are in line with legal
regulations and our Binding Corporate Rule on Privacy, which specify
how to handle personal data within the Deutsche Telekom Group. Responsibility for the compliance management system lies with the
top management level at Deutsche Telekom in the Board department for
Data Privacy, Legal Affairs and Compliance. The same applies to every
Deutsche Telekom company; responsibility for compliance is always
assigned to a member of the top management. The Chief Compliance
Officer of Deutsche Telekom AG is responsible for the Group-wide structure, advancement and implementation of the compliance management

Focus on prevention
We conduct a Group-wide compliance risk assessment each year.
This helps us identify and assess our compliance risks and define focal
points for conducting effective preventative measures, which are
compiled in our compliance program.
The goal is to make sure that the conduct of our employees is ethical
and compliant at all times, which is why we have set forth clear expectations on employee conduct in our Code of Conduct. We have also introduced Group policies relating to compliance such as policies on anticorruption, gifts, invitations, events and dealing with consultants and
agents. A policy database makes it easy for our employees to access
and follow our policies (group-wide implementation of a code of conduct).
In addition to regular compliance training, we also conduct extensive
anti-corruption training. We specifically address managers to act as
multipliers to further raise awareness of compliance. Their feedback is
thoroughly analyzed and used to introduce additional training offers or
other measures as needed (click here for more information).

Compliance

Employees can also visit the Ask me! portal to have their compliance
questions answered and find reliable information on laws, internal policies and codes of conduct relevant to their daily activities.
We have also introduced various communication measures to promote
a culture of compliance at the Group.
Identification and monitoring
Despite the best preventative measures, we are not always able to prevent breaches of law or serious violations of internal regulations at the
company.
We have created the Tell me! whistleblower portal to uncover non-compliant conduct.Our employees as well as external parties, e.g., business
partners or customers, can use the portal to report misconduct (protecting whistleblowers). Deutsche Telekom thoroughly investigates all
reports within the limits of the legal framework and punishes such activity appropriately.
We have introduced a Group-wide reporting process to control and
monitor these activities, including regular internal and external audits of
our compliance management activities.
Compliant interaction with business partners and suppliers
Our Code of Conduct specifies proper conduct for all of our employees.
With our Social Charter we make a commitment to protecting and promoting human rights including compliance with the ILO's core labor
standards. Our suppliers are expected to comply with the obligations,
principles and values set forth therein and we do our part to place our
suppliers under the obligation to do so. We also expect our suppliers to
require the same of their sub-suppliers. Our General Terms and Conditions for Purchasing include a corporate social responsibility and anticorruption clause that places suppliers under the obligation to take all
steps necessary to prevent and punish active and passive forms of
corruption. We have been offering regular e-learning and face-to-face
compliance training to our suppliers since 2014 and provide them with
a compliance guideline as well (see GRI index).
We select our business partners based on compliance criteria and
conduct risk-oriented compliance business assessments. This applies
to customers and suppliers as well as consultants (Consultant Policy),
sales agents, development partners and joint venture partners.
Compliance management certification
In order to guarantee that we are able to effectively mitigate risks and
that we have effective processes in place at the company for doing so,
we became certified according to the 980 audit standard of the Institute
of Public Auditors in Germany (IDW) in the areas of anti-corruption and
anti-trust legislation.
Anti-corruption audit: During the period from January 2012 through
December 2013, German and international units were audited for risk
of corruption in their respective countries. The auditors confirmed that
our processes at the central compliance organization and various corporate departments are suitable for effectively preventing corruption.
These processes related to sales, procurement, human resources and

46

internal audit. In 2016 (Germany) and 2017 (internationally) we will
again be applying for certification focusing on anti-corruption. We document details regarding audit content and corporate departments that
have undergone anti-corruption audits in our audit report.
Anti-trust compliance audit: Deutsche Telekom's anti-trust regulations
were also audited for compliance with the IDW PS 980 standard by an
independent auditing firm between January and December 2013. The
audit report was issued in 2015 and confirms the effectiveness of our
compliance management system, which is suitable for identifying
vulnerabilities in time, thereby preventing violations of anti-trust law.
Within the scope of this certification process, the independent auditing
firm audited Deutsche Telekom AG, Telekom Deutschland GmbH and
T-Systems International GmbH in Germany as well as ten other Group
companies internationally. We document details regarding audit content
and corporate departments that have undergone anti-trust compliance
audits in our audit report.
International collaboration on compliance
Different legal practices and cultural values in the countries where Deutsche Telekom is active represent a significant compliance challenge.
The increasingly dynamic development of global markets and intensified international competition also influence our compliance strategy.
In line with the Group's international structure, we discuss strategic
issues with an international compliance advisory team twice a year and
define a shared compliance approach. The team is a trend-setter of
sorts, as it provides an impetus for designing and implementing balanced compliance structures at Deutsche Telekom. We have also been
promoting Group-wide compliance collaboration for years through meetings of the representatives of all compliance organizations from our
international subsidiaries. The 11th International Compliance Days were
held in 2015. Around 130 compliance officers from 31 countries met at
our Greek national company OTE in Athens on April 22 and 23. Under
the slogan, "Share and Collaborate," they discussed compliance strategies and trends as well as new approaches to collaboration.
Preventing and fighting corruption
All Group units regularly audited for risk of corruption
We conduct a wide spectrum of internal measures to prevent and fight
corruption. The compliance risk assessment forms the foundation of our
compliance management system. It helps us identify and evaluate compliance risks and develop appropriate prevention measures. To this end,
we have introduced an annual process throughout the Group that
assigns responsibilities and defines clear assessment criteria that are
documented systematically. Companies are selected to participate in
the compliance risk assessment process according to a maturity-based
model . 79 companies participated in the assessment process in 2015.
Our Group risk map is a key component of the compliance risk assessment that we use to assess risks that are particularly significant to our
company. The risk map enables Deutsche Telekom's globally active
companies with their various business models to conduct systematic
risk analyses. It currently covers 27 core risk categories ranging from
corruption and anti-trust law violations to violations of the Group Code
of Conduct. Each subsidiary can add additional categories specific to
their business needs. This involves defining which specific threat each

Deutsche Telekom - Corporate Responsibility Report 2015

Strategy & management
Compliance

risk poses to the subsidiary and stating which measures have already
been implemented to mitigate this risk. If necessary, additional measures are developed to reduce the risks to a manageable level. Responsibility for the compliance risk assessment lies with the respective Group
company. Our central compliance organization provides support and
advice in these matters.
The subsidiaries' managing boards are informed of the results of the
compliance risk assessment. Subsequently the compliance program for
the following year is defined, including specific measures and responsibilities. The managing board passes a formal resolution to approve the
program. The compliance program measures are monitored closely.
Investigation based on clear criteria
Deutsche Telekom has specified clear criteria for investigating suspected cases of corruption. We only start investigations if a violation of legal
or internal regulations is reported with a sufficient degree of detail. Any
tips that meet this requirement are investigated thoroughly. Any
violations we uncover are punished appropriately. In some cases
employment relationships have even been terminated for good cause.
Claims for damages may also be asserted. Any weaknesses identified
in the internal control system during the investigation are systematically
analyzed and remedied.

the Forum Compliance and Integrity (Center for Business Ethics),
DICO (German Institute for Compliance), Bitkom (German Association
for Information Technology, Telecommunications and New Media) and
ENICO (European Network of Integrity and Compliance Officers). In
cooperation with the ICC (International Chamber of Commerce) and
other companies, Deutsche Telekom has developed guidelines to
promote the prevention of corruption.
Through cooperation and exchange of experiences Deutsche Telekom
makes a valuable contribution to the work of international anti-corruption-initiatives across company boundaries. The acquired knowledge is
used to continuously improve the compliance-management-system.
Major ongoing litigation
Deutsche Telekom is party to several proceedings both in and out of
court with government agencies, competitors, and other parties. The
proceedings mentioned in the 2015 Annual Report are of particular
importance from Deutsche Telekom's point of view.

Tell me! whistleblower portal: 120 reports made
In 2015, 120 compliance-related reports were made to Deutsche
Telekom via the Tell me! portal. 18 of those are still being reviewed for
plausibility and investigations are being made into 56 plausible reports
(as at: February 2016). 17 of those were confirmed as actual misconduct and were punished accordingly. 31 cases are still in the investigation phase. In confirmed cases, Deutsche Telekom imposes systematic sanctions that are proportionate to the act and the guilt of the perpetrator and are in line with applicable legal provisions. Overall, in 2015 the
majority of tips related to embezzlement, theft and fraud, commissions
fraud and target manipulation.
Most transparent telecommunications company
worldwide
Deutsche Telekom is the most transparent telecommunications company worldwide. This was confirmed in a study published by Transparency International in November 2015. The anti-corruption organization
has published a transparency rating list of the world's 35 largest
telecommunications companies.
The study was based on publicly available information on company
anti-corruption programs, interdependence among businesses and
country-by-country reporting of financial expenditures and revenues.
Transparency International emphasized that Deutsche Telekom publishes all relevant information regarding preventative measures conducted at the company as well as on national and holding companies and
discloses significant financial data.
Involvement in anti-corruption initiatives
Deutsche Telekom works together with associations and organizations
to fight corruption. We use these opportunities to share experiences
and to further develop our compliance management system on an
ongoing basis. For example, we are active as a corporate member of

Human rights

Human rights

As an international player, the Deutsche Telekom Group assigns high
priority to human rights compliance, especially since the ICT sector is
frequently criticized for deficiencies in its supply chain. That is why we
have established comprehensive social standards at Deutsche Telekom
and implement these using appropriate methods. At our company we
attach particular importance to complying with the right to collective
bargaining and supporting diversity and equal opportunities. We
expressly require our suppliers to assume responsibilityas a way of
making sure human rights are also protected outside of our Group.

How we protect human rights
Deutsche Telekom has made an express commitment to the UN Guiding
Principles on Business and Human Rights published by the United
Nations Human Rights Council in 2011. These principles require businesses to systematically identify the impact their operations have on
human rights, and to prevent, mitigate or compensate these where
necessary. In order to meet these requirements, we have developed an
extensive program to implement the UN Guiding Principles and introduced an ongoing process comprised of several interconnected measures
and tools (see diagram).

The obligation to respect human rights is incorporated into Deutsche
Telekom's fundamental policies: our Guiding Principles, Code of Conduct and Social Charter . Deutsche Telekom's Employee Relations
Policy and Diversity Policy are also relevant here.
Tools to assess possible impact on human rights
We use two tools to assess compliance with our Social Charter: Every
year we draw up a central Social Performance Report with the participation of all 111 fully consolidated Deutsche Telekom subsidiaries. This
report did not record any violations of our Social Charter during the
period from October 2014 to September 2015. We have also been offering a central Contact Point for Human Rights since 2013. This contact
point can be reached via various channels, for example the public
e-mail address humanrights@telekom.de. Others use our anonymous
whistleblower system, which allows them to submit their information
anonymously. All contact options are listed on our Tell me! whistleblower portal, the purpose of which is to resolve violations of legal
regulations and internal policies. We look into all tips and reports received and introduce countermeasures as soon as the information is identified as plausible. Click here for more information on the measures we
took to resolve violations reported in 2015.
We also continued the process launched in 2013 to integrate human
rights issues into the due diligence activities conducted in the context of
mergers and acquisitions. In addition, we introduced special evaluation
processes to assess employer-employee relations as part of implementing our Group Policy on Employee Relations.
Reports received by the Contact Point for
Human Rights
Since the set-up of a dedicated Contact Point for Human Rights at Deutsche Telekom in October 2013, the Contact Point is also involved
in inquiries that are related to human rights. In the reporting period
(01/01/2015 – 31/12/2015), the Contact Point received eleven inquiries related to human rights which were directly sent to the contact point
email inbox or the (anonymous) whistleblower portal.. Not all inquiries
were identified as being plausible.
Most inquiries were related to issues of freedom of expression and
discrimination In three cases Telekom has been asked to participate
in surveys about “Business and Human Rights” and “ILO Core Labour
Standards”. Two inquiries addressed the refugee aid, specially the establishment of HotSpots in refugee accommodations. One case
was related to the “implementation of minimum wages”. All inquiries
received are of course handled confidentially and with all due respect.

Risk and opportunity management

Risk and opportunity management

For us, comprehensive risk and opportunities management also means
considering the opportunities and risks arising from ecological or social
aspects or from the management of our Company. To this end, we
actively and systematically involve all relevant stakeholders in the
process of identifying current and potential risks and opportunities.
We also participate in a number of working groups and committees.
In parallel to continuously monitoring ecological, social and governance
issues, we also systematically determine our stakeholders’ positions on
these issues. The key tools here are: ouryear-round open online materiality survey for all stakeholders , our bi-monthly NGO report, which
systematically analyzes press publications of the NGOs relevant for us;
our involvement in working groups and committees, countless national
and international business associations and social organizations, stakeholder dialog formats organized by us, and our various publications.
The following aspects have been identified as material for our sustainability management.
Reputation
How we deal with sustainability issues also entails both opportunities
and risks for our reputation. A high level of service quality is one of the
most important factors for improving customer perception. This is why
customer satisfaction has been embedded in our Group management
as a non-financial performance indicator. Transparency and reporting
help to promote the trust of other external stakeholders in our Group.
Our annual and CR reports also serve this purpose. However, issues
such as business practices, data protection, or work standards in the
supply chain also entail reputational risks: If there are negative media
reports in connection with our brands, products, or services, this can
cause substantial damage to our reputation. As part of our sustainability
management, we continuously review such potential risks and take
measures to minimize them.
Climate protection
At present, we do not see any severe risks to the achievement of our
climate protection targets for our reference period .We see climate
protection above all as an opportunity: ICT products and services have
the potential to save almost ten times as many carbon emissions in
other industries as the ICT industry causes itself (SMARTer2030 study).
This creates an opportunity to reduce 20 percent of global carbon emissions by 2030, and to maintain worldwide emissions at the level of 2015
with simultaneous economic growth. The additional revenue potential
here amounts to USD 6.5 trillion, USD 2.0 trillion thereof for the ICT
industry alone. Furthermore, the ICT industry can save costs totaling
USD 4.9 trillion. Specifically, this means for Germany, for example, that
potential savings of more than 19 million metric tons of CO2 could be
made by 2020 based on the 2012 level, for example, through broadband in Germany. In addition, the economic stimulus resulting from the

broadband roll-out could create an estimated 162,000 new jobs. Additional opportunities arise, for example, from changed customer expectations, political measures to ensure the transition to renewable energy
sources, and the growing interests of sustainable investors (SRI) in the
subject of renewable energy. Environmentally-friendly products and
services enable us to tap into new customer groups.
Suppliers
We see more sustainability in our supply chain as an opportunity. It
helps to enhance our reputation and our economic success. Thus
through a development program, we help strategic suppliers to introduce business practices that are socially and ecologically acceptable
and economically efficient. The program showed measurable successes again in its second year; we will expand it further in 2016. Better
working conditions at our suppliers reduce the number of work-related
accidents and the turnover rate. This increases productivity, while at the
same time lowering costs for recruitment and training. Thus not only
do we strengthen CR performance at our suppliers, we also significantly
reduce identified risks. As part of our global procurement activities, we
can be exposed to country- and supplier-specific risks. These include,
for example, the use of child labor, the conscious acceptance of environmental damage or inadequate local working and safety conditions.
However, the reporting of NGOs or media can give rise to risks to the
Company’s reputation, but also to supply risks. We systematically review
our suppliers and in that way reduce these risks. In the renowned
RobecoSAM sustainability rating, our supply chain management in the
reporting year was rated just as highly as in the prior year with 93 out
of 100 points. Our partnerships with suppliers that comply with international sustainability standards ensure a high level of product quality and
reliable procurement.
Health and environment
Mobile communications, or the electromagnetic fields used in mobile
communications, regularly give rise to concerns among the general
population about potential health risks. There is intense public, political,
and scientific debate of this issue. Acceptance problems among the
general public concern both mobile communications networks and the
use of mobile handsets. In mobile communications, this affects projects
like the build-out of the mobile communications infrastructure and the
use of mobile handsets. In the fixed network, it affects sales of traditional DECT (digital cordless) phones and devices that use Wi-Fi technology. There is a risk of regulatory interventions, such as reduced EMF
thresholds or the implementation of precautionary measures in mobile
communications, e. g., amendments to building law or labeling requirements for handsets.

Over the past few years, recognized expert organizations such as the
World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Commission on
Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) have repeatedly reviewed
the current limit values for mobile communications and confirmed that–
if these values are complied with – the use of mobile technology is safe
based on current scientific knowledge. ICNIRP regularly reviews the
recommendations for the limit values based on current scientific knowledge.
We are convinced that mobile communications technology is safe if
specific threshold values are complied with. We are supported in this
conviction by the assessment of the recognized bodies. The basis of our
responsible dealing with this issue is our EMF Policy, with which we
commit ourselves to more transparency, information, participation, and
financial support of independent mobile communications research, far
beyond that which is stipulated by legal requirements. We aim to overcome uncertainty among the general public by pursuing an objective,
scientifically well-founded, and transparent information policy. Thus, we
remain committed to maintaining our trust-based, successful communication with local authorities over and above the statutory requirements.
This also applies after many years of collaboration with municipalities
with regard to building out the mobile network were enshrined in law in
2013; previously, this collaboration was based on voluntary self-commitments by the network operators.

Data privacy and data security

Data privacy and data security

Almost half of the German population (48 percent) has been victim
to Internet crime - for example through viruses, Trojans or computer
worms. These were the findings of a survey conducted by TNS Emnid
on behalf of Deutsche Telekom in February 2016. Another aspect of
which many users have little awareness – whether using the web for personal or business purposes – is that every click leaves behind a trail of
data that could potentially be traced back. Hackers can take advantage
of this to collect specific data and identify vulnerabilities in hardware
and software. Our customers' trust is the basis for our business as an
ICT company, which is why data privacy and data security are of utmost
importance to us.

Consistent transparency toward the public
In 2008 we were the first DAX-30 company to publish an annual data
privacy report, which documents all relevant processes at the Group.
We have been publishing an integrated report on data privacy and data
security since 2011.
In addition, we have been publishing an annual Transparency Report
since 2014. In the report we disclose our obligations to cooperate with
German and international security agencies.
Further details and current information regarding data security can be
found under http://www.telekom.com/dataprotection. The status report,
for example, includes all processes relevant to data privacy at Deutsche
Telekom. We present our latest measures to improve data privacy as well
as tips for keeping personal information safe.
The section on consumer and youth protection elaborates on how we
ensure the safety of our products and services.s

Laying the foundation for effective data privacy
In 2008 we created a Board of Management department for Data
Privacy, Legal Affairs and Compliance as well as the Group Privacy unit.
This has given us the necessary capacities for effective data protection.
The responsible Board member is advised by the independent Data
Privacy Advisory Council, which was founded in February 2009 and
comprises renowned experts from politics, science, business and organizations.
We are also committed to improving the political framework conditions
to ensure comprehensive data privacy. At the 2015 national IT summit
we signed the "Charter for the Promotion of Trustworthy Communications" together with the German Federal Minister of the Interior and
other organizations. Its main purpose is to make sure that the encryption of private communications becomes standard.

Regular employee training courses
Telecommunications companies are obliged to provide new employees
with information on data privacy regulations. Deutsche Telekom goes
beyond this legal requirement: Every two years, we train all of our
employees in Germany and commit them to data privacy and telecommunications secrecy. Corresponding requirements for national companies are in place. We have also introduced specific trainings in the customer and human resources departments where the risk of data abuse
is higher. These trainings include online courses for independent learning, presentations on data privacy and face-to-face courses on specific
topics such as "Data privacy at call centers." This helps us make sure
that all employees have in-depth understanding of the relevant data privacy policies.
Annual review of measures through audits and certifications
We conduct an annual basic data privacy audit to measure and improve
the general data privacy standards at Deutsche Telekom in Germany
and at 34 international affiliated companies. In 2015, 30 percent of
Group employees were randomly selected and interviewed online.
The basic data privacy audit is supplemented by self-assessments
completed by the data privacy officers at the national companies on
implementation of the requirements defined in the Binding Corporate
Rules on Privacy.

Deutsche Telekom - Corporate Responsibility Report 2015

Strategy & management

Based on the results, the Group Privacy department identifies need for
action at the respective departments and requires them to implement
improvement measures. To this end, the Global Data Privacy Officer
holds personal meetings with the responsible directors, managers and
data privacy officers at the different departments. The Group Privacy
department supports implementation of the improvement measures by
providing information and advice and conducts a follow-up evaluation.
Unusual audit results are taken into consideration when planning the
follow-up audit.
We also have our processes and management systems as well as products and services certified by external, independent organizations
such as TÜV, DEKRA and auditing firms.
Publication of international transparency report
Telecommunication companies are legally obliged to cooperate with
security agencies. This includes surveillance measures to record telecommunications connections or disclosure of customer information.
Deutsche Telekom has been publishing an annual transparency report
for Germany since 2014, which covers the types and amount of information we disclose to security agencies. In January 2016 we also published our first international transparency report for all of Deutsche
Telekom's national companies.
International legal framework conditions differ considerably. In some
countries it is illegal to disclose security measures, in others surveillance is directly conducted by the authorities without the involvement of
telecommunications companies. You can find more information on the
local situations in the various country reports at http://www.telekom.
com/transparency-report.
We consider it the responsibility of the authorities to ensure transparency regarding security measures and called for improved online
security in the context of a ten-point program in January 2015. Until our
requests are met, we strive to provide the necessary transparency within
the legal possibilities.
Don't give the data slob a chance – increasing employee awareness of data privacy
In January 2015 we launched an international campaign designed to
raise employee awareness of the importance of data privacy. The
campaign's protagonist is the "data slob". The data slob embodies
sloppiness in handling data and information and demonstrates the
consequences of treating data privacy lightly. We asked our employees
on the Telekom Social Network, TSN, to illustrate these risks as part
of an ideas competition under the heading "Don't give the data slob a
chance." Around 150 employees took part and addressed the topic in
writing, graphically (see cartoons) and even through videos.
In addition, employees can always report potential abuse of data privacy
at datenschutz@telekom.de.

CR-Ratings

CR rating: Group Policy on Avoiding Corruption Risks
when Working with Consultants
In order to protect company assets and to avoid any risk of corruption
and other conflicts of interest, the careful selection and monitoring of
consultants, agents and similar external intermediaries is extremely
important for Deutsche Telekom AG. That is why we introduced a Group
policy that includes requirements for selecting and monitoring external
consultants, agents and similar external intermediaries, and for designing and executing contracts with them.
CR rating: Compliance at joint ventures
We strive to implement our Code of Conduct and other compliancerelated policies at our joint ventures as well. However, because we are
only one of several partners involved in the joint venture, it is not always
possible to introduce our Code of Conduct as it applies at the Group.
As a result, the code of conduct followed by the joint venture is often
a combination of the codes of conduct employed by the parent companies. In this process we do our best to make sure that the essential
principles and elements of our Code of Conduct are also employed at
the joint venture.

We regularly conduct campaigns especially designed to raise awareness of the CoC, including an annual Guiding Principles Day and an
annual Anti-Corruption Day. Our Group-wide employee survey and
pulse surveys also regularly assess employees' familiarity with the CoC.
86 percent of those surveyed in the last employee survey conducted in
2015 said that the Code of Conduct was the basis of their daily activities. Based on the survey results, we are offering additional communication and training measures to departments as needed.
Employees can get their compliance-related questions on the CoC
answered on the Ask me! advice portal or by contacting the Compliance
department.

CR rating: Protecting whistleblowers
Every employee at Deutsche Telekom has a responsibility to report a
breach or suspected breach of legal regulations, guidelines, or internal
policies. In addition to reporting to their direct superiors, they can also
use the Tell me! whistleblower platform. Our Code of Conduct specifically states that whistleblowers will be protected. They will not be at any
disadvantage unless they themselves are in breach of applicable regulations. We communicate this policy as an aspect of our Code of Conduct
to all of our employees. The Code of Conduct also serves as a guidance
for the people and departments that are responsible for following up on
the reports.
CR rating: Group-wide implementation of the Code
of Conduct
The Code of Conduct (CoC) is a key part of Deutsche Telekom's compliance management system. The CoC has been implemented at all of our
national companies, which means that the managing boards of those
national companies have approved it and communicated it to the
company's employees. We encourage new national companies to
implement the CoC as well.
New employees learn about the CoC when they join the company. The
CoC can also be accessed on Deutsche Telekom's public websites and
on the intranet along with other information and training material, e.g., in
an e-learning format. Testimonial videos and statements by the management also emphasize the importance of the CoC for everyday work at
Deutsche Telekom.

Every second... surfing with at least 50 megabits.1
More and more areas in both the private and professional sphere are
becoming connected. This means that our networks need to be able
to transport increasingly large amounts of data. Because of this, we are
constantly expanding our networks, increasing their transmission capacity and reducing electricity consumption by using more energy-efficient technology. We also offer our customers products and services that
make their lives easier and more sustainable. And we combine
digitization with responsibility when it comes to aspects such as data
privacy.

We are planning to provide roughly 80 percent of all households in
Germany with VDSL vectoring lines featuring a bandwidth of at least
50 Mbit/s by 2018. This is subject to regulatory changes.

Responsible infrastructure expansion

Responsible infrastructure
expansion
Our network infrastructure enables economic performance and
participation in the knowledge and information society. As a result,
demand for faster, full-coverage data services is immense. That is why
we continue to rapidly expand our infrastructure and improve transmission speeds with new, secure technology.

Expanding our infrastructure
The data volume generated globally will increase tenfold by 2020 compared to 2013, according to a study conducted in 2014 by US-based IT
company EMC. That would mean 44 billion gigabytes in the networks a
year instead of 4.4 billion. The amount of digital data being produced in
Germany alone is expected to grow from a current 230 billion gigabytes
to 1,100 billion. Networks need to be continually expanded to be able to
handle this volume.

We have defined two goals as part of our INS in Germany that we plan
to achieve by 2018: Firstly, we plan to be able to offer LTE connections
to 95 percent of the population. Secondly, progress of the fiber-optic
network roll-out should allow VDSL vectoring lines with bandwidths of at
least 50 Mbit/s for around 80 percent of all households. This is subject
to regulatory changes.

Deutsche Telekom has been the largest investor in this area in Germany
for years now and will continue to drive network expansion. The main
objectives of our pan-European integrated network strategy (INS) form
the basis for these activities: growth, efficiency and quality. We will continue to expand our networks, increase the efficiency of our systems and
further strengthen our role as a leader in network quality. Our integrated
network strategy is in line with the network expansion goals specified by
the EU Commission and the German federal government (digital
agenda and broadband strategy).

Upgrading our network architecture
We intend to make our networks faster and more efficient. To do this,
we are going to deactivate all analog PSTN (public switched telephone
network) platforms that we no longer need and switch our entire telephone network to IP-based lines by 2018. Thanks to this switch and
other measures to improve efficiency, Deutsche Telekom will reduce the
carbon footprint of its fixed and mobile networks in Germany by around
40 percent by 2020 compared to 2008. The switch to IP technology,
which requires considerably less energy compared to earlier network
technologies, will contribute significantly to the overall reduction of CO2
emissions.

Network expansion based on four pillars
Deutsche Telekom's integrated network strategy (INS) for Europe is
based on the four pillars LTE, fiber optics, VDSL vectoring and hybrid. In
addition to expanding the LTE mobile network, fiber-optic expansion in
combination with VDSL vectoring technology is the short and mediumterm focus of Deutsche Telekom's INS for Germany. In March 2015 we
launched our integrated hybrid offer, a combination of LTE and fixednetwork line, thereby considerably increasing bandwidths throughout
Germany once again.

We will also rely on fiber optics when updating our network architecture
in order to meet our customers' demands for fast network connections.
Using fiber optic-based technology, VDSL vectoring, speeds up download data transmission rates to up to 100 Mbit/s and upload speeds
even up to 40 Mbit/s. But vectoring requires more energy. To reduce this
need for energy, we are working on control solutions for energy-efficient
operation of our systems. The combination of IP technology and VDSL
vectoring is already considerably more energy-efficient than conventional PSTN technology.

Mobile workplaces, multimedia applications and high-quality online
services continually boost the demand for higher bandwidths. We are
taking fiber optics closer to our customers in order to ensure the longterm success of our business.
With our network roll-out we plan to make ultra-high-speed Internet
available to 80 percent of the German population by 2018. This is subject to regulatory changes. This means that we will considerably expand
the fiber-optic network using FTTC, or fiber to the curb. For FTTC, fiberoptic cables are installed in the main cable up to the cable distribution
box (the gray street cabinets found on sidewalks in German cities). From
there, customers can be provided with large bandwidths via VDSL vectoring using the existing copper cable.
With FTTH, or fiber to the home, the fiber-optic cables are taken into the
home. This will enable products with up to 200Mbit/s for downloads
and up to 100Mbit/s for uploads, for example. FTTC alone already provides download speeds of 50 Mbit/s, which doubles to up to 100 Mbit/s
when FTTC is combined with vectoring. Upload speeds are even quadrupled to up to 40 Mbit/s through vectoring.
We have been driving our vectoring infrastructure roll-out since November 2013. Expanding the fiber-optic network, however, involves a great
deal of time and financial expense. That is why expansion is currently
not economically feasible in some regions and will only be possible
through close collaboration between politics and business.
Implementing our network strategy in the mobile
network
All of the Deutsche Telekom Group's national companies made considerable investments in 2015 in expanding their LTE networks and continue to make rapid progress in network build-out: More than 50 percent
of our mobile base stations were equipped with LTE technology in the
Europe segment (12 European countries besides Germany) by the end
of 2015. Depending on the region, our national companies provide between 35 and 95-percent coverage. We are planning to increase this to
between 75 and 95 percent by the end of 2018.

One router, two networks: Hybrid connection
The hybrid connection is another pillar of our integrated network strategy that literally integrates networks. In fall 2014 we began offering our
customers in Germany a combination of IP fixed-line and LTE mobile
communications in a single fixed-line product thanks to hybrid technology. When customers require more bandwidth for their DSL connection, our hybrid service automatically activates LTE using a special hybrid router. This means that the transmission rates of both networks are
added together. This is particularly useful in areas where we have not
been able to offer broadband Internet via the fixed network to date.
In 2014 we became the first mass-market provider worldwide to offer
this type of hybrid solution The offer has been available to customers
throughout Germany since spring 2015.
Migration to IP technology
All signs point to IP, the universal code of the 21st century. Thanks to IP
technology [Glossary] phone calls are no longer transmitted via analog
channels or using ISDN technology but in the form of data packets, a
method that has been the standard in online and mobile communications services for some time now.We switched more than 9 million lines
in Germany to IP technology by the end of 2015. In the other EU countries we also increased the number of IP lines. Macedonia, Slovakia,
Montenegro and Croatia are all now "100 percent IP." Hungary plans to
join them by the end of 2016, with Romania, Greece and Germany following in 2018. IP technology is also a requirement for VDSL vectoring
with download data rates of up to 100 Mbit/s and upload rates of up to
40 Mbit/s.
Fast Internet access on board
Deutsche Telekom and Inmarsat are planning to provide airline passengers in Europe with even better internet access on board. The companies are currently developing the European Aviation Network within the
scope of a strategic partnership. Two complementing transmission
technologies are being combined in Europe for the first time: satellite
communication and a high-performing LTE mobile communications
network.

LTE expansion has been well on track in Germany, too. We achieved
90-percent coverage by the end of 2015 and plan to increase this to
95 percent by the end of 2018.
We are also making considerable progress with transmission speeds in
mobile communications. We set the standard throughout Germany in
early 2014 by rolling out LTE on the basis of the Cat 4 standard. This
service in the LTE 1.800 network attains download speeds of up to
150 Mbit/s, 50 Mbit/s more than conventional LTE networks. More than
150 German cities benefit from this service. Speeds of up to 300 Mbit/s
have even been possible since fall 2014 with LTE Max based on the Cat
6 standard. Radio antennas have also been set up in many rural regions
to enable LTE via the 1,800 MHz frequency.
In 2017, Lufthansa will become the first European airline to conduct test
flights to help develop the European Aviation Network.

Responsible infrastructure expansion

Deutsche Telekom is continuing to expand its pan-European mobile
network for this cooperation. Around 300 new LTE base stations with
a range of more than 80 kilometers are being set up. In comparison,
conventional LTE stations only have a range of around 10 kilometers.
New mobile communications standard for even
faster Internet
The current 4th generation (4G) is the end of the era of "pure" mobile
communications standards; its successor, 5G, is starting to take shape.
Industry experts are currently intensively discussing which elements will
be included in this standard, which will be an "integrated standard" in
many respects. The goal is to ultimately agree on a globally consistent
standard.
Many companies share our belief that 4G technology will most likely
simply be adopted as part of a generic 5G standard. This means that 4G
will form the foundation of 5G performance, as the technical potential of
the current 4G standard, or LTE, has by far not yet been fully exhausted.
Thanks to the evolution of LTE, the demand for fast bandwidths from
consumers is being largely met even today. Although consumers will
also benefit from the technological advances, the new 5G functions will
primarily be of interest to industry, as they will make new business
models possible that would be inconceivable by today's standards.
These include innovative solutions for the healthcare and automotive
industries. All in all, this next generation will provide 1,000 times higher
capacity, 10 times better speed, 10 times faster response time (latency)
and 1.5 times better mobility in comparison with conventional technologies. This provides us with the opportunity to fundamentally change the
way we would like to support and assist our business customers.
At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in spring 2016, we presented the next steps on the road to 5G: the first fully functional end-to-end
5G network worldwide. In addition to high transmission rates, the model
achieved data transfers with minimized latencies of less than one millisecond. In comparison, top latencies achieved with LTE are currently
40 milliseconds.

Sustainable products and services

Technological progress offers new ways to address the challenges
posed by climate change, scarcity of resources, and nationwide healthcare. Information and communications technology (ICT) plays a key role
in this context. Among other things, our products and services make climate-friendly consumption possible for our customers and enable new
ways to provide healthcare.

Achievements made measurable
We use key performance indicators (KPIs) such as the ESG KPI Used
Cell-Phone Collection to make our achievements measurable. We have
defined performance goals, e.g., sales goals, as internal monitoring
tools in certain fields such as e-health and Smart Home.
Managing sustainable products calls for systematic measures to be
implemented throughout the supply chain, which is why we have
already established comprehensive procurement processes in order to
ensure that sustainability criteria are met. We use our Design Principles
as a guideline when developing new products and use recognized environmental labels such as the Blue Angel and the TÜV environmental
label "Certified Green Product." Their requirements show us how to
further optimize our products. These seals also help us inform our
customers of the benefits of choosing sustainable products. We also
provide our customers with a variety of offers and opportunities to
ensure that our products are recycled or disposed of properly at the
end of their life cycle.

Developing sustainable products and services
ICT helps industry, service providers, and consumers pursue a more
sustainable approach and holds tremendous market potential for all
those involved. For example, according to the SMARTer2030 study 20
percent of all greenhouse gas emissions worldwide could be eliminated
by 2030 through targeted use of information and communications technologies. However, sustainability means more than just climate protection when it comes to ICT. Technology could do many things such as
contributing to reduced resource consumption, stabilizing power supply
networks, simplifying work processes and continuing to improve medical care.
We are committed to systematically leveraging the vast sustainability
potential of ICT, which is why we continuously work on innovative and
future-oriented solutions. Among others, we focus on the Industrial
Internet and e-health growth segments. We also started a project in
2014 to identify the sustainability potential of the products and services
featured in our current product portfolio as well as business opportunities. In order to develop new ICT solutions, we are also cooperating with
partners, e.g., in the field of M2M communication and are active members of international networks.

Business potential through sustainability
Our integrated climate strategy includes identifying sustainable aspects
of products and services in our portfolio. We began this analysis process in collaboration with external experts in 2014. The results show
that 37 percent of total revenues generated in Europe in 2014 involved
products and services with sustainability benefits (click here for the analysis). Our products help improve medical care, enable people to participate in the knowledge society and conserve resources by replacing physical devices with digital solutions, to mention just a few of these benefits. We continued the project for identifying sustainability aspects in
2015. The broadband network, cloud computing and the virtual set-top
box were the pilot products tested for their contribution to sustainability
and the resulting business potential they hold. We identified their benefits in view of all three sustainability categories (environmental, social,
and economic):
Broadband Internet
Between 2012 and 2020, our broadband networks have the potential to
help reduce more than 19 million metric tons of CO2 emissions in Germany alone. Employees and students can work from home and cut out
their daily trip to the office or university. The economy benefits as well.
Between 2015 and 2020, the gross domestic product of Germany alone
is expected to grow by 47 billion euros thanks to broadband technology.
This high-speed network enables new business models and has created
162,000 jobs, generating additional tax revenues of 10.6 million euros.
The use of broadband technology also has the potential to prevent 3.8
million sick days.

B2B cloud solutions
With our business-to-business (B2B) cloud solutions an SME with more
than 100 employees can cut more than 21 metric tons of CO2 emissions
and decrease its electricity costs by 7,000 euros annually. That means
SMEs in Germany can cut back 300,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions
each year between 2015 and 2020.

Virtual set-top box
Set-top boxes (STBs) add a wide range of special functions to TV sets
and enable access to our Entertain offer, for example. By replacing
these devices with virtual STBs, each customer can save 63 euros annually typically due to device energy consumption and rental fees. This
amounts to total savings of 146 million euros for German TV users and
reduced CO2 emissions of 47,000 metric tons. This virtual solution also
conserves resources, potentially saving 4,200 metric tons of material.
We use the results of these analyses to advance our sustainable product
portfolio. Future plans also include keeping our customers informed of
these sustainability benefits, thereby sharpening our competitive edge.

SMARTer2030 – Contributing to climate protection
State-of-the-art information and communications technology (ICT)
makes life easier and encourages sustainable development. These
were the findings of the SMARTer2030 study published by the Global
e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI). The study essentially shows that ICT
products and services can provide extensive environmental, economic
and social benefits.
In many industries, ICT makes it possible to develop innovative business
models that are more resource- and cost-efficient, improve services
and tap new sources of financial success. According to GeSI, not only
could global CO2 emissions be reduced by up to 20 percent by 2030,
macroeconomic profits of up to 11 billion euros could be generated as
well. The study also predicts an increase in crop yields thanks to ICT.

Business models through innovation

As a modern technology company, our aim is to assume a pioneering
role and help shape future developments, which is why we develop
smart solutions for more efficiency and convenience while keeping environmental impact to a minimum. Our focus here includes the growth
areas machine-to-machine communication, e-health and smart home. In
addition to developing innovative solutions, we also invest in extensive
research, particularly at our central research facility, Telekom Innovation
Laboratories (T-Labs). We invested a total of 108.1 million euros in
research and development throughout the Group in 2015. We also
finance professorships, collaborate with universities and encourage
innovative business concepts with our start-up incubator, hub:raum.
Industrial Internet: opportunities of digitization
Machines and products are becoming smarter: cars communicating
with repair shops, smartphones becoming the new wallet. The technology that makes this possible is called machine-to-machine communication, or M2M. By 2020 the number of M2M connections around the
world is expected to increase to 2.5 billion. Machine-to-machine communication is an important area of growth for Deutsche Telekom, too.
Our Connected Car business area reflects this trend and focuses on
smart mobility solutions.
We offer our customers numerous benefits by connecting machines
digitally. The technology optimally synchronizes the work processes of
the various customer devices and cars or even entire industrial plants.
This increases industrial productivity, makes transportation more reliable (and more accurate) and helps reduce energy consumption and
conserve resources. Our networks serve as the basis for this, because
mobile communications is a vital part of the transmission process in any
M2M connection.
We also support the German federal government's Industry 4.0 initiative
through our involvement in machine-to-machine (M2M) communication.
The initiative's objective is to maintain Germany's competitive edge in
the technology sector.
M2M solutions for more efficient mobility
M2M communication holds strong potential in the transportation field.
Our Connected Car business area is developing custom-fit solutions
that tap this potential.
 At the international automobile fair IAA in September 2015 we
presented driver- and vehicle-oriented real-time services under the
slogan "Secure Auto Cloud." Deutsche Telekom also presented
AutoApp at the trade fair. This mobile application allows drivers to
receive position-related traffic information and situation-specific tips
designed to enhance traffic safety or reduce fuel consumption.

 Daimler has developed a retrofit telematics solution for Mercedes
cars in cooperation with T-Systems. The pilot stage was successfully
completed in 2015. The European launch of the Mercedes Connect
Me adapter is scheduled for early 2016. It allows customers to connect with their cars anywhere and anytime. For example, they can
access information such as fuel levels or the position of their vehicle
on their smartphones.
 Bicycle maker BULLS, e-bike system vendor Brose, and Deutsche
Telekom presented a jointly developed, connected electric bicycle in
2015. People who own one of these bikes can use their smartphone
to locate their bicycles at any time. Besides this, a motion sensor
detects unusually fast braking activity and extreme tilting which
could result in a fall. If the user stops for an unusually long time and
does not react to a message on the display, the bike sends a text
message with location data to a pre-defined contact person. In the
event of an accident, this makes it easier to find the cyclist quickly
and to provide assistance. BULLS is planning to launch the bike on
the market as a special model in 2017.
The port of tomorrow
During the reporting period we continued our smartPORT Logistics
(SPL) pilot project for the port of Hamburg and started to put it into commercial operation. The goal of the project is to improve HDV traffic flows
at the Port of Hamburg and in its vicinity. All relevant traffic and infrastructure data is collected and analyzed in real time for this purpose.
Results can be used to inform users about waiting times, alternative routes or parking.
In 2016 we defined data privacy guidelines for using data when working
with the Internet of Things and the Industrial Internet. Among other
things, the six rules define how Deutsche Telekom deals with personal
data and how the persons concerned are involved.
Connected farming
Roughly 2 billion metric tons of CO2 emissions can be reduced and
250 billion liters of water saved annually in agriculture alone by the year
2030 through the use of ICT. The SMARTer2030 study published by the
Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) confirms these numbers. These
amounts are equivalent to around 2.2 times Germany's carbon footprint
and the water consumption of around 180 million people. The reduction
could be made possible by pushing the digitization of farming, for
example. Real-time solutions are already making their way into agriculture. Farming machines send their data to the cloud via satellite; the
data is analyzed immediately and important information is sent to the
farmer via text message for instance. This lets the farmer optimize their
use of fertilizer, seed and machines, save time, reduce costs and conserve resources.

Deutsche Telekom - Corporate Responsibility Report 2015

Customers & products
Sustainable products and services
Business models through innovation

Deutsch Telekom is working hard to encourage digitization in farming.
Our goal in particular is to use smart technologies to help farmers
become more sustainable and master the varied challenges they face
every day. We develop solutions for this in numerous projects, as the
following examples show:
 At the 2015 Agritechnica trade show, we presented a solution that
helps farmers to dispense seeds and fertilizer efficiently and to
optimize fuel consumption. Precise location data is transferred to
agricultural machine steering systems via the mobile communications network, which helps to minimize unnecessary trips when
sowing, fertilizing and harvesting. This new technology can be
upgraded at low cost and does not require farmers to set up their
own base station.
 We developed a time clocking system especially for farmers in
collaboration with our partner MobilZeit. The solution replaces
traditional paper time cards. The system comes with a display and
keyboard as well as an evaluation software. Farm employees are
given a chip having the size of a coin – when they begin or stop
work, they hold the chip near the recording device. Thanks to an
integrated RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) transponder, the
chip can be read without contact, and the employee's work hours
are automatically recorded. The data are sent to a central computer,
via Deutsche Telekom's mobile network, and provided directly to the
farmer via the system's evaluation software. The system helps the
farmer keep up with their documentation obligations in connection
with minimum wage requirements and simplifies administrative processes. The number of hours worked, for example, are immediately
assigned to a specific cost center. This, in turn, makes it possible to
calculate labor costs and profits in relation to harvest units.
2015 CR Stakeholder Forum: Enabling sustainability –
Turning visions into reality
On November 2 and 3, 2015 Deutsche Telekom hosted the 8th CRStakeholder Forum under the slogan "Enabling sustainability –
Turning visions into reality." On the first day, Deutsche Telekom employees – in particular managers – were invited to intensively learn about
sustainable products and services. The second day was used by our
employees to share their ideas with suppliers, NGOs and other stakeholders. The presentations, discussions and workshops focused on the following questions: How can modern information and communication
technologies like computers, the Internet, e-mail and cell phones help
meet global challenges such as climate change? How can we make our
supply chain more sustainable and transparent in cooperation with our
suppliers and promote economic growth at the same time? Around
120 participants made clear recommendations for the future, e.g., greater consumer involvement and intensified cross-industry collaboration.
Raising internal awareness and fostering exchange
The goal of the first day was to show that every Deutsche Telekom
business area makes a sustainable contribution for our customers and
society. Deutsche Telekom employees presented products and solutions that help reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions among
others: cloud services, Connected Car and e-mobility or Dynamic Workplace. Participants discussed these and other sustainability benefits of
our current portfolio as part of subsequent round-table discussions and
explored ways to expand their favorable effects.

63

Opportunities and challenges from the perspective of stakeholders
On the second day, employees and external stakeholders took a more
in-depth look at issues in a workshop, including the topic of cloud
services [LINK 8628]. The workshop focused on the Dynamic Workplace, a Deutsche Telekom offer that enables business customers to
work regardless of their location. This means that employees can avoid
a trip to work and reduce CO2 emissions. Participants considered protecting data from unauthorized access (information on data protection
here) to be the greatest challenge when it comes to cloud services.
At the second workshop, participants discussed smart mobility solutions such as connected cars. An analysis we carried out together with
external experts showed that use of connected cars can reduce annual
CO2 emissions per vehicle by 15.9 percent (Connected Car). Participants at this workshop referred to data protection and security as important issues. They also considered large-scale development of infrastructure to be a significant basis for benefiting from these advantages.
Smart cities: Innovative solutions for urban spaces
Cities account for a large share of global CO2 emissions. At the same
time they can also be the driving force behind and the origin of sustainable solutions. Deutsche Telekom is dedicated to innovative solutions
that help reshape cities into smart urban spaces. One good example of
this is intelligent street lighting: sensors control lighting times and save
energy in the process.
We set up a one street lighting system with integrated motion, air
pollution, temperature, and acoustic sensors as part of a pilot project
in Dubrovnik in May 2015. In addition, the lighting solution that we installed in Budapest in November 2015 is equipped with a charging station for electric cars, a WiFi router, a security camera, and an emergency
button. Intelligent street lighting is a module within our Smart City concept and offers state-of-the-art communication infrastructures to support sustainable city development.
Telekom Romania also works towards the goal of transforming cities
into smart urban spaces. Since 2015, the company runs several pilot
projects in one Bucharest district that include smart parking, smart
lightning, video surveillance and Managed Wi-Fi components. The first
phase of the pilot projects is due to be completed in the spring of 2016
and it is planned to expand these activities to other districts as well.
QIVICON – Living in a smart home
There are many ways in which a smart home can make life easier. It lets
residents conveniently control and monitor a large number of building
and security technology devices, including home entertainment. If in the
past customers bought a smart-home solution offered by one particular
provider, they could only use those functions and devices and not those
offered by other providers. The challenge therefore was to come up with
a multi-vendor smart home solution. Deutsche Telekom and other key
players together created the QIVICON platform on which any company,
regardless of their industry or size, can offer their own solutions. This
platform gives consumers the option to customize their own combination of different offers. More than 40 partner companies and brands
currently offer their solutions on the platform. New partners, including
Assa Abloy, Bosch Junkers, DOM, and Logitech, joined the platform
during the reporting period. In the energy sector, for example, consumers have had access to smart home offers from green energy provider
ENTEGA since October 2015, where they can optimize their energy

costs with solutions like smart heating thermostats. Other offers include
security and convenience products, with the range of QIVCION-based
offerings and compatible devices from different partners, growing
constantly.
End-to-end solutions for an easy start in the smart home market
Businesses in Germany and abroad can use the QIVICON-based smart
home platform combined with a Deutsche Telekom white label app as
part of an end-to-end solution. The app can be customized to meet
company needs and can be offered under the company's own brand.
In summer 2015 the Austrian-based eww Group became the first international partner to take advantage of this opportunity and is now
offering its own smart home offer to its end customers. This is a good
example of how easy it is for companies to quickly get started in the
market with an end-to-end home automation solution for addressing
topics such as energy management, security and convenience. In
addition to platform hosting, training and customer care (3rd level),
Deutsche Telekom also offers hardware sourcing.
We support the Eclipse Foundation, one of the world's largest independent open source communities. We also actively pursue intensified
collaboration with open source project partners and relevant bodies
as a way of encouraging compatibility and standardization. Deutsche
Telekom is planning to gradually make the programming interfaces for
the smart home platform accessible so that developers can create their
own applications and control devices in smart homes.
All communication via the QIVICON Home Base, which is connected to
the Internet via servers, is encrypted. Any user data related to QIVICON
is stored exclusively on Deutsche Telekom servers in Germany. All
devices made by brands managed via QIVICON employ wireless technology based on state-of-the art security functions.
Connected health solutions for improved healthcare
Connecting healthcare services has many advantages. Telemedical
assistance systems help patients and their families in their everyday
lives, make work easier for medical personnel and reduce costs. Deutsche Telekom helps shape the digital healthcare system with numerous
pilot projects. The primary goal is to enable the fast, secure exchange
of information between doctors, patients and health insurers.
Data collection at the patient's bedside
In 2015, Deutsche Telekom installed a digital information system with
200 iPad minis at Gemeinschaftskrankenhaus Bonn hospital. Around
150 physicians and 450 nurses use the tablets when dealing with
medical findings, diagnoses and X-ray images. They can access the
information and medical records they need at all times and from anywhere within the hospital; they can even modify this data from the
patient's bedside. Patients benefit as well. Digital documentation is
more precise and there are no errors because a colleague's handwriting
is illegible. Doctors can also carry out online medicine safety checks on
the tablets to exclude reactions to other medicines.
Smart home emergency call system
We presented a new smart home emergency call system at the geriatric
care trade fair in Hanover in 2016. The system works using sensors installed in the home, which are in turn connected to the intelligent soft-

64

ware of the emergency call system. The software is able to tell the difference between, say, a person bending down to pick something up and
someone who has fallen and requires help. Upon identifying a real
emergency situation, the system automatically uses a secure network
to alert the control center staffed by an emergency home care service
around the clock. The control center establishes contact with the
resident via the hands-free function. The system also gives the staff an
overview of the situation on-site by creating an image made impersonal
and indistinct for reasons of data privacy.
Entertain for Hospitals: entertainment and information for patients
With Entertain for Hospitals, hospitals can offer patients a comprehensive range of entertainment formats and information directly at their
bedside. The vendor-independent solution can be integrated into the
respective hospital information system. This allows patients to read the
information brochures made accessible to them, see their appointments
or order meals. Depending on the hospital's offer, patients can also
watch TV programs in the time-shift mode, download series, movies
and documentaries, surf the Internet, make phone calls and play
games. Around 3,000 beds had already been equipped with Entertain
for Hospitals throughout Germany by the end of 2015.
Role model project for comprehensive healthcare
We are building an open, accessible, interdisciplinary IT platform for
medical care for people living in Eastern Saxony in cooperation with
Carus Consilium Sachsen GmbH, a subsidiary of the Dresden University
Hospital. The CCS Telehealth Ostsachsen project is expected to help
guarantee comprehensive, local medical care in rural regions for patients in the comfort of their own homes. Cardiac patients, for example,
can use their tablets to send their vital data to the Dresdner Herzzentrum cardiology center for review. The data is processed by "telenurses"
who monitor vital signs and immediately inform a physician in case of
any doubt.
The pilot phase was started in 2015 after two years of development
work. Initial applications, such as at-home care for congestive heart
failure patients and outpatient follow-up care for stroke patients, were
launched in July 2015. Introducing CCS Telehealth Ostsachsen involved
creating telemedicine workstations, providing patients with tablets and
IP telephones and installing high-performing servers, scanners and a
central database. This approach makes the project a role model throughout Europe. The EU and the Free State of Saxony support the project,
for example, by funding it with almost EUR10 million.
Innovative solutions for Papageorgiou General
Hospital in Thessaloniki
In November 2015, OTE and CISCO completed the transformation of
the Papageorgiou General Hospital in Thessaloniki into a smart digital
hospital. Thanks to the innovative COSMOTE Business IT solutions and
the use of CISCO products nursing services were upgraded, patient
satisfaction improved, operative costs reduced and productivity increased. They installed wireless voice and data transmission systems that
allow staff authorized access to the hospital's information systems via
tablets or smartphones. CISCO's wireless infrastructure supports
all the security, quality and high performing characteristics in data transmission, thus facilitating the staff's workload while offering Internet
access to both patients and visitors.The two companies also proceeded

with the installation of a new IP phone center in the hospital and connected it up to the existing one. This unified infrastructure for Internetbased data and telephony also improves the hospital's internal communication effectiveness as staff can now accept internal calls to their
smartphones, while drastically reducing telecommunication costs as
well. Furthermore, location base servicesfor the hospital'ssignificant
assets were offered via RFID tags, which allow real-time monitoring
with 1-meter location accuracy, thus minimizing the cost of consumables and mobile asset monitoring. Last but not least, every hospital bed
now has atouch-screenbedside terminal that serves as an entertainment, information and support devicefor patients and visitors, as well as
a work tool for the hospital's nursing, medical, and administrative staff.

partners and put them in touch with investors. Teams from all over the
world are invited to present their solutions to us in Berlin and/or Bonn.
The Cloud Boot Camp was held in Berlin in November 2015. More than
12 start-ups participated, presenting their most innovative ideas and
solutions.

Promoting start-ups: creating scope for ideas
We have been running our own start-up incubator in Berlin since 2012
under the name hub:raum. At hub:raum, start-up teams can develop
their ideas in an "incubator" environment and then introduce them to
the market. Experienced start-up entrepreneurs work with the teams as
mentors. We also provide teams with a maximum of 300,000 euros in
seed funding.
Interested start-ups can go to the hub:raum website and apply for
acceptance to the program. Investments were made in three start-ups
in 2015:
 M2MGO offers web portal building blocks for the Internet of Things
 Teraki develops data-reduction software for the Internet of Things
 CiValue, the first investment in Israel, offers retailers a cloud-based
big data platform to optimize their customer retention strategies.
hub:raum currently hosts a total of eleven start-ups: Blinkist, Stylemarks,
Salonmeister, Reputami, Frestyl, Vigour.io, Contiamo, qLearning and
Flexperto. hub:raum also offers an ongoing accelerator program,
ChallengeUp. Start-up teams whose ideas complement Deutsche
Telekom's business policy can join the program to turn these ideas into
business models that qualify for funding. We provide them with the
hub:raum campus infrastructure at no charge as well as hub:raum program offers, which vary from week to week (e.g., mentor and expert
consultations, workshops, and events). More than 160 start-up teams
have already taken advantage of this offer in Berlin and Cracow.
In 2015, hub:raum initiated a new program. The start-up incubator launched the Internet of Things Accelerator in collaboration with Intel, Cisco
and hub:raum Cracow. The program paired 12 European start-ups with
mentors from the M2M sector. The start-ups worked with their mentors
to develop use cases from July to November 2015. The teams were specially flown in to Cracow, Berlin, Dublin and London so that they could
work closely on the cases with their mentors. The goal was
to support the start-ups with the companies' sales expertise and expert
know-how as well as to enable the companies to access new technologies through the partnerships.
hub:raum introduced a new, topic-based event format referred to as
boot camps in 2014. At these events, start-ups are given the chance to
"boot" themselves (like booting an operating system), i.e., get noticed.
We also use these events to present the start-ups as Deutsche Telekom

Sustainable ICT solutions

Deutsche Telekom is helping millions of consumers and business customers effectively lower their energy consumption and reduce CO2 emissions with our growing offer of green products and innovative ICT solutions. We have been offering services to dematerialize business processes such as online billing, digitized workflows and cloud computing for
several years now. This contributes to the success of our "Low-carbon
society" CR action area. We also want to give as many people as possible the chance to participate in the information society and to use the
opportunities it offers. For example, we make it easier for people with
age-related or physical limitations to use modern means of communication. We develop products and services that meet their needs and continue to work on improving user friendliness. Throughout the Group,
Deutsche Telekom also offers various subsidized rates to provide lowincome customers and people with disabilities with an opportunity to
place calls and surf the Internet at low cost.
Product certifications: Blue Angel for speedphones
We see sustainable products as crucial in helping us distinguish ourselves in the ICT market. That is why we require our suppliers to comply
with environmental and social requirements and monitor this compliance. We also keep our customers informed about environmental
aspects, manufacturing conditions, safe, low-energy and demandbased usage, and resource-conserving disposal options at the end of
the product life cycle. We rely on renowned environmental labels for this
purpose.
Blue Angel for Deutsche Telekom products
95 percent of Telekom Deutschland's fixed-network devices are certified
with the renowned Blue Angel environmental label. All of our Sinus
series DECT phones have been awarded the independent environmental label since 2013. We were awarded the Blue Angel award within the
context of the German Sustainability Award in November 2015 for our
involvement and our role as pioneers and communicators of climate
protection.
Our Speedphone series received the Blue Angel certification during the
reporting period. The new IP telephones are particularly energy-efficient, low-radiation and come with replaceable batteries. A new feature
lets users configure the transmission power individually and thereby
save energy. Updates can directly be transferred to the Speedphone,
making the devices easy to update, extending their useful lives and
reducing their carbon footprint.
TUEV Certified Green Products
In addition to the Blue Angel we are increasingly focusing on the TUEV
Certified Green Product environmental label. This label exceeds the
Blue Angel criteria in ways such as requiring inspections of working
conditions at production sites. Some of our products have already been
certified, for example, the Speedphone 10 and the W 724V router.

Protecting resources with cloud computing
Cloud computing is often more resource- and energy-efficient than operating ICT processes outside of the cloud. Customers no longer need
their own servers and storage media. Thanks to more effective capacity
utilization, our data centers require less hardware, which means less
energy consumption. Compared to a customer running their own infrastructure, this solution reduces energy consumption by up to 80 percent. We are also constantly improving the efficiency of our data centers.
Before making the switch to the cloud we make a cloud maturity check
to analyze our business customers' business and IT processes. Our
assessment is based on the maturity method published by the Open
Data Center Alliance (ODCA). This helps our customers come up with
the best cloud strategy for their business. We offer the T-Systems integration platform, Data Orchestration as a Service to make the integration
of cloud services as smooth and easy as possible. The service enables
a seamless interplay between information in the cloud and traditional
on-site systems at customer offices, giving our customers faster access
to new, optimized cloud services.
Sustainable solutions from the cloud
 With our Cloud Integration Center product (formerly: Enterprise
Marketplace) we have been offering standardized cloud solutions
tailored to large enterprises since 2014. Companies can access
cloud services based on demand from our Cloud Integration Center.
Their applications, servers, and other infrastructure are operated
at our data centers. Customers can also access applications from
external software manufacturers (Shared Software as a Service –
Shared SaaS) at our Cloud Integration Center including a sustainability management software that T-Systems began selling in collaboration with the WeSustain software firm in November 2013.
 T-Systems also offers the doculife® product, which companies can
use to fully transfer their document management processes to the
cloud. Not only does the solution reduce energy consumption, it can
also be used to significantly reduce paper consumption thanks to
digitization.
 Deutsche Telekom supports companies that develop their own
cloud services by offering cloud infrastructure solutions (Infrastructure as a Service – IaaS). Existing hardware is replaced by cloud services, reducing companies' energy consumption. We also offer
development platforms (Platform as a Service – PaaS) like AppAgile.
Along with a technical development environment for IT developers,
we also make industry-specific business applications available from
the cloud.

Don't buy, rent
By using our products, our customers can help conserve resources and
reduce electronic waste and CO2 emissions. In this context we are focusing on two models: rental services for routers and media receivers and
used cell-phone collection programs.
We want to make sure that old routers and media receivers do not just
end up in the trash. That is why we promote the "Don't buy, rent"
approach. Introducing a twelve-month minimum contract term for
routers and media receivers helps to extend the average usage time and
reduces returns during the minimum lease period. When a contract is
canceled, the customer returns the devices and the devices are then either reused or professionally recycled. We also introduced a return portal
to simplify the return process, which cuts back on paper receipts and
also allows customers to process their returns via the online return portal as needed.
We actively and effectively promote the rental service in many ways
including at Telekom Shops, online, via customer service and in product
flyers. The offer has met with great customer response. The number of
people using our rental service had increased to some 8.2 million by the
end of 2015.

Used cell-phone collection
Too many used cell phones and smartphones are stuck in drawers or
disposed of illegally with the household waste. Germany's recycling and
reuse rate for small electronic appliances is much too low. Which is why
used cell phones, smartphones and tablets need to either be repaired
and reused or recycled properly. We have been offering different ways
for people to hand in their devices since 2003.
Customers have been able to return their used, high-end cell phones
and smartphones to Telekom Shops under a buyback program since
2013. They then receive a voucher equivalent to the monetary value of
their devices that they can use to make purchases at a Telekom Shop.
In 2014 we introduced the online collection portal Handysammelcenter
in cooperation with Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH). Companies can use
the portal to properly and safely dispose of their used cell phones and
smartphones free of charge and receive a certificate as confirmation.
Devices in good condition are generally reused. Public authorities, associations and other organizations can use the portal to initiate their own
collection campaigns. The entire collection process has been certified
by DEKRA. Any profit generated in this way is donated to nature conservation and environmental protection projects run by DUH.
During the reporting period we collaborated with DUH to support the
cell-phone collection campaign run by the churches of the state of
Baden-Württemberg. The goal is to collect 100,000 used phones. The
campaign is scheduled to run for two years and end in May 2017. The
members of the German Bundestag also continue to support our cellphone collection efforts. Just like in 2014, they collected used cell phones at their offices and from their constituencies in 2015. They ended
up collecting 2,500 used phones, more than twice as many as the year
before.
The collection campaign at schools in the state of Saarland, in which
we have been participating since the 2014/2015 school year, was
extended due to the great response. The campaign is under the patronage of Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Minister President of Saarland,
and includes special course offers on cell-phone collection and
resource efficiency. The campaign is now open to associations and
communities in addition to educational institutions. The collection
campaign has been honored as a “WerkstattN-project” from the German
Council for Sustainable Development and therefore belongs to one of
the 100 most innovative sustainability projects in Germany.

Blacklist on environmentally harmful materials
In 2014 we conducted a study on harmful materials in cell phones in
collaboration with the Fraunhofer Institute for Reliability and Microintegration. The study identified materials that, although harmful to the
environment, are currently not prohibited. We defined Deutsche
Telekom's own list of prohibited materials over and above those covered
by legal standards in order to send out a clear signal for a reduction in
the industrial usage of substances that are problematic for the environment. In the meantime we have discussed this topic with suppliers and
have already found broad consistency with the respective material
blacklists at some of our suppliers. Deutsche Telekom will continue
to engage in constructive dialog to find ways to avoid these materials.

In 2015, we collected 230,751 used cell phones and smartphones
throughout Germany and either reused them or had them properly
recycled. The whole process is DEKRA certified and fulfills high data
protection requirements. The joint cell-phone collection system run
by Telekom Deutschland and DUH entered its twelfth year in 2015.
More than 2 million used cell phones have been collected so far.
Handset recycling at T-Mobile USA
T-Mobile USA’s device recycling program mobilizes customers to help
reduce environmental and human health impacts from improper recycling. The company is also increasing access to quality reusable and
refurbished equipment for those who need them, while conserving our
limited natural resources.

Any wireless consumer can bring any make, model or carrier phone,
battery, accessory, tablet or netbook into any T-Mobile USA location
to be recycled for free. Through the JUMP! and Mobilize programs,
T-Mobile USA incentivizes its customers to trade in their used devices
and accessories for great deals on the latest technology. Those tradeins are all reused, refurbished or recycled.
T-Mobile USA launched the recycling program for its customers in 2008,
resulting in over 9.5 million devices being reused or resold since then.
86 percent of the devices that are taken back are reused or resold, with
the rest being responsibly recycled by providers selected on the basis of
their leading industry environmental certification1.Since 2013, T-Mobile
has sold over 1.4 million cell phones refurbished to its high standards
directly to its customers through theCertified Pre-Owned program.
In 2015, T-Mobile USA collected 4,029,970 used cell phones.
Accessible products and services
Deutsche Telekom makes it easier for people with disabilities to have
access to the knowledge and information society. Not only do we offer
subsidized rates to people from low-income households, we also offer
them to people with hearing and vision impairments. Our company also
supports them with products and solutions especially designed to meet
their needs.
Products and services for the hearing impaired
We set up a hotline (Deaf Hotline) for deaf and hearing-impaired customers in 2003, which offers customers immediate IT assistance, among
other services. Customers can send an e-mail, fax message or letter, or
use their video phone to communicate with our specially trained employees for any requests they may have. The employee either answers the
question directly or lets the person know how to contact them via video
telephony or webcam to talk about the issue. Up to 50 people currently
call the hotline every day to get help with problems involving their DSL
routers or find out more about special cell-phone rate plans, for
example.
We have been conducting a campaign entitled "Accessible sales and
service for the hearing impaired" since 2013. Special sales channels for
people with hearing impairments are set up as part of the campaign.
Deutsche Telekom began featuring special offers in 2014 for our deaf
and hearing-impaired customers on a website tailored to their needs, for
example. We also provide detailed information on these offers in video
messages filmed in sign language. The website also features Deutsche
Telekom support videos with subtitles providing information on our rate
plans and products. In November 2015 we added new mobile rate
plans to our portfolio, customized to fit the communication needs of the
hearing-impaired.

Tablets for the blind
Online communication can pose a challenge for people who are blind
or visually impaired. We support the Green Vision project, which develops special tablets for these user groups. What is special about the
Green Vision tablets is its haptic, interactive interface that provides content in Braille. The tablets literally make mobile online content tangible.
In line with the project's name, Green Vision, production of the prototype
is also intended to conserve natural resources.

First network provider in Germany to offer smartphone for seniors
Since October 2014, we have been offering a smartphone especially
developed for seniors – the Liberto 820. We are currently the only German network operator to offer this type of device. With its simple user
interface, even inexperienced cell-phone users have no problem using
all the functions of a high-performance Android device. Users are taken
through the device step by step and shown how to use it. The device
can even be set up and administered remotely via an online device
manager. The Liberto 820 is compatible with hearing aids and has an
emergency button and two simple menu versions, making it especially
suitable for seniors.
hello holnap! – the sustainability mobile app
At its 7th Sustainability Day in September 2014, Magyar Telekom launched the hello holnap! mobile phone app as part of its hello holnap!
sustainability initiative. Since then it has been downloaded 7,500 times
from AppleStore, GooglePlay and Windows Store. The app enables
users to earn points for performing tasks supporting sustainable development that are organized by the operator and its partners. The points
can then be redeemed in Forints and spent on donations. The app’s
game partners include 30km.hu, Oszkar teleauto, the ShoppingBag
shoppers' community, Heroes of Responsible Dining, Autistic Art, as
well as supporters such as Budapest Bike Mafia, the Suhanj! Foundation, the Autonomia Foundation, the Heti Betevő Foundation, the Hungarian Ornithological and Nature Conservation Society, and the National
Society of Conservationists. The tasks users can earn points for include:
 Donations to organizations through achievements
 Partnership with sharing economy companies to collect points (e.g.
carpooling or food from local farmers)
Donation
partnerships with NGOs

Points can also be earned by buying a sustainability-related mobile
phone from the Magyar Telekom portfolio. Magyar Telekom defines a
sustainability-related phone as one that either has an international certificate (e.g. TCO) or an environmental sustainability declaration or social
attributes (e.g. for elderly people or the disabled).
First “digital tree” with Wi-Fi connectivity in Romania
In March 2015 Telekom Romania and Smart Sun Solutions “planted”
the first digital tree in Romania in Timisoara. This Strawberry Tree, the
world’s first solar energy-based public mobile-device charger offering
Wi-Fi connectivity, is very suitable for “planting” in parks, open-air restaurants or commercial areas. The internet connection is based on 3G
or 4G technology, depending on the coverage, and has a reach of
approx. 10 meters. The system’s rechargeable batteries store the energy
and can run for up to 14 days. The Strawberry Tree allows simultaneous
charging of up to 16 devices and has an annual capacity of up to
840,000 10-minute charges. It is not only a very innovative concept but
also an environmental-friendly one with an eco-design and a neutral carbon footprint, while offering a friendly, convenient and inspiring service
in crowded public places.

In October, T-Mobile Czech Republic put a new service into all its 158
branded and partner shops. This free service offers remote simultaneous speech transcription, allowing deaf and hearing-impaired persons
to conveniently view a shop assistant’s answers on a tablet display. The
service organized by Transkript online, a charity, in cooperation with the
Czech Union of the Deaf (CUD) works quite simply: the shop assistant
lends the tablet with this online app to the hearing-impaired customer
and then connects him or her to the transcriber. What the shop assistant
says is transferred to the transcriber’s headphones and within moments
appears as written text on the tablet display. An additional benefit is that
this service generates work for visually impaired people who have the
ability to focus intensively on speech and thus utilize their disability as
a professional advantage in this e-transcription service.

T-Mobile Austria introduces Fairphone 2 in Austria
Since early 2016 T-Mobile Austria has been offering new and current
customers the opportunity to choose a sustainable way of life when it
comes to their smartphones. The company is one of the first mobile
network providers in the world to combine a mobile contract with the
Fairphone 2, the first sustainable, socially responsible smartphone.
T-Mobile Austria actively supports the Dutch company Fairphone in their
efforts to raise awareness of fair electronics and promote responsibility
in the industry.
Fairphone focuses on four main challenges: to make mining at the
beginning of the value chain, design, production and the product life
cycle more sustainable and transparent. In order to achieve this goal
the company cooperates with initiatives for the extraction of tin and
tantalum from conflict-free mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
It also created the first pilot supply chain for fair-trade gold in smartphones and promotes longevity through the modular product design
of the Fairphone 2. In order to facilitate long-term use of the product,
spare parts for the Fairphone 2 can be ordered via T-Mobile Austria.
National Companies expand products and services
for hearing-impaired people
Together with a specialist partner Migam, Poland’s market leader in
new technologies for deaf-mutes, T-Mobile Poland launched the project
“We Connect Everyone Everywhere”, aiming to use state-of-the-art technology to align the educational and vocational opportunities of people
suffering from hearing loss. Among other activities, the company turns
its points of sale into disability-friendly outlets, translates selected contents of T-Mobile Poland’s website into sign language and trains employees to provide a good service to deaf customers. In 2015 the company
conducted a dialog with a society of hearing-impaired Poles to better
address their specific needs. Since June, customers with a relevant
medical certificate are also eligible for the “MIG JUMP!” offer, a big data
package that allows internet communication tools, apps and video calls
to be freely used.

Slovak Telekom is also very active in developing comprehensive programs and activities to support hearing-impaired people and families
with hearing-impaired children in mastering their everyday lives. In September the Pontis Foundation received support from the Endowment
Fund Telekom in launching a free online interpreter service that enables
deaf people to better communicate at offices or doctors by contacting
an interpreter via a mobile phone or tablet. To support hearing parents
of hearing-impaired children properly stimulate and develop their
children, Slovak Telekom has prepared a relevant TV spot and print
campaign. In addition, parents and children are supported through a
mobile teacher program that helps children to hear and then speak. The
company also launched a community portal where parents with hearing-impaired children can exchange and find important information.
“I see, I hear, I react!” – educational campaign in
cooperation with the National Police Headquarters
T-Mobile cares about the safety of its customers and their families, and
it wants to involve as many people as possible in its assistance scheme.
For this reason, as the first mobile operator in Poland, T-Mobile Polska
entered into a long-term collaboration with the National Police Headquarters as part of the Child Alert system in January 2016.
As the first operator in Poland, T-Mobile enables customers to receive
information about a child who has gone missing. In practice, if there are
circumstances indicating that a child has gone missing or has been
kidnapped, T-Mobile will send its customers a special MMS (Child
Alert), which is a message prepared by the police containing basic
details of the event and the child involved. Such an MMS will only be
sent after announcing the search in the Child Alert system.
This free project will not only help to locate missing children, it also promotes the idea of “Technology for good”, an educational campaign on
how the technology can help and provide safety for customers. It complies with T-Mobile’s corporate social responsibility strategy and the
culture of helping the company has built up.

Consumer protection and security

In October 2015, the European Court of Justice determined that the
Safe Harbor Agreement was invalid. In accordance with the agreement,
U.S. companies were able to self-certify that they met European data
privacy regulations. But these principles were not effectively implemented at those companies. Edward Snowden's revelations also
demonstrated that U.S. security authorities store all of the personal data
transmitted to the United States. The protection of personal data is part
of the shared fundamental values in Europe. It is now up to the German
government, the EU Commission and the United States to create an
appropriate basis for secure data exchange between Europe and the
United States.
For Deutsche Telekom, the European Court of Justice's decision means
that we are heading in the right direction. We called for an "Internet
of short distances" at an early stage, ensuring a direct path from the
sender to the recipient when transferring data - without any detours
through other jurisdictions such as the United States. This has already
been implemented in our networks.
European business customers are critical of data storage outside of
Europe; demand for secure cloud services "made in Europe" is growing.
Our security solutions integrate these requirements; we guarantee the
same high security standards for all of our data centers. We also develop products for consumers, such as products offering end-to-end encryption, and solutions for SMEs to detect and fend off hacker attacks in
real time. In addition to data security, we have also introduced measures
for consumer and youth protection.
To us, security is more than just protecting data and infrastructure it also means protecting the public's health. We have established a
Group-wide basis for this with our EMF policy.

Customer and youth protection

Customer and youth protection

Protecting our customers is top priority at Deutsche Telekom. Whether
it be the privacy of personal data or banning web content that is harmful
to minors, Deutsche Telekom stands for high standards when it comes
to consumer and youth protection. One example of the high security
standard is De-Mail, our service for the legally secure identification of
e-mail senders and recipients. We are also setting a new security standard for sending private e-mails with the E-Mail made in Germany industry initiative, which we co-founded. We want to teach children and young
people how to use digital media safely and effectively and protect them
from inappropriate content. Numerous projects throughout the Group
aim to improve their media skills, and we work with a variety of initiatives
and partners to create a child-friendly Internet. We have reinforced our
stance with numerous national and international voluntary commitments and internal codes of conduct . In doing so, we often exceed the
standards required by national regulations.

Data privacy and security also play a key role in the development of our
other products and services. Our Privacy and Security Assessment
(PSA) procedure allows us to review the security of our systems in each
step of the development process. This procedure applies to newly developed systems as well as existing systems that undergo changes in technology or in the way data is processed. We use a standardized procedure to document the data privacy and data security status of our products throughout their entire life cycle. Youth protection aspects are also
taken into consideration in our product and service design. In Germany
we involve our youth protection officer in all issues regarding planning
and designing offers for young people. The youth protection officer can
then recommend limits or changes. In 2013, we also made it mandatory
for every international subsidiary within the EU to designate a child
safety officer (CSO) to handle youth-protection related topics. As a
result, at least one CSO was appointed in each of our European markets
in 2014. The CSO acts as a central contact for members of the community in the respective EU market. They also play a key internal role in
coordinating topics revolving around the protection of minors. These
measures increase the consistency and transparency of Deutsche
Telekom's involvement in protecting minors.
Strategic approach to protecting minors from unsuitable
media content
Our strategy to protect children and young people from harm when
using digital media is based on three pillars. We

Protecting consumers and young people
Data privacy and data security are very important to us. In 2008, we
created a special Board of Management department for this topic and
introduced the Binding Corporate Rules on Privacy specifying how
personal data is to be collected, stored, and processed at the Deutsche
Telekom Group. Not only do we provide transparent information on all
of our activities and measures in our annual Data Privacy and Data
Security Report, we also take stock of the current situation: What has
Deutsche Telekom achieved? What do politicians consider to be the
areas needing the most improvement? And what do experts think about
the current state of data privacy and data security?
Our products and services have always provided a high degree of data
privacy and data security. Growing volumes of data require special precautions to protect the privacy of citizens, which is why we approved
eight mandatory principles for handling big data, or large amounts of
personal data, in 2013. In January 2015, we also approved specific
measures to protect data and infrastructure in our "Ten-point program
for increased cyber security." We also developed new protective products including our Mobile Encryption app designed to ensure end-toend encryption of mobile communication.

 provide attractive, age-appropriate offers for children and give
parents and guardians tools (filters) that they can use to restrict
the access minors have to harmful content,
 work to fight child abuse and child pornography and
 promote skills to help people use the Internet safely.
We also collaborate closely with prosecuting authorities and NGOs as
well as other partners from business, politics, and society to ban online
content that is harmful to children and young people.
We documented our commitment to protecting minors from unsuitable
media content in Germany in relevant codes and introduced minimum
standards.
In 2007, we committed ourselves to fighting child pornography on the
Internet throughout the European Union. At a global level, we have been
a member of the global association of mobile providers, GSMA since
2008, which pursues the same objectives. In order to better coordinate
our activities within the Group, we also approved a list of general guidelines in October 2013 for our activities to help protect minors from unsuitable media content and made these guidelines mandatory at internatiDeutsche Telekom - Corporate Responsibility Report 2015

onal level, thereby setting new standards in our markets. In consideration of their particular cultural situation and business model, each
international subsidiary in the European Union can further specify these
measures, adopt additional measures, and also determine their own
strategic focal points.
Because protecting minors from unsuitable media content poses a
challenge that affects many industries, we cooperate with different organizations for the protection of minors and participate in coalitions that
coordinate the involvement of companies and organizations from the
Internet and media sector. For example, we are a member of the "CEO
Coalition to make the Internet a better place for kids." We also
play a leading role in the ICT Coalition for the Safer Use of Connected
Devices and Online Services by Children and Young People in the EU.
In this coalition, we pursue a comprehensive cross-industry approach
based on six principles that expressly includes helping young people
learn media skills.
In January 2013, as part of both coalitions, Deutsche Telekom
announced plans to implement an EU-wide set of measures based
on the principles of the ICT Coalition. The ICT Coalition published an
annual report in April 2014 on the implementation of corresponding
measures at all of the companies represented in the ICT coalition.
The report, which was written by an independent expert from the
Dublin Institute of Technology, comes to the conclusion that Deutsche
Telekom's approach to implementing the ICT Coalition's principles is
exemplary.
Protecting personal data
According to a survey carried out by the IfD Allensbach institute for its
2015 Security Report, Deutsche Telekom is the most trustworthy company among German telecommunications and Internet providers when
it comes to data privacy. Greater value is generally placed on the protection of personal data in Germany compared to other countries, which is
why the services we provide to our customers are hosted in particularly
secure data centers.
We document our wide range of data protection activities in our annual
Data Privacy and Data Security Report. The following are just a few
examples of our activities during the reporting period.
Encrypted e-mails for everyone
As of mid-2016, Deutsche Telekom and the Fraunhofer Institute for
Secure Information Technology (SIT) will begin providing Volksverschlüsselung, a simple and free e-mail encryption service for everyone.
The solution is operated by Deutsche Telekom at a high-security data
center. The goal is to make state-of-the-art encryption methods accessible to everyone. Cryptographic keys are created directly on the user's
end device and never leave their device, making sure that they are never
available to the infrastructure operator. To use the encryption, users only
need to install the software and identify themselves as part of a simple
one-time process. In the first step, users are identified via the established Deutsche Telekom registration processes or with the aid of an electronic ID card. Other processes for secure identification are planned at a
later stage.

Testing Deutsche Telekom apps
In October 2015, Deutsche Telekom data protection and security specialists examined the security levels of 30 company apps. Focus was
placed on the most popular apps in the Apple and Google download
stores, including the We Care app magazine. They also checked how
and when the apps provide the requested data privacy information. Can
customers find sufficient information at the store - i.e., before downloading the software? How detailed is the data privacy information?
Overall, the testers were satisfied with the outcome. Results were particularly favorable with regard to data minimization and restriction of use
to defined purposes, which means that apps do not store or use any
personal user data not required to operate the app. But the testers also
detected room for improvement. The most common criticism referred
to shortcomings in data privacy notices, for example when it comes to
contents or detectability within the app. Unfortunately, not all apps use
the Deutsche Telekom privacy icon yet, a data protection icon developed by Deutsche Telekom that refers the user to privacy-by-design functions. The specialists also detected some potential for optimization in
terms of data security. The Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information
Technology (Fraunhofer SIT) got involved in the vulnerability analyses
and provided Deutsche Telekom with test software to identify critical
potential security gaps commonly used by attackers. Any vulnerabilities
found were documented and corrected.
TÜV data privacy certification for phone bills
Telekom issues around 27 million phone bills each month in the
German consumer segment alone. TÜViT once again certified the
billing processes used by Telekom Deutschland in 2015, assessing
both data protection and IT security. By granting this certification,
TÜV technical services agency has confirmed that Telekom handles
customer data securely and in compliance with legal regulations.
Beware of fake bills
Time and again, criminals try to spread malicious code on computers
using fake Telekom bills. Deutsche Telekom started adding further
security features to their online bills in February 2015. In addition to
addressing customers personally and including the customer's account
number, online bills now also include the customer's address. Customers can recognize authentic online Telekom bills by the forgery-proof
e-mail seal. It appears highlighted in customer e-mail inboxes and
provides a quick overview of whether the e-mail was actually sent by
Telekom. We have also introduced an invisible signature that is read by
Internet providers as part of the e-mail transfer. Providers can tell from
the signature whether an e-mail originates from a trustworthy sender or
whether it is a fake e-mail indicating Deutsche Telekom as the sender.
The online Deutsche Telekom security guide
Information on cyber criminals, malware and phishing is distributed over
thousands of websites on the Net. The www.sicherdigital.de website
brings this information together, providing users with easy access to
security issues. Young people, adults and businesses can find useful
information and specific tips concerning security and data protection.
The "Confidential" issue of our We Care app talks about how dangerous
hacker attacks can be and how users can protect themselves.

Deutsche Telekom wins Outstanding Security
Performance Awards
Deutsche Telekom was given three awards for its security policies at
the German Security Conference in Berlin in November 2015. The Facebook Privacy app, Threat Management and Security Partnership Against
Metal Theft were all singled out for recognition.
The jury decided that Deutsche Telekom was No. 1 in Germany in the
Outstanding Security Provider category. Its Facebook Privacy app
shows users who can see their personal content, who can find them on
Facebook and who can post to their wall. Users can adjust their privacy
settings with a single click to better protect their privacy.
Deutsche Telekom's threat management system was celebrated as an
Outstanding Security Adviser. It ensures that all employees can get on
with their jobs free of fear or violence. Anyone can contact the colleagues at Threat Management in the event of sudden physical approaches or if they feel they are being pursued, if threatened with physical or
mental violence or unusual observations, such as when
others express violent fantasies. Certified threat managers have helped
around 200 colleagues over more than two years.
The jury also praised the SIPAM (Security Partnership Against Metal
Theft) as an Outstanding Security Partnership. This partnership, composed of associations and companies from the logistics, telecommunications, mining and energy sectors, was founded in 2012 at the initiative
of Deutsche Telekom, Deutsche Bahn and RWE as well as the
Association of German Metal Traders (VDM). Most of the members
operate critical infrastructures which are essential to the population,
business, and government.
Child protection software and Surfgarten browser
As a leading ICT provider, we promote to the best of our ability a secure,
positive online experience for children and young people. With ageappropriate websites and content we provide children and young
people in Germany and other countries with exciting, attractive online
content. There is, however, other, unsuitable online content on the
Net aside from these offers. That is why we provide filters that parents
can use to make it difficult for their children to access content that is
dangerous or may impair their development. One of the two programs
for the protection of young people under ages 16 and 18 from dangerous content recognized by the Commission for the Protection of Minors
in the Media (KJM) was our child protection software. Parents (or other
legal guardians) can use the software to flexibly determine which
content their children (or wards) can access.
We also developed the Surfgarten browser for the iPhone, iPad, and
iPod Touch for protecting minors in Germany. Both our German child
protection software and Surfgarten contain a technological solution that
identifies the age-rating of websites. We also integrated the fragFinn.de
search engine in both software solutions.
The cell-phone user's license for children
We also offer solutions that enable children and young people to safely
use cell phones. At IFA 2015, we introduced our new Family Card Start
family plan, mainly intended for use by children. In the basic version of
Family Card Start, fee-based mobile data use (excluding WiFi) is initially
blocked by default. There is also the option to block calls to fee-based

73

special phone numbers and value-added services. With the launch of
the new plan and as part of the "Cell-phone beginners" campaign, we
also published our cell-phone user's license on YouTube. The goal is
to raise awareness among children regarding responsible smartphone
use.
In addition to these solutions, we also promote secure and responsible
media use among young people with our Teachtoday initiative. The initiative supports children and their families with practical and everyday
tips and materials.
Taking action against child pornography
Deutsche Telekom considers it its obligation to take rigorous action
against depictions of child abuse on the Internet. Deutsche Telekom has
been involved in an EU-wide fight against the depiction of child abuse
since 2007 in the European Framework for Safer Mobile Use by Younger
Teenagers and Children. Since 2008 we have been committed to combating the spread of such content initiated by the global association of
mobile providers GSMA.
Since 2013 we have also been participating in two cross-industry
coalitions committed to fighting child abuse on the Internet, the "CEO
Coalition to make the Internet a better place for kids" and the "ICT
coalition forthe safer use of connected devices and online services by
children and young people in the EU." The ICT Coalition published its
first annual report in 2014. The report acknowledges our involvement in
this area. We continue to be active in both coalitions and remain fully
committed to their principles.
Working with the Center for Online Child Protection
As in 2014, we continued to participate in the Center for Child Protection on the Internet (I-KiZ) during the reporting period, a project run by
the German Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women,
and Youth. The "Network against the abuse and sexual exploitation of
children – No grey areas on the Internet," was initiated in 2014 as part
of the project. The aim of the network, which is under the patronage of
Manuela Schwesig, Federal Minister of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens,
Women and Youth, is to effectively fight the online depiction of children
and young people in sexual poses and ban it internationally. It started its
work by setting up a competence center designed to investigate the
"grey areas" facilitating sexual abuse on the Internet.
Encouraging the responsible use of mobiles
T-Mobile Netherlands undertakes various activities under the auspices
of the Responsible Mobile Use Program:
Financial Responsibility Program
Due to the fact that many households in the Netherlands are struggling
financially and for various reasons are having difficulties paying their
monthly bills, T-Mobile Netherlands started building a new and disruptive program focusing on financial responsibility in 2015. The program
follows a very innovative and personal approach that aims to make a
difference for the company in terms of keeping its customers, and for
society by helping customers to overcome financial difficulties.The
program is based on six projects implemented by a cross-functional
team within T-Mobile Netherlands and in cooperation with different
partners:

Consumer protection and security
Customer and youth protection

1. Guest lectures on debt prevention in schools during National
Money Week: This nationwide project week organized by the Ministry
of Finance particularly targets primary schools. As 90% of children get
their first mobile phone when they are 11 or 12 years old, T-Mobile
Netherlands provided guest lectures to teach children how to prevent
high costs resulting from mobile use and use their connection in a responsible way. With almost 150 colleagues involved, the guest lectures
reached over 4,500 children. The company’s employees held the guest
lectures with materials provided by the company. The objective is to
reach out to 10,000 children in 2016.
2. Financial Cafés 2.0: Situated in easy approachable community centers or libraries, Financial Cafés run by the NGO Humanitas enable people with financial problems to just drop in and get help from a volunteer
or a social worker. In the 2.0 version, big corporates such as T-Mobile
Netherland are working together to learn from each other now best to
collect money from the same customer in a very humane way, i.e. coordinated by Humanitas volunteers. The volunteers are trained on the
T-Mobile debt-collection procedures and have a direct point of contact
in the company. This is helping the company to improve its dunning processes in a social and fair manner.

Traffic safety
In September 2014 the Dutch Transport Ministry and Safe Traffic
Netherlands launched a campaign about the safe use of mobile phones
in road vehicles: "Keep Your Eyes on the Road”. T-Mobile Netherlands
was the first company from the telecom sector to adopt the campaign
and support it through flyers in stores and especially in social media. A
similar campaign was launched to encourage safe cycling since 20%
of all cycling accidents in the Netherlands are caused by social media
use in traffic. The fietsmodus-app activates a traffic mode that works in
similar fashion to flight mode. In 2015 T-Mobile Netherlands upgraded
this campaign and customized it to the T-Mobile brand by making a
special promotion film featuring the CEO and adding some extra prizes.
One of the prizes users can win is a T-Mobile cycle. As a result the
number of users more than doubled.
De Kindertelefoon
Since 2010 T-Mobile has been sponsoring De Kindertelefoon, a helpline
where children in particular can anonymously call for help. T-Mobile
enables children and young people to use their mobile phone to make
free calls to this Kindertelefoon.In 2015 the helpline was contacted
nearly 600,000 times.

3. Poverty Coalition: This partnership between corporate banks, insurance companies, energy companies, bailiffs, money collecting companies, universities and tax authorities is working to prevent and fight
poverty among Dutch households in the Netherlands.
4. Social SIMs: More than 600,000 people in the Netherlands are
unemployed – not just the 40+, but also 20- to 30-year-olds. A large proportion of them are in debt and facing great problems. But in order to
participate in society and the labor market it is important be reachable
via phone. T-Mobile Netherlands is cooperating with local municipalities
to provide the unemployed and people with debts with special SIM
cards featuring a charitable tariff. In addition to the SIM cards, T-Mobile
Netherlands is also offering job application workshops, short internships, soft skill training courses, and workshops on how to prevent
debts.
5. Outbound calling team: T-Mobile brought a team of empathic
colleagues together as a special outbound calling team that calls
customers involved in the dunning process. Instead of asking them to
pay, the message is “How are you? We appreciate you very much as
a loyal costumer. Can we help you?” This is being undertaken with the
understanding that basically, every customer is willing to pay and for
customers in financial trouble an appropriate solution can always be
found.
6. Financial debt prevention through product design: As a telecom
provider T-Mobile Netherlands is aware of its responsibility to protect
customers against fraud, unexpected costs, bill shocks, taking out
subscriptions they cannot afford or problematic telecom debts. T-Mobile
Netherlands therefore introduced new services (Stel Samen Stel Bij)
that enable customers to adjust their usage in real time. With the
T-Mobile App customers enjoy real-time insights into their costs and
usage. To prevent bill shocks the company also contacts customers in
real time if usage is high. And if a specific customer cannot be reached,
the services are temporarily stopped.

Cyber Security

The hacker community continues to grow more professional and the
damage they cause often affects all company departments. Vulnerabilities often meet with automated attacks as early as 8 hours after being
published on the Net. As a responsible ICT provider, we are fighting this
trend. Our business model includes guaranteeing our customers a high
degree of security and effectively protecting the data and infrastructure
of the people and companies who use our services from unauthorized
access.

Protecting our infrastructure
Protecting our customers from online dangers is a major concern at our
company. In our Cyber Security business area, we have the capacities
necessary not only to identify cyber attacks in plenty of time but also to
respond quickly with countermeasures. We are also developing new
ways to prevent attacks on an ongoing basis. To help us do this, we opened our own Cyber Defense Center where we analyze online behavior
patterns and develop defense strategies.

With the aim of improving collaboration when it comes to digital security, we also regularly host the Cyber Security Summit in collaboration
with the Munich Security Conference. The next conference is scheduled
for 2016.
Telekom Security is pooling Deutsche Telekom's security expertise
During the reporting period the Board of Management decided to
create the new Telekom Security unit. Units working on the topics of
security that have been separate until now, such as the Cyber Security
business area, will be brought together here under one roof. The purpose
of consolidating these units is to increase our competitive edge and
develop new, innovative offers for our customers. Telekom Security is to
be formally established on April 1, 2016, and the new organization will
officially be launched as a full-fledged separate unit on January 1, 2017.
Study: Deutsche Telekom is Germany's leading
security provider
Deutsche Telekom is the leading provider of managed security services
in Germany. The analysts at Experton came to this conclusion in their
Security Vendor Benchmark 2015 study. They reported that Deutsche
Telekom has an attractive portfolio and proven competitive strength.
The analyst firm conducted an extensive review of the offers of 450
security providers for the first time for the study. Deutsche Telekom
received excellent ratings in the following categories: Security Information and Event Management, Mobile Security as a Service and Managed Security Services.

Collaborating in the name of security
Cyber security is a shared responsibility. We work with research institutes, industry partners, initiatives, standardization bodies, public institutions and other online service providers worldwide to fight cyber crime
and improve online security. We collaborate, for example, with
the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) throughout
Germany and with the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) at a European level.
To support our business customer segment we entered into a partnership with the AlienVault company in 2015. Together we offer a security
solution for cyber attacks developed especially for SMEs. The solution
lets SMEs use a defense system that was previously only available to
corporations with extensive IT resources. We presented the new offer
at CeBIT 2015 for the first time.

Mobile communication and health

Mobile communication and health

Electromagnetic fields (EMF) are a prevalent element in our connected
world, even if we are not able to perceive them directly. Their effects on
our health remain a topic of discussion. It is very important to make sure
that they do not present a problem for people or the environment when
we use them in mobile communications.
The effects of electromagnetic fields have been thoroughly researched
over past decades in numerous scientific studies. The World Health
Organization (WHO) analyzes the findings of scientific research and
recently made a statement regarding the results in October 2014. In its
statement the World Health Organization concludes that the current
threshold values for electromagnetic fields ensure that mobile communications technology can be used safely but that further research is
required.
Deutsche Telekom has made a commitment to actively address scientific research on mobile communications and health, and provides
detailed information on the Group website regarding the latest technology and scientific risk assessments published by expert committees
and organizations.

Striving for secure mobile communications
Our goal is to make our mobile communications infrastructure and
our new products, as well as the processes on which they are based,
as resource-efficient, secure and safe for health as possible. In Germany
these activities are based in particular on voluntary commitments by
mobile communications providers and an agreement with local authorities' associations. Compliance with these voluntary commitments is
reviewed every two years. The Informationszentrum Mobilfunk e.V.
(IZMF), an industry initiative by mobile communications enterprises,
submitted an extensive expert report on the topic to the German federal
government in May 2014; the next expert report is scheduled for spring
2016. Due to the changes in the German mobile communications industry that have led to a reduction in the number of member companies
involved, the IZMF was closed at the end of 2015. However, Telekom
Deutschland will continue its commitment to keeping the public informed by supporting the www.informationszentrum-mobilfunk.de information portal in collaboration with Telefónica.

Our Group-wide EMF Policy, which we adopted in 2004, plays a pivotal
role. The policy specifies standardized minimum requirements in the
area of mobile communications and health, requirements that by far
exceed those set forth by national laws. Our policy provides our national
companies with a mandatory framework that makes sure that the topic
of mobile communications and health is addressed in a consistent, responsible way throughout the Group. All of our national companies have
officially accepted the EMF Policy and implemented most of the required measures.
Our EMF Policy stipulates the following principles and measures:
 Transparency: We place importance on discussing issues involved
in mobile communications openly. We make all relevant information
regarding our mobile communications equipment in Germany
accessible to the public, e.g., on the EMF databases operated by
the German Federal Network Agency.
 Information: We provide consumer information that is easy to understand and pursue a fact-based, sound information policy. On our
Group website we provide the latest information to those interested.
We also provide our customers with information on the SAR levels
of their devices. In addition, customers can get information on SAR
levels at many of our shops, via our free environmental hotline or via
e-mail.
 Participation: We rely on close collaboration and constructive dialog
with all those involved, including communities, when it comes to
network expansion. Our goal is to find amicable solutions and
negotiate acceptable compromises, which can only be achieved by
responding fairly to critical arguments and being ready to learn from
mistakes.
 Research and partnerships: Our guidelines call for funding targeted
research, scientific excellence, transparency, objectivity and intelligibility.
We conduct quarterly reviews of compliance with our EMF Policy. The
findings are used to improve individual aspects and develop solutions
in different working groups such as the EMF Core Team and the EMF
Technical Working Group.
Evaluating and implementing the EMF Policy
Our goal is to put our EMF Policy into practice seamlessly throughout
the Group. We help our national companies do this by providing specific
tools. We developed standardized policies for funding research, for
example, and published these on the Deutsche Telekom website. Our
national companies will use these policies in their funding programs.

We also rely on the independent initiative of our national companies
and encourage them to continue to improve their measures even if
they have already effectively introduced the EMF Policy. The dialog
conducted by the Deutsche Telekom national companies with other
network providers and with consumers, politicians and scientists plays
a central role in this context.
Regular monitoring activities show us that the EMF Policy is being
implemented in all of our action areas. We also continue to optimize
current measures being employed at national-company level.
 IZMF conducted a measurement campaign through the end of 2015
to provide the population and stakeholders with information on EMF.
In October 2015 IZMF published a study on measuring high-frequency emissions in everyday situations. The result: The German
population is only mildly exposed to transmission waves emitted
by surrounding broadcasting transmitters and mobile base stations,
wireless local area networks, mobile devices and DECT telephones.
Although making phone calls on your own cell phone increases
exposure, total exposure still remains well below standard thresholds.
 The Bavarian Mobile Communications Pact was extended for an
unlimited time in fall 2015 on the basis of the pact signed in 2011.
 In Austria, the industry association Forum Mobilkommunikation
(FMK) initiated the citizens' mobile communications forum, giving
interested citizens the opportunity to pose questions about mobile
communications directly and online. Over time the citizens' forum is
becoming a knowledge platform where people can use the search
function to get answers to the most important questions on the
topic.

Service quality

As a service-oriented, responsible company, we feel obliged to respond
to our customers' needs and expectations. That's why we have set up
a comprehensive customer relationship management system. We
encourage dialog with our customers by giving them opportunities to
quickly and easily contact us at any time via the communication channel of their choice, e.g., online, via app, phone or e-mail or at a Telekom
shop.

How we guarantee excellent service quality
We strive to delight our customers and have integrated this goal into
our Group-wide Guiding Principles. Even variable components of our
managers' salaries are based on customer satisfaction. We use a variety
of tools to regularly gauge the satisfaction and loyalty of our customers.
One of these tools is the TRI*M customer loyalty study, which is conducted several times a year by an independent external service provider.
The results are presented in the TRI*M index. Our target was to improve
the results by around 10 percent in Germany by the end of 2015 compared to the results from 2012. We were able to achieve the target
values from 2012 through 2014. A decision was made to put target
achievement for the year 2015 on hold due to the ongoing transformation programs and increased number of customer inquiries regarding
the migration to IP technology.
Since 2013, fixed-line and mobile communications customers in
Germany have been able to reach us by phone around the clock at no
charge. This applies to all of our service numbers, even for questions
regarding Internet and TV services. Online inquires are becoming more
and more important as well. More than 40 percent of all service inquiries at Telekom Deutschland are solved by support provided by our
cross-area online platforms. We systematically evaluate our customers'
inquiries and complaints to identify the root of the problem and make
improvements.
Best customer experience with "C1 - customers first"
The "C1 – customers first“ program plays an important part in providing
the best customer experience as described in our corporate strategy.
The purpose of the program is to improve the satisfaction and experience of consumers and business customers and to surpass their expectations if possible. Last year we implemented the following measures:

 In April 2015 we launched the customer program for MagentaONE
for consumers, which offers free service advantages. Specially trained MagentaONE service teams are at the core of the program.
They allow for fast response to customer requests. In order to tailor
the program to our customers' needs we engaged in extensive dialog with them before the program started. We visited customers at
home, held workshops and conducted a quantitative market
research study. Results showed what our customers expect from a
good customer experience and how important it is to them.
 Another example of a successful "Customers first" measure during
the reporting period is our welcome gift for customers who are
moving. More than 9 million German citizens moved home in 2015.
When moving, our customers expect a seamless transition of their
Deutsche Telekom connection. We therefore consider this situation
to be a moment of truth in customer relations: a perfect chance to
foster customer satisfaction and loyalty, but also a situation in which
bad service can ruin the customer relationship. For that reason we
decided to reinterpret the traditional welcome gift of bread and salt
in 2015. Customers receive a gift card welcoming them to their new
home and giving them the opportunity to order bread and salt from
our gift shop. The idea is to provide a positive experience in a stressful situation and to create an emotional bond between our customers and Deutsche Telekom.
 We also gave order confirmations sent to new fixed-line customers a
more modern, clearer, more concise layout in 2015. Important information can now be seen at a glance. The price, minimum term of
contract and cancellation period are listed directly next to the
purchased product and any important information such as the provision or termination date are highlighted.
Indicator shows customer retention progress
We use the TRI*M-index to gauge customer retention and regularly participate in benchmarkings. Our goal was to increase customer retention
in Germany by 10 percent by 2015 compared with 2012. We were able
to keep customer retention on the rise from 2012 through 2014. Due to
ongoing transformation programs and increased customer inquiries
regarding the migration to IP technology we had to put this target on
hold for 2015. For the Deutsche Telekom group, however, we were able
to increase the TRI*M from 65.9 points in 2014 to 67.4 points in 2015.
With this, we have reached our initial goal in 2015. We plan to achieve a
slight increase eachyear until 2018.

Deutsche Telekom: leading in customer satisfaction
Customer satisfaction with our service was assessed by TÜV Rheinland
technical services provider in the reporting period. The testers rated our
service hotline, the Telekom shops, and our technical service as "good"
for the third time in a row. They asked a representative sample of 2,750
customers about their experience. As in previous years, customers rated
reliability, friendliness and competence. Based on the number of points
determined by the testers, each individual area also received a score of
"good."
Service study on mobile communications stores:
Deutsche Telekom takes the win
Deutsche Telekom employees are always friendly and confident when
providing customer assistance. That was the conclusion drawn in a
study conducted by the market research institute, Deutsches Institut für
Service-Qualität. These results gave Deutsche Telekom the win with a
total rating of "good." The mobile communications stores also scored
points by having the most extensive offer of cell phones and featuring
high-end retail space with a clear layout.

Digital responsibility

Digital responsibility

Digitization is changing our lives – how we communicate, how we stay
informed, how we learn. In a digitized world media skills are indispensable when it comes to getting involved in society, which is why we work to
teach people how to competently and safely use new technologies. Our
numerous projects and initiatives in Germany and Europe are targeted
at children and young people as well as adults and seniors.

Assuming responsibility for the digital
transformation
All around the world, having access to modern information technologies
is the basis of being able to participate in the knowledge and information society, which is why we are creating the necessary technical infrastructure and reducing the financial hurdles that prevent its use. We also
help people learn how to actively and competently use new technologies, conducting custom projects for various target groups. ICT can also
be used to address social challenges. We develop our own offers and
support partner initiatives with our expertise in this area.
 Promoting media literacy: Our Teachtoday initiative provides children, young people, families and teachers with extensive practical,
hands-on materials and formats for teaching children how to use
media safely and competently. We also address people that have
rarely or never worked with modern information technology through
a variety of offers: Our employees, for example, organize courses on
how to use cell phones and the internet for residents of Lebenshife
facilities within the context of our Social Days. Another good
example for this is the Access to the Digital World initiative supported by OTE and COSMOTE, where people over the age of 50 with no
computer experience can learn the basics of using digital technology. Another key focal point of our involvement is promoting online
security. Our online advice portal, www.sicherdigital.de, for example,
gives people free security advice designed especially for their age
group. Our free data privacy advice portal also offers advice on data
privacy and security.

 Enabling access: We offer schools throughout Germany free broadband access as part of our Telekom@School initiative. This gives
children and young people the opportunity to learn how to use
digital media irrespective of their family background. We also offer
special rates to enable low-income customers and people with
disabilities to make phone calls and surf the web at reasonable prices. More than one million customers in Germany take advantage of
these special rates each year. Our national companies also work to
make technical infrastructures easier to use. In the scope of
Magyar Telekom's "hello holnap!" initiative for example, customers
with disabilities are offered special rates and usage options in line
with their particular needs.
 Helping solve social problems: The technology can contribute to solving social problems. As part of our refugee aid activities for
example, we set up the refugees.telekom.de portal, providing
refugees with consolidated information on asylum procedures and
on living and working in Germany. Ongoing projects and initiatives
also benefit from our expertise: During the reporting period we
supported the International Mapping Day and asked people to
check locations for the Wheelmap.org online map, which is designed for people with disabilities. We also participated as a partner in
the pilot project promoting a year of voluntary social/digital work.
Teachtoday – initiative for the promotion of safe and
competent media use
Teachtoday is our initiative for teaching people how to use media
safely and competently. It supports children, young people, parents and
grandparents as well as teachers by offering hands-on tips and materials - online and at face-to-face events. In 2015 our media obstacle
course took to the German roads: Awareness was raised for safe media
usage in a playful manner among over 4,900 school students between
the ages of 9 and 12 in 42 institutions in eleven different federal states.
More than 150 children discussed topics involving the digital world at
the Summit for Kids in November 2015. We documented their ideas
in an interactive manifesto. The highlight of the event was the award
ceremony of the "Media, sure! But secure." competition. For the first
time, international submissions were accepted and projects from five
countries took part. The jury presented awards to seven projects including the joint media project on refugee migration from Syria called
“Homeland!?”, which was submitted by the Martin Luther King School
in Saarlouis, Germany. In 2015, we also created a new media magazine
for children called "Scroller," which is supplemented by an advice portal
for parents and notes for teachers. The portals teachtoday and scroller
are available in English as well as German.

Change & Corporate Responsibility at Deutsche Telekom, is
a member of the jury that will select the best submissions in summer
2016. Deutsche Telekom also became a partner of the new Digital
Neighborhood project in November 2015. With the project, DsiN is
planning to create a Germany-wide network of IT experts from
associations and non-profit organizations to pass on their knowledge
of IT safety issues to people in their personal environment.
DsiN was created as part of the 1st National IT Summit nine years
ago under the patronage of the Federal Ministry of the Interior. The
association is a point of contact for consumers and companies and
provides specific advice to raise security awareness when using the
Internet.
Pilot project for voluntary social/digital work in Saxony-Anhalt
The pilot project promoting a year of voluntary social/digital work was
launched in the city of Halle in October 2015. The new offers for promoting media skills involved in the pilot project extend the current
concept of a voluntary social work year: Under the program, young
people between the ages of 16 and 26 with an interest in modern media
can work on digital projects or help people learn how to use new media
at non-profit organizations, such as facilities for seniors and people with
disabilities, day-care centers and clinics. The scope of the program,
which is initially beind tested at around 25 facilities in Saxony-Anhalt,
ranges from digital storytelling to creating accessible web content.
Volunteers receive media teaching support during their entire time in
the program.
The project, which is scheduled to run two years, is sponsored by the
German Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth,
Deutsche Telekom and NrEins.de AG. In addition to the pilot project in
Saxony-Anhalt, the ministry is also supports a two-year sponsorship of a
pilot project in Rhineland-Palatinate. The objective of the two pilot projects is to produce results that enable institutions offering voluntary
social work positions to integrate digital modules into the traditional
concept.
Innovative solutions to social challenges
Technology can help to overcome social challenges. This is why Deutsche Telekom promoted the following digital initiatives during the
reporting period:

 Deutsche Telekom supports International Mapping Day
campaign
To celebrate the “International Day of Persons with Disabilities
2015”, the non-profit organization “Sozialhelden” collaborated
with the World Health Organization (WHO) and ITU (International
Telecommunication Union) to initiate the International Mapping Day
campaign. The aim was to add even more locations with wheelchair
accessibility to the Wheelmap.org online map. Deutsche Telekom
called upon its employees, customers and other interested people
to participate in the campaign.
 IRMGARD app helps adults learn to read and write in German
IRMGARD is the first app in Germany designed to help adults learn
to read and write in German. The only other apps so far are designed for children and not very suitable for use by adults. IRMGARD
particularly focuses on the specific needs of adults,: users are, for
example, addressed and motivated by a real person on an equal footing. Deutsche Telekom co-financed the IRMGARD app and asked
people to volunteer their time to promote use of the app.
Program educates children in safe Internet use
In June 2015, COSMOTE launched a new program for the optimal and
safe use of today’s technology by children called “Child and Safety in
Technology”. In this framework, the company also launched an online
platform website and a leaflet providing relevant information to parents
who can now learn how to make this technology more functional and
safe through the use of specialized products and services. One of them
is the new COSMOTE SMILE service designed especially for smartphones and tablets, which ensures a child can only operate specific phone
numbers selected by the parents for incoming and outgoing calls, and
only allows access during specified times of day to apps and webpages
selected by the parents. COSMOTE SMILE also detects the position of
the child's mobile/tablet on a map and notifies parents when the signal
leaves the designated boundaries.
Fostering safe Internet use and digital inclusion
Digital Bridge Program
In the 11 years since Magyar Telekom launched its Digital Bridge
Program, the inhabitants of small, disadvantaged settlements where few
people live have been taught how and what the internet can be used for,
and how it can make their life easier. Participants in the program are helped by Magyar Telekom volunteers who provide advice tailored to the
inhabitants’ individual needs. 15 events were organized during 2015.
Seven were at elementary schools as a summer digital “daycare” for
school pupils aged 10-14 and eight were Digital Bridges, including Digital Bridge Festivals (digital education and talent show). During 2015
approx. 1,000 people were reached, and a further 60,000 through the
respective Facebook page. The 200th Digital Bridge event was staged
in November 2015.
Smart Digital Program
Legislation in Hungary requires every Internet provider to provide free
software on its homepage to make protection of underage persons
possible. Through its Smart Digital Program Magyar Telekom, however,
is doing much more than merely fulfilling its legal obligations since
Telekom volunteers have educated tens of thousands of school pupils
on how to use the net more safely and consciously. Within the frame-

work of this Smart Digital Program, which evolved from the Digital
Bridge Program, Telekom is contributing to the development of a climate of digital maturity and literacy in Hungary. For the fifth year in a
row, children were trained in the safe use of online technologies on
Safer Internet Day (see below). Within the framework of a residential project in Nyíregyháza (see below) an intensive series of lectures aimed at
beginner internet users commenced for adults and seniors. This free
course teaches participants what the web can be used for and how it
can help them solve everyday problems.
Safer Internet Day
Safer Internet Day is an annual EU initiative accompanied by a wide
range of extraordinary net community, school and technology programs.
In 2015 Magyar Telekom cooperated with the Digital Knowledge Academy to simultaneously teach 1,000 children from 14 schools in 12
cities on the conscious and safe use of online technologies. Telekom’s
volunteers passed on practical skills relating to the opportunities and
risks inherent in the use of the net, ways of setting options and filtering
content, as well as netiquette. In an interactive lecture during a
45-minute classroom session the speakers addressed basic issues ranging from password protection and filtering risky content to solutions to
safeguard users from harassment. All these activities took the specific
needs of the age group concerned into account.
Digital Hungary – a residential project in Nyíregyháza
One of Magyar Telekom’s long-term goals has been to spread smart city
services in order to improve the living standards of urban inhabitants,
and contribute to the creation of a more sustainable urban environment.
Digital Hungary, the first comprehensive program for digital communities and the economy, commenced in Nyíregyháza. In the first round,
Hungary's government allocated HUF 1.7bn (€ 5.48 Mio.) to the first
phase of this Digital Hungary government program in Nyíregyháza. In
spring 2015 Magyar Telekom collaborated with the Ministry of National
Development and the Municipality of Nyíregyháza to launch a comprehensive development plan in the county capital. Under the auspices of
the Digital Nyíregyháza sub-project Magyar Telekom is investing its own
resources (close to HUF 0.5bn (€ 1.6 Mio.)) to carry out an intense network development in the city. The work is already underway in several
parts of the city, and Magyar Telekom is planning to make at least 30
Mbps available for over 7,000 households in 2016. Many other settlements are scheduled to have new generation and broadband access
by the end of 2017.
IT Courses for Seniors
AjTy (“you too”) Senior, a project launched in 2013 by T-Systems
Slovakia in cooperation with the electro-technical secondary school in
Košice, provides IT courses for senior citizens. The lessons offered in
2015 focused on working with a PC and the Internet, e.g. what the
Internet can be used for, how a mail account can be created, how
documents can be written in Word, how to chat online, etc. 2015 was
very successful in that 40 seniors were attracted to the two courses in
the summer and winter term. 20 volunteers from T-Systems Slovakia
taught the seniors all the knowledge and skills required. Improvements
were made to the courses, e.g. in ways of communicating with the
students, delivering course content after its completion, final tests, etc.

Access to the Digital World program
For yet another year, COSMOTE supported the Access to the Digital
World Program, which aims to reduce PC illiteracy amongst the over-50s
and thus enhance their access to the digital world, education and lifelong learning. This initiative offers, free of charge, basic digital skills and
Internet usage courses to over-50s with no previous digital experience.
Two- and four-hour seminars are held to introduce the participants to
the use of touchscreen technology for smartphones and tablets, and
online social networking, e.g. Skype, Facebook, etc. From September
2014 to the end of July 2015, Access to the Digital World was held in
three municipalities, attended by a total of 765 senior citizens with an
average age of 64. Besides financial support, COSMOTE provided all
the necessary hardware and technical support.
Record participation at free programming workshops
Since September 2015 Telekom Romania has been running the fourth
round of the Coder Dojo Bucharest North Workshops, with over 50
children and youngsters aged 7 to 16 studying programming and computer-assisted electronics based on the Arduino development platform.
The workshops are being organized free throughout the 2015-2016
school year and include training sessions for beginner programmers as
well as for youngsters who have already gathered experience at the previous years' Dojos and want to upgrade their programming or Arduino
skills. The children and young people attending are coordinated by
volunteering mentors from the world of business or independent specialists who want to get involved in educating the younger generation.
Bucharest North @Telekom Romania, the oldest Dojo of its kind in
Romania, has been running for four years with monthly meetings staged
at a location where logistical support and Internet connections are provided by Telekom Romania.
CoderDojo, an international movement initiated in Ireland in 2011, aims
to offer interested children the chance to learn programming in an informal environment through regular sessions outside normal school hours.

As in the past, organizations planning to open an e-classroom where
the target group would learn for free to use computer programs (Word,
Excel etc.) and the Internet, e-mails, etc. applied for funds from the
e-Macedonia Foundation in 2015. As a result, the e-Macedonia Foundation provided €8,000 to open two new e-classrooms. The Foundation
provides full or partial funds for the opening of every e-classroom as
well as technical support through teaching aids, Internet links and fully
functioning equipment.
So far, around 400 citizens in the Republic of Macedonia have been
received practical further education through this project.

Connected Kids
Digital literacy is becoming a basic skill required for participating in any
aspect of society. With its Connected Kids project, T-Mobile Austria
hopes to raise awareness among students, parents and teachers regarding the numerous ways mobile Internet can be used for learning, and
to advance the use of digital media at schools. T-Mobile Austria has
been collaborating with Apple since 2013 to provide Austrian classrooms with tablets and mobile Internet hotspots for 2 weeks at a time.
3,777 students at 37 participating schools and more than 200 teachers
have already had the chance to explore digital learning in a connected
classroom. Educational and technical support is provided to make sure
students get to experience all the advantages of mobile communication
in teaching.
T-Mobile launched the Connected Kids blog to make the experience of
using digital media in schools and families as part of a connected classroom available to the public.
Long-term project goals include inspiring students to pass on what they
learn to people outside of traditional educational institutions.
e-Macedonia Foundation continues e-Classrooms
project
The e-Macedonia Foundation initiated the e-Classrooms project in 2012
with the aim of offering socially vulnerable people access to information, social interaction and improved educational standards and skills,
and thus enhancing their employment prospects. Concurrently, the idea
of the e-Macedonia Foundation is to create a comprehensive digital
society in which everyone will be able to explore their possibilities and
benefit from the new technologies, enjoy a free access, share information and services, and be able to participate more efficiently in their
communities.

Providing diversity and equal opportunities

Providing diversity and equal
opportunities
Deutsche Telekom promotes equal opportunities and involvement in
society. We work to provide better educational opportunities in all areas
of life to everyone, regardless of their social background or personal ability, starting with early childhood and continuing on through old age.
Our efforts particularly focus on teaching people how to use digital
medial safely and competently.
In view of the strong influx of refugees coming to Europe, we are also
interested in giving the people who arrive here the chance of a fresh
start. With that we support the sustainability of Europe and our company.

More than 200 new projects for the "Yes, I can!"
initiative
Our "Yes, I can!" initiative teaches young people key skills to enable
them to act independently and with self-confidence. In doing so, we promote equal opportunities within our society. In the reporting year, more
than 200 new projects went live with funding totaling over 800,000
euros. The focal theme in 2015 was "Exploring, understanding and shaping my environment," in which children and young people were encouraged to take a close look at their direct environments and to get to
know their surroundings from a completely new perspective. Numerous
other skill-enhancing projects, for example in the areas of crafts, the theater, and geocaching, also received support from the initiative. Since it
was launched six years ago, over 900 projects have been funded by the
initiative nationwide with a total volume of 5 million euros. This has
made it possible to reach over 75,000 children and young people.
Task force for refugee aid
In view of the massive challenges involved in aid work for refugees, our
Board of Management set up its own task force in August 2015. It pools
our various aid programs in Germany to ensure that support can be provided faster and with less red tape:

Promoting equal opportunities
Our goal is to connect people, not only with our products and services
but also with our social commitment. We contribute our core expertise
as an international ICT corporation to these efforts and work actively to
ensure that everyone, regardless of age, background or education, can
participate in our society. Our efforts to promote equal opportunities
include supporting projects and institutions, such as our "Yes, I can!" initiative, that work to develop the individual skills of young people from
disadvantaged backgrounds, both socially and in terms of education.
We are also involved in numerous projects to teach people how to use
digital media safely and competently. Our "My chance to get going!" project gives these young people the opportunity to participate in a vocational training program.
We also encourage young people to volunteer, e.g., within the scope of
our Enactus university partnership, a coaching offer for social projects
conducted by students. The Deutsche Telekom foundation also promotes equal opportunities and is involved in numerous projects to help
people develop their skills in the STEM subjects (science, technology,
engineering and mathematics).
In view of the influx of refugees coming to Europe we expanded our
refugee aid as part of our social commitment in 2015 and set up different aid offers at our European locations along the routes used by refugees.

 E-mails or messenger services are usually the only way for people
in refugee shelters to keep in touch with their families and friends.
By the end of February 2016, we had already supplied free WiFi to
around 68 refugee reception centers.
 How can I apply for asylum? Where can I learn German? Am I allowed to work? Where can I get help? The answers to this and many
other questions can be found on our "https://refugees.telekom.de"
internet platform. The portal also makes it possible to contact local
helpers and organizations. It is available in eight languages and is
being continually expanded.
 We offered 19 Deutsche Telekom properties as refugee
accommodation.
 In 2015, we advertised 77 internships at Deutsche Telekom and
offered grants for students to study at our HfTL University of Applied
Sciences in Leipzig via the „careers4refugees.de“ refugee platform.
So far, we were able to assign 47 internships to university and
school students and six grants for university courses.

Society
Providing diversity and equal opportunities

 At their request, we assign civil servants working for our company
to the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) to help
process the high number of applications for asylum. Employees
have submitted more than 800 applications to Vivento, Deutsche
Telekom's personnel service provider. Nearly 500 civil servants are
already working at BAMF or are scheduled to start soon, and more
civil servants still have the opportunity to transfer to the Federal
Office.
 Many of our staff help out in the temporary shelters, accompany
refugees on visits to the public authorities, and donate both clothing
and money. We support this voluntary work via our "engagement@
telekom.de" platform. By the end of February 2016, more than 70
aid projects had been launched, including a nationwide charity run
with over 1,100 participants at 16 locations, which brought in over
50,000 euros. Other projects include joint activities to promote integration and offer German language courses. Employees are currently teaching German within the scope of the "I want to learn German" project.

87

 We collaborate with ministries, government agencies, adult education centers and those in charge of running refugee registration centers like the German Red Cross, Caritas, the Workers' Samaritan
Federation (ASB), etc. Our involvement in a collaboration with
Germany's Relief Coalition and its partners is ongoing. Furthermore,
we work closely and pragmatically with over 30 other companies to
achieve specific targets.
At our European sites along the refugee routes, we implement various
aid projects that suit local needs. We offer people in many countries free
internet access to ensure they can keep in touch with their friends and
relatives. Some of our national companies have set up donation hotlines. Financial support provided by the OTE Group to the coastguard
service in Greece, for instance, has already helped to save 74,000 people from drowning. T-Mobile Austria has been working in refugee aid
since 2010, helping for instance to give young refugees a new perspective in life. Since then, ten percent of trainee positions in Austria's
T-Mobile Shops have been reserved for young refugees who enter the
country without their families and are supported by "lobby.16." This
association organizes training and continuing education for young
unaccompanied refugees.

Society
Providing diversity and equal opportunities

We have gathered a valuable experience since the task force was first
launched and struck a positive balance at the end of 2015. We plan to
continue these aid efforts in 2016.
Deutsche Telekom foundation promotes STEM
subjects
The Deutsche Telekom foundation sponsors numerous projects involving STEM subjects to improve the skills of young people in science,
technology, engineering and mathematics and get them excited about
careers in these fields. One excellent example is the Junior Engineer
Academy (JIA), which was founded in 2005. The academy helps
secondary schools in Germany develop a STEM profile. 75 schools
were involved in the JIA network at the end of 2015 and the project has
reached around 4,500 students since its founding. The Junior Engineer
Academy will begin establishing technology-related school partnerships
in central, eastern and southeastern Europe in 2016.
“Be a math whiz”
The PISA study revealed that around 20 percent of young people in Germany only have basic math skills upon completing their mandatory education. The Deutsche Telekom foundation initiated the "Be a math whiz"
project in 2010 to help students early on in their educational careers.
The project develops, tests and distributes special course material for
students in the lower secondary level. This is supplemented by continuing education courses for teachers throughout Germany held at the
German Center for Mathematics Teacher Education (DZLM). The effectiveness of the materials will be evaluated on a regular basis in the
future. For this purpose the math skills of 4,500 students were tested

88

and their teachers were surveyed during the reporting period. As a
result, we identified a surprisingly high need for assistance - up to 80
percent of the students per class at some schools. The overall results of
the skills assessment have been available since the end of 2015. They
provide a basis for future evaluations so that we can track progress.
Further tests will be conducted in 2016 and 2017 to assess whether the
students are able to retain the skills they learn in the long run. Simultaneously, we will continue distributing course material.
“MINTeinander” project
The aim of the MINTeinander project, which was launched in 2013, is
to teach STEM (or MINT in German) skills to children from preschool to
secondary school ages using course material developed by the project.
The second call for applications in fall 2015 was targeted at preschools,
elementary schools and secondary schools that collaborate with other
institutions in their region and want to improve their natural sciences
course offer. Together with the newly selected institutions, since January
2016 the project has supported a total of 291 preschools, elementary
schools and secondary schools collaborating in 61 preschool/school
networks, including one from Argentina and one from the U.S. Each
school is given an experiment set on magnetism as well as accompanying didactic material developed by a group of experts from the University of Münster. Teachers of institutions that recently joined can take
advantage of free continuing education offers conducted by experienced experts from the network. The foundation will be launching another call for applications in September 2016, where preschool/school
networks can apply for materials on the topic "Sink or swim”.

Junior Science Café
How much research is involved in a smartphone? How will we be
communicating with each other in 20 years? In the Junior Science Café
(JSC) project, students aged 14 through 18 organize discussion panels
with experts where they can talk about science-related topics in a
relaxed atmosphere. The main focus of the project is to encourage students to act independently. They choose the topic and the experts and
plan and moderate the panel discussions, which introduces them to
different scientific topics.

This is how we are currently supporting the Enactus team at WHU Otto
Beisheim School of Management in Vallendar in their project activities and it's been a success so far. During the reporting period, the team we
coach at WHU Vallendar won the Rookie Award for the best up-andcoming team at the Enactus 2015 National Cup for their 2nd Home project. In the project refugees are trained to become care professionals
and receive German lessons, thereby offering them new career perspectives. Caritas, the German Red Cross and the AWO welfare organization
support the project.

The project, which the Deutsche Telekom foundation is conducting in
collaboration with the Wissenschaft im Dialog (WiD) business initiative,
struck a favorable balance in 2015: A total of roughly 30 schools throughout Germany participated in the project and 18 café events were held
during the reporting period. Students invited around 50 experts
to come to their schools and discuss topics such as digital forensics,
communication in the aerospace sector and smart home technology.
Around 1,300 visitors attended the discussions.

Deutsche Telekom also provides general support to all the student
teams. During the Enactus team weekend in December 2015, project
managers from more than 40 Enactus student teams in Germany were
given a good overview of helpful methods for conducting projects. Deutsche Telekom introduced tried-and-true project management methods
to the students and shared experience gained in strategic transformation projects conducted by the company.

New project: STEM reading mentors
What happens when a volcano erupts and how does a satnav work?
Exciting stories can be used to explain many natural science and technological phenomena. The new collaboration between the Deutsche
Telekom foundation and the German Reading Foundation expands on
this idea. The aim of the collaboration is to recruit volunteer mentors to
read stories involving the STEM subjects to children between the ages
of three and ten and get them excited about contents dealing with
mathematics, natural sciences and technology. The foundations created
a special list of STEM media tips containing both classic books and
digital offers such as apps and animated e-books. The collaboration got
the ball rolling on International Volunteer Day with a "reading hour" at
Deutsche Telekom headquarters. Deutsche Telekom CEO Timotheus
Höttges, Professor Wolfgang Schuster, Chairman of the Deutsche
Telekom Stiftung Executive Board, and Dr. Jörg F. Maas, Chief Executive
of the German Reading Foundation, participated in the event.
Training for reading mentors via face-to-face events and online courses
began in 2016. They will then be able to work with children at day-care
centers and elementary schools. Upon request, the German Reading
Foundation's Reading Network also helps volunteers locate suitable
schools or day-care centers. Deutsche Telekom offers its employees the
opportunity to volunteer as a reading mentor within the context of the
company's Social Days. 50 employees participated in the new project in
2015.
Coaching for student social-welfare projects:
Enactus
Deutsche Telekom's Center for Strategic Projects (CSP) has been
supporting the international student network, Enactus, for several years.
We advise student teams at WHU Otto Beisheim School of Management
when it comes to realizing their own social and environmental projects
and business concepts.
Deutsche Telekom took on a new role as an Enactus incubator in
mid-2015. In this role, we systematically support newly formed student
teams by offering method training, coaching and networking opportunities.

Supporting War Child
T-Mobile Netherlands’ partnership with and main sponsorship of the
NGO War Child helps children in war areas, and particularly in Lebanon,
to enjoy an education. This is made possible through a grant, the provision of free consultancy, and raising money through employee initiatives.
2015 was a year of great engagement with around 600 employees involved, help provided to 25,000 children, and a record sum of nearly
€350,000 raised for War Child.
In 2015 T-Mobile Netherlands again provided a call center facility for
War Child, in particular for their TV show. More than 10,000 friends
(monthly donors) were reached and helped by the 400 employees
volunteering their services at the call center.
Lebanon and the war in Syria
About 1.5 million Syrian children have fled the civil war in Syria to neighboring countries such as Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan. Ever since the
beginning of the conflict, Syrian children have been severely affected by
illegal detainment, sexual abuse, and exposure to hostilities. War Child
provides Safe Spaces and psychosocial relief for Syrian refugee children. Parents and carers are also involved. The lion’s share of the money
T-Mobile Netherlands raised in 2015 went to Lebanon. A delegation of
T-Mobile colleagues visited Lebanon to experience for themselves what
great work War Child is doing and how the company’s support for War
Child is helping children and their families. In addition, the company
has provided War Child employees with free subscriptions and free
handhelds.
Vluchtelingewerk Nederland
Over the past 12 years T-Mobile Netherlands has supported War Child
in its aid work in war regions. However, in view of the current refugee
crisis it was decided to initiate a local partnership with Vluchtelingenwerk Nederland. The company donated technology and a pre-paid SIM
card with €10 of credit for data or voice service use to the first 10,000
refugees. As part of the Social SIMs initiative (see above), these SIM
cardholders are also being invited to job application workshops and soft
skill training courses, as well as being provided with apps to help them
to find their way around the Netherlands.

“The first five are most important”
The partnership between UNICEF and the Telekom for Macedonia
Foundation aims to raise awareness of the importance of early education. After all, children develop most in the first five years of their lives,
and children who attend high-quality pre-school programs are more
successful in school and life in general. To this end, the partnership is
striving to open early childhood development centers so that children
from vulnerable environments enjoy the same opportunities for early
education as their peers who go to kindergartens.
In order to close the gap between urban and rural areas, where kindergartens are underrepresented, the new early childhood development
centers are being built in the communities that need them most. Overall,
ten centers, with nearly 400 children enrolled, have been opened.
The Telekom for Macedonia Foundation made an initial cash donation
of US$50,000 (€ 46,000) to help pay for the new centers, and also
donated some of the revenues from text messages sent on New Year’s
Eve.

Their community volunteer efforts make our employees the most effective representatives of our values. Through their efforts, our employees
express our relationship to our society and contribute to strengthening
the sense of community we share. This is not only helpful for the community, but also fosters Deutsche Telekom's reputation. Volunteering is
also very beneficial when it comes to internal HR development. It
strengthens identification with the company, expands each person's
horizon and has a positive impact on social skills and teamwork.
That is why we give our employees ample opportunity to volunteer, preferably with a focus on teaching media literacy. This is just another way
in which we help simplify and enrich the lives of those around us.

Taking responsibility in our society
We contribute to society in a number of ways with our corporate citizenship program, engagement@telekom. In times of digital transformation,
we want to be a trusted partner to our community. We contribute our
core expertise and the knowledge of our employees to these efforts.
engagement@telekom is based on two pillars:
 Corporate volunteering (supporting our employees in their volunteering activities) and corporate giving (our donation activities)
 Long-term partnerships with non-profit organizations

We give our employees the opportunity to volunteer for social projects
or the environment within the scope of our Social Days. These volunteer
opportunities are often within the context of our longstanding partnerships with non-profit organizations such as Lebenshilfe and DKMS,
the German Bone Marrow Donor Center. One of our focal points are
projects that promote media literacy, in which our expertise can be
particularly effective. Corporate volunteering is also an important component of our training and development activities. The volunteer efforts
of our apprentices are given special recognition in our Group competition, "Responsibility wins!".
With our corporate giving activities we support the work of aid organizations worldwide, preferably those with which we have longstanding partnerships. We also provide fast disaster relief. Our 13-year collaboration
with Aktion Deutschland Hilft, Germany's Relief Coalition, is an excellent
example. Our Group Donation Policy outlines the framework for our
donation activities.
We collaborate closely across country borders when it comes to our
involvement and share experiences and best practices. A set of KPIs
helps us measure the success of our social commitment. In addition to
our Social Commitment ESG KPI we successfully tested three additional
KPIs in 2014 and included them as a standard part of our KPI set in
2015. These new KPIs are the Community Investment ESG KPI, the
Beneficiaries ESG KPI and the Media Literacy ESG KPI.The KPIs enable
us to make targeted measurements of the investments we have made
as well as the number of people involved and the target groups reached
by our efforts. We can also determine specifically the number of people
participating in our media literacy programs, thus drawing a direct
relationship to our core business.
In 2015 we also conducted an extensive strategy process in order to
more effectively align our activities with our corporate image and core
expertise. Our strategy now includes a list of criteria for selecting future
projects.
"Responsibility wins!" competition
Our annual "Responsibility wins!" competition gives our apprentices and
students in cooperative degree programs the opportunity to develop
their skills beyond the scope of their professional training in order to
benefit others. Many of them all over Germany once again participated
in 2015. Three excellent projects received an award in February 2016 at
an awards ceremony held at Deutsche Telekom headquarters in Bonn.
First place this year went to a team from the Landshut training center,
who promoted agreement between residents and night owls in the city
of Regensburg with their "Party fair" project. The team conceptualized
and filmed video clips addressing problematic behavior such as drinking, vandalism and aggressive behavior.

In March 2015, Cyclone Pam touched down with full force on the island
state of Vanuatu situated northeast of Australia. The cyclone was the
worst natural disaster in the history of Vanuatu. According to the United
Nations, at least 24 people lost their lives during the cyclone and 3,300
lost their homes. Deutsche Telekom provided fast aid to the victims of
the cyclone. The Group donated 50,000 euros in emergency aid to
Germany's Relief Coalition and we asked our employees to donate as
well.

Earthquake in Nepal
In April 2015, Nepal experienced its biggest earthquake in more than
80 years followed by a number of severe aftershocks. More than 8,000
people lost their lives and the geographic location made it difficult to
provide aid. Deutsche Telekom donated 50,000 euros in emergency
aid to Germany's Relief Coalition and helped facilitate communication
in the disaster area by canceling roaming fees for calls and, in some
cases, for text messaging. In addition to Deutsche Telekom in Germany,
T-Mobile USA and our national companies T-Mobile Netherlands,
T-Mobile Czech Republic and T-Mobile Austria as well as Telekom
Albania, Crnogorski Telekom (Montenegro) and Telekom Romania all
participated in the efforts. Deutsche Telekom employees were ready
to help as well, collecting 45,400 euros in aid funds in a cross-border
employee donation drive; Deutsche Telekom doubled this impressive
donation to express its appreciation to its employees.
Aid for refugees
Deutsche Telekom also supports the refugee aid efforts of Germany's
Relief Coalition. In addition to asking employees to make donations,
we held charity runs at all of our 16 German training centers. The
50,000 euros we collected were donated to a project dedicated to
trauma work at a refugee camp in northern Iraq. We also created our
own refugee aid program early on. It pools the company's various aid
programs to ensure that support can be provided faster and with less
red tape.
Together we are stronger
For the tenth consecutive year in 2015, Hrvatski Telekom ran its successful donations’ competition “Together we are stronger”, which is staged to support worthy causes in the community that aim to enrich
people’s lives and further community development. In the ten years of
this initiative, Hrvatski Telekom has been able to support the realization
of more than 240 projects with grants totaling almost HRK 8.5 million
(over €1.1 million). The projects were in areas such as technology, lifelong education, healthcare, care for the elderly and infirm, humanitarian
work, ecology, and sustainability.
The fund for 2015 grants amounted to HRK 720,000 (ca. €94,000) and
was again intended for organizations and institutions that carry out initiatives of importance to the local community. The categories for the
2015 competition, which ran from September to November, were:

Cultural and sports sponsorship

Culture and sports are a source of pleasure, inspiration and also innovative strength for society. An inspiration to many people, they create a
sense of community and enable understanding across cultural and political borders. As an international corporation, we feel that sponsoring
cultural activities and sports is another element of our corporate responsibility.

Encouraging enthusiasm for sports with the Telekom
Baskets
2015 marked the 20-year anniversary of the Telekom Baskets Bonn.
Deutsche Telekom celebrated the occasion with an extensive anniversary campaign in which fans and basketball enthusiasts had the
chance to vote for their favorite player of each season over the past 20
years. Photos of the 20 selected "legends" were then posted as an XXL
photo gallery at selected buildings in Bonn.
Ticket sweepstakes for the Telekom Baskets
Before the 2015/2016 season got underway, Deutsche Telekom launched its eighth Tix for Kids ticket sweepstakes. We raffled off two sets of
tickets (2 x 30 tickets) for each home game. Participation was open to all
schools in Bonn. Businesses also had the opportunity to become ticket
sponsors for social welfare institutions, school classes, club teams and
work centers for disabled people. Deutsche Telekom itself donated an
additional 242 tickets to various organizations including the “Maria im
Walde” children and youth center and refugee accommodations.

Getting involved in culture and sports
Deutsche Telekom encourages variety in cultural expression throughout
the Group. In Germany, it is one of the leading sponsors of culture and
sports. As well as providing financial support, we offer our experience
in communication and marketing activities to support artists, athletes,
organizers and clubs. Regional involvement at our locations also plays
a key role.
Sponsoring music is a long-standing tradition at Deutsche Telekom and
a vital element in the company's brand communication activities. We
want to give as many people as possible access to cultural events, thus
encouraging them to share thoughts and ideas. Our main sponsorship
focus is placed on events like the Beethovenfest and the International
Telekom Beethoven Competition Bonn, which has been providing a
stage for up-and-coming pianists from all over the world for 10 years.
Deutsche Telekom supports competitive and recreational sports
equally. Our sports sponsorship activities focus on soccer partnerships
with the DFB German Football Association, FC Bayern Munich and
other German major league soccer teams. Deutsche Telekom also lays
emphasis on those aspects of sports that foster community life. We
sponsor athletes supported by the Stiftung Deutsche Sporthilfe,
recreational and school sports projects as well as athletes with disabilities. As a Bonn-based company, we also sponsor the Telekom Baskets
Bonn basketball team and the Bonn Marathon. We also encourage our
employees to participate in the city's traditional annual run and in the
"Staying in shape in the winter" running for health program.

Second round for Baskets@school student training project
Deutsche Telekom's Baskets@school initiative makes it possible for
students in 5th through 10th grade to have their sports idols visit their
school. Children and young people experience what professional
basketball training is like by participating in a training session that lasts
for around 90 minutes. Because the previous year's response was so
positive, the basketball club decided to expand the campaign's scope,
and, for the first time, involved schools from other districts in the program. Head team trainers offered a total of eight training sessions from
November 2015 through April 2016. The aim of Baskets@School is to
get students from the region interested in basketball and to improve
their team spirit.
ANSTOSS! soccer initiative
The goal of Deutsche Telekom's ANSTOSS! soccer initiative is to make
new experiences possible and support young talents. This broad-based
project promotes soccer in the areas of amateur and recreational sports,
developing young talent and disabled sports.
Listening to soccer instead of watching it
One focal point of ANSTOSS! is the "New sports experience" initiative,
which has been encouraging young people to try out disabled sports
since 2009, raising their awareness of what people with disabilities can
accomplish. The initiative launched a new project during the reporting
period called "'Seeing' soccer through sound," in which young people
with and without sight impairments take a trip to the soccer stadium
together. The kids "watch" the game in a very special way: equipped
with darkened ski goggles, they can only hear the live commentary
by a reporter who makes the game tangible to people with sight impair-

ments. After the game, the participants get together to talk about their
experiences. The experience helps them better understand what life is
like for each other and helps them overcome their fears and reservations. A total of 45 young people from 7 schools participated in the
"'Seeing' soccer through sound" program during the reporting period.
The collaboration partners of "New sports experience" are the German
National Paralympic Committee (DBS), the German Football Association
(DFB) and the Sepp Herberger DFB foundation.
Deutsche Telekom looking for top goals by kids
Every month, Deutsche Telekom looks for the best goals scored by
young people Germany-wide in its "Stollenstrolche – Germany's top
goals by kids" initiative. Any young soccer player up to age twelve can
participate. A jury selects the five best goals from the submitted videos
and posts them on www.stollenstrolche.de where people can vote for
their favorite. The Stollenstrolch of the Month wins a trophy and a 1,000
euro voucher for their club.
Deutsche Telekom became a partner of the Bavarian soccer association, BFV, in March 2015. The collaboration, which is scheduled to run
until December 31, 2016, will be supporting the Stollenstrolch program
as well as the "New sports experience" initiative.
Deutsche Telekom also became a premium partner of the first “Fußballiade” soccer competition. The four-day community event hosted by the
BFV was held in the city of Landshut in June 2015 under the slogan,
"Bavaria celebrates soccer." 3,000 soccer players from 209 clubs as
well as more than 10,000 visitors attended the event. The Bavarian soccer association and Deutsche Telekom kept their eye out for the top
goals scored by kids and announced the winner of the title Fußballiade
soccer competition. Junior teams also had the chance to try out blind
soccer.
A unique concert experience at the Beethovenfest
and Jazzfest festivals
Beethovenfest Bonn festival
In 2015 Deutsche Telekom was once again the main sponsor of the
Beethovenfest Bonn festival where we presented two particularly
special concert events: a concert given by the Wiener Symphoniker on
September 6 and, on a different note, the Caribbean Showdown Vol. II
concert on September 13. This explosion of South American music was
organized by the student manager initiative of the Young Beethovenfest,
which Deutsche Telekom has been supporting for five years. In the project, a team of 9 to 10 school students takes over planning and advertising a concert for the Beethovenfest Bonn over a period of eight
months. The students handle financing and advertising and make sure
the
concert runs smoothly. The team is also responsible for artist and sponsor services, visitor services, the online presence on different channels,
a press conference and planning and running the entire supporting and
educational program. Beethovenfest employees assist the students in
all of their responsibilities.

94

Jazzfest Bonn festival
Deutsche Telekom was also again the main sponsor of Jazzfest Bonn,
which was held in May 2015. We presented a double concert at the
Telekom Forum on May 16 within this context: Nigel Kennedy reinterpreted songs by guitar legend Jimi Hendrix in a world premiere. The act
was opened by a captivating performance by Jazz clarinetist Rebecca
Trescher.
Media education project with the Junges Theater
Bonn
Deutsche Telekom and the Junges Theater Bonn (JTB) launched a
new media education project in 2015 to raise student awareness of how
to use the Internet safely. Since the project was launched in fall 2015,
fourth-graders at up to 30 elementary schools in Bonn and its surroundings have had the opportunity to participate in a special project day.
Together with their teachers they wrote their own play focusing on the
opportunities and risks of the Internet. One main feature of the class
project was depicting the Internet as a "human machine." Some students played people using the internet, some played servers and others,
routers. Thick ropes connected the users, servers and routers. Students
then had the chance to perform the play for their parents and fellow students at their schools. In 2016, Deutsche Telekom will be continuing the
JTB project at another 30 schools. The project is Deutsche Telekom's
most recent collaboration with JTB, who we have been working with
since 2004.
Cultural sponsorships to preserve and promote
Greece’s cultural heritage
The main objective of the cultural sponsorships is to promote Greece’s
cultural heritage by providing an advanced technological infrastructure,
services and know-how to cultural institutions in Greece. Some of the
major innovative cultural sponsorships in 2015 also supported local
communities
“A Greek Island at the Gates of the East” – Rhodes Archaeological
Museum
Rhodes Archaeological Museum hosted an exhibition entitled “A Greek
Island at the Gates of the East” from the Louvre featuring treasures from
the island of Rhodes from the 15th to 5th centuries BC. 48 unique and
rare loan items were exhibited in their birthplace for first time. 3G/4G
and Wi-Fi were provided to Museum visitors and in the surrounding
Palace and Knight’s Castle.
Underwater excavation off the coast of Antikythera
Support continued for the underwater excavation expedition off the
coast of Antikythera in September and October 2015. The international
team of scientists carrying out the excavation came from the Hellenic
Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities and the Ministry of Culture in collaboration with the U.S. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. COSMOTE
provided uninterrupted communications in Greece and abroad to meet
the team’s telecommunication and publicity needs, as it had equipped
the island of Antikythera with permanent new-generation telecom infrastructure in 2014.

Restoration of the National Observatory of Athens on Nymphs Hill,
Thissio
Another important contribution to preserving Greece’s cultural heritage
was the restoration of the historic Dorides Refracting Telescope and
the building and dome it is housed in. The work was completed in May
2015. The building and telescope built in 1870 are located at the National Observatory of Athens in Thissio, directly opposite the sacred rock
of the Acropolis. Now visitors can observe and explore the Attica sky
and planets through the lens of the most historic telescope in Greece,
as 113 years of scientific history have been brought back to life by the
work of OTE Group technicians. They not only dealt with all the
telescope’s electrical and mechanical problems but also repaired the
structural problems in the building and the dome, and installed lighting
for the path leading to the Dorides building.

Digitization as a key opportunity

Digitization as a key opportunity

So how can we make sure the digital age doesn't leave people
behind?
To an extent, people need entirely different qualifications to survive in
this new world. That is why it is so important to be able to use new technologies competently. We need a fresh push in education -- from
schools and vocational training all the way to colleges and universities -to make digitization a central plank of all programs and courses, and
to involve not just politicians and academics, but business too.
Do you think that people have still to realize just how decisive
digitization is for the future?
Let me put it this way, we still do not have a full enough understanding
of digitization. That is why I think computer science should be made a
mandatory subject in our schools. As a subject, computer science has
an importance comparable with English these days.
And what can people do as individuals?
People should embrace this change and see digitization as a chance
to reshape society. That means being prepared for lifelong learning and
further development. Anyone who thinks they can rely on one formal
qualification for their entire career is quickly going to run into difficulties.
What does Deutsche Telekom offer its employees to keep them in
good shape for the digital age?
We offer a wide range of in-house further training. Our cyber security
professional training course is just one successful example of this. And
with our Teachtoday initiative we are also working to achieve competent
use of digital media in wider society.

Christian P. Illek,seit April 2015 Vorstand Personal der Deutschen Telekom

Digitization is changing our society and working world.
What trends do you see?
The digitized ecosystem will change the way we work. The presence
of automation and smart machines in our working and private lives is
increasing. As this process continues, we must ensure that people stay
at the heart of everything we do. We aren't talking about competition
between man and machine – we're talking about collaboration and
automation. That will give us extra freedom, freedom that can then be
dedicated to innovation. It's worth noting that digital skills are not just
a key qualification in the working world but now also a prerequisite for
participating in society.

In addition to new educational content, does digitization also require
new methods of cooperation?
Of course. To put it simply, what matters is results, not whether you turn
up. In the future, cooperation in an increasingly digitized working world
will require us to work in a more participative, transparent and virtual
way: specific work situations will determine the most suitable working
environment. Depending on your role, that may mean being on the go
or being part of an open-plan office set-up with agile working methods.
This will require employees, and in particular managers, to embrace
these new working methods. Trust will be the decisive driver behind this
cultural change.
In what way is leadership changing because of this development?
Digitization, with its growing complexity and volatility, is forcing us to
abandon our tried-and-tested leadership models. New criteria for evaluating leadership skills and style are being introduced as yesterday's
"command-and-control" approaches often no longer function. Digital
collaboration tools, such as companies' own internal social networks,

Deutsche Telekom - Corporate Responsibility Report 2015

Employees
Digitization as a key opportunity

98

make knowledge-sharing faster and more transparent, which ultimately
leads to decision-making processes becoming more democratic. It is
vitally important for managers in Work 4.0 environments to understand
and be able to work with such tools. Particular attention must be given
to how leadership's responsibility can influence culture.
Key word culture: But Deutsche Telekom is anything but a young
start-up, its a well-established corporation...
...in the midst of a transformation. That is why management must pay
extra attention to managing ambivalent organizational structures. On
the one hand, our core business must be continuously optimized while,
on the other, innovations and new business ideas must be developed.
The struggle to manage efficiency and innovation calls for rigorous,
interdisciplinary thinking from leadership and better and more intensive
communication.
Many people are worried about increasing digitization, both as it
affects their private and professional lives. What would you say to
them?
Digitization offers us fascinating possibilities. It can help us make work
more humane and improve our lives. Just think of medical technology,
for instance. These developments offer many opportunities and we
must seize them. At the same time, we must act to shape technological
progress in all areas of our responsibility and value system. In the digital
age, transparency and sticking to core ethical and moral principles will
be indispensable guidelines on the path to a social consensus at work
and in life in general.

Responsible and agile employer

Responsible and agile employer

We aim to become the leading European telecommunications provider.
Cooperative employee relations that are based on involvement and fairness are key in achieving this goal. As a responsible employer we give
our employees the opportunity to realize their potential and to contribute their individual strengths and ideas within our Group. In a market
characterized by transformation, we use pioneering methods and tools
to help our employees approach necessary changes and new technical
opportunities with flexibility.

expressly encourages flexible working models. Our flexible working
models range from flexitime and part-time work to lifetime work
accounts. We introduced lifetime work accounts for all of our employees
in 2016, for example. This gives our employees the opportunity to
finance a temporary release from work of longer than one month, which
may be used for early retirement, a sabbatical or to support a period of
part-time work. Before that, lifetime work accounts were only available
to executives. Deutsche Telekom's working models comply with current
collective agreements for employees, the Federal Civil Service Act and
internal regulations.
Socially responsible staff restructuring
Our Group transformation activities, which will help us stay competitive
in the future, were a central topic these past years and will continue to
be in years to come. These activities include complex staff restructuring
measures. Deutsche Telekom is committed to socially responsible staff
restructuring with the extensive support of our employees. These measures are based on our “integrated planning and management process”, which the Group Board of Management annually reviews and
approves. We document the progress of our socially responsible staff
restructuring activities in our monthly Group reports.

Shaping employee relations as a responsible employer
As a responsible employer, we maintain trusting relationships with
our employees throughout the Group as well as with trade unions and
employee representatives and engage in extensive dialog with them.
This involves the works councils, the Central Works Councils, the Group
Works Council, the Group representatives for the disabled and the Executive Staff Representation Committee within the Group in Germany,
and the European Works Council at a European level. We maintain constructive relationships based on mutual trust with all of these employee
representative bodies.

Employee satisfaction and participation
We pursue open dialog and productive exchange with our employees.
The Telekom Social Network (TSN) is an important tool in these efforts.
All of our employees can post topics of their choice there and open
them for discussion. Our managers also regularly use TSN as a platform
for direct dialog. Another central aspect in our Group-wide feedback
culture is our employee survey. We supplement this survey with regular
pulse surveys, which give us a snapshot of the mood in the Group
twice a year. Our Group-wide ideas management activities are another
key tool in encouraging employee contributions to the success of the
company.

Fair pay and benefits
We give our employees fair pay in line with the standard wages typical
to the relevant country's employment market and guarantee equal pay
for work performed by men and women without discrimination. We
pay Deutsche Telekom managers in compliance with our Group-wide
“Global Compensation Guideline”. We also offer our employees additional benefits such as our company pension scheme. We assess the
effectiveness of our pay and benefits elements by conducting various
measures such as employee interviews.

Our employees have been showing an ever-increasing interest in getting
involved in both our Group-wide employee survey and our ideas
management initiative. 78 percent of our employees participated in the
2015 Group-wide employee survey (without T-Mobile USA). This is
the highest participation rate we have seen so far, and employee satisfaction was higher than in previous years as well. In terms of ideas
management, twelve ideas were submitted for every 100 employees, the
highest participation rate ever recorded We also offer our employees
different ways to get involved, e.g., in the form of corporate volunteering
projects.

Flexible working models
Having the chance to structure one's work according to one's own
needs considerably improves work-life balance and helps prevent stress
and the feeling of being overworked. That is why Deutsche Telekom

Our Guiding Principles and Employee Relations Policy form the basis
for the employee relations standards that are employed throughout the
Group.

Deutsche Telekom - Corporate Responsibility Report 2015

Employees
Responsible and agile employer

Compliance with the Employee Relations Policy at
national companies
To help us effectively implement our Group Employee Relations Policy
we conduct special reviews to assess labor relations at the different national companies as well as any human rights-related risks resulting from
our business activities. In 2015 we held on-site reviews of compliance
with our Employee Relations Policy at the subsidiaries Deutsche Telekom Kundenservice in Germany, Hrvatski Telekom in Croatia and T-Systems France. The results were published on our website.
Our analyses showed that many employee standards in place at Deutsche Telekom Kundenservice are well above market standards, including internal training and development opportunities as well as the
health rate. Hrvatski Telekom in Croatia is the leader when it comes to
equal opportunities for men and women as well as work-life balance.
T-Systems France has also effectively implemented many aspects of the
Employee Relations Policy, including appropriate health and safety standards, risk prevention measures and work-life balance offers.
Socially responsible staff restructuring at
T-Systems
T-Systems has undergone an extensive transformation over the past
two years, a process that it has now successfully completed. This transformation was accompanied by complex staff restructuring measures at
T-Systems that were conducted in a socially responsible manner during
the reporting period. It included training measures, creating new
business areas and staff reductions. The Group offered support to all
employees whose positions were cut through a variety of measures,
focusing on the following initiatives during the reporting period:
Innovative change management with Job Service & Placement
Our active change management program for staff restructuring, Job
Service & Placement (JSP), was launched in 2014 to prepare employees
whose positions are undergoing restructuring in the transformation
process for employment opportunities within and outside of our company. Advisors from Vivento assist these employees with a professional
career analysis, advise them on their perspectives, help them through
the application process and help them identify interesting job openings.
Employees switching to an internal or external position with less favorable pay and benefits can also qualify for compensation payments. When
filling jobs being advertised internally, first priority is given to employees
supported by the JSP service, and we offer employees additional training of up to six months if necessary. We also provide support to anyone
whose position has been or is going to be cut through transparent
communication, e.g., through our "On-site consultations on staff restructuring during the transformation process," orientation workshops, continuing education, English courses and Xing trainings. JSP consulting
approach was enhanced in 2015. Consultants now assume more of a
supportive role. With this approach we intend to strengthen employees'
initiative and encourage them to independently find solutions that will
best suit them. JSP has placed a total of 800 employees in the approximately 18 months since it was launched.
Career opportunities for civil servants
Deutsche Telekom, numerous German federal government agencies
and Deutsche Telekom's own personnel service provider, Vivento, launched the “Chancen Bund initiative” in 2014 to offer IT experts with civilservant status at T-Systems an attractive opportunity to work for a German federal government agency. Thanks to the initiative 400 civil ser-

100

vants have already been seconded to the German federal government.
During the reporting period Deutsche Telekom developed a solution
that makes it possible for civil servants to switch to the next higher service grade. In accordance with legislation regarding civil servants it is
possible to switch to the next higher service grade in certain positions.
This is an opportunity for advancement, particularly for civil
servants who are currently performing a more senior role on temporary
leave from civil-servant status.
Supporting the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF)
The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) has seen a rapid
escalation in the number of applications for refugee status or asylum.
In order to rise to this challenge, the BAMF is currently on a recruitment
drive to significantly expand its workforce. Supporting federal, state and
local governments is particularly important to Deutsche Telekom when
it comes to refugee aid. Chief Human Resources Officer, Dr. Christian
Illek, initiated a task force for refugee aid during the reporting period
that is involved in different aid activities, including providing experts to
support the BAMF. There is a lot that Deutsche Telekom civil servants
can do at BAMF, from handling administrative tasks and coordinating
integration programs to providing IT support. BAMF is looking for
medium- to upper-grade civil servants who want to bring commitment
and experience to this social challenge.
Initiatives for switching jobs within the Group
We encourage employees to look for new jobs within the Group through
a number of offers. The incentives we offer include a special bonus
and compensation for any differences in pay. A good example is the
"operational services as an opportunity" initiative, which we launched
during the reporting period. With this initiative we support employees
looking to switch to operational services GmbH & Co. KG, a 50-percent
subsidiary of T-Systems International GmbH. We also assign tasks that
were previously handled by external service providers to our own employees whenever possible in line with the principle of "internal over external."
To help us in these efforts, we launched the Market Unit Hub initiative
for employees working for our T-Systems Market Unit. Within only six
months after launching the initiative we were able to place almost 300
employees and replace external service providers.
Thanks to these measures we were able to avoid compulsory redundancies and set up new business areas with qualified IT experts in 2015.
However, we have not yet met our headcount targets at Telekom IT,
which is why we made the decision in Q3 2015 to intensify our current
measures.
Civil servant transfers
Around 800 Deutsche Telekom civil servants decided with the assistance of Deutsche Telekom's in-house personnel service provider,
Vivento, to make a permanent transfer to federal, state or local government. Their decision was made easier by the increased need for personnel at the level of federal, state and local government resulting from
numerous reform projects. The new employment opportunities outside
of the company offering highly interesting perspectives for new career
paths were particularly attractive to employees from Group departments
currently undergoing a transformation process. Transfers to customs
offices, IT positions connected to the “Chancen Bund initiative” and a
number of positions with federal, state or local public administration
were of particular interest.
Deutsche Telekom - Corporate Responsibility Report 2015

Responsible and agile employer

Flexible working models
In addition to a wide range of working models Deutsche Telekom offers
part-time models that are tailored to the needs of specific target groups.
Voluntary commitment to encouraging part-time employment
Deutsche Telekom has been explicitly promoting part-time working
hours for managers since introducing its policy on part-time work in
2010. The aim is to encourage part-time work with a view to improving
and facilitating the work-life balance, for both women and men. In 2015
a total of 51 managers throughout Germany were working part-time.
We have also made a similar voluntary commitment regarding employees covered by collective agreements and civil servants. 13.7 percent
of employees covered by collective agreements and 20 percent of civil
servants employed at Deutsche Telekom throughout Germany are currently working part-time.
Guaranteed return to full-time work
Since January 1, 2014, we have been guaranteeing part-time employees
at Deutsche Telekom the chance to return to work full time in case they
wish to end part-time work earlier than planned and return to their previous schedule. All they need to do is give 3 months' notice; operational
issues play no role. That means more flexibility and security for employees. With this policy, Deutsche Telekom is setting the bar for part-time
employment.
Phased retirement
Phased retirement is a model to help employees with a smooth transition to retirement. Employees aged 55 and above can reduce their final
working years and begin early retirement. Deutsche Telekom offers
phased retirement both as a block and as a part-time model . Unlike
regular part-time regulations, Deutsche Telekom makes a substantial
top-up payment to the employees' net part-time pay with its phased retirement offer. That means that reducing their weekly hours does not
mean a proportionate reduction in net pay for employees. A total of
2,309 phased retirement contracts were signed during the reporting
period, 1,869 with employees under collective agreements and 440
with civil servants.
Part-time training for single parents
Deutsche Telekom has been offering single parents up to the age of
25 the opportunity to complete a training program or cooperative
course of study part-time since 2011 in collaboration with the German
Federal Employment Agency. 50 young people began their part-time
training with this program in 2015.
Returning to work after parental leave
Within the scope of the Stay in ContacT parental leave program, Deutsche Telekom offers employees on parental leave a part-time
program to help them return to work.
Deutsche Telekom also offers many other part-time options to reduce
working hours including job sharing, where two or more employees
share one position. This option can be employed using a job splitting
model where each employee is responsible for different tasks or via job
pairing, where employees share responsibility for one area.

Deutsche Telekom is committed to fair pay
Deutsche Telekom fosters employee relations based on trust and pays
all of its employees at the Group fairly and based on market standards.
This also includes our numerous apprentices, students on cooperative
degree programs and entry-level professionals. In the 2014 collective
bargaining round, the negotiating partners agreed on the following
terms, which apply to the majority of employees covered by collective
agreements at the Deutsche Telekom Group in Germany:
 Starting in 2014, the salaries of roughly 60,000 employees covered
by collective agreements at Group parent company Deutsche
Telekom AG and in the Germany operating segment were raised in
two phases as at April 1, 2014, and February 1, 2015, by a total of 5
percent for employees in the lower pay groups and 4.6 percent for
employees in the higher pay groups. The collective wage agreements have a term of 24 months and will expire on January 31,
2016.
 Pay raises totaling 3.5 percent were agreed at T-Systems within the
context of the current transformation program at T-Systems. The
roughly 20,000 employees received a 1.5-percent raise as at April 1,
2014, and a 2.0-percent raise as at April 1, 2015. The collective
wage agreement has a term of 24 months and will expire on March
31, 2016.
 The majority of the Group's employees participate directly in the
company's success. For these employees, variable remuneration is
determined exclusively on the basis of company target achievement.
The Minimum Wage Act, which went into effect in Germany on January
1, 2015, has no impact on payment under collective agreements at
Deutsche Telekom. Hourly wages at Deutsche Telekom are considerably
higher than the required minimum wage of 8.50 euros. Internships with
a duration of more than three months, with the exception of mandatory
internships, also became subject to minimum wage when the new legislation went into effect. Regardless of these legislative changes, Deutsche Telekom places considerable importance on continuing to offer
both voluntary and mandatory internships with longer durations, giving
students the chance to explore possible careers and get to know what it
is like to work at the company.
Intensive dialog with employee representatives
We successfully continued our intensive dialog with the works councils
and trade unions in 2015. The year was characterized by measures of
far-reaching strategic significance such as site consolidation for Deutsche Telekom Technischer Service GmbH and founding a multi-shared
services unit, which has been in charge of finance, purchasing and HR
services since January 1, 2016. We have discussed these intensively
with employee representatives. This goes to show that our commitment
to trusted cooperation, which is anchored in our Employee Relations
Policy is taking effect. Standardizing and harmonizing employment conditions within the Group will be a key topic for the future, and we will do
this in close collaboration with the trade unions and works councils.
Thanks to the establishment in late 2015 of the IT and telecoms employers’ association agv:comunity, collective agreements can now be made
for the Group as a whole, rather than just for individual companies. In
this way we hope to cut back on the complexity of collective agreements
at the Group. The agv:comunity is also open to other companies from
the telecommunications and IT industry.

Responsible and agile employer

Great interest in employee survey
The opinions of our employees play a key role in the evolution and transformation of our company, which is why we regularly ask them to give us
their feedback. Our most important feedback tools include our employee survey, which is conducted every two years, and the bi-annual pulse
survey . The pulse survey continuously gives us a snapshot of the current mood in the Group and allows us to monitor the effectiveness of the
follow-up measures taken as a result of the employee survey. This lets us
make quick adjustments if necessary.
Our most recent Group-wide employee survey (without T-Mobile USA)
was conducted in 2015. We invited some 184,000 employees from 30
countries speaking 22 different languages to give us feedback. Over
144,000 employees worldwide took part, a response rate of 78 percent.
This is the highest participation rate we have seen so far, and the high
participation rates recorded in previous years are also proof of the tremendous interest our employees have in helping to shape our Group.
The high scores previously recorded in the commitment index continued to increase slightly in 2015 to 4.1 on a scale of 1.0 - 5.0 (2012:
4.0). Employee satisfaction, which we gauge twice a year with our
Group-wide pulse survey, also receives a high score with 76 percent
positive responses. The next pulse survey will be conducted in 2016.
The next Group-wide employee survey is scheduled for 2017.
High turnout for Group-wide ideas management
A large number of employees again turned out to get involved in the
Group-wide ideas management program in 2015. In Germany alone,
one out of every eight employees submitted a new idea, giving us the
highest participation rate ever recorded. This shows how strong our
employees' interest is in actively playing a part in improving our products and services. The economic benefit resulting from the 13,728
ideas submitted translated into a total of 146.5 million euros in cost
savings and tapping new business potential. We particularly encourage
our employees to submit ideas on the topics of the future, which is why
we launched the "Smart Home - simpler, better, more integrated!" ideas
management campaign in May 2015, calling for innovative suggestions
on the topic. Making a name for our “Smart Home” product, which constitutes one of the largest areas of growth at our Telekom Shop Gesellschaft, is one of the Group's top objectives. Contestants submitted a
total of 66 ideas, five of which resulted in a modification or expansion of
the product.
Our ideas management results can also hold their own in external
competitions. One employee idea won the 2015 German Ideas Award
granted by Deutsches Institut für Betriebswirtschaft in the "Best environmental idea" category. Another idea received first place in the "Best
employee idea 2015" category of the 2015 Ideas Management Award
presented by Deutsches Institut für Ideen- und Innovationsmanagement.

We are keen to foster a communicative, performance-driven working
climate, innovativeness and agility. As well as modern workplaces, this
demands measures to encourage flexibility, virtual collaboration and
leadership, and a culture of knowledge sharing. We are creating open
office worlds and tearing down the proverbial walls to promote interdepartmental collaboration. Employees can choose their workstation
and share their desks. In 2015, one of our top priorities was to redesign
our locations in Bonn, Frankfurt, and Hamburg. Our goal is to continue
to pursue the transformation of our corporate culture from one based on
being at the office to one based on results. The plan is to reach around
25,000 employees with our concept by the end of 2017.
We promote and support virtual collaboration in communities of
practice. Instead of rigid, closed project teams, employees work
together
to develop cross-functional and cross-hierarchical solutions and to
increase their knowledge informally. During the reporting period, 40 of
these transnational communities worked at T-Systems on strategic
topics such as cyber security, cloud technology and the Industry Internet. Community members received intensive support through online
training to improve their virtual collaboration.
Leadership in times of change
We founded Shareground in 2013, an organizational unit that supports
cultural transformation with new work methods and innovative learning
formats. This includes workshops and team coaching sessions that
cover new forms of collaboration.
We are aware that companies also need to adjust their basic understanding of leadership in times of change, which is why, during the reporting
period, we invited all of our managers to participate in the “Facilitative
Leadership Curriculum” pilot project, a training program
on the topic of leadership in times of change. Facilitators are managers
who initiate, facilitate and encourage change at a company. With our
“Facilitative Leadership Curriculum” we hope to give new momentum
particularly to our employees who are involved in change processes
and development initiatives at our company. The pilot project provides
managers with an introduction to the methods and approaches used by
"facilitative leaders." They learn how to create a culture of development
and learning that is based on the individual's voluntary action and autonomy. Participants are also given practical tools and techniques that
they can use to make their jobs as managers easier. The program consists of three training units. Once they have completed all three units,
participants are invited to join the Facilitator Community where they
can discuss their experiences on the job with each other. A total of
32 employees participated in the pilot project and response was very
good. We will decide whether or not to offer the Facilitative Leadership
Curriculum program to all managers after the pilot project has been
evaluated.

Future Work – working in the digital age
The primary aim of our human resources development measures is to
promote virtual collaboration and new workplace structures. We collaborated with the University of St. Gallen to conduct a survey of experts
in order to identify the opportunities and challenges to the world of work
that come with digitization. 25 megatrends pertaining to Work 4.0 were
identified and published.

Health and safety

The health and performance of our staff are the foundation of the longterm success of our business. High absence levels due to illness, on the
other hand, come with many risks. Deutsche Telekom feels that it is its
duty and responsibility to maintain and promote the health of our employees.

One focus of our corporate health promotion activities is encouraging
our employees to assume responsibility for their own health. Our managers play a key role in promoting a corporate culture in line with these
goals and are obligated to take this responsibility seriously. Healthpromoting leadership is part of our leadership principles at Deutsche
Telekom and is assessed based on department-specific targets derived
from the results of our employee survey.
Above-average results
Different performance indicators reflect the effectiveness of our
corporate health management activities:
 The employee health rate of 94* percent at Telekom Deutschland is
stable unlike the current industry trend. (*95.6 percent excluding
long-term illnesses)
 The health index derived from the 2015 Group-wide employee
survey also remained stable compared to 2012 results.
 The accident rate is considerably below the industry average.

Promoting the health of our workforce
The main goal of Deutsche Telekom's health management system is to
maintain the health and performance levels of our employees. We view
occupational health and safety legislation as minimum requirements.
Incorporating health and safety management throughout the Group
Our corporate occupational health and safety measures are effectively
incorporated into our corporate structures via certified management
systems and appropriate policies and guidelines. These are based on
the internationally recognized OHSAS18001 standard, which we began
rolling out throughout the Group in 2010. All of the parties, tasks and
measures involved in the health and safety management system are
described in a handbook and procedural instructions and have been
signed by the executive management. The topic is monitored and managed at Group level; health managers at each location are also responsible for structuring the measures.
We systematically assess the effectiveness of our measures. This includes reviewing the results or our employee survey, competitor benchmarks and other relevant performance indicators. The analysis
of this data forms the basis for annual targeted measures that by far
exceed legal requirements. Some examples include our diabetes
prevention campaign and an extensive psychosocial counseling offer.

 According to health insurance providers, the number of our
employees suffering from mental disorders and the length of
treatment is not rising unlike the industry trend.
This year's RobecoSAM rating, for example, attests to our high standards. RobecoSAM is one of the leading rating agencies, annually
assessing the sustainability performance of major corporations. Deutsche Telekom scored 97 out of 100 points in the Privacy and
Operational Health & Safety category of the 2015 RobecoSAM Corporate Sustainability Assessment, making Deutsche Telekom an industry
leader.
Diabetes prevention campaign
Seven million people in Germany suffer from diabetes and the numbers
are growing. Having your blood sugar tested is a good way to identify
the disease at an early stage, which is why Deutsche Telekom offered its
employees the opportunity to have their blood sugar tested at more than
50 locations in Germany between March and June 2015. More than
3,000 employees participated in the campaign, which was conducted in
collaboration with the BKK health insurance company. Employees with
unusual results received extensive follow-up counseling by a company
doctor. Deutsche Telekom's blood sugar testing campaign picks up the
thread from last year's heart and circulatory disease prevention campaign. Because diabetes will become more common as the population
ages, we are planning to continue this campaign in the coming years.

Fit and mobile at work
We have been offering our employees special fitness programs at locations in Germany since 2014 to help counteract the effects of a day
spent working at their desks. Qualified mobile fitness coaches teach
easy-to-do exercises particularly for the back and neck to small teams
of employees. We continued these programs in 2015 as part of our
extensive health promotion activities; more than 600 courses were
held in 2015.
Psychosocial counseling as part of change
management
Changes at work can be perceived as stressful, which is why we have all
the transformation processes currently underway at Deutsche Telekom
intensively supported by the Employee and Executive Advisory Service.
Our goal is to provide support to employees and managers and prevent
psychological crises.
We offer individual counseling where employees affected by the changes can take advantage of an hour of private counseling. Special offers
to managers and those responsible for change processes are designed
to help them through the transformation. Talks and workshops on psychological health complete the offer. Communication campaigns are
used to inform employees and managers at affected sites of the offers
available.
The T-Systems transformation process received particular support in
2015 thanks to psychosocial counseling offers. In collaboration with
health service provider B.A.D., we offered counseling days at 11 locations in Germany. B.A.D. also offered on-site consultations at all of
T-Systems' 12 regional info events. We offered events for managers as
well, where they could learn more about B.A.D.'s services. Three-quarters of all of T-Systems' managers (1,550 people) took advantage of the
opportunity to find out more and address specific questions pertaining
to their daily leadership tasks.
Workshop makes promoting health top priority
A corporate culture that promotes health needs role models, which is
why we have been integrating workshops on health-promoting leadership into our Leadership Excellence and Development (LEAD) program
in Germany since 2014. At the two-day workshops, managers learn
more about their own health and are taught how to improve their
individual resources. They then learn the basic principles involved
in a managerial approach to promoting health. This offer addresses executives and experienced top-level managers. We also offer workshops
on health and leadership for our other managers such as team leaders.
This workshop series will be offered again in 2016.
‘Nurture Yourself’ Program
In order to assist T-Systems employees to function at optimal levels,
the company provides an Employee Wellness Program (EWP) known
as Zinakekele (which means ‘nurture yourself’ in Zulu). Employees and
their families have access to confidential support to help them address
the challenges and problems experienced in modern life, e.g. physical,
mental or emotional illness, financial, legal, marital or family distress,
alcohol or drug abuse, or similar concerns. The program provides
various counseling and support services that can be accessed by
phone or face-to-face in both work and private environments. Emplo-

yees are encouraged to take responsibility for their own health through
an online portal where they receive personalized ‘Health Bytes’ (according to their profile) and can ‘Ask the Doctor’ about any concerns they
have.
The EWP activities in 2015 included:

Launch of a T-Systems Walking Club

Approximately 1,000 employees were reached during the Wellness
Days in May 2015. With the help of a state-of-the-art technology-driven
journey a comprehensive health and wellness profile of each employee
was built to identify areas of potential risk, which should then be
addressed.
Towards the end of 2015 a “Giving From The Heart” program was launched to support employees who are going through a traumatic experience or critical illness. This program includes personal messages from
the Managing Director in conjunction with counselling sessions with a
psychologist.
Since back and neck pain was one of the top reported health problems
in the Employee Survey 2015, the company is planning to provide laptop stands for all employees in 2016, as they promote good ergonomics
and help to alleviate back and neck pain.
Total Health: Internal health for employees program
Total Health, an in-company training program, promotes physical exercise to improve employees’ health and lifestyle, and enable them to
participate in relaxing activities with their co-workers. Total Health
continued throughout 2015 with 142 employees participating in 313
different kinds of sporting disciplines, such as kickboxing, zumba
fitness, Latin dance and yoga, all taught on company premises. One of
the most remarkable benefits of the Total Health program has been the
marked reduction in the numbers of overweight employees, as shown
by the figures provided by PREVENIMSS, a government program that
examines employees in the T-Systems offices for two weeks a year.
In addition to the ongoing sporting activities of the total Health Program,
T-Systems Mexico staged an internal competition known as Kiloton
from 15 June to 27 August 2015. Kiloton combined exercise and a
balanced diet to motivate employees to reduce weight and body fat. The
activities offered to reach that goal included a nutritionist program, kick
boxing and dance classes on the premises, as well as weekly tips on
how to reduce or lose weight. More than 200 participants (almost 15%
of the workforce) made up 50 mixed teams in the Puebla offices and
17 mixed teams in the Polanco and Santa Fe offices. The results were
extraordinarily good and exceeded the previous year’s target with all the
participants managing to reduce their body fat and weight. By the end
of the 2015 activities, the participants had lost a total of 282 kg due to
their great efforts and participation in all the classes offered by the company.

Health activities for employees
During 2015 Slovak Telekom staged numerous health-oriented activities
for employees, including measuring blood pressure, cholesterol levels,
varicose veins and hemoglobin, health boxes for front-line staff, first-aid
courses, massages, lymphatic drainage, health seminars, and information about healthy food at the workplace.
These activities are very popular at Telekom, with 2,793 employees
having their health measured and 1,390 participating in the 14 health
seminars and workshops featuring nutrition specialists, doctors and
other professionals. A special Health Week and Benefits was held from
September 21-30, 2015.

Education and development

Education and development

The need for highly qualified workers in the STEM subjects (science,
technology, engineering and math) will continue to grow in coming
years. This development will particularly be felt in business areas such
as cloud technology, big data, cyber security and the Industrial Internet.
Our extensive training and continuing education offers help prevent a
lack of these skilled workers, sharpen our company's competitive edge
and get us ready for the digital future.

Investing in training and development
Our goal is to identify and get talented young people on board early on
in their careers. That is why we extensively support their training and
continued education. We specified a trainee ratio of 2.9 percent of our
employees in Germany each year until 2015. We currently offer openings for ten vocational training programs and eight cooperative degree
programs. This makes us one of the largest vocational training providers
in Germany. We also offer a large number of training and development
opportunities for our experts and managers. With these continuing
education offers, Deutsche Telekom promotes the concept of life-long
learning.

The cornerstones of our vocational training and development programs
are our Employee Relations Policy, Guiding Principles and Leadership
Principles.
Education 3.0 successfully concluded
The aim of our Education 3.0 initiative, which we finalized in 2015, was
to bring our offers better in line with Deutsche Telekom's future strategic
needs. We developed a completely new training portfolio for the big
data topic, for example. Courses on "usable privacy & security" were
added to our training program for cyber security professionals, which
was launched in 2014. In this context, we laid special emphasis on digital learning formats along the entire education chain, from vocational
training through to cooperative bachelor programs and part-time master
programs.
Promoting digital learning
We have been promoting digital learning at our company for many
years. Around 30 percent of all learning hours are currently held digitally and the number is growing. The learning program portfolio combines programs available on the market with our own in-house products
to create Group-specific content. A good example of this is our “All-IP
Basic Training”, a 90-minute online training program. The course is offered to all of our employees, an excellent chance to acquire basic knowledge of IP. By the end of 2015, this course had been accessed around
3,700 times, both nationally and internationally. We also rely increasingly on informal digital learning. Experts meet in digital communities, for
example, to discuss the topics of the future. Around 40 international
communities are currently active, 17 of which are focused on Deutsche
Telekom's strategic business areas. Community members at T-Systems
use the “Virtual Collaboration” digital learning format to encourage collaboration across segments, countries and hierarchies.
Group-wide management development
With our Leadership Excellence and Development (LEAD) program,
we make a standardized offer of business-based, strategically relevant
learning formats available to all managers at the Group. The portfolio
covers central topics that support managers in mastering the challenges involved in their daily work as well as in their roles as leaders
and team managers. The program is based on our leadership principles
"Collaborate," "Innovate" and "Empower to perform."
Performance assessment tools
The “Performance Dialog” is our tool for assessing the performance of
high-ranking managers. Around 2,800 top-level managers are currently
being assessed using this tool. The assessment involves not only target
achievement levels but also looks at how the manager went about
achieving these goals. Managers complete a self-assessment and
obtain feedback from their colleagues. We also continue to use our

Deutsche Telekom - Corporate Responsibility Report 2015

Employees
Education and development

other performance assessment tools, “Compass”, for civil servants and
employees covered by collective agreements in Germany, and our
“Performance & Potential Review” for employees in Germany outside
collective agreements, a tool that is also used at many of our national
companies.
Assessing effectiveness
We regularly and systematically review the effectiveness of our training
and development activities. These reviews involve standardized surveys
conducted as part of our quality circle, which gives us a regular overview of the quality of our training and development activities via monthly
reports. Our Bologna@Telekom program designed to encourage parttime study ,for example, is now subject to extensive quality controls –
from the application process to graduate management. We also ask
employees to evaluate our training and development offers in our regular employee survey . Additional tools are added to our standard
reporting and surveys as needed. In 2015 we surveyed all 805 of the
top-level managers at T-Systems about our leadership culture within the
scope of our Group-wide initiative "Lead to win." The fact that 75 percent of these managers participated in the survey shows that this topic
is important to them. 66 percent rated collaboration within their own
business unit as positive. The feedback we received from more than
400 personal comments was especially valuable. We will be using the
survey results to further improve the leadership culture at T-Systems.
Deutsche Telekom's in-house university encourages
interest in STEM subjects
The company's own HfTL University of Applied Sciences in Leipzig is
involved in a variety of projects focused on educating experts to work in
the telecommunications market and on encouraging young people to
pursue careers in the STEM subjects.
New bachelor program: Applied computer science
The cooperative bachelor program for a degree in Applied Computer
Science got underway at HfTL with the start of the 2015/2016 winter
semester. In addition to teaching the basics of computer science, the
program particularly focuses on future-ready technologies and how
they can be applied. Students can choose specialization modules such
as programming apps for smartphones, programming databases and
managing complex networks. They also gain and apply in-depth knowledge of innovative concepts and technologies for application development and data management. The program will be continued in the
2016/2017 winter semester with a considerable increase in registration
numbers.
Study programs available to refugees
HfTL has been accepting refugees for bachelor and master's degree
programs, both full and part-time, since the 2015/2016 winter semester.
The bachelor programs are held in German and the master's program in
Information and Communications Technology is offered in both German
and English. As HfTL students, refugees qualify for the "MINT-Bonbon"
scholarship program, which means they do not have to pay course fees.
Costs for German courses or subject-related support courses as well as
semester fees and the required IT equipment are paid for as well. The
German Federal Employment Agency's career information centers and
non-profit organizations provide refugees with information about the

107

offer. Seven refugees from Syria were accepted into the bachelor program for the 2015/2016 winter semester. New students are expected to
join in 2016.
Competition instead of class
In the 2015/2016 winter semester more than 200 HfTL students participated in the 2nd Software Engineering Competition. For the first time,
students from the Business Information Systems and Communications
and Media Technology part-time programs also participated in the competition. The competition calls for students to develop innovative solutions to current problems in the telecommunications industry and other
business sectors. The projects covered a wide range of topics, from web
applications for non-profit associations, apps to create songs and budget planning for shared apartment communities, to developing a community app for borrowing unused equipment and other items. The student projects will be judged by an internal jury at the university on the
basis of specified criteria. The winning team will get to participate
in an IT security workshop held by T-Systems MultiMedia Solution in
Dresden. Other prizes include a workshop on the Scrum software
development method and the chance to participate in student business
counseling.
Getting Recruiting at Deutsche Telekom ready for
the future
Deutsche Telekom is always looking for creative spirits and technologyminded people who want to help us shape the digital future. We will
consolidate our local Recruiting units into one global organization in
2016 in order to give us access to the best people regardless of national
borders and to improve international collaboration.
We have effectively positioned ourselves as an attractive employer over
the past few years with a creative, target group-oriented presence in
social media and other unusual initiatives such as "Leave your Mark"
and "Blind Applying." This was confirmed by the Online Talent Communication 2015 study conducted by Potentialpark, which rated our Careers website as the best employer presence in Germany.
Since 2013, we have been awarding the Women's MINT Award in
collaboration with audimax student magazine and the “MINT-Zukunftschaffen” (Creating a STEM future) initiative in order to do something
about the lack of STEM experts and to get young women excited about
STEM subjects. The award goes to the most convincing final papers on
the following growth topics: networks of the future, Industrial Internet,
cyber security, automotive technologies and digital universe. The winning paper on "Dynamic Cell Size Adaptation and Intercell Interference
Coordination in LTE Heterogeneous Networks" received a prize of 3,000
euros and an additional paper in each of the five categories received
500 euros.
Active sourcing is key in looking for candidates, i.e., actively addressing
potential candidates via networks, trade fairs, events, etc. This enables
us to quickly engage in authentic, personal contact with candidates,
which establishes trust and helps us fill positions with top candidates
more quickly and cost-effectively.

Education and development

Start up!: trainee program for young innovators
Our international Start up! trainee program offers young people with
entrepreneurial spirit who are open to new ideas and innovation a
chance to get started at Deutsche Telekom in Germany. We hope to
attract graduates in STEM subjects to the trainee program. In the
reporting period we accepted 31 university graduates into our trainee
program, roughly 45 percent of whom were women. During a period of
15 to 18 months, the trainees get to know different areas of the company
in Germany and abroad and are put in charge of challenging project
activities in various business areas. Experienced mentors assist the trainees. The program is supplemented by innovative training formats and
events. One example is the Start up! Learning Company, with which we
won the HR Excellence Award 2015 in the "Corporate talent management program" category. At the Start up! Learning Company, young
talents can participate in project simulations where they learn how to
realize change despite resistance.
Encouraging diversity among our apprentices
We stand for open-mindedness and are committed to diversity, which is
why we accept different performance levels and needs when it comes to
young talents:
 Depending on how long their families have been in Germany and
where they come from, young people with migrant backgrounds
often encounter particular problems on the job and vocational training market. We see them as an opportunity for our company: today,
8.1 percent of our apprentices and students in cooperative degree
programs have a nationality other than German, representing a total
of 69 countries. We have also been offering internships for school
students targeted specifically at refugees since 2015 within the
scope of the Group's refugee initiative.
 In 2009 we launched the "My chance to get going" project in collaboration with the German Federal Employment Agency to help
people qualify for entry-level training. The program prepares disadvantaged young people for an apprenticeship at Deutsche Telekom.
The project has been very successful so far. Of the 564 interns who
participated in the program between 2009 and 2014, 401 have
already started a apprenticeship at our company; 93 of them started
with the first training year and 308 were accepted directly into the
second year. Another approx. 70 interns started the program in
2015.
 Since 2011 we have been collaborating with the German Federal
Employment Agency to offer single parents the opportunity to complete a training program or cooperative degree program part-time.
50 young people began their training with this program in 2015.
 To encourage diversity in the program, we also work to increase the
number of women participating in technical cooperative study programs. While in 2010 the share of women was only 11 percent, it
has meanwhile risen to 23.5 percent.
 Around one percent of our apprentices are young people with disabilities. This is above-average in view of the total number of disabled
people in Germany.

108

 Our Young IT Talents and Young Sales Talents programs support
high-performing apprentices and students in cooperative degree
programs who are focusing on IT, sales and customer consulting.
Participants have the opportunity to tackle challenging customer
projects and extend their skills at expert and training events, and in
national and international competitions.
Training program for cyber security professionals
enters second round
Deutsche Telekom is closing a gap on the German vocational training
and job market with our training program for cyber security professionals (certified by the Chamber of Industry and Commerce, IHK), which
was launched in 2014. According to a study by the BITKOM industry
association, IT data privacy experts are extremely hard to find on today's
market. The study found that there were no vocational training programs
and very few degree programs that people could attend to learn the
necessary skills. In response, Deutsche Telekom launched the cyber
security professional program in September 2014, a two-and-a-halfyear, part-time program created for apprentices and students in cooperative degree programs at Deutsche Telekom who become eligible to
apply after completing their current training. The program combines
classic further training with study modules and learning phases at the
company. Those who complete the course receive a certificate for IT
security professionals from the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
The training program for cyber security professionals entered its
second round in 2015 with ten selected participants. The program is
very popular with 300 graduates applying for the program in 2015. The
third generation of young talents will get started with the program in
2016. Employees with career experience will also have the opportunity
to earn the IHK certificate in 2016 through a condensed continuing
education program. In early 2016 Deutsche Telekom won the IHK education prize awarded by the Association of German Chambers of
Commerce and Industry (DIHK) in the Corporations category.
Special emphasis was placed on the topic of usable security and privacy. We created a supplemental training offer that focuses on the
human factor involved in IT security in collaboration with the Fraunhofer
Institute for Communication, Information Processing and Ergonomics
(FKIE) and incorporated it into our program in 2015. Another program
launched in 2015 is the "network forensics" certificate that our employees can earn by attending a series of seminars developed in collaboration with several universities.
Promoting and retaining talent
Having dedicated, ICT-minded and service-oriented employees contributes to the success of our business. This makes it important to secure
the loyalty of these talented employees, encourage them, get them involved and develop their skills further. Our global talent management system serves as the basis for succession planning and placement of talented employees at our company.

vitae and get noticed. Employees from human resources units throughout the Group use the platform to get in touch with them. With more
than 550 employee profiles, 24 percent of which were posted by women
and 36 percent by international colleagues, the response to the platform
was slightly less than the previous year. The platform is a useful tool in
simplifying the process of finding the right person for a position anywhere in the Group and increasing an employee's chance of getting
noticed. It also encourages employees to gain experience at different
business units or national companies and in a range of functions,
furthering diversity at the Group.
"Light up" talent conference provides opportunity for dialog
300 talented employees from 20 countries met at the talent conference
in Bonn in September under the slogan, "Light up" or "Put your talent
in the spotlight!". Conference participants had the opportunity to learn
more about effective strategies to help them advance their careers.
The event was also an excellent networking opportunity. Around 100
top managers from the Group's various business units were invited to
attend the conference as guests.
T-Systems Connect-2-Change initiative: promotes dialog with
top performers
The Connect-2-Change initiative was launched in 2014 as a two-year
program to accompany the transformation process at T-Systems. Its aim
is to recognize the potential of top performers at T-Systems and
strengthen their loyalty to the company. During the reporting period
we invited roughly 150 employees to work on T-Systems' transformation
and future topics at conferences outside their typical job environments.
In intensive dialog with the management and in working groups,
participants had the opportunity to reflect their experience and knowhow from their day-to-day work on the basis of the company's strategic
direction. The mixed format of information, dialog, networking and interactive elements was well received. 98percent of participants gave the
program an excellent rating. 96percent said that the conference
strengthened their feeling of recognition and loyalty to the company.
The management also rated the event very favorably.
International Career Management Program encourages
international dialog
The International Career Management Program initiated by the Europe
& Technology Board area was launched in 2014. The purpose of the
program is to encourage an exchange of talented employees and create
permanent, international career paths facilitating transfers between the
national companies. More than 120 managers and experts traded workplaces at different companies for several months during the reporting
period. Employees were able to further their skills in an international
environment and the departments benefited from new knowledge and
experience as well as intensified networking. The program also expanded our internal talent market.
Delight your Customer: Telekom Deutschland's talent and
innovation platform
The Delight your Customer event series has served as a talent and
innovation platform at Telekom Deutschland since 2011. The program
addresses employees who are strong performers or have high potential
as identified by our performance development tools, “Compass” and

109

the Performance & Potential Review. Focal topics include customer
orientation and current market trends such as the increasing digitization
at the workplace. Participants collaborate in workshops, receiving real
customer feedback to improve service quality.
Three two-day “Delight your Customer” events were held in Bad Neuenahr, Germany in 2015 under the slogan "Experience digital worlds."
Roughly 1,000 participants from Telekom Deutschland met there to
network and come up with innovative ideas. The program featured
workshops and presentations on topics such as big data, design thinking, M2M and agile work. With the Delight your Customer program,
Telekom Deutschland specifically encourages cross-departmental and
cross-functional exchange. The event was very popular, with 97 percent
of participants stating they were satisfied or very satisfied.
Performance Dialog for all executives
Performance Dialog, which was introduced in 2014, is a tool for assessing the performance of top-level managers. It was expanded during the
reporting period to include all executives.
Performance Dialog encourages ongoing dialog between executives
and their superiors. Working together closely with their superiors and
reflecting intensively on their own leadership style is expected to
improve the performance of our executives and make the assessment
process more transparent. Performance Dialog is based on our “Guiding Principles” and our “Leadership Principles”, which were introduced in 2014: "Collaborate," "Innovate" and "Empower to perform." In
addition to being reviewed by their superiors, their colleagues also
assess the executives' leadership style. This peer feedback also has a
direct impact on target achievement.
Our “Compass” tool for assessing employees covered by collective
agreements and civil servants in Germany and our “Performance &
Potential Review”, which we rolled out internationally in 2014, continue
to be used throughout the Group.
Reality-based training for everyday challenges
In 2015 we offered a three-day Project Management Reality Training
program in which a total of 140 experienced project managers from
21 countries and all business areas of Deutsche Telekom participated.
Participants learned how to deal with everyday challenges with the help
of reality-based simulations, including fictional customers, employees
and suppliers. One assignment was to develop a concept for effectively
integrating a local telecommunications company affected by extensive
market changes. Participants had help from experienced trainers and
coaches and were able to expand their skills in dealing with different
target groups and intercultural collaboration. The training event was
also an excellent opportunity to share experiences and network with
people from other segments and countries. 95 percent of participants
stated that they would recommend the training to their colleagues.
Because of the tremendous response, we will be offering the program
again in 2016. The Project Management Reality Training program is part
of our international personnel development offer.

Employee engagement
T-Systems Limited has around 700 employees, distributed across a
number of locations in the UK and supporting a wide range of customers with different demands and IT requirements. The diverse nature of
the demands and staff geography coupled with an increase in home
working makes creating and maintaining a healthy company culture
more difficult and has increased the importance of consistent and well
managed two-way communication and engagement between staff and
management.
In 2015, T-Systems Limited implemented the Career Gateway, which
plays an essential role in shaping the company’s strategic skill management and establishes a proactive approach to continuous up-skilling.
It enables managers and individuals to identify any gaps in their skill set
either for their current or any possible future role within the company.
The Gateway will then pinpoint relevant training in a structured and
consistent manner. Employees take responsibility for their own development but are supported not only by their manager but also by Career
Champions who help to define and structure the career paths and
options available to all staff.
In addition to the Career Gateway, T-Systems Limited also implemented
a number of measures to improve the quality of two-way communication
between employees and the leadership. For example, Leadership@Delivery sessions are organized for developing common leadership skills,
changing management techniques, and sharing best practices
on developing people and managing teams.
The Managing Director holds face-to-face townhall meetings at our key
locations to explain local and international strategy in person.
Last but not least, the third Festival of Discovery, which gives staff from
different locations, service lines and accounts a chance to meet and
learn more about the strengths and direction of the company’s
business. The Festival of Discovery 2016 was held on 10th March 2016
and included a presentation to all staff on the importance of Corporate
Social Responsibility.

Diversity and equal opportunities

People from approximately 150 countries, women and men, young and
old as well as people with different abilities and cultural backgrounds,
work together effectively at Deutsche Telekom. This diversity helps us
stay on top of global competition with good ideas, excellent products
and the best team.

We offer multiplier and mentor programs to establish managers as
role models and ambassadors who encourage diversity. Since 2015,
we have been promoting awareness of diversity within the Group with
our unconscious bias campaign. It includes workshops and other offers
aimed at reducing prejudice. Many of our employees have become
actively involved in addressing various aspects of diversity, for example
as members of internal networks such as “queerbeet”, a network of
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual employees, or of the numerous
women's networks that have been established within the Group.
Deutsche Telekom's Diversity Policy, die Guiding Principles and Employee Relations Policy and the Social Charter are the cornerstones of
these measures. We are also a founding member of the Diversity Charter association.
We regularly review the effectiveness of our measures to promote
diversity and publish the results in our Fair Share and Work-Life reports.
More than 25 percent of our managerial positions are currently held by
women. The number of managers working part-time and the number
of fathers taking advantage of parental leave continues to grow as well.
The number of disabled employees working in Germany puts us well
over the statutory quota of 5 percent.

Supporting diversity
Our aim is to promote and benefit from the diversity of our employees as
a source of creativity and innovation. We offer our employees numerous
opportunities to grow professionally and personally at our company,
regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, health or ethnic or cultural
background. A central point here is increasing the number of women in
expert and managerial positions. We want to be the first DAX-30 company to have 30 percent women in middle and senior management
positions worldwide. To this end, we launched the Fair Share initiative.
As early as during the hiring process we emphasize diversity and consider options other than just traditional educational routes. One good
example is our entry-level qualification program for young people who
are disadvantaged in terms of their social and educational background
and our part-time apprenticeships/degree programs for single parents.
We support an effective work-life balance with extensive offerings to
allow our employees to work at their best. This includes daycare offers
and assistance with caregiving, offers which exceed the legal requirements. A good example is the right for part-time employees to return to
full working hours. All employees can return to their full weekly hours
whenever they want. In 2016 we also introduced lifetime work accounts,
which can be used by our employees to take limited time off, for
example.

Participating in the third German Diversity Day
In 2015 Deutsche Telekom again participated in the Germany-wide activity day held by the Diversity Charter association, the third German
Diversity Day. On this day we also launched our internal campaign on
unconscious bias. We used posters to raise awareness, explanatory
videos and practice-oriented workshops to show to our employees how
subconscious prejudice influences thoughts, feelings and actions and
how such behavioral patterns can be overcome. By the end of 2015,
a total of 3,100 employees had participated in the workshops and feedback was very positive. We have now begun to adapt the campaign to
other regions and to implement it at our national companies.
German Diversity Conference
An independent platform for dialog, strategies and innovation projects,
the Diversity Conference has been hosted jointly by the German daily,
“Tagesspiegel”, and the Diversity Charter association since 2012. In
November 2015 around 300 key players from the worlds of business,
politics, society and science once again came together in Berlin. At
one booth participants were able to catch up on activities at Deutsche
Telekom relating to diversity and unconscious bias. Deutsche Telekom
also sponsored the Diversity Slam, a particular highlight of the conference. Four teams or individuals, which had been pre-selected by a
jury, had a maximum of ten minutes to present their idea, best practice
example or study results relating to the topics of prejudice, stereotypes
and unconscious bias. The audience then voted for the best slam
presentation.

Action plan to promote inclusion
The share of disabled employees at our company has been exceeding
the statutory minimum percentage of 5 percent of the workforce for
years. Currently, people with disabilities account for more than 7 percent of our workforce in Germany, which puts us ahead of all other
DAX-30 companies. During the reporting period we developed an
action plan in collaboration with employee representatives that is based
on the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and
designed to continue the successful inclusion of persons with disabilities at our company. Measures defined in the action plan include
accessibility of training courses and IT applications.
Mentoring program for experts and managers on
parental leave
In 2014 we initiated the second round of our “Child and Career” mentoring program. The program is targeted toward young talent in expert
and managerial positions who are planning to take or are currently on
parental leave or have just returned to work. During all of these phases,
they are supported by a senior manager mentor. 31 tandem teams took
part in the second round of the program. The program runs for approx.
18 months and will end on June 30, 2016, with a number of trainings,
events and tandem discussions. The poll conducted upon completion
of the first round found that participants were very happy with the program; almost 20 percent were even able to advance their careers during
parental leave.
Training program to prepare employees for the
supervisory board
In 2014 we became the first DAX-listed company to develop a training
program in cooperation with the European School of Management and
Technology (ESMT) that gets employees ready for a position on the
supervisory board. The goal is to create a pool of candidates who could
potentially assume a position on the supervisory board at a Deutsche
Telekom company in Germany or abroad and to encourage women in
particular to take on a supervisory board position.
The first round of the program with 24 women ended in summer 2015.
In addition to traditional content, the training also gave insight into
practical experiences presented by supervisory board members, case
studies from the Group and a simulated supervisory board meeting. Of
the 24 female participants, 7 now hold positions on a supervisory board
with several more going through the nomination process. The training
program helped increase the percentage of women on supervisory
boards in Germany from 28 percent in 2014 to 30.6 percent. The program won 3rd place in the Equal Job Opportunities category of the HR
Excellence Award.
The successor program, now also open to men, got underway in
November 2015 with 28 female and 7 male participants.
The Family Manager pilot project
In July 2015 Deutsche Telekom created the position of Family Manager,
a point of contact offering employees personal advice on all kinds of
topics relating to the reconciliation of work and family. This offer also
includes a family hotline. Since its introduction the pilot project has met
with positive feedback. So far, approx. 140 personal consultations have
been provided. 420 employees have also signed up for a series of talks

112

on the "Reconciliation of work and care," which was launched as part
of the pilot project in December 2015. This pilot project will run for one
year and is initially available in Bavaria only.
Lifetime work accounts
We introduced lifetime work accounts for all of our employees in 2016.
This gives our employees the opportunity to finance a temporary release
from work of longer than one month, which may be used for early retirement, a sabbatical or to support a period of part-time work. Until this
year, lifetime work accounts were only available to executives. Our
employees can finance their account either from their gross salary or
with time credits converted into monetary amounts. Until 2018 we will
also support employees who are below a certain income limit with an
annual contribution.
Commitment to increasing the number of women in
managerial positions
In 2010 we became the first DAX-30 company to commit to staffing
30 percent of our mid and upper-level management positions worldwide with women. Our “Fair Share” initiative is designed to help us
achieve this goal. In 2011 we also launched an initiative together with
two other companies to boost the number of women in managerial
positions at the 30 DAX-listed companies, an initiative that is unique
in Europe. With these initiatives we were able to help fuel the ongoing
public debate on the topic.
To help us reach our goal, we launched our Fair Share initiative and
a number of measures: expanding our offers dedicated to work-life
balance by introducing parental leave models, flexible working hours
and child care facilities, a mentoring program to prepare female employees for supervisory board positions as well as addressing talented
women through channels such as our talent platform, Talents@Telekom.
As a result, we have been able to continually increase the percentage of
women in management positions since 2010. With 35 percent on the
Group's Supervisory Board, we have already surpassed our own goal as
well as the legal quota introduced on January 1, 2016. Since announcement of the women's quota in early 2010, we have been able to increase
the percentage of women throughout the Group from 19 percent to a
current 25 percent. In order to consolidate our achievements beyond
2015, we have prolonged our plan until 2020 and extended it to the two
management levels directly below the Management Board, to managing
boards as well as to our internal supervisory boards in Germany. With
these efforts, we are significantly surpassing the statutory regulations in
effect since 2015. We are planning to further pursue the measures we
have already taken in order to reach our goals.
Im November 2015 we joined the UN Women Empowerment Principles,
a global initiative launched by the United Nations and Global Compact
for the promotion of women at companies.
Sponsorship of “Every woman in technology” awards
T-Systems Limited partnered with Everywoman in 2013 and is now an
active member of the network. Everywoman is a membership organization that has championed the advancement of women in business since
its foundation in 1999.It works alongside companies looking to develop
and retain a pipeline of female leaders who are looking to advance

themselves and others.T-Systems Limited has its own Everywoman community with the aim of helping staff connect and stay inspired by providing the opportunity to network internally and externally, and to attend
in-company webinars, bi-monthly meetings and an annual event to hear
and learn from each other and leading women in the technology industry. In 2015 the Everywoman network was opened up to all staff to build
a broad understanding of the benefits to the organization of having a
truly diverse workforce.
As part of our commitment to the Everywoman program, T-Systems
sponsored the 2015 Everywoman Team Leader Award as one category
of the “Every woman in technology” awards. The awards play a vital role
in uncovering role models whose stories and achievements demonstrate to those young women and girls that they can achieve great
success if they opt to forge a career in IT.
T-Systems views the Everywoman program as an important part of its
strategy and continues to support it in 2016.

CR-rating: Overtime
Employees of Deutsche Telekom work under a flexitime policy. That
means that working hours are no longer based on specific starting and
ending times. Instead, employees can independently decide when they
are going to start and end work each day within a specified framework.
Hours worked are recorded in a flexitime account. When an employee
collects credit – in other words, works more than their regular working
hours – a traffic light system indicates whether those hours are still
acceptable. If they are not, flexitime credits are reduced in line with a
reduction plan agreed between the employee and their manager. The
flexitime account balance must pass the zero mark in regular intervals,
i.e., whithin 18 months as a rule.

CR-rating: Diversity & equal opportunities
T-Systems South Africa specifically encourages and supports groups
such as the blacks, coloreds and Indians that have been traditionally
disadvantaged. The framework for these efforts is the South-African
government's “Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment” (B-BBEE)
initiative. The aim is to achieve equality for traditionally disadvantaged
citizens when it comes to education and professional careers. In 2015,
T-Systems South Africa once again achieved its target of reaching the
B-BBEE compliance level 2. This compliance level confirms that the
company has followed the recommendations for supporting disadvantaged citizens to a very high degree. Compliance was certified by an
independent, external auditor.

Since January, employees covered by collective agreements have also
been able to pay up to 80 hours a year onto a lifetime work account. in
order to use all or part of these hours for a release from work later on.
The employment relationship persists during this release from work.
Remuneration is sourced from the credit accrued in the lifetime work
account.

The company worked to achieve the compliance level by setting specific
diversity targets for every employee category. These targets are based
on an analysis of the employee structure, vacant positions and potential
employees on the labor market. They cover ethnic background as well
as gender. Targets are set for every business area and in turn contribute
to the company targets . The managers' performance agreements are
linked to these targets.

CR-rating: Staff restructuring
Restructuring measures can have a significant impact on the lives of our
employees and their families, which is why we carefully consider alternative solutions and weigh legal, ethical and business-related aspects
before making such decisions. If a restructuring project cannot be avoided, we try to minimize any negative impact on our employees based on
our extensive experience with structuring change processes to make
them as socially responsible as possible.

Companies in South Africa are not legally required to participate in the
B-BBEE program; the program is, however, a requirement for receiving
government subsidies and participating in public bids

The relevant works council committees are informed on significant operational changes and involved according to the legally applicable provisions such as the German Works Constitution Act (Betriebsverfassungsgesetz). We also regularly engage in dialog with employee representatives at a national and European level. We comply with local employment
legislation in the countries in which we are active and often go above
and beyond minimum standards.

Sustainable procurement strategy

Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the media continue to
uncover violations of employee and human rights as well as environmental protection standards along the supply chain for phones, laptops
and other ICT products. As one of the largest telecommunications service providers worldwide with more than 30,000 suppliers in over 80
countries, we take this issue seriously. We use effective management
tools to make sure our suppliers and manufacturers provide humane
working conditions and are involved in effective environmental protection.

Managing sustainability in procurement processes
One of Telekom's aims is to constantly improve the sustainability of its
value chain. We have laid the foundation for this with our sustainable
procurement strategy. We adhere to principles for socially and environmentally friendly procurement throughout the Group and manage our
processes with the help of internal and external performance indicators
and management tools.
Basic standards
Telekom has created social and environmental minimum standards for
its corporate governance through its Guiding Principles and voluntary
commitments. We also require our suppliers to comply with these standards. Our CR and anti-corruption clause, which is based on the fundamental principles set forth in the following Group Policies, is an integral
component of our supplier contracts:






Our Group-wide Code of Conduct,
Our Social Charter,
The Telekom Fraud Policy,
The Coltan Statement and
The Statement on Extractives.

With our Social Charter we have made a commitment to complying with
the fundamental principles and standards set forth by the International
Labour Organization (ILO) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as well as with the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights and the UN Global Compact.
Commitment to sustainable procurement
Our strategy for realizing sustainable procurement practices is based on
our CR strategy and has been effectively incorporated into our procurement processes. The Sustainable Procurement Working Group (SPWG)
is responsible for Group-wide, i.e., international, implementation of our
sustainable procurement strategy. Members of the SPWG assist our
employees in all decisions regarding sustainable procurement. The
heads of the CR and Procurement departments are jointly responsible
for the implementation of sustainable procurement practices. They
report directly to the Board of Management member for Human Resources and Finance, respectively. Our escalation process calls for decisions
to be made at Board of Management level in serious cases. We have
also specified sustainable procurement requirements for the BuyIn joint
venture.
We have incorporated our sustainability principles into the Group's Global Procurement Policy to provide orientation for our buyers. The
accompanying Procurement Practices provide specific instructions on
how to conduct procurement transactions in Germany. We use an e-learning tool to train our employees. Our buyers can, for example, use the
tool to learn how to implement our sustainability principles in their daily
business activities.
Promoting sustainability with the Sustainable Procurement ESG KPI
We introduced the Sustainable Procurement ESG KPI to measure and
manage our performance in this area. This KPI measures the ratio between the procurement volume we receive from suppliers whose compliance with social and environmental criteria has been verified through
self-assessments, E-TASC or social audits, and our total procurement
volume. We have reached and even exceeded our goal of
covering 75 percent by 2015, reaching a current 78 percent for this KPI.
Our goal is to reach 80 percent by 2020.
Sustainability rankings rate supply chain management activities
Every year leading rating agencies measure the sustainability per-formance of large enterprises. Deutsche Telekom scored 93 out of
100 points in the Supply Chain Management category of the 2015
RobecoSAM Corporate Sustainability Assessment, making Deutsche
Telekom an industry leader.

Two awards presented in 2015 confirm our good performance in the
area of sustainable supply chain management: the German CSR Award
in the CSR in the Supply Chain category and the DQSGermany Excellence Awardin the Responsible Sourcing category.
CR Stakeholder Forum: transparency and
economic growth
On November 2 and 3, 2015 Deutsche Telekom hosted the 8th CRStakeholder Forum under the slogan "Enabling sustainability –
Turning visions into reality." While the first day focused on sustainable
products, the second day's main topic was sustainable supply chain
management.
Former German Federal Minister of the Environment Prof. Dr. Klaus
Töpfer held an inspiring opening speech in front of 120 external and
internal participants. He described sustainability as extremely complex
– an ongoing process. He also said that it is important to find solutions
today to ensure peaceful coexistence with an estimated world population of 9 billion by the year 2050 and called for the development of ICT
solutions in the face of the challenges ahead.
The subsequent panel discussion, which Prof. Töpfer also took part in,
provided key insights into CR issues – including those beyond Deutsche
Telekom's borders. Axel Bachmann, head of Sustainability at Coca Cola,
talked about the beverage company's CR activities. Luis Neves, Board
Representative for Sustainability and Climate Protection, provided
insight into the work of the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI), of
which he is chairman. Tessa Wernink, co-founder and head of Communications at Fairphone, introduced the company's sustainable smartphone. During the discussion, a number of votes were held in which
guests could participate using an app. All participants said they placed
importance on transparency in the supply chain. However, the panel
agreed that it was impossible to have complete control over a supply
chain with more than 30,000 suppliers, making risk awareness and
management all the more critical. They also agreed that transparency
in the supply chain could be a competitive advantage as it promotes
innovation and new business models. An interesting fact: 45 percent
of the guests who took part in the voting stated that they do not consider
sustainability aspects when buying a cell phone.

Act responsibly, teach sustainability
Acting responsibly is part of our corporate culture. We incorporate
this basic approach into various measures at our company, including
continuing education. The topic of sustainability in day-to-day business
was a focal point of our training activities for buyers in 2015. Around
120 employees from Germany and various national companies participated in four-day training courses where they learned about processes
and tools for sustainable procurement. 287 employees also used our
Sustainable Procurement e-learning tool in 2015.
DELFIN Award for suppliers and other companies
On June 12 2015 the 8th DELFIN award ceremony took place as part of
the 16th Sustainability Roundtable in Budapest. DELFIN is a Hungarian
acronym for “Award for a Committed, Sustainable and Innovative Generation” and these awards go to suppliers offering outstanding commitment to sustainable development in four categories:
 Support for equal opportunities and promotion of non-discrimination inside and outside the company
Innovation
in the interests of sustainability

Sustainability
education and awareness raising

Investment
and
development related to climate protection

This year, the jury of experts decided to recognize the efforts of organizations and businesses promoting waste management, renewable
energy, environment-friendly transportation, and equal opportunities.

Transparency as the basis for more sustainability was discussed in greater depth in subsequent workshops. One of the proposals that
participants came up with was to offer additional rewards for suppliers
meeting compliance standards. They were also in favor of closer
supplier/customer cooperation to create trust and find joint solutions
together in the face of potential challenges.
The second focus of the event, sustainable products and services,
is covered in the customers & products section.

Supply chain management

Supply chain management

Deutsche Telekom maintains business relationships with more than
30,000 suppliers in over 80 countries. Our relationships with suppliers
are based on trust and dialog combined with monitoring and providing
concrete support for the implementation of sustainability standards. We
have a variety of instruments, methods and measures in place to help us
improve the sustainability of our supply chain. Our basic aim is to recognize the cause of any problems and to work closely together with our
suppliers to resolve them.

Improving sustainability in the supply chain
Depending on the development phase of the supplier relationship, we
use different tools to make our supply chain more sustainable. A tenpercent sustainability-weighting factor has been included in all bids for
proposals since 2014. This creates strong incentives for suppliers to
offer more sustainable products and services in the bidding process.
We also use a four-level approach to minimize risks and encourage our
suppliers to improve their practices. The funnel chart illustrates the process. Via our supply chain management system we initially ask all
potential suppliers with an annual order volume of more than 100,000
euros about 16 sustainability-related aspects (phase 1). These 16
aspects relate to human rights and corruption as well as environmental
protection and occupational health and safety.
As the business relationship proceeds, we ask strategically relevant and
high-risk suppliers to enter extensive information about their practices in
the E-TASC (Electronics Tool for Accountable Supply Chains powered
by EcoVadis) information system. Experts evaluate these statements on
the basis of additional background information and targeted research.
We take things a step further in our relationships to some suppliers that
exhibit a higher CR risk and conduct on-site social audits (phase 2). In
doing so, we focus not only on direct suppliers of Deutsche Telekom but
also on downstream suppliers as far as possible.

We also boost the effectiveness of our audits by collaborating with a
current nine other companies in the Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC).
Thanks to the increasing number of JAC members, we are able to
conduct a higher number of audits on joint suppliers.
We use the information provided and audit results to classify and
evaluate suppliers, especially those that offer several material groups,
according to CR criteria (phase 3). This is done using supplier scorecards, which let us assess a supplier's sustainability performance and
compare them with other suppliers at a glance. The evaluation is also
based on press information and reports from non-governmental organizations (NGOs). We also collaborate closely with selected suppliers to
address acute issues and improve their sustainability performance in
the long term. Our supplier development program is particularly effective here (phase 4). In cases of significant disregard of our requirements,
we initiate an escalation process to effect fast resolution in accordance
with the Deutsche Telekom sustainability standards. The results of the

Initial success for supplier development program
We collaborate as partners with our suppliers to make sure they are able
to meet our high sustainability criteria with measures like our development program for key strategic suppliers. In this program we work
together to come up with solutions for topics such as environmental protection, working hour regulations and occupational health and safety. It
is a clear win-win situation for us as well as our suppliers because better
working conditions have a positive influence on employee loyalty and
motivation, raise productivity and improve the quality of products.
Having launched the pilot with three suppliers in 2014, we extended the
project to build a comprehensive development program in which seven
companies already participate. We are planning to include four additional suppliers in 2016.
One of our key suppliers has been able to reduce CO2 emissions in its
own operations and in its supply chain by 169,000 metric tons since the
start of the program. And this is not the only measurable success: one
supplier was able to increase its productivity by 34 percent, another was
able to reduce the number of employee absences due to occupational
health and safety issues by 48 percent and another supplier was able to
increase waste recycling from 69 percent to 85 percent.

Online survey gives up-to-date overview of working
conditions at suppliers
Various tools are employed to assess the effectiveness of our supplier
development program. We ran a pilot project to test an online survey
to help us in these efforts in December 2015. We asked employees from
a supplier in China to rate their employer in nine categories including
overtime, discrimination and occupational health and safety. Employees
were given QR codes so that they could use their smartphones to
participate in the survey voluntarily and anonymously. After evaluating
the results, we found that there is low risk with this supplier in terms of
employee fluctuation, child labor and occupational health and safety.
We are planning to gradually expand the survey to all suppliers within
the scope of our development program in 2016. Additional improvement measures will be introduced following the survey as needed.
We are also planning to use this procedure with other suppliers when
applicable. This will make it possible for us to assess the effectiveness
of improvement measures introduced in the wake of social audits.

The diagram shows the areas in which we audit our suppliers. Using the
results, we work with them to develop a plan for remedying any issues.
Suppliers receive support from Deutsche Telekom experts as well as
professional external consultants in applying these measures. All activities and results are documented so that we can gauge the effectiveness
of the measures employed. Adjustments are then made as needed.

2015 audit results

A total of 62 social audits, 7 on direct and 55 on indirect suppliers of
Deutsche Telekom, were conducted in 2015 through the auditing program set up and managed at Group level. As in previous years, our activities were focused on suppliers in Asia, particularly China and a few
neighboring countries such as Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam. We
also conducted social audits in Mexico, the UK and Eastern Europe.

Detailed results
We do not audit all of our suppliers (over 30,000) equally but instead
focus on strategically important or high-risk supplier groups. We focus
on roughly 200 suppliers that are regularly audited at least every three
years. The majority of these audits take place within the context of the
Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC).

Audited suppliers included manufacturers in the areas of IT hardware,
‑software and ‑services as well as networks and devices. The audits did
not find any cases of corruption or bribery nor any critical violations of
compliance policies or the right to intellectual property.

A total of 661 violations of Deutsche Telekom supplier requirements
were identified during the audits conducted in 2015, 17 of which were
unacceptable incidents. The audits conducted at 49 suppliers resulted
in critical findings – 197 individual cases in total. Click here for some
examples of unacceptable and critical violations and the improvement
measures introduced.

At a glance: 2015 audit results

305 of the identified violations (52 of which were critical) were remedied
by the end of 2015. The improvement measures had not yet been
effectively concluded in the other cases. Most of the violations related
to occupational health and safety (44 percent), a five percentage point
decrease compared to 2014. The number of corporate ethics violations
increased considerably in contrast (from 6.6 to 16 percent). This can
particularly be attributed to inadequate CR management and, especially
with regard to procedures and policies, risk assessment, ‑risk monitoring, reporting and training. These are all important in ensuring responsible supplier management, which is why we will be focusing on these
aspects more intently in coming years. Environment came in third at
12 percent compared to 10 percent in 2014, followed by working hours
at 11 percent compared to 12.6 percent in 2014.

Suppliers
Resource scarcity and raw materials sourcing

Resource scarcity and raw
materials sourcing
Production of electronic devices like smartphones is harmful to the environment and requires large amounts of water and energy. Because the
production facilities of suppliers and manufacturers are often located in
regions where water is scarce or the population does not have sufficient
access to electricity, the availability of resources plays a more significant
role there than it does in countries like Germany.
Moreover, valuable raw materials like metals are used in producing
smartphones and other ICT products. Some metals, including tantalum,
gold, tin and tungsten, are extracted from ores, some of which are extracted in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo under
conditions that are inhumane and/or associated with civil war. The parties involved in conflict in the region use the profit for purposes such as
financing civil wars. Deutsche Telekom does not produce any ICT products itself. The Group purchases these products from international
manufacturers and sells them at its stores, offers them in the context of
service provision or uses them in its network infrastructure. We require
our suppliers to refrain from using any of these conflict resources. We
also support industry initiatives like the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative,
which work toward a more sustainable supply chain.

Handling critical raw materials
Deutsche Telekom collaborates with suppliers and industry initiatives to
effect responsible raw materials sourcing. One of our requirements on
suppliers is that they do not use any conflict resources in the devices
they sell or the network technology they employ.
Deutsche Telekom published its Coltan Statement in 2005 and added
the Statement on Extractives to it in 2009. The use of conflict-free
resources has been a product requirement on our manufacturers since
2014. The purpose of this decision is to make sure that both our direct
suppliers as well as their sub-suppliers minimize the social risks that
come with extracting raw materials. We require our suppliers to comply
with Deutsche Telekom's Statement on Extractives. Policies regarding
conflict resources and their use are also an integral aspect of our supplier audits.
In cooperation with the Global e-Sustainability Initiative and the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition industry associations, we work to
advance the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI). This initiative helps
companies identify conflict resources and avoid trade and production
involving those resources.
Recycled tantalum, on the other hand, is considered conflict-free, which
is why Telekom Deutschland GmbH is conducting a research project on
recycling precious metals such as gold and tantalum from outdated network infrastructure components.
No conflict resources: Participating in the
Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative
Deutsche Telekom has been supporting the Conflict-Free Sourcing
Initiative (CFSP) ever since it was founded in 2008. CFSI is the largest
business initiative for responsible raw materials sourcing. Its objective
is to identify conflict resources and prevent their extraction and sale.

Supporting responsible resource extraction
Deutsche Telekom requires its suppliers to protect the environment and
use resources responsibly. These requirements are documented in our
Social Charter. They are also described in detail in our CR clause, which
has been a permanent feature of our General Terms and Conditions
for Purchasing since June 2013. We require our suppliers to provide
information on their activities as part of a self-assessment and conduct
supplier audits to emphasize the importance of these requirements. In
the scope of the audits, we check whether our suppliers use an environmental management system and how they manage their energy and
water consumption, as well as other factors. We also explicitly ask them
about their waste management system.

CFSI is based on a working group that was founded in 2008 by the
Global e-Sustainability Initiative and the Electronic Industry Citizenship
Coalition industry associations (Extractives Working Group) to address
sustainable raw materials extraction. Since then, the number of metal
processing companies and smelters participating in CFSI has continued to grow. 184 of these companies have been audited in compliance with the standard audit protocol. Another 50 have committed
themselves to completing the audit process (as of February 2015).

Climate protection strategy

Climate protection strategy

195 countries made a commitment to meeting mandatory climate
protection goals at the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris in 2015.
As a telecommunications company, we want to contribute to achieving
the 2-degree target that was set in Paris. We have been working toward
a low-carbon, sustainable future for years. Our products and services
help our customers reduce their carbon footprint. The flow of traffic at
the Port of Hamburg, for example, can be controlled more efficiently in
real time and farmers can prevent redundant trips when tending their
fields. We continue to systematically expand our offers for these types
of solutions. Our climate protection targets also include reducing our
own CO2 emissions by 20 percent by the year 2020 compared to 2008
levels. To do this, we are investing in efficient network technology,
improving energy management at our buildings and setting clear CO2
limits for our service vehicle fleet.

Protecting the environment
"We assume responsibility for a low-carbon society" is one of the key
action areas of our CR strategy. We intend to keep this promise with the
help of our Group-wide climate protection target, which was adopted
in 2013 to reduce our CO2 emissions by 20percent (excluding T-Mobile
USA) by 2020 compared with 2008. We have developed measures to
help us meet this target as well as instruments to gauge our progress.

Measurable success in climate protection
We record the direct impact of our climate protection measures with
our Energy Consumption and CO2 Emissions key performance indicators (KPIs) in order to assess the effectiveness of those measures. These
KPIs also help us keep our stakeholders informed regarding the progress we have made in achieving our climate target. In 2015, we also
worked on new KPIs that can be used to analyze the relationship between energy consumption/CO2 emissions and transported data
volumes. We are planning to introduce these KPIs in 2016.
Measuring direct and indirect emissions
We measure our CO2 emissions on the basis of standards such as
the internationally recognized Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, which
distinguishes between three CO2 emissions categories: GHG Scope 1, 2
and 3. Over the past few years, we have introduced measurement of
GHG Scope 1 and 2 emissions throughout the Group. Our CO2 Emissions KPI is based on this data. Since 2013 we have been recording all
relevant Scope 3 emissions generated by our business in Germany. We
also recorded the Scope 3 emissions generated by other national companies for the first time in 2015 and plan to measure them throughout
the entire Group by the end of 2016.
Collaborating for innovation and climate protection
Effective climate protection calls for joint efforts on the part of business,
politics, science and society. We are involved in a number of German
initiatives (2° foundation in Germany) and international associations to
help us effectively work to protect the climate. One of these is the Global
e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI). As an industry association, GeSI's
vision is to help make society greener and more climate-friendly with the
help of ICT solutions.
Using electricity from renewable energy sources
Measures to improve the energy efficiency of our networks and infrastructures are at the heart of our climate protection strategy. To date,
we have not included renewable energy in our calculations regarding
our Group-wide climate protection target. Renewable energy, however,
can help avoid CO2 emissions. That is why we attach great value to the
use of renewable energy, which will play an important role in our integrated climate strategy in the future.

sustainable products
our products and services help our customers reduce energy consumption or have other favorable effects in different parts of society. our products help reduce Co2 emissions and costs significantly, for example in
the areas of healthcare, business, mobility and logistics. dynamic workplace, for example, makes it possible for many of our business customers' employees to work from home. That means they produce less Co2
and save time usually spent commuting to work. The time they save can
also improve their work-life balance and have a positive impact on
employee health. we intend to integrate this potential step by step into
our portfolio, thus contributing to our fourth pillar, sustainable products.
products and services that provide sustainable benefits accounted for
37 percent of total revenues in 2014. in 2014, products of deutsche
Telekom allowed greenhouse gas savings of nine million metric tons
(click here for the analysis). due to this, we were able to compensate
more than our own Co2 emissions.
measuRing scope 3 emissions along the value chain
indirect emissions along the value chain, or scope 3 emissions, make
up the majority of our total emissions. recording these emissions helps
us design targeted measures to reduce our carbon footprint at a corporate and product level.

in 2015, we were able to make substantial improvements in the four
pillars of our integrated climate strategy - Co2 emissions, renewable
energy, energy efficiency and sustainable products - and measure these
achievements on the basis of specific targets and indicators.
Co2 emissions
As regards the first pillar, reducing Co2 emissions, we finished the rollout of our monitoring process in 2015, which had been launched the
year before. we were also able to record scope 3 emissions for all of
our national companies in 2015 as planned. These efforts have made
it possible for us to publish all of our Co2 emissions in compliance with
the ghg protocol for the first time in 2016. And we continue to work
toward our climate target in 2016 in order to reduce our emissions by
20 percent by the year 2020 compared to the base year 2008 (excluding T-mobile us).
renewable energy
we continue our efforts to increase our reliance on renewable energy
throughout the group. some of our national companies are already
setting a good example; magyar Telekom in hungary has been getting
100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources since 2015. we
have also set parameters for assessing the sustainability of purchased
electricity in collaboration with our colleagues responsible for procuring
electricity for our offices and facilities in europe. These parameters help
us increase the transparency of our energy mix and improve it as a
result.
energy efficiency
we are always working to improve the capacity and performance of our
fixed-line and mobile communications networks. because these require
the most energy throughout the group, we continue to modernize them
and enhance their energy efficiency. in 2015 we developed two new
kpis to measure our progress, one that establishes a relationship between our energy consumption and transported data volume and
the other between our carbon footprint and transported data volume.
we are planning to introduce these kpis in 2016.

we have been recording scope 3 emissions at deutsche Telekom in
germany since 2013. our scope 3 emissions for 2015 were down
1.1 percent year on year at 4,217,367metric tons of Co2 equivalents.
As in previous years, most emissions were generated through the use
of end devices bought from or leased through us as well as by end
devices bought from other providers to use our telecommunications
services. These emissions constitute roughly two-thirds of our total
scope 3 emissions. emissions generated by purchasing goods and
services are significant as well; these make up around one-fourth of
total scope 3 emissions. our employees commuting to work caused
the highest increase in emissions; this is due to the use of an increased
emission factor. with a year-on-year increase of 60 percent, these
emissions currently make up 8 percent of our total scope 3 emissions.

Climate & environment
Climate protection strategy

We fully disclose the data on the emissions generated by other national
companies for the first time for 2015. Emissions sources there are
similar to those identified in Germany. At national companies without
any relevant fixed-line business such as those in Austria, Poland and the
Netherlands, however, purchased products and services are the main
source of Scope 3 emissions.

126

Czech Republic, the Hungarian Magyar Telekom also
managed to obtain 100 percent of its electricity from renewable energy
sources for the first time in 2015.
We rely increasingly on renewable energy sources throughout the
Group. Our goal is to tap new potential for reducing CO2 emissions beyond achieving our climate protection target. That is why the Group started to develop sustainability criteria for procuring its electricity in 2015.
We had already analyzed the situation at every national company and
identified further possible uses for renewable energy in 2014. Based on
the findings, our plan is to develop measures to increase the share of
renewable energy sources used throughout the Group.
Magyar Telekom and T-Mobile Austria are
climate-neutral
Our Hungarian national company, Magyar Telekom, has been fully
climate-neutral since 2015. In order to reduce energy consumption,
the company has been conducting several measures such as updating
its networks and data centers and increasing the number of alternative
drive vehicles in the company fleet. Additionally, Magyar Telekom procures 100 percent of its electricity from renewable energy sources. Part of
the company's electricity procurement is based on RECS certificates.

T-Mobile USA Energy Strategy
In September 2015 the first annual energy planning meeting took place
with groups from across the business representing retail, corporate real
estate, critical facilities, network engineering, procurement and sustainability.
This team is focused on raising the visibility of energy efficiency as an
opportunity for many divisions across the company by working with
each business unit to set goals and track progress. The team is also
focused on short-term projects like using a consistent vendor for LED
lighting retrofits and piloting analytics software. Ultimately, the team will
be improving T-Mobile USA’s use of analytics and metrics to manage the
company’s energy performance and identify opportunities to reduce
consumption.

In early 2015 T-Mobile Austria became Austria's first CO2-neutral mobile
communications provider. Not only does the company ensure CO2-neutral operation of its network like other providers do, it also guarantees
that all other parts of the company such as offices, shops and vehicle
fleets are CO2 neutral. This is mainly made possible through using CO2free energy from renewable sources. Emissions that cannot be avoided
at this point are compensated for through certificates in compliance
with internationally accepted standards. In an effort to assess and
further reduce inevitable emissions, the company is measuring its CO2
emissions according to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol Standard
(Scope 1-3). This includes direct and indirect emissions such as those
generated by employee travel.
Another option: CO2 compensation
Preventing greenhouse gas emissions has top priority at our company.
Reducing such emissions is the second-best option. Investing in
certified climate protection projects is one way to compensate for some
of the CO2 emissions that we are unable to avoid generating or reduce.
From early March 2015 to late February 2016, Telekom Deutschland
compensated for 10,362 metric tons of CO2 emissions. These included
emissions associated with our events (participant travel to and from
the event, room usage, etc.) and certain products and services (e.g.,
conference calls or web conferences). Our Event Policy specifies the
ways in which we compensate for emissions generated by events.

More green energy at European national companies
All of Deutsche Telekom's national companies in Europe are expected
to make sure that the share of renewable energy they use for their power
supply is at least 10 percent above that of the respective national energy
mix by 2016, to the extent permitted by the liberalization of the energy
market. To this end they can also purchase renewable energy certificates if needed, a practice already in place in the Netherlands and Greece.
In addition to T-Mobile Austria, T-Mobile Netherlands and T-Mobile

Climate protection measures

With our Group-wide climate protection target we have resolved to lower
energy consumption and, therefore, CO2 emissions in all areas. Our
main focal point is areas with the highest energy consumption, particularly our technical infrastructure (fixed network, mobile communications
and data centers), which make up around 70 percent of our energy
consumption. Use of our buildings and vehicle fleet (one of the largest
in Europe with around 40,700 company cars and service vehicles) are
another major factor.

Energy efficiency in the network

128

Energy efficiency in the network

Our networks make up our core business and form the basis of our
products and services. However, operating our networks is also our
main source of CO2 emissions, which makes achieving greater energy
efficiency in network operation a key component of our climate protection target. We take different approaches for the fixed network, mobile
communications and data centers. When it comes to data centers, we
focus on a few particularly efficient data centers. And when it comes to
our networks, measures include replacing old technology with new, for
example through IP migration in the fixed network.

Operating energy-efficient networks
Deutsche Telekom operates its own fixed-line and mobile communications networks in Europe and the United States. Most of our energy
requirements come from operating this network infrastructure. In the
interest of our customers, we continue to increase the capacity and
performance of our networks so that we can handle growing amounts
of data and increasing demands on the speed and quality of data
transmission. This always goes hand-in-hand with higher energy requirements. We pursue three different approaches to further reduce our
energy needs:
 We are modernizing our network infrastructure by migrating over to
IP technology, installing highly efficient plants to ensure availability
of power and consistently removing technology that we no longer
need.
 We optimize energy supply and conversion, e.g., by improving
power converters.
 We use more energy-efficient technology for lighting, monitoring
and above all cooling our facilities.
Our internal energy service provider, Power & Air Solutions, which is responsible for energy management in Germany, plays a key role in these
activities. Power & Air Solutions has been ISO50001 certified since
2013 for their energy efficient approach.

Measuring and controlling energy consumption
The PUE factor (Power Usage Effectiveness) is measured annually and
is an important performance indicator for managing our climate protection measures. Our goal for our fixed network in Germany is to reduce
our PUE factor to 1.4 by 2020, allowing us to compensate for increasing
energy requirements due to growing volumes of data and new features.
Research on efficient network technologies
We constantly work to increase the energy efficiency of our network infrastructure. In 2015, we launched the EARNI project research project
together with partners from industry (Alcatel-Lucent) and science
(Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute). The project's goal is to improve
network capacity utilization and energy efficiency by using multipurpose technologies. We suffered a setback in a comparable project in
March 2015 when we decided to cancel the project after a field test had
shown that introducing the technology for load-adaptive network operation would only be feasible with substantial effort and considerable losses in terms of reliability/availability.
Reduced CO2 at data centers
We also keep our goal of reducing our carbon footprint in mind when
planning and operating our data centers. To achieve this goal, T-Systems takes a two-step approach: It starts with optimizing energy consumption at each data center site and then continues with improving
processes throughout the global data center landscape.
Between 2008 and 2013 the focus was on optimizing existing data
center space. Some examples include updating the cooling systems
and installing cold aisle containment to control the flow of cooling air
as needed and minimize cold air waste in the IT areas. Advancements
in IT technology also made it possible to considerably reduce energy
consumption. In addition to these fundamental technical optimization
measures, we are always fine-tuning our climate control technology;
this in combination with optimum data center capacity utilization
enables us to continue to improve efficiency.
The PUE factor serves as an indicator for improvements in energy efficiency. We were able to reduce the average PUE factor at the T-Systems
data centers from 1.85 to 1.63 between 2008 and 2015.Despite these
favorable overall results, we recorded fluctuations in the PUE factor
during the reporting period compared to the previous year. This is due
to the fact that, while the energy required for non-ICT components
remained unchanged, computer energy consumption fluctuated in the
wake of the consolidation process.

Deutsche Telekom - Corporate Responsibility Report 2015

Climate & environment
Climate protection measures
Energy efficiency in the network

129

Improved cooling technology for data centers
In 2014, we launched operations at our cloud data center in Biere. The
cooling concept developed in-house cuts total energy requirements by
around one-third relative to comparable data centers. But we do not
limit our efforts to new data centers. We also strive to cut back on
energy consumption in our current network infrastructure. That is why
we tested two new ways to cool data centers and switching centers in
2015:
 controlling ventilators already in place with the help of 3D room
temperature measurement
new
heat removal systems.

We will use the test findings to further optimize our current cooling
systems.

The PUE factor serves as an indicator for energy efficiency.Between
2008 an 2015, we saw a positive change in the average PUE factor of
our data centers from 1.85 to 1.63 thanks to the measures described in
the text.
The second phase has been ongoing since 2013. This phase combines
physical data center consolidation (i.e., reducing data center space and
sites) with logical consolidation (i.e., virtualizing data center infrastructure). The DC11@2018 program is working to globally consolidate data
center sites with the latest IT technology to a few FMO (future mode of
operation) data centers. The target average PUE factor at the FMO data
centers will be 1.4 once the program has been completed. This requires
a homogeneous IT landscape combined with optimum capacity utilization of data center infrastructure, IT hardware and the software running
on the systems. We expect these measures to bring about another
massive reduction in CO2 emissions. Current program plans estimate
a cumulated CO2 reduction of up to 51 percent by 2020 based on the
2012 figures.
Innovative solutions for an energy-efficient network
infrastructure
Operating our networks and data centers accounts for the majority
of our energy consumption. Through various measures, we intend to
reduce our energy consumption and improve the energy efficiency of
our infrastructure, moving us closer to our climate target. We initiated
several projects in 2015 including the following:
Creating an energy dashboard
During the reporting period we developed a new web-based energy
application, the Energy Dashboard. The app makes it possible to monitor approximately 8,000 fixed-network nodes and 20,000 mobile base
stations. This gives all Power & Air Solutions employees who monitor the
energy consumption levels of our systems a quick overview – at any
time and from anywhere. The app includes a notification system in case
large consumption points exceed certain threshold values. This lets us
identify possible causes early on and take counteractive measures. The
app also makes it possible to identify and selectively control central network nodes with high traffic volumes.

Energy-Aware Network Infrastructure (EARNI)
research project
We are always expanding and optimizing our networks so that we can
offer services that are demand-oriented and energy-efficient. Whenever
technically feasible, we are increasingly employing system technology
based on multipurpose hardware. We joined forces with Alcatel-Lucent
and the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute in 2015 to launch the
Energy-Aware Network Infrastructure (EARNI) project. The aim of this
project is to find out whether using new multipurpose systems has a
favorable impact on network energy efficiency.
For the research project, we used an actual use case to calculate energy
requirements and compared the results with conventional technology.
The results of this comparison show that, with careful planning and network design, the capacity of multipurpose systems can be much better
utilized and therefore promise better energy efficiency compared to
conventional technology. The system also permits load-adaptive operation.
Multipurpose hardware brings other advantages as well. The technology
makes it possible to incorporate controllers to control local energy supply systems. Cogeneration plants and photovoltaic systems can be used
to provide power to the telecommunications network. What's more, this
equipment can be controlled with the same hardware that is used for
the network technology. The EARNI project also analyzed a use case
pertaining to the control of power supply.
The research done within project EARNI was based on the previous
projects LOLA and DESI, which examined operating concepts for the
load-adaptive operation of networks.
Cogeneration plants reduce CO2
We are increasingly using combined heat and power (CHP) plants in
addition to the conventional power grid. They are an efficient, environmentally friendly way to provide power to our network nodes: CHP
plants convert around 90 percent of the energy into usable energy
(electricity and heat); in contrast, conventional electricity generation in
the German power grid has an efficiency of only around 40 percent.

Deutsche Telekom - Corporate Responsibility Report 2015

Climate & environment
Climate protection measures
Energy efficiency in the network

130

By using these plants, we can considerably reduce the CO2 emissions
caused by network operation. Power & Air Solutions was operating its
own CHP plants at a total of 27 network nodes in February 2016. These
units generate around 7.9 GWh of electricity each year. Due to the high
efficiency of these units, they generated 2,700 metric tons less CO2 than
energy taken from public power grids.
More units planned
We commissioned two additional CHP units to be installed in Berlin
and Frankfurt am Main in 2015. We also looked into how to increase the
efficiency of our current CHP plants. Based on the findings of our analysis, we designed a new energy concept for one of our sites in Berlin.
The concept should be in place by the end of 2016.
CHP units basically cover the electricity and heating needs of our
network nodes via thermal energy. To tone down excessive electricity
needs (peak loads) during times of exceedingly high data traffic
volumes, we have improved load distribution by introducing a new
control approach.

Energy-efficient buildings

Energy-efficient buildings

Within the scope of our climate protection target, we work diligently
to continue to reduce our energy consumption and the carbon footprint
associated with it. Efficient facility management plays a key role in these
efforts. Around a quarter of our energy consumption throughout Germany can be attributed to usage of our buildings, for example.

Our real estate management departments are responsible for measurements, analyses and developing appropriate measures. In 2014, they
coordinated the installation of heating systems that use waste heat
generated by IT systems at three of our data centers.
Electricity
Our employee workstations, lighting, and building technology, including
pumps, ventilation, cooling and elevators, are responsible for the largest
part of electricity consumption in our buildings. We focus our energy
conservation measures on the following areas:
 Using LED lighting and motion detectors in underground parking
structures and hallways
Using
state-of-the-art pumps and fans


"heating energy" and "electricity consumption." We have defined subtargets for each of these areas to help us attain our climate target in
Germany. Progress is measured twice a year.
Two approaches are involved in achieving our sub-targets. One of these
is to reduce our office space. Apart from staff restructuring measures,
we are introducing new office workplace concepts to optimize space
usage. Another focal point is increasing the energy efficiency of our
processes. For this we use an energy management system compliant
with the international standard ISO 50001. We identify the need for
improvement by using specific indicators such as "kilowatt hours per
square meter," "energy consumption at midnight" or "peak loads" to
compare similar facilities. The energy management system is run by
Power & Air Solutions.
Heat and hot water
We use approximately 600 GWh of heating energy throughout Germany
each year, primarily by using gas and heating oil as well as district
heating. That is the same amount of energy needed to provide around
100,000 newly built apartments with heat and hot water. To reduce
consumption, we calculate the basic renovation work needed at our
facilities, conduct efficiency analyses and focus on necessary and
particularly efficient measures within the scope of the available budget
such as:
 Optimizing heating systems
 Using condensing boiler technology to replace old heating
systems and pumps
Recovery
of waste heat produced by data centers

Using
cogeneration
plants


In 2015, we equipped 41 elevators at eight locations with modern
LED lighting.
Micro Smart Grid project reduces costs and CO2
Our facility energy management measures all work toward the same
goal: reducing our energy requirements to help us reach our climate
target.
Smart grid solutions have the potential to optimize the energy requirements of buildings, reducing costs as well as CO2 emissions. We developed an innovative energy concept based on this technology for one of
our sites in Berlin in 2015. The concept revolves around a micro smart
grid.
We are planning to use two CHP plants with high thermal energy storage capacity, which are scheduled to be installed by the end of 2016.
The waste heat produced by the CHP plants will be used to heat a
neighboring school and gym. We expect the new system to not only cut
back on costs but also reduce CO2 emissions by up to 800 metric tons a
year.
Solar energy: Sunny prospects for climate
protection
We are increasingly relying on solar energy to power our technology
sites. In 2014 we decided to equip 600 of our sites with photovoltaic
units over the next several years. Our internal energy service provider,
Power and Air Solutions, is responsible for installing the units.
In early 2016, Deutsche Telekom was operating solar power units at a
total of 307 switching centers in Germany. This is expected to reduce
our carbon footprint by 932 metric tons per year and move us closer to
our climate target for 2020.

Climate-friendly mobility

Climate-friendly mobility

With around 25,700 vehicles in Germany alone, our corporate fleet is
one of the largest in Europe. The CO2 emissions of the entire vehicle
fleet are around 7 percent of our total emissions (Scopes 1 and 2 according to the GHG Protocol) in Germany. That is why we encourage our
employees to take a climate-friendly approach to mobility. We also focus
on alternative and fuel-efficient engines - which of course must also be
financially viable - when purchasing new company cars and service
vehicles.

Natural gas vehicles
We feel that low-emissions natural gas drives are the right approach
toward effective green mobility. This technology is an effective aid in
reducing pollution and the carbon footprint, particularly when renewable resources are used, e.g., natural gas obtained from residual materials and waste. However, long-range use of natural gas vehicles is still
very limited due to an insufficient number of natural gas filling stations.
We find the limited offer of suitable vehicles available from manufacturers particularly restrictive. Despite this, we continue to offer natural-gas
powered cars to company car users and to do so at especially favorable
terms and conditions. The Green Car Policy penalty budget is partly
used for this purpose.
We also encourage our commuting employees to actively protect the
climate by enabling them to buy discount season tickets for local and
regional public transportation.

Our climate-friendly mobility efforts
We achieved our goal of reducing the average CO2 emissions generated
by all newly procured cars (company cars and service vehicles) to 110 g
CO2/km by the end of 2015. These results come in below the EU requirements of 120 g CO2/km. Due to the lack of established alternative
methods, we had to refer to the manufacturer standard CO2 values in
our calculations. We are aware that this method has been widely
criticized for some time now and are closely following public discussion
of the issue.
In order to make our fleet management climate-friendly, Telekom
MobilitySolutions pursues a strategy based on three pillars:
 Rightsizing: selecting appropriately sized, energy-efficient, lowemissions cars. By introducing our Green Car Policy we have also
created incentives for drivers of company cars to select smaller,
more efficient cars.
 Economizing: encouraging a fuel-efficient, low-emissions driving
style with driver training courses

Green Card for company fleet
The Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH) environmental organization has awarded the Green Card to Deutsche Telekom's company car fleet.
DUH surveyed 194 listed companies and SMEs for the study. The organization asked these companies about the average CO2 emissions produced by the company cars of the Chairman and members of the Board
of Management and by the company car fleet as well as about the
details of the mobility strategy. A total of only 12 companies received
the Green Card for their credible climate awareness.
Deutsche Telekom served as an excellent example with its Green Car
Policy and target of reducing standard emissions of new cars within the
entire vehicle fleet to an average of 110 g CO2/km by 2015.
On the go and green
Since 2015 Deutsche Telekom has been offering its employees the
chance to purchase a bicycle or e-bike as a green and healthy alternative using deferred compensation. With the support of Telekom MobilitySolutions, employees can lease a bicycle through their employer for
three years. The monthly payments are subtracted from the employee's
gross salary. The new offer has met with tremendous response right
from the off. Several hundred employees are already taking advantage
of the offer.

 Substituting: piloting and testing alternative mobility concepts.
We can further reduce our fleet's carbon footprint by purchasing vehicles with alternative drives and fuel systems. We have been turning to
natural gas and electric vehicles for some time now to help us achieve
this goal. Medium-term, we are especially planning to continue to keep
tabs on developments in electric mobility and employ these effectively.

We provide shuttle service between different locations, e.g., to the Cologne/Bonn airport or the Siegburg ICE train station to reduce the carbon
footprint of business trips. Roughly 117,000 passengers used this service in 2015. Employees can use an app or the intranet to book
a seat.

Our employees can use bicycles available at eight major Deutsche
Telekom locations to get to their business appointments within the city.
Uses for electric cars
We continue to encounter hurdles when it comes to extensive use of
electric cars: Limited range, insufficient charging infrastructure and
high costs make these cars unattractive in many usage scenarios. To
date, our electric car projects have only been possible because the
charging stations at Deutsche Telekom locations have been set up
with the help of project partners. We participate intensively in selected
electric mobility pilot projects to test the medium-term potential of
electric mobility:
 Two additional new-generation electric/plug-in hybrid rental cars
have been available for business trips since November 2015. With
proceeds from the Green Car Policy penalty budget, we purchased
two additional cars to complement the two electric cars in our fleet
(BMW i3 and VW eGolf): a Mercedes-Benz B Class Electric Drive
and an Audi A3 e-tron plug-in hybrid.
 We have been participating in an e-mobility funding project
("Wirtschaft am Strom") in Hamburg together with Deutsche
Telekom Technischer Service since April 2014. In this project, we
are using seven Renault Zoe and three Smart ed models as service
vehicles.
 In spring 2014 we added a Tesla electric car to our vehicle fleet for
Board of Management members as a chauffeured vehicle for trips in
the Cologne/Bonn area and to Darmstadt. Charging stations for the
car were set up on-site.
 A few selected hybrid cars have been available in our company car
segment since summer 2014. The offer only applies to the upper
vehicle classes as the high costs involved exceed the defined budgets in the other categories. We have also begun offering electric
cars as company cars for the first time in selected regions.

Climate & environment
Resource efficiency and environmental protection

Resource efficiency and
environmental protection
We work diligently to improve the energy efficiency of our networks.
In our view, this is the most effective way to reduce our impact on the
climate and environment. We also try to limit our use of scarce resources and work on reducing the amount of waste produced throughout
the Group. We also recycle the valuable materials found
in waste such as copper and lead from used cables.

Saving resources and protecting the environment
With our health, safety and environmental management system (HSE)
we have made a commitment to continually improving our performance
in these areas. The system is based on international standards OHSAS
18001 on occupational health and safety and ISO 14001 on environmental management.
Our aim is to improve resource efficiency throughout the Group by steadily reducing the amount of waste produced and improving our recycling processes. We also support cell-phone collection campaigns in
order to regain valuable resources. For this purpose, we have introduced the Used Cell-Phone Collection ESG KPI, which compares the number of cell phones in circulation to the number of collected devices.
We regularly collect Group-wide data on the amount of waste we
produce. Our International Waste Management Framework guarantees
standardized guidelines for all Deutsche Telekom companies. Our national companies are required to use this framework as a basis for identifying their own measurable targets and then monitor target achievement.
This approach makes it possible to flexibly address the specific requirements of each country and company without working with quantitative
objectives.
Resource efficiency is a priority for Deutsche Telekom at workplaces,
too. We use recycled paper and energy-efficient multifunctional printers
and encourage employees to use green office supplies. In order to
reduce the amount of paper used throughout the Group, Deutsche
Telekom asks its employees to have their salary statements sent to their
"De-Mail" account instead of having a printout sent by post. Around 20
percent of employees have already canceled delivery by post. We laun-

ched the Click Green campaign in early 2016 in order to motivate
even more employees to make the switch. With the project, Deutsche
Telekom sponsors a reforestation project at the Westwald in Darmstadt.
Waste reduction and recycling
Our national companies are responsible for implementing our waste
management strategy according to standardized Group-wide principles.
Based on our International Waste Management Framework, which was
approved in 2013, they develop a waste strategy or update their current
strategy and identify appropriate targets: The reduction of hazardous
waste has top priority. An international status survey on the implementation process is currently being planned. The idea is to get a central overview of the current status of strategy development and target definition.
Requirements for Group-wide copper cable recycling
Our activities are currently focused on disposing of the copper wires
that have been the main component of telephone lines for decades.
These are being replaced over the course of our fiber-optic roll-out.
The national companies still need support when it comes to meeting
our standards for responsible waste management in terms of recycling
and disposing of old copper cables. In response, our waste experts
came up with a draft of copper-cable recycling requirements and submitted it to the national companies for approval. As a result, a guideline
that is mandatory throughout the Group was introduced in January
2016.
Recovering tantalum from electronic waste
Our entire network will be migrated to IP technology by 2018. Over
the next few years we will be dismantling tons of used electronics. We
intend to recover precious metals such as gold and tantalum from the
resulting electronic scrap.
The tantalum used to manufacture condensers is extracted from coltan.
Coltan is considered to be a conflict resource, which is why recycling is
important when it comes to enabling conflict-free manufacturing of condensers.
In 2013 we launched a project in collaboration with bifa environmental
institute in order to develop the optimal method for dismantling and
recycling tantalum condensers. We had to dismantle the condensers
manually during the pilot phase since chemical and thermal processes
are not suitable.
In 2015 we studied other ways to efficiently dismantle tantalum condensers. In an effort to integrate the latest research on different methods of
tantalum recycling in the process, Deutsche Telekom cooperated with
Deutsche Umwelthilfe to organize an expert discussion with representa-

tives from a number of research and recycling institutions. We will
choose the best recycling process available and then put it into operation in 2016.
Take-back recycling program
The take-back recycling program for batteries, ink cartridges and phones was launched in June 2013 with the aim of enhancing recycling
activities in the COSMOTE-GERMANOS retail network, as well as
strengthening society’s environmental awareness. In 2015, the program
was implemented in more than 460 retail outlets and about 50 t of batteries, ink cartridges and phone devices were collected. Around World
Environment Day a two-week promotional campaign in the COSMOTE–
GERMANOS retail network allowed customers who recycled their old
mobile devices to enjoy a discount of up to €20 on a new smartphone
or tablet.

lers, to produce heat or cooling inside the building is no longer needed.
Consequently, the amount of electricity consumed in October and
November fell by 14 percent. The total consumption of energy at this
site was reduced by 3 percent in 2015.
5,800 metric tons of copper cable recycled
In 2015, Deutsche Telekom removed more than 5,800 metric tons of
copper cable from duct systems in Germany alone. The cable is processed in accordance with environmental standards at certified waste
disposal facilities and up to 90 percent of the material are recycled.

For each metric ton of phone devices collected during the period from
June 2014 to December 2015 (15t in all) the sum of €1,000 was donated to two environmental NGOs (Callisto & Philodassiki Enossi Athinon)
that organize educational programs for schools with a particular focus
on forest and wild life protection.
Environmental Management Program 2015
In 2015 T-Systems Iberia set up an Environmental Management
Program that includes the following activities:
ISO 14001 certification extended to Cerdanyola site
Now that the T-Systems Iberia headquarters in Barcelona and Madrid
are ISO 14001 certified, the aim was to also have the new data center
in Cerdanyola certified. To this end, a gap analysis was conducted, an
activity plan based on legal requirements and other aspects created,
communication and training activities implemented, and an internal
audit conducted. After the ISO 14001 requirements were fulfilled in the
data center at the Cerdanyola site, DEKRA was commissioned to conduct an external audit. The results of this audit were positive so that the
company’s ISO 14001 certification will also include this site.
Paper consumption reduced at Cerdanyola site
A reduction of paper consumption, especially at the Cerdanyola site,
was already identified as a significant aspect in the materiality analysis
conducted in 2014. For this reason and as part of the ISO 14001 certification, T-Systems Iberia set the target of reducing its paper consumption by 5 percent at this site by the end of 2015. In order to achieve this
goal several campaigns were implemented to raise awareness for a responsible use of paper among employees. In addition, the company set
up a procedure to control paper consumption (Paper Warehouse Custody). All that resulted in an overwhelming 30 percent reduction in paper
consumption.
Cutting energy consumption
In order to reduce CO2 emissions caused by primary energy consumption from fossil fuels, the T-Systems Iberia site in Barcelona (22@) was
connected to a new district heating/cooling provider (Districlima) in
October 2015. Districlima generates energy from waste energy sources
(urban or alternative solid waste) using very energy-efficient technologies. As a result, the conventional equipment, such as chillers and boi-

Protecting biodiversity
Extinction continues to be a global problem. The consequences are difficult to predict. One major cause of extinction is the fact that more and
more space is being taken up for industry, agriculture and transportation. In 2014, we conducted a study on the size of the space used for
our business activities in Germany in order to effectively steer our efforts
to help protect biodiversity. We also included worldwide upstream value
chains in our analysis. The study's findings confirmed our view that the
amount of space we use has relatively little impact on the environment.
Our business activities primarily impact biodiversity at the start of our
value chain in regions located far away where we have very limited influence. Despite this fact, we are working to increase our influence through
measures such as our supply chain management. The study identified
use of space along the entire value chain at a total of 1,730 square kilometers per year. That is around twice the size of Berlin. 14 percent of
this is space characterized by highly above-average biodiversity according to the criteria specified by the non-profit organization, Conservation International.
Our influence on maintaining and improving habitats with high biodiversity is greater in areas close to our facilities. That is why we collaborate
with competent partners on nature conservation efforts near us.
Renaturalizing habitats with high biodiversity
We have been supporting nature conservation projects initiated by the
Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH) organization since 2000 with the proceeds
from our used cell-phone collection activities. In 2015 we donated to the
organization's Living Rhine project, which uses exemplary measures to
show how more space for natural river landscapes can be created along
one of Europe's busiest inland waterways. The Living Forests nature

Resource efficiency at the workplace
We were able to maintain the percentage of green office material ordered at our offices in 2015 at 35 percent of total order volume. Because
we streamlined our portfolio in line with cost optimization targets, the
percentage of items meeting particularly strict sustainability criteria
came to 22 percent. These criteria include paper bearing the Blue
Angel environmental label.

Socially Responsible Investment ESG KPI (SRI)
In 2015, around 21 percent of Deutsche Telekom AG's shares were held
by investors who take SRI/ESG criteria into account at least partially in
their investment decisions. Around two percent of T-Shares were held
by investors who give priority to SRI/ESG aspects when managing their
funds.

The Socially Responsible Investment ESG KPI indicates the percentage
of Deutsche Telekom AG T-shares held by investors who show concern
for environmental, social and governance criteria in their investment
strategy. Due to annual updating of the calculation criteria, comparisons
with the previous year may not always provide conclusive information.

Leaders Index for the fifth year in succession. In the Sustainalytics rating
agency ranking on which this index is based, we emerged as no. 2
in the telecommunications industry worldwide and no. 3 among all
German companies in the last financial year. Once again, our share was

Sustainable Procurement ESG KPI
The Sustainable Procurement ESG KPI indicates a considerable yearon-year increase at 78 percent, because we audited more suppliers
than originally anticipated for their compliance with our social and environmental standards. This is significantly higher than the target value of
75 percent we forecast for 2015.

We measure the degree to which our procurement volume is covered
by sustainable activities with the Sustainable Procurement ESG KPI.
It measures the share of procurement volume we obtain from suppliers
where one or several Group companies of the corporate group have
been assessed for compliance with our social and environmental standards by way of self-assessments and/or audits. This also applies for
audits carried out on subcontractors. In the coming years we expect
our Sustainable Procurement ESG KPI to rise slightly above the figure
achieved in the reporting year.

Net value added
Net added value increased slightly year over year from 31.6 billion euros
to 32 billion euros. This year-on-year increase in net added value is primarily the result of increased payments to lenders, which can primarily
be attributed to a reduction in new medium and long-term debt. Please
refer to the section on "Financial position of Deutsche Telekom AG" in
our current annual report for more information on cash flow from financing activities and details on financial liabilities.

In contrast to the statement of income, the net value added only takes
account of real payment flows. That means that deferred tax expenses
and the accrual of provisions do not impact the net value added of the
reporting period. Although these costs are deducted from net profit in
the statement of income, they are not linked to any current payments to
stakeholder groups, as is the case with net value added. Outpayments
in this respect are scheduled for the future and will only be accounted
for in net value added in future years.

Personnel costs and personnel cost ratio
By personnel costs we mean basic personnel costs (salaries) and incidental personnel expenses – where applicable including, or adjusted
for, special factors in conjunction with personnel restructuring measures
(individual downsizing instruments). The personnel cost ratio represents
personnel costs as a proportion of revenue. The development of this
rate serves as a benchmark for company business. This performance
indicator has fallen continually Group-wide since 2012 from 23.2 to
today’s figure of 21.2 percent. Again, the slight increase in the ratio
for Germany compared with 2014 (32.9 to 33.0 percent) reflects expenditure on expanding and restructuring the networks and the investments

145

associated with this. Deutsche Telekom is driving network build-out not
just in terms of coverage but also with regard to transmission speeds.
The key driver of the Group’s adjusted personnel cost ratio, which fell
by 0.8 percentage points, is the significant rise in revenue. It more than
compensated for the rise in personnel costs in the Group.
The disadvantage of the personnel cost ratio is that it ignores external
personnel costs. Therefore the total workforce costs ratio is more
meaningful for the management of personnel costs at Deutsche
Telekom.

Revenue per employee
While revenue per employee in Germany rose slightly by 5,000 euros
following several years at a fairly constant level, international business
reported growth in revenue per employee of around 17 percent. This
is largely accounted for by our U.S. business. The number of employees
in our United States operating segment increased by 11.5 percent,
partly due to growth of 8.3 million new mobile communications

146

customers as a result of the Un-carrier initiatives launched by T-Mobile
USA. As a result, the United States segment achieved a revenue increase of over 29 percent year on year, thereby accounting for the largest
share in Group revenue at 41.8 percent. This disproportionately high
growth in revenue compared with the rise in headcount explains the
segment’s higher productivity figures.

Energy Consumption ESG KPI a)
Deutsche Telekom measures the Energy Consumption ESG KPI as the
Monetary Power Efficiency Index (MPEI) in which developments in
energy consumption (in thousands of MWh) are indicated in relation
to revenues (in billions of euros). The figure for the Energy Consumption
ESG KPI decreased in the reporting year compared with 2014, a positive trend that is even stronger than anticipated. As revenues increased,
electricity consumption throughout the Group remained stable, and
actually fell slightly in Germany, in 2015. In view of the lightning rise in
worldwide data traffic and the continuing network build-out, this stable
trend is a success and has only been possible due to the progress we

have made in energy efficiency. For the years 2016 and 2017, we
anticipate a positive trend, namely that our Energy Consumption ESG
KPI will decrease over the next two years. This trend is based on the
ratio between the slight savings in power consumption and increasing
revenues. We expect the reductions in power consumption in particular
as a result of our network migration to IP technology in Germany, improved network utilization in general, and the consolidation of
T-Systems data centers in various countries. These savings are expected
to be partly counterbalanced by the expansion of T-Mobile US and the
accompanying rise in power consumption.

in Hungary and Austria climate-neutral. Data on renewable energy is
being reported here on a Group-wide scale for the first time.

Decoupling Power Consumption and CO2 Emissions
Deutsche Telekom was able to reduce the emissions generated by
its electricity consumption to zero from 2008 to 2012 by purchasing
RECS img certificates (Renewable Energy Certificate System). However,
we feel that these certificates have not had as positive an impact on the
environment as we had hoped. Demand for certificates was generally
limited. As a result, RECS certificates do not make a noticeable contribution to encouraging the expansion of renewable energy sources.
That is why we feel it makes more sense both in terms of ecological and
economic aspects to invest in reducing our energy consumption and
increasing our energy efficiency than to purchase RECS certificates.

CO2 emissions (Scope 1 & 2)

CO2 Emissions ESG KPI
The CO2 Emissions ESG KPI indicates the development of absolute as
well as relative emissions compared to the base year 2008. The comparative value from the base year is 3,362 metric thd. tons of CO2.We had
assumed there would be a slight decline in the CO2 Emissions ESG KPI
for 2015, i. e., a slight improvement. This is consistent with the actual
trend, which is in particular due to the aforementioned stable development in electricity consumption and the slight fall in emissions from fuel
and natural gas consumption. The developments in power consumption
are the main drivers of the trend in our CO2 emissions. We therefore
expect our CO2 Emissions ESG KPI to fall slightly in 2016 and 2017.
Our expectation for the Group units participating in the climate protection target (excluding T-Mobile US) is that, in 2020, CO2 emissions will

lie 20 percent below the rate of the base year 2008. For detailed comments on the figures for each national company, please refer to the
interactive benchmarking tool.
We calculated our CO2 emission values based on different energy and
fuel consumption data. Calculation complied with the Greenhouse Gas
(GHG) Protocol and was based on emission factors set forth by the
International Energy Agency (IEA) and/or the GHG Protocol calculation
tools. The total value reflects direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2)
emissions.Since our CO2 emissions are largely driven by our power
consumption, the resulting positive trend is similar to the development
described for the Energy Consumption ESG KPI.

CO2 emissions (Scope 1 & 2)

Total CO2 emissions (Scope 1 & 2 Emissions)
Our CO2 emissions are largely driven by our power consumption. The
year-over-year decrease of 5 percent is largely due to the use of energy
certificates (RECS img, GOO) at Magyar Telekom in Hungary, T-Mobile
Poland and Cosmote in Greece.
For the first time, we distinguished between "location-based" and
"market-based"methods in calculating the Scope 2 emissions img in the
table below. The"location-based" method is based on emission factors

152

for certain geographic locations; i.e., without taking a company's
individual power mix into consideration. The "market-based" method on
the other hand is based on the emissions actually generated by a power
source. In this method, procuring renewable energy decreases the
emission results. If the power source being used and thus the emission
factor cannot be clearly determined, a residual factor is applied for
calculation. This residual factor is sometimes considerably higher than
the regional power mix factor.

Number of vehicles
The total number of vehicles at our company - in particular the number
of gas-powered company cars - decreased year over year by around 3
percent. In particular T-Hrvatski Telekom (Croatia), Magyar Telekom
(Hungary), T-Mobile Netherlands, T-Mobile Poland and OTE were able to
decrease their numbers of gas-powered company cars considerably.

The total number of natural gas-powered vehicles remained unchanged.
Insufficient manufacturer offers limited our ability to expand this vehicle
category. Regardless of this, we continue to focus on alternative and

used a discount season ticket provided by their employer to commute
by public transport. The decrease in these numbers can largely be attributed to the fact that the public transportation authorities increased
their prices Prices experienced a particularly steep increase in the

Used cell-phone collection and waste volume

Used cell-phone collection and
waste volume
Used Cell Phone Collection ESG KPI a)
We have been reporting the Used Cell-phone Collection ESG KPI for
two years based on the reference value "number of devices in circulation." This makes it possible to more precisely illustrate the ratio of the
number of cell phones brought to market to the number of used devices
collected. When customers use the devices for longer periods of time,
the environment benefits from this decision and, as a result, this has
a positive impact on the KPI. Around 394,000 mobile devices were
collected throughout the Group in 2015, an increase of around 40%
in comparison to 2014 (around 288,000). This increase was mostly
generated by the national companies in Germany, Greece and the

Netherlands. TMUS is not included in the Group's ESG KPI; around
4 million mobile devices were collected there alone.
The Used Cell-Phone Collection ESG KPI measures the ratio of
collected devices (in thousands) to the number of devices in circulation
(in millions). The collected devices are recorded in kilograms or in units.
When using kilograms, we apply a Group-wide conversion factor of
7.25 units per kilogram unless another conversion factor is typically
used in that country. Mobile devices in circulation include smartphones,
simple phones, tablets and cordless phones. Units are reported by
Procurement for reasons of data quality.

Community Investment, Beneficiaries, and Media
Literacy ESG KPIs
The report comprises a set of three KPIs for calculating the impact of
our social commitment. Our activities are based on the methods employed by the London Benchmarking Group (LBG), which incorporate the
aspects, "input," "output" and "impact".

The Beneficiaries ESG KPI reflects the number of people who got involved in community activities and the number of people in the target
group that benefited from such activities.
The Media Literacy ESG KPI reflects the share of people we have
reached through programs addressing this topic. This KPI establishes a
direct correlation between these activities and our core business.

The Community Investment ESG KPI illustrates activities in which Deutsche Telekom was involved in the community either financially, through
its employees, or through donating materials.

ESG KPI „Social Commitment“ DT Group in Germany
As shown below, we measure our performance in society with the Social
Commitment ESG KPI img. The trend in the Social Commitment ESG
KPI img reflects the German public's growing expectations of our
Company's social commitment, whereas Deutsche Telekom's performance receives the same rating as the previous year. Public expectations of our commitment have increased significantly – influenced primarily by the issue of refugees, which is the subject of heated public discussion at present.

170

We use an exclusive telephone survey of 2,000 people from the German
residential population (customers and non-customers) con-ducted by
TNS Infratest to measure our Social Commitment ESG KPI . The following questions were asked to determine the importance of social
com-mitment: "How important is it to you that companies are active in
the community?" In order to rate the performance of the Deutsche Telekom Group in Germany, TNS Infratest read the names of several companies to those surveyed and asked them to indicate whether those companies were involved in the community by answering "yes" or "no."

employees on their career trajectory to a management role or when
developing their current managerial position. In the first year of the initiative, the percentage of women in middle and upper management rose
markedly from 22.7 to 24.7 percent. In December 2015 the figure was

25.8 percent. The percentage of women on supervisory boards in
Germany has risen from 17.7 percent to 30.6 percent since 2010. Deutsche Telekom is one of only a handful of DAX corporations with
an established track record of women on its Board of Management.
The number of women working in the international management team

school or at the vocational training center. The highlight of this is
that, like all apprentices, part-time candidates can cut their training

Proportion of civil servants in Group workforce
The proportion of civil servants employed in the company fell once
again in 2015. The reasons for this included the fact that Deutsche
Telekom has not recruited any new civil servant staff since the company
was privatized. In addition, many civil servants took early retirement
or were transferred to public authorities. This has led to a continual
reduction in the proportion of civil servants in the workforce, from

around one third in 2011 to under 29 percent in 2015. Besides this,
400 civil servants were seconded to the Federal Office for Migration
and Refugees (BAMF) in the reporting year to provide support for

Employees have the chance to submit their own ideas and, in doing so,
to actively shape their workplaces. Costs that were reduced by 146.5
million euros in 2015 played a key role in keeping Deutsche Telekom
competitive. In addition, workforce commitment enables the Group to
position itself as a more innovative and more competitive enterprise.
As an incentive for the innovators Deutsche Telekom awards attractive
bonuses for successful suggestions. The Coppair idea took first place

in the “Best employee idea” category of the 2015 Ideas Management
Award presented by Deutsches Institut für Ideen- und Innovationsmanagement. The submitters of the idea proposed simultaneous usage of
mobile and fixed-line communications, which vastly improves download
and, in particular, upload speeds. This makes a high and constant data
rate possible before fiber roll-out is complete. A large number of units
throughout the Group were involved in its implementation, and their
commitment resulted in the product launch of Magenta Hybrid.

Portfolio of Intellectual Property Rights
279 patents were registered during the reporting period. By the end
of 2015, we owned around 8,400 intellectual property rights (IPRs),
considerably more than in the previous year. We take a targeted
approach to managing these IPRs in consideration of cost-benefit
aspects. We regularly take stock of our IPRs and eliminate those that
are no longer relevant.
Patents are gaining more and more significance in the telecommunications industry. Market players and their areas of activity are changing,
with a knock-on effect on our IPR (intellectual property rights) agenda.
On the one hand, our Group's scope for action must be maintained.
On the other hand and alongside our own research and development

196

activities, we want to pave the way to open innovation through collaboration projects and partnerships. National and international IPRs are vital
for these types of activity. We are strongly dedicated to generating our
own property rights. Industrial property rights include inventions, patent
applications, patents, utility models and design patents. Thanks to our
intense efforts to develop and structure our IPR portfolio, the rights we
hold are highly valuable and firmly in line with our Group's strategic
objectives. We have put in place a professional patent law management
process to keep our IPR assets safe. Additionally, we are represented on
various standardization bodies in our industry. We manage our IPRs on
the basis of cost/benefit aspects, filing only selected applications and
de-registering patents systematically.
