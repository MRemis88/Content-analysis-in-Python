REWE Group Sustainability Report 2015/2016

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,
Partners and Friends of REWE Group,
An Indian fairy has an instructive lesson for each of us today: Once upon a time, a forest ﬁre was
raging through the woods, and all of the animals that inhabited the area were ﬂeeing for their lives.
Each of them felt incapable of doing something to battle this major disaster. Except for one little
hummingbird. It ﬂew oﬀ to the river and collected a few drops of water to ﬁght the ﬂames. The other
birds started laughing and asked the diminutive ﬁreﬁghter a question: “What are you doing?” The
bird replied: “I’m doing what I can.”
Today, the word “sustainability” has become the buzzword of the times. Within the context of
sustainability, many people have correctly pointed out that we are using excessive amounts of the
world’s precious resources. But, like the birds in the woods, we also feel we are too small or too weak
to tackle this huge problem by ourselves. As a company that employs sustainable business
practises, we also run up against the limits of what is feasible in a globalised world and realise we
cannot change everything all by ourselves. Nonetheless, we have understood the message of the
small hummingbird in the Indian fairy tale: Everyone does what he or she can. Togetherness
produces success. You need courage and perseverance to steadily and resolutely pursue goals even
when the progress is slow and the challenges are great.
For this reason, the title of this sustainability report is “Together”. It expresses the philosophy we use
to foster sustainable changes: Always together with our partners, employees and customers; always
in a dialogue designed to create an understanding of shared goals; and always with a passionate
commitment to ﬁnding the best, most viable solution.
Even after the change in the company’s executive leadership in July 2017, REWE Group stands for
continuity in its commitment to sustainability during these times of global challenges. I will continue
to resolutely pursue this direction and ensure REWE Group will remain both a partner for
sustainability and a pacesetter in the development of sustainable solutions for trade, travel and
tourism. The challenges are signiﬁcant. The international community has set some ambitious targets
with the Sustainable Development Goals that should be reached by 2030.
As digitalisation spreads, sustainability management is also facing some challenges of its own to
ensure everyone will proﬁt from this change and new solutions will improve resource eﬃciency and

the well being of people.
In this report, we will show you just how far we have gone and what we are still planning to do. Please
take this journey with us and continue to share your critical-constructive feedback with us as we
move forward.
I hope you enjoy this exciting and inspiring report.

The Sustainability Strategy of REWE Group
The Sustainability Strategy of REWE Group
GRI 102-18: Governance structure
GRI 102-19: Delegating authority
GRI 102-20: Executive-level responsibility for economic, environmental, and
social topics
The Management Board has clearly deﬁned the company’s position in its Guidelines for Sustainable
Business Practices: “Sustainability is not a ﬂeeting trend at REWE Group. Rather, it is a fundamental
element of its business strategy.” To REWE Group, this means: It promotes a more sustainable
assortment and deals fairly with partners and suppliers. It does business with the environment and
climate in mind. It assumes responsibility for its employees and works to prepare society for the
future.
As a leading international trade and tourism company, REWE Group is keenly aware of the special
role it plays as an interface among producers, suppliers and consumers. For this reason, the
sustainability strategy encompasses all of the company’s business operations in order to integrate
more sustainable consumption and tourism into the entire marketplace. REWE Group formulates
challenging goals and is not afraid to tackle complex issues. In many cases, it has been the
pacesetter that introduced ideas that are now general standards. As it carries out its sustainability
strategy, REWE Group conducts an intensive dialogue with stakeholders and enters binding, longterm partnerships. It does so because long-range improvements can be achieved only if all
participants work together on the same goals. In applying this strategy, the company continuously
expands its share of more sustainable products and services and introduces more sustainable
consumption to larger and larger segments of the population.
In 2008, REWE Group added the following principle to its mission statement: “We are aware of our
responsibility and act sustainably.” At the same time, the company also introduced a system of
strategic sustainability management. In 2010, it deﬁned its Guidelines for Sustainable Business
Practices and laid a binding foundation for REWE Group’s comprehensive commitment to
sustainability. The goal was clearly deﬁned from the start: Sustainability should be brought “out of
its niche” and introduced to mainstream society.
While introducing its sustainability strategy, REWE Group created four pillars of sustainability in
2008: Green Products; Energy, Climate and the Environment; Employees; and Social Involvement.
The company added areas of action within these pillars that outline the key issues of its commitment
to sustainability.

Reorganisation of the Company’s Structure since 2016
In 2016, REWE Group made several changes in its company structure that serve as the basis for
further improvements in eﬃciency and long-term proﬁtable growth. As part of the changes, it
created a new central organisation in which the sales lines REWE and PENNY were merged.
REWE Group refocused its sustainability strategy at the same time. It carried out a comprehensive
strategy process in which the organisation and the focal points of its sustainability strategy were

evaluated and reformulated. The core element of this strategic realignment is the provision of
increased freedom to individual sales lines to carry out the sustainability strategy and, thus, to
facilitate added customisation of the strategy to the speciﬁc needs of each sales line. In taking this
decision, the company addressed the diﬀerent business models of food retail, travel and tourism,
and DIY stores, each of which has diﬀerent stakeholder expectations and sustainability challenges.
Each sales line can focus on those places where it has the biggest lever for improvements. At the
same time, it can better tailor more sustainable products and services to the needs of various
customer groups. The more sustainability becomes a success factor in the sales lines’ business, the
faster and more eﬀectively sustainability will become a ﬁxture in the mass market. REWE Group’s
four pillars of sustainability continue to underpin its overarching strategy, and the Guidelines for
Sustainable Business Practices continue to serve as the joint direction and canon of values for the
company’s commitment to sustainability.
During the reporting period, the sales lines REWE, PENNY and DER Touristik each carried out farreaching strategy projects.
In 2016, DER Touristik reworked its sustainability strategy under the motto “DER Welt verpﬂichtet”
(Committed to the World). As part of this work, a materiality analysis was conducted under
consideration of the sales line’s most important stakeholders. In the ﬁrst step, the sales line
conducted a baseline study and competitive analysis. Customers, employees and NGOs, among
others, were surveyed online to identify and prioritise key issues. In addition, about 60 managers of
DER Touristik took part in personal interviews in which they evaluated the issues in terms of
opportunities and risks for the company as well as on the basis of the potential to exert inﬂuence.
The identiﬁed issues were consolidated. They were then prioritised and approved by the
International Board of DER Touristik.
REWE and PENNY also conducted far-reaching materiality analysis on continued strategy
development. This work drew on ﬁndings from customer and market research and stakeholder
surveys. Benchmark studies were conducted in the food retail sector, among other areas, and the
political landscape was analysed. In addition, the sustainability strategy was reviewed in terms of its
contribution to the company’s Sustainable Development Goals (see below). The objective of this
analysis was to identify potential opportunities and risks associated with the revision of the
sustainability strategy. In the second stage of the work, the areas of action and the focal points of
the company’s commitment were reviewed on the basis of the results of the analysis and adjusted
when necessary. Up to six workshops were conducted for each pillar in the sustainability strategy.
These workshops were attended by experts in the particular ﬁeld as well as representatives of the
sales lines, the Department of Corporate Responsibility and the Strategy Department. The
workshops facilitated a discussion about and an evaluation of the relevance of the identiﬁed issues
and challenges in terms of the company’s strategy and its operational business activities. As a result
of this work, adjustments were made in the areas of action for the sales lines involved in food retail in
Germany. The other sales lines were included in the process of materiality analysis during interviews
and the workshops. They are now in the process of reviewing the new areas of action in food retail in
Germany and introducing them either in whole or in part.

Sustainability Organisation
At REWE Group, the company’s management has made sustainability its highest priority. Since the
sustainability strategy was introduced in 2008, it had been directed by CEO Alain Caparros. This
responsibility was passed to his successor, Lionel Souque, during the changing of the guard at the
company on 1 July 2017. Like his predecessor, the new CEO believes that sustainable business
practises are a precondition for the company’s long-term success (see the foreword by Lionel
Souque).
Until mid-2016, a high-ranking sustainability strategy committee had been responsible for managing
REWE Group’s sustainability strategy. The committee served as a decision-making body and idea
generator for the strategy’s implementation in all sales lines. It formulated the company’s annual
sustainability goals and oversaw the progress of projects and key performance indicators (KPIs). The
Sustainability Strategy Committee was drawn from the entire REWE Group: It was composed of
members of the Management Board, all fully authorised representatives of REWE Group, managers
from all sales lines and holding organisations, the chairman of the Central Works Council and a
representative of independent retailers.
As part of the recalibration of the strategy in 2016, REWE Group bolstered the sustainability
organisation within the individual sales lines and further integrated sustainability into business
processes. The responsibilities of the strategy committee were also transferred to the sales lines; the
sustainability department and the pillars of sustainability were strengthened; and sustainability was
integrated into regular decision-making processes. In taking these steps, REWE Group is determined
to develop sustainability measures in closer proximity to its business operations and customers and
to introduce them more rapidly.
For the pillar Green Products, the new department Sustainable Products was created at REWE and
PENNY. This new unit was placed directly within purchasing and supports the development of
sustainable assortments there. In other areas, project groups are continuing to work across sales
lines, including for the pillar Energy, Climate and the Environment. This work will create agile
structures in which project teams will be able to work together in a results-driven manner.
Independent retailers are also included in these processes. This enables their ideas and experiences
to ﬂow into decisions regarding the development of sustainability at REWE Group.
Jan Kunath is the member of the Management Board who oversees sustainability at REWE and
PENNY. Members of Division Management Boards are responsible for each pillar, thus underscoring
the importance of the pillars of sustainability and the work on them. Measures based on the pillars of
sustainability are developed to reﬂect the goals and the positioning of the sales lines. These steps
are then approved during regular annual and strategy-planning sessions of REWE and PENNY. As a
result, the responsibility is integrated into established decision-making processes all the way to the
operational level.
The sustainability organisation of REWE International AG is led by the Holding Management Boards
or managing directors, which is supported by a sustainability staﬀ unit. Responsibility in the
individual trade companies under the holding’s umbrella is assigned to the respective board

members, management teams and top executives. Working and project groups for each of the four
pillars of sustainability are charged with putting the measures into eﬀect. Sustainability plays an
integrative role in business activities thanks to the inclusion of sustainability management in the
strategies of the trade companies under the umbrella of REWE International AG.
At toom Baumarkt DIY stores, CEO Detlef Riesche assumes the main responsibility for sustainability.
Like for the entire REWE Group, the sales line’s sustainability management is based on the four
pillars of sustainability. toom has created a department in purchasing that comprehensively
coordinates the issue of sustainability in work that extends beyond the continued expansion of
assortments that include more sustainable products. Decisions about the sales line’s strategic focus
and projects are taken during the regular meetings of its sustainability committee. This committee is
composed of representatives of the management team, managers for the pillars and other
nominated employees from relevant departments.
The central sustainability department of DER Touristik also bases its work on the four pillars of
sustainability as well as carries out measures and projects. During the reporting period, DER
Touristik initiated a strategic process in which the sustainability organisation will be analysed and
restructured if necessary.
The Department of Corporate Responsibility at REWE Group works with the individual sales lines. It
helps to implement the sustainability strategy of the entire REWE Group and serves as a central
interface between the sales lines and dealings with external stakeholders. As part of sustainability
reporting, the Department of Corporate Responsibility documents and analyses the progress being
made by sustainability projects and in the KPIs. It also takes on an advisory role for project groups
and sales lines.

Sustainable Development Goals
In 2015, the United Nations adopted Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These 17 objectives
address the key challenges of sustainable development on a global level. The SDGs are to be
reached by 2050 and are broken down into 169 targets. REWE Group is determined to support the
eﬀort to reach these goals by carrying out its sustainability strategy. To do so, it has compared its
sustainability goals and business processes with the 17 UN development goals and the related 169
SDG targets. Following this analysis, sustainability managers at REWE Group prioritised the SDGs
and targets. Their ranking of the most relevant SDGs was taken up during a podium discussion held
as part of the REWE Group Dialogue Forum with stakeholders in 2016. The feedback provided by
stakeholder ﬂowed into an overall ranking in which the following SDGs were given a high priority for
REWE Group:
1.

Responsible Consumption and Production

2.

Life on Land

3.

Life Below Water

4.

Decent Work and Economic Growth

5.

Zero Hunger

6.

Aﬀordable and Clean Energy

The analysis shows that REWE Group’s sustainability activities will help to achieve the SDGs ranked
as relevant and identiﬁed additional potential for future activities.

REWE Group consists of two lead companies: REWE-ZENTRALFINANZ eG (RZF) and REWE –
Zentral-Aktiengesellschaft (RZAG). REWE Group is proud of its cooperative roots. The Supervisory
Board, shareholders, retailers and the Management Board of REWE Group view the long-range
cooperative structure as a guarantee of independence and self-determination. In 2007, this
commitment was reaﬃrmed in the Travemünde Declaration. The headquarters of REWE Group have
been located in Cologne ever since the company was established. As of 31 December 2016, the
parent company and 385 subsidiaries (previous year: 369) were included in the Combined Financial
Statements (see the REWE Group Annual Report 2016, page 3). About 1,400 independent partner
retailers are also part of REWE Group.

Risk Management
GRI 102-11: Precautionary Principle or approach
REWE Group strives to create a balance among the economic, environmental and social impacts of
its business operations wherever possible. In this process, it continuously measures its own
performance and progress. When diﬀerent goals come into conﬂict with one another, the company
calls on experts from its own ranks and from external stakeholder groups.
As an international trade and tourism company, REWE Group faces a number of economic risks
related to its business activities. These risks include logistics risks, price trends, and amended laws
and regulations that occasionally may have short reaction times. Uniform group-wide risk
management successfully addresses these risks and ensures long-range opportunities. The
company’s management and supervisory bodies are informed annually about the combine’s current
risk situation in a standardised report. In inventories, risk managers report to the combine about
relevant individual risks from the risk areas as of a given closing date. Risks with similar content and
causes are subsequently aggregated at the combine level into risk categories and classiﬁed as high,
medium or low with regard to their relevance to the combine based on the threat potential to the
company’s business activities, ﬁnancial position, results of operations, cash ﬂows and REWE
Group’s image.
In addition, REWE Group analyses sustainability-related risks in connection with its assortments (for
more information, see GRI 204: Procurement Practices).

Ethics and Integrity
GRI 102-16: Values, principles, standards, and norms
of behavior
With the goal of “The Best Performance – for Customers, Retailers and Employees”, the
fundamental values of REWE Group were formulated in the mission statement drawn up in 2008:

●

We act independently according to the ideas of community!

●

We work for the customer – we are at the heart of the market!

●

We welcome new directions. Standing still means going backwards!

●

We act with integrity and treat one another with respect! We keep our word!

●

We strive to ﬁnd the best solution, make considered decisions and act consistently!

●

We are aware of our responsibility and act sustainably!

Rules governing the upstanding behaviour of all employees and managers including the
Management Board and the Supervisory Board members are speciﬁed and bindingly formulated in
REWE Group’s code of conduct . The code is also designed to serve as a guide to those who work
with REWE Group.
The foundation of sustainable activities at REWE Group are the Guidelines for Sustainable Business
Practises. It takes concrete form in the principle “We are aware of our responsibility and act
sustainably!” As a result, it provides binding orientation for employees, managers, business partners
and suppliers.

GRI 102-17: Mechanisms for advice and concerns
about ethics
After introducing a professional anti-corruption system in 2007, REWE Group decided in 2010 to set
up an autonomous, decentral compliance organisation: The Corporate Department of Governance &
Compliance bundles and coordinates all compliance-relevant activities in REWE Group. A
compliance oﬃcer serves as an expert contact partner in each business unit and country company.
The aim of REWE Group’s Compliance Management System (CMS) is to prevent violations of laws
and internal company rules and, thus, to preclude damage to the company and personal liability of
the company’s bodies and employees. To achieve this objective, a compliance programme has been
developed. This programme comprises a number of preventative measures, including risk
assessments, training and consulting. Violations of legal regulations or internal rules, particularly

Materiality Analysis
GRI 102-45: Entities included in the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements
The report covers REWE Combine companies for Germany and Austria. The sustainability work
undertaken by independent retailers is addressed and presented only in individual cases due to the
large number of activities and the entrepreneurial autonomy of the retailers. This approach has also
been taken for locations outside Germany and Austria. Nonetheless, more than 50 per cent of REWE
Group’s employees have been covered. In reporting the data, a clear declaration has been made in
those places where detection limits deviate. For instance, the data for the pillars of Energy, Climate
and the Environment occasionally include independent retailers and locations outside Germany.

GRI 102-46: Deﬁning report content and topic
Boundaries
In 2014, REWE Group conducted a comprehensive materiality analysis that still applies for this
report. In this work, a representative cross-section of relevant stakeholders was asked in personal
interviews about their requirements, thoughts and strategic recommendations. In addition, an online
questionnaire was ﬁlled out by 115 participants. The survey results were used to develop a ranking
of 25 top-priority issues and 13 less critical issues. The latter group included various employee
issues, topics of social involvement, transparent marketing, certiﬁcation and labels, waste
management, more sustainable packaging and biodiversity. These issues were intensely discussed
in REWE Group project groups. It was concluded that all issues are critical to the combine’s
continued involvement and to reporting. The only exception is biodiversity: It is not a top priority
within the conﬁnes of the company’s business operations. But the issue is important in the supply
chain. As a result, it will be monitored in this context and reported on.
In March 2015, the PRO PLANET Board of Advisers, in which many NGOs are represented, reviewed
and approved the ﬁndings. Afterwards, the materiality analysis was discussed and approved by
REWE Group’s Sustainability Strategy Committee chaired by the member of the Management Board
Manfred Esser.

Classiﬁcation of Key Issues in GRI Aspects
GRI 102-47: List of material topics
GRI 102-49: Changes in reporting
A reclassiﬁcation of the aspects to be reported was done for REWE Group’s Sustainability Report
2015/2016. This work considered the fact that a comprehensive strategy process was conducted
for REWE and PENNY in 2016. During this process, the topics of sustainability commitment were
reworked in terms of stakeholder expectations and social development. To address the results in the
reporting, new aspects like animal welfare, more sustainable procurement, Green Buildings and
biodiversity were added as part of a comparison.

Approach by REWE Group
The stakeholder groups that are relevant to REWE Group were determined as part of the
sustainability strategy developed in 2008. The list is constantly modiﬁed on the basis of intense
discussions in such places as the REWE Dialogue Forums, Sustainability Weeks, the PRO PLANET
Board of Advisers and stakeholder surveys. The key stakeholder groups with which the company
conducts a dialogue are suppliers, consumers, business partners, political leaders, government
authorities, the academic community and non-government organisations (NGOs) as well as its own
employees, the Works Council, managers and independent retailers. During the reporting period,
REWE Group performed stakeholder mapping to gain an overview of relevant NGOs in the areas of
social issues, the environment, consumers, animal welfare, climate protection, conscious eating and
emergency assistance. The results ﬂow into the planning of stakeholder communication activities.

Sustainability Weeks

As a trade, travel and tourism company with millions of customer contacts each day, REWE Group
has both a special opportunity and an obligation to lead sustainability out of its niche existence.
Important momentum is generated during direct and personal conversations with a range of
stakeholders. In this activity, REWE Group views itself as an idea generator at events, podium
discussions and talks. It shares the experience it has gained in sustainability activities during these
discussions. The holding areas are responsible for the institutionalised dialogue with stakeholders
and communications with leading media and the trade press. They create umbrella brand
campaigns and measures, including the company’s own sustainability label PRO PLANET.
In 2010, REWE Group began to hold dialogue forums where it can have a personal, candid and
intense discussion with stakeholder groups. These forums also consider how trade and industry can
encourage customers to become more sustainable consumers. In 2015 and 2016, about 500 people
attended two dialogue forums. In 2015, about 270 people came to the forum “The Future of
Sustainable Consumption”. In 2016, about 200 people were invited to the dialogue forum that was
held as part of REWE Green Days 2.0. These individuals included representatives of political groups,
NGOs, the academic community and industry as well as REWE Group employees and customers.
The topics discussed included the UN Sustainable Development Goals, protection of the seas,
packaging and plastic, food waste, work/life balance, animal welfare and the future of sustainable
consumption (for more information, see dialog.rewe-group.com). The stakeholders’ central
concerns were discussed on site. They will shape the reﬁnement of REWE Group’s sustainability
strategy. Expert dialogues on speciﬁc topics were also held throughout the year.
One key organisational unit of the stakeholder dialogue is the PRO PLANET Board of Advisers. This
board serves as a professional and technical adviser who supports the activities of REWE Group and
is consulted about communications issues (see GRI 204: Procurement Practices).

Strategic Partnership with NABU
In 2015, REWE Group set up a strategic partnership with the environmental group Naturschutzbund
Deutschland e.V. (NABU). In doing so, it intensiﬁed a working relationship initiated in 2009. As a
result of the change, the two parties’ joint project work has been expanded to speciﬁc areas of
cooperation, including protection of the seas, plastic bags, protection of forests, paper, conservation
of resources and the fostering of biological diversity. In working groups and strategy workshops,
NABU and REWE Group develop roadmaps leading to the achievement of jointly deﬁned
sustainability goals. A key aspect of the partnership is a constructive, but critical discussion that is
conducted both on the work level and between the CEO of REWE Group and the president of NABU.
As a result of these discussions, NABU has become an important idea generator for the reﬁnement
of the sustainability strategy.

Customer and Employee Communications
The sales lines conduct communications with customers by doing such things as discussing
sustainability in weekly ﬂiers, on their websites and during Sustainability Weeks. The Sustainability
Weeks are held annually and raise consumers’ awareness levels about more environmentally and
socially acceptable products by taking individual steps.
In addition, all employees are informed, stimulated and energised about the issue. And there is a
clear reason for this: Employees serve as the interface with customers and suppliers. As a result,
they play the role of sustainability partner and become a key competitive factor. To bolster this
eﬀort, the concept of sustainability ambassador was developed. The aim is for the ambassadors to
communicate sustainability issues in stores, develop their own ideas and excite customers and other
employees for the topic. As part of their jobs, ambassadors answer questions raised by customers
and colleagues and can demonstrate in the stores themselves the sensible and positive aspects of
sustainability.

GRI 201: Economic Performance

Management Approach (GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)
The long-term business success of REWE Group is based on a cooperative structure that has given
life to such company values as solidarity, unity and sustainability. The cooperative philosophy, the
management culture that has arisen from it and the related long-term, cross-generational direction
of the company create security and stability for all stakeholders, extending from members and
employees to customers, suppliers and the entire socioeconomic environment. For this reason, the
Supervisory Board, shareholders, retailers and the Management Board of REWE Group consider the
long-range cooperative structure to be a guarantee of independence and self-determination.
REWE Group is determined to generate long-term business success and to conduct its business
activities in an environmentally and socially conscious manner. This commitment is spelled out in
the Guidelines for Sustainable Business Practices that apply to all employees and contract
partners of REWE Group. In the Guidelines, the company expresses its determination to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions generated by business processes, use renewable energy sources and
conserve natural resources, among other actions. By developing socially and environmentally
acceptable products and services as well as expanding its more sustainable product range, the
company is also helping to minimise the negative impacts created by its business operations.

GRI 201-3: Deﬁned beneﬁt plan obligations and other
retirement plans
REWE Group Pension Fund
As a result of demographic change, supplemental retirement planning is becoming increasingly
important. REWE Group understands this need. Through its REWE Group pension fund, it provides
employees with a company pension scheme that is designed especially with the needs of retail
employees in mind.
The REWE Group pension fund also provides beneﬁts that are paid out in cases of invalidity and
death in addition to the pension payments themselves. An employee may remain in the REWE
Group’s pension fund even if he or she leaves the company. In addition, REWE Group assumes
liability for the funds paid into the system and supports employees with an employer-ﬁnanced
payment of up to 300 euros each year. The company provides a supplement of up to 15 per cent to
employees’ own contributions to the pre-tax deferred compensation scheme. REWE International
AG oﬀers a similar programme in Austria.

REWE Group Voluntary Pension Beneﬁts
The beneﬁts of the German government’s basic pension scheme are limited to the so-called pension
contribution assessment ceiling. The need to have a supplementary retirement plan is particularly
high for employees with incomes that exceed this ceiling because the diﬀerence between their ﬁnal
salary and the highest basic pension entitlement of the government scheme can be very high. To
address the needs of this target group, REWE Group oﬀers its own retirement scheme model called
“REWE Group Voluntary Pension Beneﬁts”. The beneﬁt of this model is its tax-free contributions,
which can include large amounts of employee-ﬁnanced contributions through the pre-tax deferred
compensation scheme. Outside Germany, special retirement schemes are oﬀered because national
social security and tax laws set the conditions for company pension plans.

Historic Pension Models
In addition to the active pension models described above, both deﬁned-contribution and deﬁnedbeneﬁt plans of employees who worked at companies that were acquired in the past are continued.
They are also listed among pension provisions in the Annual Report if necessary.
In 2016, the fair value of the deﬁned-beneﬁt obligation (DBO) for the entire REWE Group was

934.7 million euros (in addition to 243.8 million euros of pension-like obligations, 2015:
773.4 million euros and 225.8 million euros, respectively). You will ﬁnd additional information in the
REWE Group Annual Report 2016 starting on page 114.

Other Beneﬁts:
Other employee beneﬁts include voluntary special payments above the general pay scale and
voluntary social beneﬁts like survivor beneﬁts and retirement allowances, the volume of which is
listed as a component of “pension-like obligations”.

Compliance
GRI 205: Anti-corruption
GRI 206: Anti-competitive Behaviour
GRI 307: Environmental Compliance
GRI 419: Socioeconomic Compliance

Combined Management Approach (GRI 103-1, 103-2,
103-3)
Violations of regulations can have personal consequences (including claims for damages or criminal
charges) for individual employees or board members of REWE Group. This, in turn, could hurt the
image of companies in REWE Group. A trade and tourism company faces particular compliance risks
in the areas of price-ﬁxing, the exercise of market power against suppliers and personal gain. For
this reason, integrity and fairness in business transactions as well as in interaction with others are
important fundamental principles in the mission statement of REWE Group. With the code of
conduct of REWE Group, the company has deﬁned standards of behaviour that are obligatory for all
individuals who work on behalf of REWE Group.
An anti-corruption system was introduced in 2007. As part of this eﬀort, various codes of conduct
were implemented for managers and employees. In addition, an internal anti-corruption oﬃcer and
an external ombudsman were appointed. In February 2009, REWE Group named a chief compliance
oﬃcer. And, in June 2010, the Corporate Department of Governance & Compliance began to
combine and coordinate the activities of REWE Group. Since 2011, the department has been
supported in its work by decentralised compliance oﬃcers in the respective business units and
country companies. As part of an eﬃcient compliance management system (CMS) drawn from the
standard IDW PS 980, REWE Group has set up a compliance programme that comprises a number
of preventive steps. Since mid-2011, regular compliance risk analyses have been conducted with
the goal of developing further preventive measures. Training for employees and special rules
governing ways to handle gifts made to top executives or purchasing departments are also included.
In 2015, the CMS was submitted to an external readiness check by a highly respected auditing ﬁrm.
As a follow-up step, the CMS has been reviewed on the basis of the recognised audit standard
(PS 980) of the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany since 2016. The objective of the audit is to
continuously improve the existing system. As part of this eﬀort, the new organisation of policy
management at REWE Group was added to the Corporate Department of Governance & Compliance.
In January 2016, work began in particular to reformulate compliance-relevant combine policies as
part of the restructuring. The project will be completed in 2018.
Formal complaints can be addressed to a number of diﬀerent departments at REWE Group,
including management, compliance, quality management and purchasing. They can also be sent
directly to the stores themselves.
Legal violations have not been comprehensively and centrally tracked by REWE Group. For this
reason, no assurances can be given regarding the completeness of the information in the following
categories.

GRI 205-1: Operations assessed for risks related to
corruption
With the help of an IT-supported tool, corruption risks are systematically recorded and evaluated in
REWE Group. Appropriate measures are then developed on the basis of this information. This
represents complete coverage of strategic business units, both national and international.
“Commercial bribery” was identiﬁed as a key corruption risk in the business areas of purchasing and
logistics.
On the basis of a compliance risk analysis in 2012, the focal point addressed during the reporting
period was reﬁnement and implementation of appropriate risk management measures. As part of
the integration projects Governance Risk & Compliance (GRC), business operation risks and
compliance risks were jointly collected, evaluated according to the same criteria and integrated into
a group-wide system solution (for more information about risk management, see the REWE Group
Annual Report 2016, pages 24–29).

GRI 205-2: Communication and training about anticorruption policies and procedure
In 2013, a mandatory e-learning course called “Compliance Basics” was rolled out across Germany
for all administrative employees. The course focused on the correct approach to gifts (anticorruption). The course was voluntary for top executives. In addition, classroom training and
advisory sessions were conducted in 2015 and 2016 for areas susceptible to corruption like
purchasing and expansion (national/international). In-depth compliance training for members of the
Supervisory Boards of leading companies of REWE Group was oﬀered as well. The training concept
applies a risk-focused approach that calls for training to be held on a regular basis. As a result,
nearly all relevant employees will have received the training within a period of two years to three
years.
REWE Group has been providing information about compliance, particularly tip-oﬀ management, on
its website since 2013. Its code of conduct can also be downloaded. Every employee of REWE Group
can ﬁnd basic compliance information in the intranet and in various team rooms.

GRI 205-3: Conﬁrmed incidents of corruption and
actions taken
Whistleblower tips received by compliance oﬃcers are systematically compiled in the compliance
tip tool. They are then reviewed and forwarded to the appropriate department, in particular auditing.
This department examines the allegations and reports the results and measures to be taken as a

result to the Corporate Department of Governance & Compliance. It is the responsibility of the
operative units to implement these measures, which can involve such matters as labour or criminal
issues. In 2015, three signiﬁcant tips about corruption were received by Governance & Compliance.
Two were submitted in 2016. Each case involved “commercial bribery”. Labour-law disciplinary
steps were taken in each case. REWE Group protects the names of whistleblowers and aﬀected
individuals as part of its tip-oﬀ management system.
Together with decentralised compliance oﬃcers, the Corporate Department of Governance &
Compliance holds annual workshops for the purpose of modifying the compliance programme and
implementing preventive measures to minimise compliance risks.

GRI 206-1: Legal actions for anti-competitive
behaviour, anti-trust, and monopoly practices
REWE Group does not report legal actions or the results of such actions as this information is subject
to conﬁdentiality obligations.

GRI 307-1: Non-compliance with environmental laws
and regulations
REWE Group does not provide disclosures about non-compliance with environmental laws and
regulations as this information does not have the necessary level of quality available throughout the
combine. In addition, no plans exist to gather this information in future as the eﬀort to acquire the
data is not proportional to the beneﬁts obtained from gathering it.

GRI 419-1: Non-compliance with laws and regulations
in the social and economic area
REWE Group does not provide disclosures about non-compliance with laws and regulations as this
information does not have the necessary level of quality available throughout the combine. In
addition, no plans exist to gather this information in future as the eﬀort to acquire the data is not
proportional to the beneﬁts obtained from gathering it. We report on legal risks on page 28 and the
following in the Combined Management Report for the 2016 business year and disclose the other
provisions for court, litigation and legal consulting costs in note 34 on page 119.

Public Policy
GRI 415: Public Policy

Management Approach (GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)
To support future-oriented economic, nutritional and environmental policies, REWE Group conducts
a dialogue with political leaders on various levels. The company maintains oﬃces in Berlin and
Brussels that serve as platforms for dialogue and discussions with key stakeholders for trade, travel
and tourism as well as REWE Group. REWE Group excludes no one who shares its values and
principles from this dialogue. During the reporting period, a number of background meetings and
events were held. Invitations to these meetings were extended to many diﬀerent leaders from a
range of parties. The topics of sustainability, local supply and healthy diets were addressed in a
number of events. Representatives of REWE Group also met with oﬃceholders and oﬃcials from
government authorities to inform them about relevant issues and to explain the company’s interests.
Representatives of REWE Group also served as speakers and discussion partners at events that were
organised by government authorities, political parties and trade associations and that explored
political and social issues that apply to REWE Group.
Donations made to parties or political groups, elected representatives, government authorities,
churches and other religious groups must be approved by the Management Board member
responsible for the particular area and the Chief Compliance Oﬃcer of REWE Group. Every donation
must comply with legal regulations and regulatory guidelines at REWE Group, including the code of
conduct.

GRI 415-1: : Political contributions
REWE Group-Combine conducted no political party sponsoring during the reporting period. In 2016,
REWE Group joined a Social Democratic business group, Wirtschaftsforum der SPD e.V., and a
Christian Democratic Union business group, Wirtschaftsrat der CDU e.V. The annual dues for both
memberships are about 33,000 euros.

Data Protection
GRI 418: Customer Privacy

Management Approach (GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)
As a matter of principle, the companies of REWE Group handle personal data conﬁdentially. REWE
Group secures these data in accordance with current legal requirements. REWE Group has made
this practise a high priority, particularly in light of the growing online business being conducted by its
sales brands.
Every data protection inquiry that is submitted to the companies of REWE Group by customers or
oversight authorities is documented, reviewed and processed. Data protection oﬃcers (DPO) (eight
DPOs for 58 companies in 2016) address legally compliant approaches to personal data and the
processing programmes that have been put into place regarding it. In addition, they work on the
modiﬁcation of company-speciﬁc data protection and data security measures and advise
organisational units and departments. The data protection oﬃcers report directly to the top
management level of the companies or to the Managing Board of REWE Group.
Important areas addressed during the reporting period on the basis of the work put into them were:

●

The use of external IT service providers as part of contract data processing and

●

Video surveillance in stores that is subject to prior checking by the DPOs.

The EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU-GDPR) that took eﬀect in 2016 requires REWE
Group to take a range of steps, including the reformulation of existing policies, training documents
and templates. Speciﬁcally, this work will involve expanded documentation and information
requirements, privacy impact assessments and the right of aﬀected individuals to information,
correction, deletion and data portability. REWE Group is preparing to implement the requirements of
the EU regulation on data protection with external support. The work is scheduled to be completed
by May 2018.

GRI 418-1: Substantiated complaints concerning
breaches of customer privacy and losses of customer
data
During the reporting period of 2015/2016, seven justiﬁed complaints (one authorised by the
organisation and six by supervisory authorities) related to data protection violations at companies in
REWE Group were ﬁled. But none of these cases involved data leaks, data theft or data losses. Six
complaints were ﬁled during the same period at REWE Group in Austria.
The allegations made in the complaints are analysed, technical or organisational processes are
changed where necessary and the complaining party – either an aﬀected individual or supervisory
authority – is notiﬁed about the ﬁndings and potential measures to be taken as a result.

Green Products
Pillar of Sustainability: Green Products
The concept of sustainability has entered the mainstream of society. It is reﬂected in both dietary
and consumption behaviour as well as in the selection of holiday destinations. Recent surveys have
found that about two-thirds of Germans buy organic products on occasion at the very least (source:
German Ministry of Food and Agriculture: Environmental Barometer 2017; the German
Environmental and Protection Agency: Attitudes About the Environment in Germany 2016). In
addition, more than one-third of Germans want to take more sustainable trips (source: German
Ministry of Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety: Travel Analysis 2014).
More and more people are interested in knowing how their actions impact society and the
environment. In particular, they want to know that products and services are made or oﬀered under
good working conditions and that the environment is not damaged in the process. Nonetheless, one
principle still applies: Sustainability is never the sole criteria used to take a decision. Quality and the
price are just as important. At the same time, consumers interpret the term “sustainability” in
diﬀerent ways. Some deﬁne it as protecting nature and the environment. Others view it from the
perspective of social conditions and animal welfare.
REWE Group intends to address these needs and excite growing numbers of people about more
sustainable products and services. REWE Group considers sustainability to be a part of its business
strategy, an area that contributes to the company’s success in business and serves as a major driver
of growth. The focal points of the strategic objective of the pillar Green Products are:
1.

Creating more sustainable product ranges

2.

Improving social and environmental standards in the supply chain

3.

Promoting the consumption of more sustainable products and services

Strategic Approach
In Germany, REWE Group takes a due-diligence approach that is based on OECD guidelines for
responsible agricultural supply chains and combines the activities of the pillar Green Products into a
ﬁve-step process:
1.

Management Systems: Sustainability is an integrated component of regular business processes.
The aim is for sustainability aspects to be considered in every purchasing decision.

2.

Risk Analysis: REWE Group continuously analyses social and environmental risks in the supply
chains of its products. As part of this activity, the company conducts hot spot analysis and
works closely with stakeholders, including the PRO PLANET Board of Advisers and dialogue
forums. REWE Group substantially expanded this eﬀort in 2016 and 2017. In one aspect of
these activities, it conducted formalised risk analysis for food and non-food store-brand
products that covered all key product groups. As a result, sustainability risks could be evaluated
and prioritised on the basis of product clusters.

3.

Strategy: The ﬁndings of the analysis are used to develop recommended courses of action and
measures, including a range of instruments that have proven themselves under real-world

business conditions. These programmes include the sustainability label PRO PLANET for the
store-brand products sold by REWE Group, the company’s own guidelines for numerous raw
materials and certiﬁcations from independent organisations to ensure that sustainability
standards are being met. In terms of holistic solutions and general standards, REWE Group
plays an active role in industry initiatives, some of which it has launched itself.
4.

Review: Audits and goal veriﬁcation of the guidelines are used to measure progress. The
eﬀectiveness of measures is also regularly reviewed.

5.

Reporting: To provide transparency to stakeholders, REWE Group reports about the
programmes and results of its sustainability activities. In addition to the sustainability report,
this work includes the PRO PLANET website and the REWE Group’s homepage.

The following areas of action have been deﬁned for the pillar Green Products: “expansion of
sustainable product ranges”, “social standards in the supply chain”, “product quality and safety”
and “biodiversity”.
The areas of action for food retail in Germany were recalibrated as part of the strategic process for
sustainability in 2016. The new areas of action were redeﬁned as: “fairness”, “diet”, “labour and
social standards” and “animal welfare and environmental protection” (for more information, see
thechapter Strategy).
The project group Green Products has been led by Jan-Peer Brenneke (Managing Director for Store
Brands Purchasing & Development national / international) since 2016.

Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
As a way of measuring the progress being achieved in the pillar Green Products, REWE Group
deﬁned key performance indicators (KPIs) in 2010:
KPI 1 : Expanding the number of more sustainable store-brand and branded products
KPI 2 : Boosting the number of non-food suppliers with social audits (BSCI) from developing
countries to 85 per cent by 2015
The central components of the ﬁrst KPI are the number of organic, regional and PRO PLANET
products in the assortment. Since 2010, this area has grown without exception. The number of PRO
PLANET products in Germany has risen from 256 in 2010 to 957 in 2016. At the same time, the
share of REWE organic products climbed from 2.8 per cent in 2010 to 4.2 per cent in 2016
(measured by sales value).

For the second KPI, the total reached 85 per cent in 2014 and then hit 99.4 per cent in 2015.
As part of the company’s strategy process, the KPIs are currently being reviewed and modiﬁed.

Sustainable Development Goals
The activities conducted in the pillar Green Products also focus on the global goals of sustainable
development. During the reporting period, REWE Group measured its sustainability strategy against
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It then identiﬁed and prioritised the SDGs that are
relevant to the company (see the chapter Strategy). Three of the highest-priority SDGs apply to the
pillar Green Products: SDG 12: responsible consumption and production, SDG 15: life on land,
SDG 14: life below water.

More Sustainable Product Range
GRI 204: Procurement Practices

Management Approach (GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)
Expanding its sustainable product range is one of REWE Group’s major strategic goals. In striving to
achieve this goal, the company focuses on improving the social and environmental aspects of its
products and services and on positively inﬂuencing value chains. As part of these eﬀorts, REWE
Group helps to protect and sustainably use the natural basis of life.
REWE Group works closely with its suppliers in the process and continuously reﬁnes the
environmental and social requirements for its product ranges. Step by step, sustainability is joining
freshness, quality and price as an important factor in the shopping process. The expansion of
sustainable product ranges must be in line with demand by customers. REWE Group focuses its
activities on its store brands, for which it plays a key role in product design. In systematically working
to achieve its goals, REWE Group in Germany has developed a strategic approach that bundles the
diﬀerent approaches used for the pillar Green Products (see the Management Approach Green
Products).
The following text outlines the relevant approaches being taken to create sustainable product
ranges:

●

Expansion of organic and regional assortments

●

The PRO PLANET label for store-brand products

●

The deﬁnition of guidelines and more sustainable procurement practices for raw materials

●

The strengthening of more sustainable branded products

●

Activities in industry initiatives.

Organic and Regional
REWE Group continuously works to expand the organic product ranges of its sales lines. With the
Guideline for Ecological Products it approved in 2014, REWE Group formulated requirements for
suppliers and companies that exceed organic standards like the EU organic farming label in many
cases. More than 150 organic products sold by the REWE sales line are subject to the signiﬁcantly
stricter criteria of the farming organisation Naturland.
In addition to organic products, local and regional suppliers play an important role at REWE Group.
To consumers, this group of suppliers represents freshness, short transport distances, trustworthy
production and support of local economies. REWE Group has markedly expanded its regional
product range in recent years. The foundation of this eﬀort is formed by long-term relationships of
the REWE sales line with suppliers and direct marketers in the region as well as transparent,

attention-grabbing communication about the special quality of these products to consumers for
example by introducing the brand REWE Regional.
Information about the development of regional product ranges is available in GRI 204-1 and about
organic products in GRI FP2.

PRO PLANET
PRO PLANET represents one major goal of REWE Group: to make conventional products in the mass
market more sustainable and to promote sustainable consumption among the general public. As
part of its broad Green Products strategy, the company has devised the PRO PLANET process: With
the PRO PLANET label, REWE Group provides its customers with a comprehensible and transparent
guide to more sustainable products. In the process, it promotes increased sustainability in
production and processing through speciﬁc PRO PLANET projects.
As a rule, the PRO PLANET process can be applied to all products of REWE Group. A specially
modiﬁed process has been developed for the DIY business to cover intricately produced items like
LED lamps that are frequently part of complex value chains. All products sold under the PRO
PLANET label in DIY stores must go through this process or the original PRO PLANET system.

Every PRO PLANET process begins with careful analysis in which independent experts examine the
entire life cycle of the selected product group. This analysis can identify problematic social or
environmental impacts (hot spots). Product- and raw-material-related recommendations are
developed for signiﬁcant hot spots. These recommendations are carried out following a successful
feasibility study during PRO PLANET projects. As an alternative, an existing label can be applied if
the hot spot can be reduced or eliminated with it. The product will then bear both labels. For
instance, store-brand chocolate bears both the PRO PLANET label and the UTZ label for sustainable
cocoa, a seal based on conservation of resources and social criteria. If existing standards do not
eliminate the hot spot, further steps must be taken before the PRO PLANET label is awarded.
The entire process is supported by an independent group of stakeholders: The PRO PLANET Board
of Advisers was set up in 2009. It consists of ﬁve NGO experts who contribute their knowledge and
approve the issuance of the PRO PLANET label. The board’s members get together up to six times a
year during two-day meetings. In addition, REWE Group draws on the project-speciﬁc expertise of
external partners during the issuance process.
The members of the PRO PLANET Board of Advisers during the reporting period were:

●

Bernward Geier (COLABORA)

●

Georg Abel (VERBRAUCHER INITIATIVE e.V.)

●

Friedel Hütz-Adams (SÜDWIND e.V.)

●

Dr Eick von Ruschkowski (NABU Bundesverband e.V.; replaced Florian Schöne, NABU
Bundesverband e.V., in 2016)

●

Barbara Studeny (Global 2000)

The label is designed to serve as a navigation system for more sustainable products. It provides
information to customers about which hot spot was improved for each respective product.
Additional information can be obtained by using a code number on the website www.proplanetlabel.com. It describes the added value oﬀered by PRO PLANET products and identiﬁes the hot
spots that were reduced or eliminated. The label applies for a period of three years. The product
then must undergo a review before the label is issued again.
The following seals are among the established labels used in the PRO PLANET process: ASC, Cotton
made in Africa, Blauer Engel (Blue Angel), Fairtrade, FSC®, MSC, PEFC™, Rainforest Alliance, UTZ
Certiﬁed, GOTS and VLOG.
Information on the development of PRO PLANET products is found under GRI FP2.

Guidelines of REWE Group
The guidelines of the REWE Group represent an important instrument in the work aimed at making
the supply chains of critical raw materials more sustainable. In these guidelines, REWE Group sets
standards covering the supply of raw materials like cocoa, palm oil and ﬁsh. It also establishes a
deadline for the transition to more sustainable raw materials. REWE Group had approved the
following guidelines by the end of 2016:

●

Guideline for Ecological Products Deﬁnes standards for organic store brands that exceed the
requirements of the EU organic farming label in many cases (download).

●

Guideline for Soy in Animal Feed: Requires imported soybean meal to be non-genetically modiﬁed
and calls for the examination of potential replacements with domestic protein sources as key
requirements (download).

●

Guideline for Fish, Crustacean and Shellﬁsh: Deﬁnes standards for wild ﬁsh and ﬁsh from
aquaculture, including demanding transparency criteria(download).

●

Guideline for Natural Stone Products: Deﬁnes an implementation framework for improving social
and environmental standards in the production of natural stone (download).

●

Guideline for Palm Oil and Palm Kernel Oil Products: Sets an implementation schedule for the
transition to sustainable palm oil and deﬁnes requirements that go beyond established standards
(download).

●

Guideline for Cocoa: Deﬁnes requirements for the procurement of cocoa and sets a schedule for
the transition to certiﬁed sources (download).

●

Mission Statement on Animal Husbandry of the Future: Formulates fundamental principles and
goals for implementing species-appropriate animal-husbandry practises (download).

Information on the status and goal achievement for the guidelines is available under GRI FP1.

Sector Initiatives
Strategies that change entire sectors over the long term are required for many sustainability
challenges in global value chains. This is why REWE Group plays an active role in sector initiatives
and launches them itself on occasion. This multi-stakeholder approach is designed to include as
many players as possible throughout value chains and to jointly create solutions that will lead to
long-term positive developments throughout the supply chain.

Forum for Sustainable Palm Oil

REWE Group is an initiative partner of the Forum for Sustainable Palm Oil (FONAP) that was created
in 2013. The forum’s mission is to strengthen demand for certiﬁed palm oil and to bring about longterm changes in the palm oil sector as a result. Members of the forum have committed themselves
to using only sustainably certiﬁed palm oil, palm kernel oil and their derivatives and distillates in
their products. With the group’s founding in November 2015, REWE Group became part of the
forum’s Steering Committee. It plays an active part in a working group that monitors and reviews the
members’ pledge and in a working group that is developing a project in producer countries.

German Initiative on Sustainable Cocoa
As a charter member of the multi-stakeholder initiative German Initiative on Sustainable Cocoa
(GISCO), REWE Group joins other companies to support the PRO-PLANTEURS project, a joint, ﬁveyear cocoa programme being conducted in Côte d’Ivoire. The project strives to professionalise the
work of 20,000 cocoa farmers, their families and producer organisations. The aim is to improve the
lives of the families by boosting incomes and upgrading diets. The project is aimed in particular at
women and young farmers with the goal of increasing the appeal of cocoa farming.

Textile Alliance
In June 2015, REWE Group joined the Alliance for Sustainable Textiles. The multi-stakeholder
initiative was started in October 2014 and works to bring about social, environmental and
commercial improvements throughout the textile supply chain. As part of this work, an action plan
outlining the process for reaching the alliance’s goals was approved. REWE Group is a member of
the working group on chemical and environmental management, one of three professional
committees in the group. As an alliance member, REWE Group has developed an ambitious
roadmap for 2017 that contributes to the achievement of the organisation’s objectives. In addition,
all alliance members are working in 2017 to implement their individual goals and to release progress
reports in 2018.

Futouris
DER Touristik joined Futouris, the sustainability initiative of the German travel and tourism industry,
in 2015. The organisation’s primary objective is to promote destinations over the long term by
supporting environmental, biodiversity and corporate responsibility projects on behalf of society and
culture. During the reporting period, DER Touristik was actively involved in three initiative projects:
The industry project Sustainable Food developed guidelines for providers of tourism services to
improve the range of sustainable food and beverages oﬀered in holiday regions. Follow-up projects
on the topics of food waste and communication with guests have been planned as well. The KAZA
project is designed to develop a standard for sustainably operated lodges in the KAZA region of
Africa (Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area). The project Green Travel Transformation
is working to raise awareness levels about sustainable travel opportunities (for more information
about this project, see GRI 417: Marketing and Labeling).

Fruit Juice Platform
In June 2016, REWE Group became a member of the European Fruit Juice Platform and works to
improve the social and environmental aspects of the industry’s supply chain.
REWE Group also plays an active role in other initiatives and campaigns:

●

The Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI) (for more information, see GRI 414: Supplier
Social Assessment).

●

Detox campaign for textile production without hazardous chemical (for more information, see GRI
308: Supplier Environmental Assessment).

●

Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety (for more information, see GRI 414: Supplier
Social Assessment).

●

The Animal Welfare Initiative (for more information, see GRI FP10: animal welfare).

●

Initiative Biodiversity in Good Company (for more information, see GRI 304: Biodiversity).

●

German Association of Non-Genetically Modiﬁed Foods (Verein Lebensmittel ohne Gentechnik
e.V., VLOG)

Branded Products
In addition to its store brands, REWE Group is also committed to more sustainable branded
products. This pledge is reﬂected in the Sustainability Weeks held at REWE Group each year. During
a deﬁned period of time, the company focuses on more sustainable products in addition to
organising participatory activities. A selection of these more sustainable branded products is oﬀered
each year as part of an online consumer voting campaign. REWE Group and the sustainability
foundation Stiftung Deutscher Nachhaltigkeitspreis e.V. also present the German Sustainability
Award in the category Germany’s Most Sustainable Products (Food and Non-Food). The sustainable
qualities of all products that are part of the voting are reviewed in advance by the Collaborating
Centre on Sustainable Consumption and Production (CSCP) in Wuppertal, Germany. The jury of the
German Sustainability Award then conﬁrms them (for more information about Sustainability Weeks,
seeGRI 417: Marketing and Labeling).

Regional Products
GRI 204-1: Proportion of spending on local suppliers
REWE Group deﬁnes regional suppliers as those individuals who are included in one of various
regional concepts. The regional assortments include a high percentage of fresh fruit and vegetable
products that are sold in stores on a seasonal basis.
With the REWE Regional concept, a Germany-wide brand for regional products was created in 2012
as a way of clearly identifying these products. The region from which a product comes is shown on
the packaging: as a politically deﬁned area (i.e., a German state), a cultural region (i.e., the
Franconia area of northern Bavaria) or a traditional cultivation region (i.e., the Altes Land area that
straddles parts of Lower Saxony and Hamburg). Examples include sausage and eggs from North
Rhine-Westphalia or Bavaria, apples from Altes Land and North Sea shrimp from Dithmarschen. The
regional assortment performed very well during the reporting period. The number of products rose
sharply, and revenue as measured by sales value jumped by more than 80 per cent from 2014 to
2016.

Regionalfenster (Regional Window)
As another way of promoting regional products, REWE Group became a charter member of the
Trägerverein Regionalfenster e.V. in 2012. Following a test phase in February 2013, REWE Group
has been applying the group’s regional window concept to selected products in PENNY and REWE
stores since 2014. The label provides consumers with veriﬁed information about the origin of
ingredients and the processing location. In this manner, the regional window creates transparency
for customers that complements store-brand-speciﬁc information. At REWE, the number of regional
window items rose from 216 in 2014 to 288 in 2016.

PENNY expands the regional window to about 30 items when they are available in Germany. These
products include cucumbers, carrots, asparagus and tomatoes that frequently come from one
supplier per region. As a result, nearly all items produced in Germany are identiﬁed as regional
window products. As an additional way of highlighting a product’s origin, PENNY identiﬁes regional
fruit and vegetables by German state or agricultural or “pleasure region” like the Oldenburger

Münsterland area of northwestern Germany. Transparency about a product’s origin is one part of
PENNY’s regionality pledge, a promise that also covers its commitment to freshness by employing
short transport distances and promoting domestic producers.
In Austria, an array of regional concepts is also being employed. In 2010, the A+A label began to be
used. It identiﬁes products that are entirely produced and processed in Austria and that use only
ingredients from Austria (a deviation of 2 per cent is permitted to address such issues as the use of
spices). A+A is used in BILLA, Merkur and PENNY stores in Austria.

Since September 2014, another regional concept for fruit and vegetables has been used in the
stores of BILLA, MERKUR and Sutterlüty. It is called “Da komm ich her” (I’m from Here). During the
reporting period, the fruit and vegetable items sold on a seasonal and regional basis was expanded
to 244. In 2016, 1,635 stores were part of the programme, and the products generated more than
80 million customer contacts.

range had 713 products, compared with 676 in 2015. The products generated total revenue of more
than 130 million euros in 2016.

Local
When the word “local” is used, it refers to products that generally come from small suppliers or
sellers of agricultural items who directly serve a regionally limited number of stores. To further boost
the number of items produced locally, REWE Group has appointed locality oﬃcers. These ofﬁcers
establish contacts between REWE stores and local producers and suppliers. They also perform such
jobs as attend locality conferences where suppliers can present their goods. During the reporting
period, the number of locality oﬃcers rose from six to 12. One successful example of the promotion
of local suppliers is the REWE Landmarkt (country store) concept in the Region Middle. Farmers in
the central German organisation Vereinigung der Hessischen Direktvermarkter e.V. (VHD) sell their
products under this name throughout the state of Hesse. At the end of 2016, 258 stores sold more
than 2,900 Landmarkt items.

Raw materials
GRI FP1: Percentage of purchased volume from
suppliers compliant with company’s sourcing policy
REWE Group continuously works to make its supply chains more social and environmentally
conscious. In this eﬀort, REWE Group draws on internationally recognised certiﬁcation standards
and formulates its own requirements as part of its guidelines and its PRO PLANET process. The
following text outlines the approaches that the company takes to individual raw materials.

Palm Oil
The increased cultivation of palm oil is destroying peat forests and rainforests. In the process, the
basis of local populations’ lives is frequently being taken away, and the habitats of valuable species
are being lost. The clearing of rainforests is also releasing huge amounts of CO2 .
Against this backdrop, REWE Group developed its Guideline for Palm Oil and Palm Kernel Oil
Products at the beginning of 2011. The goal of this guideline is to use only more sustainably
produced palm oil in all store-brand products. To achieve this objective, REWE Group primarily
employs the certiﬁcation standard developed by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), an
organisation it joined in 2011. Four trade models are applied in supply chains for the purchase of
certiﬁed palm oil. Each employs diﬀerent requirements regarding the traceability of the raw material
to the farm. With the help of all trade models, REWE Group has been able to use only certiﬁed palm
oil since 2013. In Austria, REWE Group has been using only certiﬁed palm oil since 2014.
The objectives of the REWE Group guideline are part of a company pledge that the company signed
in 2015 as a member of the Forum for Sustainable Palm Oil. The ambitious goals of this commitment
are designed to facilitate the traceability of palm oil over the long term through compliance with
deﬁned supplemental criteria. This work also involves purchasing palm oil that is subject to the
demanding trade model of segregation. In this process, sustainably produced oil is continuously
separated from non-certiﬁed oil along the entire supply chain. In consideration of the individual
goals for each palm (kernel) oil product, REWE Group attained a total achievement level of
99 per cent with all store-brand products in Germany in 2016. The requirements pose a special
challenge to small suppliers with complex supply chain structures. For instance, some suppliers
could not make the switch to the segregation trade model until 2016 because of the very complex
and expensive work that goes into setting up separate product streams. This is particularly the case
when a supplier switches only a small amount of his total production. REWE Group in Germany is
working with its suppliers to achieve the last few per cent needed to achieve the goal. In Austria,
REWE Group has made major strides in its eﬀort to use certiﬁed palm oil. At the end of 2016, more
than 50 per cent of products in the food and non-food area had been switched to segregation.

Cocoa
A major amount of global raw cocoa comes from Western Africa. It is work that is primarily done on
small, family-run farms. Cocoa farmers have to battle diﬃcult business conditions there and
frequently live with their families below the poverty level. As a result, they lack investment funds and

generally have poor working conditions, which can also include exploitative child labour. In its
Guideline for Cocoa, REWE Group formulated the goal of purchasing all raw cocoa supplies for its
store brands from more sustainable farming structures by the end of 2015. This is assured by
applying the standards Fairtrade, Fairtrade Sourcing Programme, Rainforest Alliance and UTZ. By
the end of the deadline on 1 January 2016, REWE Group in Germany had raised its share of certiﬁed
cocoa to 90 per cent. The share of certiﬁed cocoa climbed to 94 per cent in 2016. As a result, REWE
Group has not achieved its target. The primary reason for this delay was the inability of some
suppliers to meet transition deadlines. One major challenge involves switching small amounts of the
total production to the certiﬁed product. REWE Group is continuing eﬀorts to reach its 100 per cent
goal and is working closely with its suppliers to ensure that this target is hit as quickly as possible. In
Austria, REWE Group has more than 400 certiﬁed cocoa products among the store brands and
branded items in its assortment.
REWE Group is also an initiative member of the German Initiative on Sustainable Cocoa (GISCO).
The objective of this multi-stakeholder initiative is to improve living conditions of cocoa farmers and
their families as well as to increase the production and marketing of sustainably produced cocoa.

Bananas and Pineapples
The cultivation of the tropical fruits bananas and pineapples may result in negative environmental
and social impacts in production countries. These include poor working conditions at fruit farms, the
widespread use of pesticides and damage to ecosystems. In 2015 and 2016, REWE Group and its
sales lines in Germany completely switched their purchasing of non-organic pineapples and bananas
to Rainforest Alliance. As a result, all pineapples and bananas came from farms certiﬁed by the
Rainforest Alliance at the end of 2016.

Cotton
Cotton is the most important raw material used in the textile industry. It is primarily grown in India,
China and the United States. Conventional cotton cultivation practises use extensive amounts of
water, pesticides and fertilisers. To boost its percentage of textile products made with more
sustainably cotton, REWE Group in Germany uses Cotton made in Africa (CmiA) and supports the
Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS). REWE Group has set the goal of increasing its share of
store-brand textile products made of more sustainable cotton from 56 per cent in 2015 to
70 per cent by the end of 2017.

Coﬀee
The farming of coﬀee as a globally traded product is an important economic sector in many
countries of Latin America, Asia and Africa. But the yields of the small farms that produce the beans
are frequently too tiny to produce an income from which coﬀee farmers and their families can live.
Added to this are the health and environmental risks posed by the incorrect use of pesticides. To
improve the lot of coﬀee farmers, REWE Group is switching to certiﬁed coﬀee on a step-by-step
basis. In 2015, the share of coﬀee certiﬁed by UTZ, Bio or Fairtrade was 33.3 per cent. The total
rose to 61.7 per cent in 2016. All store-brand coﬀee products at REWE Group in Austria are
Fairtrade certiﬁed.

Tea
Conventional tea farms are frequently monocultures that use large amount of pesticides. This
endangers biodiversity and the supplies of drinking water for people who live in the cultivation areas.
Local workers also face a number of challenges, including low wages and inadequate occupational
health and safety practises. To address such issues, REWE Group promotes sustainable agriculture
in tea production and orders certiﬁed products that bear the Rainforest Alliance seal and the PRO
PLANET label. The share of certiﬁed tea products was 14 per cent at REWE and PENNY in 2016.

Due to the limited number of certiﬁed farms, the black and green PRO PLANET teas contain
50 per cent certiﬁed raw tea at market entry. REWE Group is striving to continuously increase this
percentage. For 2017, PENNY set the goal of switching the entire segment of green tea and Earl
Grey to raw products certiﬁed by the Rainforest Alliance.

Fish
Rising demand for ﬁsh and seafood has put the world’s ﬁsh stocks under severe pressure and
resulted in over-ﬁshing in some regions. In its Guideline for Fish, Crustacean and Shellﬁsh, REWE
Group has pledged to purchase increasingly more ﬁsh products from sustainable and certiﬁed
ﬁshing operations and aquaculture and to transparently inform consumers about this eﬀort.

The assortment of REWE Group in Austria has about 400 MSC-certiﬁed ﬁsh products.

Soybeans as Animal Feed
In conventional animal-husbandry practises, soybean meal imported from overseas countries is
used to provide animals with suﬃcient amounts of protein. This meal frequently includes genetically
modiﬁed types of beans. For this reason, REWE Group has drawn up a Guideline for Soy in Animal
Feed that requires producers of store-brand products to abandon the use of genetically modiﬁed
soybeans, among other requirements. This requirement is implemented on an individual basis for
each species of farm animal. As proof that no GMO feed is being used, REWE Group in Germany
works with the German Association of Non-Genetically Modiﬁed Foods (VLOG). In 2016, the entire
range of fresh eggs at REWE Group in Germany had been certiﬁed by the group. For fresh milk, the
share rose from 20 per cent in 2015 to 77 per cent in 2016. The entire range of fresh eggs at REWE
Group in Austria comes from non-GMO feed.

Wood and Paper
REWE Group is committed to protecting the forests of the world and the animals and plants that live
there. For this reason, it supports environmentally and socially conscious forest management by
increasingly procuring wood and paper for its products and packaging from sustainably operated
sources. REWE Group uses the seal of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC®) and of the Programme
for the Endorsement of Forest Certiﬁcation Schemes (PEFC™) as well as the German environmental
seal Blauer Engel (Blue Angel). A large number of REWE Group products already bear these seals.
For instance, nearly 80 per cent of hygienic paper products at REWE and PENNY have the FSC label.
All other hygienic paper bears either the PEFC™ label or the Blauer Engel seal. All paper shopping
bags and all packaging used for the Vivess store brand are made exclusively with FSC-certiﬁed
paper. Nearly all store-brand stationery products have the Blauer Engel seal. toom Baumarkt DIY
stores oﬀer a continuously expanding range of certiﬁed items from many diﬀerent product
categories. toom Baumarkt DIY stores are oﬃcially FSC® and PEFC™ certiﬁed. As a result, they meet
the high standards that apply to transparency and the control of the product chain in both systems
for sustainable forest management.

Peat-Free Soils
toom Baumarkt DIY stores plan to stop selling peat soils by 2025. This commitment applies to both

store brands and branded products. As part of this transition, the percentage of peat in the entire
assortment is being continuously reduced and replaced with renewable raw materials. At the same
time, the range of peat-free soil products is rising each year. In spring 2017, the assortment of peatfree toom Naturtalent potting soil was expanded to ﬁve items that also bear the PRO PLANET label.
The REWE and PENNY sales lines have also added peat-free and peat-reduced alternatives to their
season range of soils.

Natural Stone
toom Baumarkt DIY stores work to ensure that social standards and environmental requirements are
met in the extraction and production of natural stone products. To achieve this goal, toom has been
working for several years with the independent experts of XertiﬁX to seamlessly track the supply
chain of natural stone all the way back to the quarry and to monitor compliance with social and
environmental criteria. In 2016, toom Baumarkt DIY stores began to sell the ﬁrst certiﬁed natural
stone products that bear both the XertiﬁX Plus and PRO PLANET labels. This range of certiﬁed
products is being continuously expanded (for more information, see the chapter Natural Stone in
the magazine).

Organic and PRO PLANET
GRI FP2: Percentage of purchased volume which is
veriﬁed as being in accordance with recognized
standards
PRO PLANET
In 2015 and 2016, the PRO PLANET products in individual product groups generated diﬀerent
results. Overall, a sharp increase in the number of PRO PLANET products was seen in Germany. But
this fact was not reﬂected to the same degree in customer contacts and percentage of sales. There
was one reason for this development: A number of high-volume products lost the PRO PLANET label
as part of the review process used by the PRO PLANET label. Many of the newly added products are
also found in the assortment of toom Baumarkt DIY stores. As a result, they are available in a smaller
number of stores. In 2016, the percentage of sales for PRO PLANET products in Germany was about
11.6 per cent, slightly below the level recorded in the previous year. Overall, however, this metric
has moved in a positive direction over the years.
A similar trend for PRO PLANET was seen at REWE Group in Austria. Just like Germany, high-volume
products lost the PRO PLANET label, a development that resulted in fewer customer contacts and a
lower percentage of sales even as the number of products continued to grow.
The population used for calculating the share of PRO PLANET products in gross sales value for
Germany has been modiﬁed. It now comprises all store-brand products of the sales lines REWE,
PENNY and toom Baumarkt DIY stores. In the past, the population was made up of only the product
groups of the three sales lines where PRO PLANET products are sold. As a result of the larger
population now being used, the total fell slightly in comparison with the REWE Group Sustainability
Report 2013/2014.

Organic Products
The various organic product ranges oﬀered by the sales lines of REWE Group all performed well
during the reporting period. These gains were reﬂected in both the number of products and the
percentage within the assortment. This positive trend in organic farming can also be seen across
Germany: The percentage of organic products in Germany was 4.8 per cent in 2016. For food
retailing overall, the ﬁgure rose by 14.6 per cent from 2015 to 2016 (German Alliance of Organic
Farming: organic sector 2017).

REWE
REWE Bio replaced Füllhorn as REWE’s organic store brand in 2013. The product range has been
continuously expanded since then. During the reporting period, the number of items was markedly
increased once again, from about 200 products in 2014 to more than 500 in 2016 (average during
the entire year). As a result, REWE Bio products made up about 4.2 per cent of the assortment in
2016. The total rose to 5.7 per cent when the organic products of branded manufacturers are
included. As measured on sales value, revenue rose by more than 30 per cent in 2016 compared
with 2014.

PENNY
At PENNY, the Naturgut brand replaced the organic store brand B!O in 2014. With Naturgut, PENNY
unites regional, vegetarian and organic products under one brand name. The Naturgut assortment
performed well during the reporting period. The share of organic products in the entire range rose
from about 1.6 per cent in 2014 to 2.3 per cent in 2016, a jump of 40 per cent. For fruit and
vegetables, the share fell from about 7 per cent in 2014 to 6.6 per cent in 2015. But it later climbed
to 7.3 per cent, an increase that reﬂects the introduction of Naturgut Bio-Helden (organic heroes).
In April 2016, PENNY introduced the Naturgut Bio-Helden as a way to boost organic farming. The
brand comprises organic fruit and vegetables that have minor ﬂaws in their shape or skin. Such
problems are more common with organic products. But they do not reduce the quality of the
products in any way. In the past, farmers have been unable to sell this part of their harvest via food
retailers. Instead, they marketed the products to industry at comparatively lower prices. Or they
simply destroyed them. The Naturgut Bio-Helden are not packed in any special way or sold at a
lower price. They are simply a ﬁxed part of the organic product range oﬀered by PENNY stores. By
selling these products, PENNY plays an active role in the ﬁght against food waste in the upstream
production stage. Organic farmers can sell a greater amount of the crops that they produced with so
much hard work through retailers and strengthen their economic base in the process. At the same
time, consumers are being successfully shown that products with outer blemishes can still be
perfect in terms of taste and quality. The positive sales ﬁgures demonstrate the success of the
concept and its high acceptance among customers: Since the Bio-Helden were launched, the sold
volume in the corresponding product category has risen by 12 per cent compared with the previous
year (see the chapter on Bio-Helden in the magazine).

toom Baumarkt DIY stores
toom Baumarkt DIY stores have been selling organic-certiﬁed store-brand products for kitchen
gardens since 2014. These products include peat-free soils certiﬁed by the Bio-Grünstempel
(organic green seal), organic fertiliser, organic herbs and organic vegetables. The assortment
comprised 128 products in 2016.

TEMMA

With TEMMA, REWE Group is applying a successful organic store concept. In addition to more than
5,000 organic products, these organic specialist stores have culinary oﬀerings. Nine TEMMA stores
are currently in operation, primarily in the Cologne/Düsseldorf metropolitan areas, the Rhine-Main
Region of central Germany, Hamburg and Berlin.

REWE Group in Austria
With the creation of Ja! Natürlich in 1994, REWE International AG became a pacesetter in Austria.
Today, the organic brand generates more than 90 per cent of revenue produced by organic
products. PENNY Austria sells organic products under the store brand Echt B!O. The strategic goal
of REWE Group in Austria is to produce above-average growth of the organic assortment in
comparison with conventional products. This object was markedly exceeded during the reporting
period: Revenue generated by organic products at REWE International AG rose by 22 per cent from
2014 to 2016. The main reason for the huge jump was the inclusion of products from Alnatura, a
Germany-based chain of organic supermarkets.

Biodiversity
GRI 304: Biodiversity

Management Approach (GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)
REWE Group is a trade and tourism company whose business operations have a broad impact on
biodiversity. In addition to direct eﬀects on the company’s business locations and the transport of
goods, the key areas are primarily the upstream and downstream stages of the value chain. The
impact here is created by the non-sustainable use of natural ecosystems in such areas as the mining
of natural resources, the manufacture of products and activities for tourists.
In the Guideline for Sustainable Business Practises, REWE Group has made a ﬁrm commitment to
preserving and protecting natural ecosystems. It has also endorsed the objectives of the UN
Convention on Biological Diversity. In addition, as part of an initiative called Biodiversity in Good
Company REWE Group has pledged to integrate protection and sustainable use of biodiversity into
the company’s sustainability management. During the reporting period, a biodiversity guideline was
developed for the purpose of establishing a holistic biodiversity management system in the entire
company.
Maintaining biodiversity is an important criterion used to design more sustainable product ranges.
This is particularly the case for store brands. The reason: REWE Group has the most leverage to
bring about change here. Biodiversity criteria can be addressed through systems of standards like
Bio, the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), UTZ, the Rainforest Alliance and the Marine Stewardship
Council (MSC). They are also used in the guidelines that REWE Group has drawn up for such raw
materials as palm oil, ﬁsh and cocoa. Impacts on biodiversity are examined during product-related
analysis conducted in the PRO PLANET programme as well. As a result, negative impacts can be
identiﬁed and steps taken to reduce or eliminate them (for a detailed description of these
instruments, see GRI 204: Procurement Practices).
REWE Group works in alliances to advance biodiversity with the help of partners. In one aspect of
this work, the company carries out projects designed to promote biodiversity in agriculture with the
help of a strategic partner, the German environmental organisation NABU. This collaborative work
includes the PRO PLANET apple project that aims to increase the biodiversity of apple orchards.

GRI 304-2: Signiﬁcant impacts of activities, products,
and services on biodiversity
REWE Group’s store-brand production is the area where the company has its greatest opportunity to
protect biodiversity. The following projects illustrate the focal points of the company’s activities
during the reporting period. Progress and impacts are evaluated on a project basis and described
within the context of the projects being presented.

PRO PLANET Apple Project
This project is being conducted jointly with the German environmental organisation NABU. Its goal is
to increase the biodiversity of apple orchards by forming an alliance between farmers and the

environmental protection. Since the project was launched, the number of participating apple
farmers has increased to well more than 250. The project has been successfully conducted for
several years now. In 2016, it won the German CSR Award in the category of Model Collaboration
Between a Company and NGOs/NPOs.
The project is having a broad range of positive eﬀects: In 2016, 475 (2015: 1,831) trees and shrubs
were planted, and 268 (2015: 179) old fruit trees were preserved. Nearly 30 hectares (2015:
25 hectares) of ﬂowering strips and wide-ranging forms of structural enhancements like dry stone
walls and small bodies of water were added. Another focus of this work is bees. A wild-bee
monitoring programme initiated in 2013 found that the types of bees had grown signiﬁcantly in
orchards. Compared with 2010, the types had increased by about 50 per cent from 56 to 84,
including eight (2010: ﬁve) endangered species. The wide range of nesting aids and speciesprotection measures for birds, bats and insects are also having a positive impact. In 2016, a record
number of 16 kestrel breeding pairs were counted in the southern Rhineland region.
In 2015, the measures were monitored by the University of Bonn: the measures were evaluated in a
point-based system that weighed their suitability for promoting biodiversity. In 2016, pilot projects in
vegetable and potato farming were planned and conducted on the basis of the evaluations. The
objective is to integrate additional cultures into biodiversity projects. The project is to be expanded
in 2017.

Projects in Banana-Growing Regions
Since 2008, REWE Group has been striving to improve the environmental and social conditions of
banana farming in Central America. Working with the banana producer Chiquita and the German
Corporation for International Cooperation (GIZ), REWE Group conducted the Tropical Project in
banana-growing regions of Panama from 2009 to 2013. In addition to environmental protection
measures, the project focused on winning the support of the local population. Thanks to
environmental training and improved economic outlooks, members of the local population were
taught to use valuable ecosystems more carefully and to maintain biodiversity over the long term.
The project’s volume totalled 1.2 million euros.
As a result of the positive results, the Tropical Project was expanded to other banana-growing areas,
for example Costa Rica. More than 1 million euros were provided for this eﬀort by the REWE Group
Central America Fund – or banana fund – from 2013 to 2016. The fund is designed for local
organisations whose project ideas compete to win the ﬁnancial support. The GIZ coordinates the
project applications and monitors local project implementation. The funding is approved by a board
of trustees on which representatives of Chiquita, Dole, Fyﬀes, Caritas and REWE Group serve.
The measures are complemented by strict production requirements. All farms that grow bananas to
be sold by the sales lines of REWE Group in Germany must be certiﬁed by the Rainforest Alliance or
according to Bio guidelines to ensure that social standards are followed and to keep negative
environmental impacts to a minimum. The bananas of the store brand “REWE Beste Wahl” also have
been awarded the PRO PLANET label of REWE Group. As a result, they also meet sustainability
criteria that exceed the requirements of the Rainforest Alliance.

The Environmental Protection Programme “Blooming Austria”
In a project called “Blühendes Österreich” (Blooming Austria), REWE International AG began in
2014 to work with the nature protection organisation BirdLife Österreich to create environmental
habitats. The initiative provides funding for use in preserving and maintaining endangered natural
areas and extensive agricultural sites as well as projects for environmental and sustainability
training, thus promoting domestic biodiversity. The aim is to protect a total of 1,000 hectares of
endangered environmental areas by 2020. In 2016, 325 hectares were maintained, and about
150,000 euros in premiums were paid to the 113 participating farms.
In 2015, REWE International AG converted the initiative into a charitable private foundation. As an

independent organisation with its own staﬀ and clearly regulated ﬁnancing, the foundation
represents a long-term commitment and credibility to customers. The foundation’s ﬁnancing and
project activities have been linked to certain products. The foundation receives one cent from every
sold product in the store brands “Da komm ich her” (I’m from Here) (available at BILLA, MERKUR,
ADEG and AGM), “immer grün” (always green) (MERKUR), bigood (BIPA) and “Ich bin Österreich” (I
Am Austria) (PENNY). As a result, customers of the trade companies are actively integrated into
project support. In addition, conscious buying decisions are encouraged. The foundation’s budget
totals about one million euros. The Stiftung Blühendes Österreich has been evaluating and reviewing
activities conducted from 2014 to 2016 with BirdLife Österreich. The results will ﬂow into strategic
planning for 2017–2021. The process was scheduled to be completed in June 2017.

Peat-Free Soils
To harvest peat, centuries-old moors were and are drained. The process destroys the habitat of
animals and plants. It also releases the carbon trapped in the moors as climate-killing CO2 . For this
reason, toom Baumarkt DIY stores became the ﬁrst German DIY store chain in 2016 to decide to
convert its entire line of soils, both store brands and branded products, to peat-free alternatives by
no later than 2025. By spring 2016, the store-brand assortment of peat-free soils had been
expanded to ﬁve products. The peat-free soil bears the PRO PLANET label and the organic seal BioGrünstempel®. In addition to expanding the number of peat-free products, toom Baumarkt DIY
stores will gradually increase the amount of peat-replacement materials from renewable resources
in all soils they sell. In taking these steps, toom Baumarkt DIY stores is ﬁghting climate change and
fostering biodiversity. The REWE and PENNY sales lines have also added peat-free and peatreduced alternatives to their season range of soils.

Glyphosate
Glyphosate, the most widely used pesticide in farming around the world, is the target of continuous
criticism. A widely read study done by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)
concluded in 2015 that glyphosate was probably carcinogenic to humans. The improper use of the
pesticide can also pose a threat to the environment, particularly for bodies of water and the
organisms that live in them.
In light of this risk to humans and the environment, toom Baumarkt DIY stores became Germany’s
ﬁrst DIY store chain in 2015 to drop products containing glyphosate from its product range. The
company took this decision even though it was generating annual revenue of 2.1 million euros
(2014) with this pesticide. By the end of 2013, toom Baumarkt DIY stores had removed about
60 per cent of products containing glyphosate from its assortment.

Environmental Standards in the Supply Chain
GRI 308: Supplier Environmental Assessment

Management Approach (GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)
REWE Group obtains a broad range of products and product components from sources located
inside and outside Germany. To improve the environmental impact along the supply chain, REWE
Group considers observance of environmental standards when it selects its suppliers and business
partners. It also works with its suppliers and business partners to make supply chains more
transparent and production more environmentally conscious. With the Guideline for Sustainable
Business Practices, REWE Group has formulated the principles of its business relationships. Its
environmental principles include:

●

Prudent use of such resources as land, air, water and natural raw materials,

●

Protection and preservation of natural ecosystems and biodiversity as well as

●

Avoidance and reduction of environmental risks.

The principles apply both to the company’s own business processes and to those of REWE Group’s
business partners and suppliers. REWE Group reserves the right to apply sanctions when the values
contained in the guidelines are deliberately and ﬂagrantly breached.
To identify signiﬁcant environmental impacts and to take appropriate steps in product supply chains
that, on occasion, can be both complex and global, REWE Group has set up a strategic process that
bundles the various strategies related to the pillar of Green Products (see the Management
Approach Green Products). In 2016, REWE Group broadly expanded its eﬀorts to assess risks
within this framework. As a result, all relevant product groups are now covered. The results of this
risk assessment are used to develop measures based on the particular risk for the various product
groups. As part of this work, REWE Group plans to test an environmental management programme
for non-food factories.
In addition, REWE Group completed the pilot phase of a self-assessment tool for suppliers during the
reporting period. The supplier questionnaire developed by REWE Group was tested by store-brand
suppliers in a range of product groups and validated by audits. The results ﬂow into the reﬁnement
of supplier management.
When it implements improvements, REWE Group applies internationally recognised standards like
the GOTS logo for sustainable textiles or FSC® and PEFC™ certiﬁcation for sustainable forest
management. REWE Group also plays an active role in platforms like the Forum for Sustainable Palm
Oil and the German Initiative on Sustainable Cocoa as a way of reﬁning standards and initiating
industry-wide improvements in environmental conditions (see GRI 204: Procurement Practices).

GRI 308-2: Negative environmental impacts in the
supply chain and actions taken
Pesticide Use in Conventional Fruit and Vegetable Farming

REWE Group has set the goal of continuously reducing the amount of pesticides used in the
conventional cultivation of fruit and vegetables. In this eﬀort, REWE Group works with farmers,
NGOs and scientiﬁc experts to develop solutions that have the lowest-possible impact on the
environment and assure production and yield certainty for farmers. REWE Group has drawn up a
black list that contains substances that farmers may not use. The list was signiﬁcantly expanded
during the reporting period. REWE Group regularly monitors the progress being made in its
pesticide-reduction programme. As part of this work, REWE Group has commissioned the
environmental group GLOBAL 2000 to prepare an annual pesticide-impact report since 2009. This
report includes three impact indices based on a deﬁned methodology. The results show that a
reduction in the indices has occurred since the base year of 2009. In 2016, two indices rose as a
result of adjustments made to thresholds (the status report 8 of chemical pesticides an be
downloaded here.

Detox Programme for Safe Textiles
To improve the environmental impact of the textile supply chain, REWE Group joined Greenpeace’s
detox campaign in 2014. In addition, it has set up a related programme for products with REWE
Group as the production company in the product groups clothing, shoes and household textiles. The
goal is to create safe textile production that eliminates hazardous chemicals by 2020. To achieve
this objective, REWE Group is working with its suppliers to systematically remove hazardous
chemicals from textile production.
Chemicals are primarily used in textile production during so-called wet processes that involve
dyeing, bleaching and washing. The health of factory workers can be endangered when hazardous
substances are used in these production steps. In addition, bodies of water and other ecosystems
can be negatively impacted if chemicals contained in wastewater enter the environment.
As part of the implementation of the detox programme, a roadmap pointing the way to 2020 was
approved in 2014. The current status of the roadmap is documented in annual progress reports (the
progress reports can be downloaded here: Progress report 2015, Progress report 2016). REWE
Group’s strategy comprises three elements:
1. Chemical Management
Chemical management includes the continuous development of requirements for suppliers and
products. REWE Group has developed the following instruments to perform this work:

●

The Manufacturing Restricted Substances List (MRSL) contains chemicals that REWE Group has
rated as hazardous and that may not be used in production operations. It also includes thresholds,
testing methodologies and schedules for eliminating the chemicals. The MRSL is updated
annually. The methods used to perform the updating were enhanced in 2016 as well. As part of a
new screening process, 35 new substances were rated as hazardous and added to the MRSL. The
new MRSL 2.0 was released in January 2017 (more information on the testing methodology is
available here the current MRSL can be downloaded here).

●

REWE Group has conducted ﬁve pilot projects in which suppliers and wet-process factories were
assisted in their eﬀorts to eliminate selected chemicals. The ﬁfth project is currently being
implemented. The results are available to other suppliers as case studies.

●

A ban on the hazardous chemical groups polyﬂuorinated and perﬂuorinated chemicals (PFCs),
alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEOS) and alkylphenols (APs) took eﬀect on 31 December 2016.
Information about these chemicals was provided to the suppliers in the form of chemical fact
sheets. REWE Group has also conducted training about the substitution of these chemicals.

●

Wastewater tests are used to determine the current status of wet-process factories and to verify
whether substitutions have been made. As a way of initiating improvements, REWE Group helps
factories introduce systematic chemical management.

2. Supplier Management

An important pre-condition for the success of the detox programme is collaboration along the supply
chain. This is necessary in particular because hazardous chemicals are generally used by the
upstream suppliers of REWE Group’s direct business partners and not the direct business partners
themselves. For this reason, supplier management aims to create close relationships with strategic
suppliers and to gain them as partners for the detox programme. REWE Group has already reached
an important goal: All suppliers in the supply chain have committed themselves to the detox
programme. REWE Group carried out the following measures during the reporting period:

●

In the ﬁrst step, REWE Group developed a brochure containing the most important information
and had it translated into four languages.

●

In 2015 and 2016, REWE Group organised a number of meetings, events and workshops,
including a supplier conference that was held in August 2015 in Bangkok.

●

REWE Group has developed a manual for suppliers. This supplier tool kit contains the most
important information related to the implementation of the detox programme.

●

A capacity-building programme was developed for wet-process factories. This programme is
designed to enable the factories to adapt their chemical management practises to the detox
requirements. For this purpose, local advisory structures are to be set up in China and Bangladesh
to provide practical guidance to the factories. Experts will be trained as part of this work with local
organisations, and a tailored training programme will be developed. The programme will enter the
pilot phase in 2017. During this eﬀort, 110 producers will undergo training and be advised. REWE
Group is working with the German Corporation for International Cooperation and the Tchibo
company as part of this eﬀort.

●

To ensure that the detox programme is carried out eﬀectively, REWE Group and its strategic
suppliers are jointly creating a pool of wet-process factories with which they are intensely working
to reach the detox goals.

●

The detox requirements are a binding stipulation in the business agreements reached with
suppliers. Suppliers must sign the detox commitment, a pledge in which they are required to
eliminate hazardous chemicals and to list wet production sites in the supply chain that must also
agree to adhere to the detox commitment. Suppliers must provide valid water test reports to
document their successful substitution work and their observance of pre-deﬁned thresholds.
These reports must be posted on the publicly accessible IPE platform. The supplier must present
this proof before products may be shipped. If these requirements are not met, an action plan to
eliminate the causes will be developed.

3. Stakeholder Commitment
Given the nature of complex supply chains and the variety of chemicals being used, a joint approach
to the issue of safer textile production is imperative. REWE Group plays an active role in the dialogue
with stakeholders on a number of diﬀerent levels:

●

It talks about its experiences and describes best practices in discussions with other retailers and
textile companies.

●

In its position in the Chemicals Working Group of the Alliance for Sustainable Textiles, REWE
Group is working to reﬁne standards.

●

In cooperation with testing institutions, tests are being conducted to determine whether the
thresholds set for chemicals reﬂect the current state of technology.

●

REWE Group continuously evaluates the data from wastewater tests to track overall progress in
the work to substitute hazardous chemicals and publicly releases this analysis as discharge data
reports.

●

To transparently inform stakeholders, REWE Group releases an annual detox progress report and
posts information on the REWE Group’s website (the progress reports can be downloaded here:
Progress report 2015, Progress report 2016).

4. Closed Loop

As part of its detox commitment, REWE Group is developing measures to promote closed loops in
textiles. The company took the following steps in this eﬀort during the reporting period:

●

Completion of an academic study on the topic of closed loops in cooperation with Hong Kong
University of Science and Technology.

●

For this reason, REWE Group decided in 2016 to establish a textile return system in future.

●

Assortments of products with recycle ﬁbres.

●

Customer communications on the topics of environmentally conscious washing and upcycling.

Social Standards in the Supply Chain
GRI 414: Supplier Social Assessment
GRI 412: Human Rights Assessment

Combined Management Approach (GRI 103-1, 103-2,
103-3)
REWE Group obtains a large number of products and product components through supply chains
that extend across several countries. The company’s goal is to work together with business partners
and suppliers to implement binding standards that apply to their joint supply chain and to further
improve labour and social standards in production operations.
The Guideline for Sustainable Business Practices of REWE Group applies to all business
relationships. The guideline is based on the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the
conventions of the International Labour Association (ILO). It addresses such issues as a ban on
forced labour and exploitative child labour practises as well as fair employee policies. REWE Group
reserves the right to apply sanctions when the principles contained in the guideline are deliberately
and ﬂagrantly breached.
In 2008, REWE Group joined the Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI), an alliance of
companies that are committed to improving labour and social standards in risk countries. To achieve
this goal, BSCI members have developed the BSCI code of conduct. This code was revised in 2014.
Its requirements include a renunciation of exploitative child and forced labour practises as well as
freedom of association and collective bargaining.

The issue of social compliance is put into practise by the Department of Sustainable Products in
close cooperation with the departments responsible for purchasing and assortment composition.
The social compliance process develops measures on the basis of an analysis of social risks. It also
uses a monitoring system to observe and evaluate them. The ﬁndings then ﬂow back into the further
development of social compliance activities. As a result, other product groups and links in the
supply chain are continuously added. In 2016, REWE Group markedly expanded its eﬀort to identify
and systemise risks (for more information about risk analysis, see the overarching Management
Approach Green Products).
In Asia, the sourcing oﬃce REWE Far East (RFE) is responsible for purchasing food and non-food
products. As a result, it plays a key role in the improvement of working conditions in the supply

chain. The Corporate Responsibility Department of the RFE maintains direct contact with suppliers
and assists with the social compliance process on site.
A key aspect of the work to implement improvements is the information that suppliers provide
themselves. In 2016, the pilot phase of a self-assessment tool for suppliers (food/non-food) was
completed. The questionnaire developed by REWE Group was tested by store-brand suppliers in a
range of product groups and validated by audits. The results ﬂow into the reﬁnement of supplier
management.

GRI 414-2: Negative social impacts in the supply chain
and actions taken
In general, REWE Group has developed three diﬀerent approaches to social impacts in the supply
chain. Measures are carried out within each approach:

1. Boosting the Percentage of Socially Audited Production Sites from Risk
Countries
REWE Group purchases food and non-food products through the combine’s own trading company
REWE Far East (RFE) or through other importers. REWE Group obtains non-food products, including
household goods and textiles, primarily from Asian countries. The BSCI has rated many of these
countries as risk countries in terms of compliance with labour and social standards (the complete
list of BSCI risk countries can be downloaded here).
Suppliers and production sites in risk countries are required to present conﬁrmation of a valid social
audit. Recognised social audits include those based on the BSCI standard or the SA8000 standard.
SMETA audits of the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange were added in 2017. Textile production sites in
Bangladesh must also undergo an inspection based on the Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building
Safety. To continue improving labour and social standards, REWE Group documents the audit
results, tracks improvements and urges production sites and suppliers to attend BSCI training
courses.
In recent years, REWE Group has focused its social compliance activities on non-food suppliers
because a large number of them – including textiles – are based in BSCI risk countries. By 2015, a
nearly complete coverage rate for socially audited production sites was achieved, with 99.4 per cent
of revenue of REWE Far East (RFE) being generated with non-food suppliers. About 95 per cent of
the audit results received a grade of C or better in the BSCI rating system. The results show that
suppliers and production sites are working to improve social standards and that the assistance and
support provided by REWE Group and the RFE staﬀ in particular are paying oﬀ.
In 2016, this eﬀort was expanded to suppliers of store-brand food products in risk countries. The
aim is to integrate all production sites of non-food and store-brand food providers in risk countries
into REWE Group’s social compliance process. The food category covers all foods with the exception
of ultra-fresh products like fruits, vegetables, meat and sausages. With the addition of food
producers, data collection for the share of audited production sites was modiﬁed. The calculation is
now done on the basis of production sites instead of revenue percentage. In addition to suppliers of
REWE Far East, it tracks all other importers in risk countries. The new data were collected for the
ﬁrst time in 2016. The revenue percentage of audited production sites in the non-food area was
collected for the last time in 2015.

2. Improving Social Standards in the Supply Chains of Raw Materials
REWE Group analyses the risks of violation of social and labour standards in the supply chains of
critical raw materials. If social risks are identiﬁed, REWE Group will deﬁne requirements in such
documents as guidelines or within the context of the PRO PLANET process. It implements them
through audits and certiﬁcations, in industry initiatives or in local projects. Examples of risk-related
raw materials include cocoa, palm oil, bananas, pineapple, hazelnuts and cotton (for more
information, see GRI 204: Procurement Practices).
Since 2013, REWE Group has required suppliers of primary fruit and vegetable products to pledge
that they will pay statutory, negotiated or contractually set wages within the context of their national
code of laws as part of the framework agreement on compliance with the core labour standards of
the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The suppliers must also demonstrate this compliance to
the company. The suppliers are also required to ensure that their own suppliers also meet these
standards. All producers of fruit and vegetable products must demonstrate that they meet the
requirements cited above by undergoing external audits (such as the GLOBALG.A.P Risk
Assessment on Social Practice (GRASP), SA8000, Sustainable Agriculture Network (SAN), BSCI).
Compliance with these requirements is checked during spot audits.
In June 2010, REWE International AG began to require PRO PLANET suppliers of fruit, vegetables
and eggs to have the social aspects of their operations evaluatedon the basis of GRASP standards.
All producers (with the exception of family-run operations) undergo GRASP audits.
In the reporting period, REWE Group conducted the following projects to improve social standards in
the supply chains of raw materials, among other things:
Cocoa
As a charter member of the multi-stakeholder German Initiative on Sustainable Cocoa, REWE Group
joins other companies in supporting the PRO-PLANTEURS project, a joint, ﬁve-year cocoa
programme being conducted in Côte d’Ivoire. The project strives to professionalise the work of
20,000 cocoa farmers, their families and producer organisations. The aim is to improve the lives of
the families by boosting incomes and upgrading diets. The project is aimed in particular at women
and young farmers with the goal of increasing the appeal of cocoa farming.
Hazelnuts
The largest share of hazelnuts consumed around the world comes from the Turkish cultivation region
on the Black Sea. Each year, thousands of migrant workers travel to the region to harvest the crop.
The normal conditions of the hazel nut farms include poor housing and child labour. Working with
the humanitarian organisation Support to Life (STL), REWE Group is striving to improve the situation
of the migrant workers. To achieve this, REWE Group also uses a UTZ certiﬁcation process for
hazelnut production. The standard deﬁnes minimal requirements for migrant workers’ health and
safety, their rights, living conditions and accommodations. It also calls for training programmes. The
standard prohibits child labour as well. Serving as the main partner, REWE Group has joined forces
with other companies to play a major role in the development of the UTZ hazelnut standard.
Products meeting this standard are also awarded the PRO PLANET label.

3. Reﬁning Social and Labour Standards
REWE Group is actively working to upgrade social and labour standards. In the process, the
company works intensely with standards organisations. Examples in the reporting period included
the development of the UTZ standard for hazelnuts, Rainforest Alliance Plus and the creation of the
Fairtrade programme for supplies of individual raw materials. REWE Group also lobbied for the
addition of criteria of the International Labour Organization (ILO) to the standard of the Marine

Stewardship Council (MSC).

GRI 412: Employee training on human rights policies
or procedures
Employees of REWE Group who work in food, near-food and non-food purchasing in Germany and at
REWE Far East receive regular training about relevant labour and social standards issues. This
ensures that the deﬁned social standards, including the demand for social audits, are considered in
the selection of suppliers and in the purchasing process. Most recently, purchasing employees in
food and near-food received training once again about the social compliance requirements of REWE
Group at the end of 2016.

Customer Health and Safety
GRI 416: Customer Health and Safety

Management Approach (GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)
To ensure the quality and safety of its products, REWE Group has introduced a comprehensive,
cross-stage quality assurance system that extends along the entire value chain in its core business
of trade. The system comprises such preventive measures as the preparation of product guidelines,
systematic issue monitoring, controls, audits and consumer tips about the proper way to use
products at home. A system of key performance indicators introduced in 2010 makes compliance
with legal and company quality standards more measurable and transparent. The key performance
indicators, including the results of internal microbiological analyses or rates of complaints, are
prepared quarterly, evaluated and presented in the management report of REWE Group’s quality
management.
A special focal point of quality management is store-brand products: The combine deﬁnes special
requirements for the products and suppliers to meet in all steps along the value chain – from raw
materials and recipes to labelling and packaging. These speciﬁcations form the basis for regular
spot checks conducted by independent accredited testing institutes. The spot checks are
determined on the basis of supplier and product risk. Foods like fresh fruit and vegetables are tested
more frequently than products like salt and sugar. For fruit and vegetables, the combine has an
annual “Status Report on Chemical Pesticides” prepared for Germany. The reports have been
compiled and released by the Austrian environmental organisation GLOBAL 2000 since 2009.
In addition to the products themselves, other links in the value chain are examined: All store brand
suppliers in the food area must be certiﬁed according to the internationally recognised standard IFS
Food or the standard of the British Retail Consortium (BRC). Furthermore, REWE Group conducts
additional supplier audits on the basis of a risk analysis. This involves evaluating a number of key
performance indicators like dissatisfaction with products, customer complaints and the risk
classiﬁcation of the product group. Manufacturers and suppliers who fail to meet REWE Group’s
quality standards are asked to remedy the situation. Otherwise, they face the possibility of being
delisted.
Annual audits of the company’s warehouses are conducted by internal auditors as well as by
independent external organisations. All areas of the warehouse are included in these audits, from
goods receipt to transport to stores. In addition, special audits that focus on the implementation of
quality guidelines for fruit and vegetables are conducted in warehouses.
Regular internal and external inspections are also conducted in REWE Group’s food stores. The
external inspections are conducted on the basis of checklists prepared by QS GmbH, Bonn. The lists
focus on meat, meat products, fruit, vegetables and potatoes. Products made in REWE stores
themselves, including ground meat (at the service counter) or fruit and convenience products are
subject to microbiological monitoring. These samples are examined by independent laboratories.

Crisis and Safety Management at DER Touristik

The Department of Crisis and Safety Management at DER Touristik is responsible for traveller wellbeing in emergency situations. During crises like natural disasters, accidents or terrorist attacks,
Help Teams go into action. The specially trained team members take care of the safety of and
provisions for travellers and employees at the particular site. They provide support to individuals and
organise transportation to hospitals, alternative hotels and return trips to home if necessary. To
quickly reach mission locations, the Help Teams are based at a number of diﬀerent places, including
Bangkok, Miami and Costa Rica.
The crisis and safety management oﬃce is based at the headquarters of DER Touristik in Frankfurt.
As part of crisis-prevention work, employees there monitor developments in travel regions around
the clock. If one of the team’s early-warning systems raises an alarm, steps can be quickly taken to
manage the crisis. These steps include crisis hotlines for direct contact with aﬀected individuals and
close working relationships with destination agencies, government authorities, airlines and airports.
Another focus is creating an up-to-date and qualiﬁed ﬂow of information for all aﬀected individuals
and the general public.
Continuous advanced training of relevant employees is another important aspect of crisis
management. This involves training for Help Team members and for employees of travel agencies.
The training programme won the Willy Scharnow Award for innovative advanced training concepts in
2009. In 2016, the programme comprised 27 crisis and safety training courses that were developed
individually for sales. The programme is scheduled to be expanded even more in 2017.
A sharp rise in crisis situations occurred in 2016. The crisis management work involved 579 crisis
events – nearly 100 more than the previous year. In response to the increased need, DER Touristik
doubled the number of Help Team members from 36 to 72 during the reporting period. It plans to
raise the total to 100 during 2017.

GRI 416-1: Assessment of the health and safety
impacts of product and service categories

GRI 416-2: Incidents of non-compliance concerning
the health and safety impacts of products and services,
by type of consequences
In 2015, nine public recalls of store-brand products were conducted in Germany and Austria. Four of
the recalls involved foreign objects. Each recall aﬀected a diﬀerent product. Reviews of the cases
concluded that each was an isolated incident. No trend among products or producers could be

found. A separate recall involved the suspected presence of listeria in soft cheese. Two products
were recalled because the label failed to include an allergen, and two recalls were initiated because
of microbiological deviations.
Eleven public recalls involving store-brand products occurred in 2016. Six recalls involved foreign
objects. Three other products were recalled because of microbiological deviations. Two other
products were recalled because of label problems – in one case, an allergen was not listed. In the
other one, an item was packed in the wrong package.
In every case, customers were able to return the product and get their money back.

Promoting Sustainable Consumption
GRI 417: Marketing and Labeling

Management Approach (GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)
Promoting the use of sustainable products and services is an important part of REWE Group’s
sustainability strategy. To make more sustainable product ranges a success, their social and
environmental added value must be communicated to consumers in an understandable and credible
manner. Consideration must also be given to the fact that other criteria like price, quality and
freshness go into purchasing decisions as well. Retail plays an important intermediary part in this
context. Without adequate demand and a willingness to pay on the part of the customer, responsible
providers can run into ﬁnancial diﬃculties. And without a broad range of sustainable products,
consumers are unable to act in an ethically responsible way. For this reason, REWE Group has
committed itself to moving sustainability from a niche role and rather incorporating it as part of the
mass market.
As part of its sustainability communication eﬀort, REWE Group takes a number of diﬀerent steps
that are designed to facilitate informed purchasing decisions and to excite consumers about more
sustainable products and services. The key principles of communications are credibility,
transparency and messages aimed at speciﬁc target groups.

Increasing Awareness of Sustainability
REWE Group works to promote sustainable consumption and to put an end to its “niche existence”.
Part of this eﬀort involves getting consumers excited about sustainability and making them aware of
sustainability issues in their everyday lives.

Sustainability Weeks
One key aspect of this eﬀort is REWE Group’s Sustainability Weeks. During a deﬁned campaign
period, the company’s various sales lines explore the issue of more sustainable consumption with
their customers within the context of an overarching societal topic like conscious diets, social
involvement and regionality. One ﬁxed part of Sustainability Weeks is participatory activities that
encourage people to take action and that frequently bring abstract sustainability topics to life by
providing speciﬁc examples. In addition, the company increases the advertising of the more
sustainable products in the sales lines’ product ranges, including branded products. In the process,
REWE Group creates awareness about sustainability in purchasing decisions and promotes
responsible consumption among its customers. In 2016, REWE and PENNY each conducted three
Sustainability Weeks, just as they did in 2015. As part of its Sustainability Weeks, DER Touristik
explained biodiversity to its customers. toom Baumarkt DIY stores focused on biodiversity, climate
protection and inclusion during the reporting period. At REWE Group in Austria, the annual
Sustainability Weeks were conducted under the motto of “Gemeinsam an morgen denken” (Thinking
Together About Tomorrow).

German Sustainability Award
Each year, REWE Group and the sustainability foundation Stiftung Deutscher Nachhaltigkeitspreis

e.V. present the German Sustainability Award in the category Germany’s Most Sustainable Products
(Food and Non-Food). In this competition, consumers have an opportunity to vote on the most
sustainable branded products. The producers of branded products can compete for this award. In
2016, the competition was opened to all listed suppliers of REWE Group for the ﬁrst time. In a shortlisting process, the sustainable contribution of the selected products is reviewed by the Centre on
Sustainable Consumption and Production in Wuppertal, Germany. The products are then nominated
for the online voting competition by the jury of the German Sustainability Award.
The winners during the reporting period were:

●

Food category: BIONADE elderberry soft drink (2016); iglo cream spinach (2015)

●

Non-food category: Frosch citrus shower and bathroom cleaner (2016); Omniﬂora Fairtrade roses
(2015)

Customer communications
The sales lines of REWE Group conduct sustainability-related communication activities to sensitise
consumers about its sustainability involvement and sustainable consumption. During the reporting
period, PENNY launched a sustainability campaign that featured the frog ﬁgure “Günter
Kastenforsch” invented by Janosch, a German author and illustrator of children’s book. Under the
motto of “grün sparen” (the Green Way to Save), “grün genießen” (the Green Way to Enjoy) and
“grün engagieren” (the Green Way to Get Involved), the cute sustainability ambassador provided
clear, down-to-earth information about the ways that sustainability beneﬁts the environment, society
and customers themselves.
REWE made regionality the focus of its national campaign in Germany. Customers were informed in
a widely broadcast TV ad. Regional suppliers were introduced on interactive website, and customers
were encouraged to upload their own regional recipes.

GRI 417-1 Requirements for product and service
information and labeling
The products of REWE Group are labelled in accordance with legal requirements regarding their
origin, composition and usage (including the expiration date). In addition to facts required by law,
REWE Group labels the sustainability aspects of its products and provides detailed information
about the origin of many of them.

Use of Sustainability Labels
With its PRO PLANET process, REWE Group has created a system that enables it to clearly and
transparently provide sustainability information on products. The PRO PLANET website includes
additional information about individual products that can be directly accessed by entering a
product-speciﬁc code on the label. The PRO PLANET label serves as a navigation system for
consumers (for an overview of these products in the assortment and a description of the PRO
PLANET process, see GRI 204: Procurement Practices).
In addition, REWE Group uses recognized external labels to mark its store brands and adds branded
products with these labels to its assortments. These labels include the Blauer Engel (Blue Angel),
Fairtrade, the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC®), the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest
Certiﬁcation Schemes (PEFC™), the Rainforest Alliance, the German Association of Non-Genetically
Modiﬁed Foods (VLOG), the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), the Aquaculture Stewardship
Council (ASC) and UTZ. Organic and regional products also have their own labels. Nearly all fresh
ﬁsh counters at REWE stores have been certiﬁed by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) since
2009 and by the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) since 2012.
To enable consumers to take informed buying decisions amid this maze of labels, REWE and PENNY

have posted the most important information about the labels and certiﬁcations that they use on their
websites (REWE;PENNY).
toom Baumarkt DIY stores worked with the consumer group Verbraucher Initiative e.V. to develop a
guideline for sustainability labels. The guideline is designed to provide customers with a map to
more sustainable purchases and provides information about recommended labels found on
products in the DIY store. The selection of labels is based on ratings by the consumer portal labelonline.de. The guideline is distributed in stores as a printed leaﬂet and can be downloaded here. For
its non-food products, REWE Group uses the TÜV Exklusiv seal that applies to the quality and safety
of products. Every product certiﬁed by the technical services company is given an individual ID
number that can be used to obtain additional information. In 2015, 348 products were awarded the
seal for the ﬁrst time. A total of 225 were added in 2016. By the end of 2016, 3,707 products had
been awarded the TÜV Exklusiv seal.
To provide travellers interested in sustainability with transparent decision-making assistance, DER
Touristik is working on a strategy to clearly label sustainable travel opportunities. As part of this
work, the number of labels used in the catalogues of the tour operator was reduced from 23 to one –
the sustainability seal Travelife. Travelife is an industry-wide, internationally recognised label that
rates such criteria as energy eﬃciency, waste avoidance and fair working conditions. The labelled
hotels use green power, pay the minimum wage to their employees and train them about child
protection. As part of the project Green Travel Transformation being conducted by the sustainability
initiative Futouris, DER Touristik is also helping to develop an industry-wide label for sustainable
travel opportunities that can be directly used in the information and booking system of tour
operators. DER Touristik plans to consider a larger number of labels under the uniform logo once
again in the future.

Transparency About Information on Origin
Many consumers want to know something about the origin of the products they buy. REWE Group
responds to this wish by taking such steps as highlighting the origin of its regional products and
having information about many products certiﬁed according to the criteria of the programme
Regionalfenster (Regional Window) (see, GRI 204: Procurement Practices).
As part of its Guideline for Fish, Crustacean and Shellﬁsh (formerly the Guideline for Purchasing
Sustainable Wild Fish), REWE Group introduced a tracking code for store-brand ﬁsh products in
2012. With this code, consumers can go to the websites of the REWE and PENNY sales lines and
learn about the supply chain of ﬁsh products. In addition, the ﬁrst aquaculture products can now be
tracked online all the way back to the farming region. More than 70 ﬁsh products now have the
tracking code. This represents a share of 85 per cent.
In 2014, the name of the actual production company began to be included on the store-brand
products sold by PENNY and REWE. This provides consumers with additional transparency about
the supply chain. REWE Group continues to be listed as the production company in only a few
exceptions, including the products of the brand Feine Welt (Fine World) that are made by small
suppliers.

GRI 417-3: Incidents of non-compliance concerning
marketing communications
As a matter of principle, REWE Group advertises its products and services in strict conformity with
legal requirements as well as with ethical and cultural standards. It expressly avoids the use of
sexist, discriminatory, political, pornographic, extremist and violence-glorifying advertising. Truth,
precision and transparency are the fundamental advertising principles employed by the company. In
addition, REWE Group adheres to its own company-wide code of conduct, regulations, guidelines
and rules laid down by national advertising boards. To succeed, communications of sustainability
issues require a signiﬁcant amount of credibility. In its Guideline for Sustainable Business

Practises, REWE Group expresses its explicit commitment to complying with applicable consumerprotection regulations and to employing appropriate sales, marketing and information practises in
communications with consumers. As a way of considering these factors in the advertising concepts,
the company’s ads are approved by the Sustainability Department before being published.
In the reporting period 2015/2016, no signiﬁcant violations were known.

Animal Welfare
Animal Welfare

Management Approach (GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)
Animal husbandry is a key branch of agricultural production. Animal-based products like meat and
eggs are ﬁxed parts of our diets as well. The ongoing public discussion about the issue of animal
welfare also demonstrates that consumers are placing an increasingly high priority on proper care of
farm animals.

Improving the Welfare of Farm Animals
In its Guideline for Sustainable Business Practises, REWE Group commits itself to following and
improving animal protection standards. It carries out this commitment as part of its sustainability
strategy. The company has been working for years to improve animal welfare, health and protection.
As part of this eﬀort, REWE Group develops programmes that are designed with speciﬁc animal
breeds in mind and that take the conditions of various value chains into consideration.
The programmes are carried out in PRO PLANET projects, among other places. In one such project,
the feeding and husbandry conditions for chicken and laying hens were improved. The company’s
work also focuses on the production of pork, poultry and rabbit meat as well as fresh milk. A key
focus of the company’s commitment to animal welfare involves painful procedures performed on
animals, including the castration of piglets and the trimming of laying hens’ beaks. REWE Group has
set challenging goals related to ending such practises. As it carries out its programmes, REWE Group
conducts an intense dialogue with relevant stakeholders, like suppliers, scientists and NGOs.

Animal Welfare Initiative
As a charter member of the Animal Welfare Initiative, REWE Group also works to improve industrywide animal welfare standards. This alliance of representatives from farming, the meat-packing
industry and food retail is striving to create a more animal-conscious form of meat production.
Participating companies from the German retail sector make a ﬁnancial contribution to the initiative.
They donate four cents (6.25 cents beginning on 1 January 2018) to the Animal Welfare Initiative for
each kilogram of pork and poultry they sell. These contributions will generate about
255 million euros in the next three years. As a result, around 85 million euros are currently available
each year to ﬁnance animal-welfare measures that extend beyond legal requirements. This ﬁgure
will rise to 130 million euros beginning in 2018. As a result of the participation of more than 3,000
farms, husbandry conditions for more than 255 million pigs, chickens and turkeys could be
improved. The initiative’s plans call for ﬁnancial resources to be increased to 100 million euros each
year to enable more pig farms to take part.

Mission Statement on Animal Husbandry of the Future
In 2015, REWE Group released its Mission Statement on Animal Husbandry of the Future, a position
paper that describes the overarching objectives of REWE Group in terms of more sustainable animal
husbandry. The mission statement outlines the range of requirements that sustainable agriculture
must address. In addition to animal welfare, these requirements comprise environmental and
climate protection, resource eﬃciency, food safety and eﬃciency. As part of this mission statement,

REWE Group formulated a canon of values for its commitment to animal welfare. This canon is
based on the “Five Freedoms” of responsible animal husbandry that were deﬁned by the Farm
Animal Welfare Council of the British Department for Environment, Food and Rural Aﬀairs:
1.

Freedom from hunger, thirst and malnutrition

2.

Freedom from discomfort

3.

Freedom from fear and distress

4.

Freedom from pain, injury or disease

5.

Freedom to express normal behaviour

The mission statement is designed to promote the enhancement of ongoing projects and
requirements. As part of this work, the company plans to issue guidelines about speciﬁc husbandry
and management systems that include speciﬁc requirements.
The complete mission statement can be downloaded here .
In December 2016, REWE International AG issued its own animal welfare guideline that outlines key
measures and areas of action in this area.
In addition, Germany and all other countries that serve as potential suppliers for animal source raw
materials have developed regulations governing livestock-management practices. REWE Group only
adds those partners who completely fulﬁl their home country’s regulations to the company’s supply
chain.

Animal Welfare at DER Touristik
As a responsible tour operator that is committed to sustainable activities, DER Touristik has made
the protection of nature and animals a high priority. In many holiday destinations, interaction with
animals is part of local entertainment activities. In order to make such tourist attractions possible,
wild animals are often seized from their natural habitats, held in captivity and forced to serve as
tourist attractions. The impact of such activities may not be obvious on ﬁrst glance for tourists.
DER Touristik believes that animal-friendly tourism is possible. Such practises include protecting
animals from abuse, preserving natural habitats and ensuring species-correct husbandry activities if
necessary. For this reason, the company primarily supports travel experiences that focus on
watching wild animals in their natural habitat.

Animal Protection Guideline
In November 2016, DER Touristik Central Europe issued an animal protection guideline that applies
to all related products of the tour operator brands and destination agencies as well as to all
purchased, oﬀered or conveyed services, including those provided by third parties. The company
guideline governs the approach to tourism products that include interaction with animals. Its goal is
to remove all oﬀerings in which animals are used to entertain tourists from the programme of DER
Touristik by 2020 if they do not comply with DER Touristik’s animal protection guideline. Where
possible, the entertainment programmes will be replaced with animal-friendly alternatives. The
company has also pledged to inform customers about the appropriate way to deal with animals and
about animal-friendly tourism opportunities. The implementation of the guideline was initiated at the
beginning of 2017. The requirements will be introduced step by step beginning with the winter
season 2017/2018. The focus of the ﬁrst phase will be elephants, predatory cats and marine
mammals. To ensure that the deﬁned animal protection criteria and recognised animal protection
standards are applied, the company plans to have the animal sites undergo an independent audit.
DER Touristik has joined forces with non-government organisations and other industry actors in an
eﬀort called the Proving Demand for Higher Welfare Elephant Venues Working Group. The objective
of this work is to increase demand for elephant-friendly touristic sites and to support the

development of consistent, transparent and high animal protection standards.

Indicator: Projects and Measures to Improve Animal Welfare
In the area of animal welfare, REWE Group is taking a number of steps that are based on the
individual species and the conditions of farm animal husbandry. The following section explores a few
selected projects involved in this work.

Rejection of Piglet Castration Without Anaesthesia
Boars, or non-castrated pigs, can develop a foul odour that permeates the meat after the animals
reach sexual maturity. For this reason, male piglets are castrated about seven days after birth,
usually without anaesthesia. REWE Group has set the goal of selling only fresh pork that comes from
pigs that were castrated with anaesthesia beginning in 2017. At the end of 2016, about 70 per cent
of the pork it sold met this requirement. The majority of farms that supply REWE Group have already
switched to alternative methods like castration with anaesthesia, boar fattening and immunization
against boar taint, or odour. Nonetheless, small farms in particular face some major challenges in
this work. To help to maintain small farm structures, REWE Group is working with suppliers to
develop economically viable ways to facilitate the conversion of these farms.

Rejection of Routine Shortening of Pigs’ Ring Tails
In conventional animal husbandry, the tails of most piglets are docked, or trimmed, within four days
after birth. This step is taken to prevent pigs from biting one another’s tails. Such actions can occur
when pigs are subjected to intense stress. If the ring tail is not docked and remains intact during the
animal’s life, this can be used as an indicator of humane husbandry conditions.
In 2016, REWE Group worked closely with both farmer associations in the German state of North
Rhine-Westphalia, the State Ministry of Agriculture and the State Chamber of Agriculture to conduct
a lighthouse project on the topic of ring tails. About 60 pig farms took part in it. During the project,
the farms did not trim the ring tails. Instead, they altered husbandry conditions by providing pigs
with rooting earth, hay or straw as well as open drinking sources. This approach provided additional
activity opportunities and helped to improve the animals’ health. Observation of the animals was
increased, and their feed was modiﬁed as well. As compensation for their work, the farmers were
paid 18 euros per animal and a one-time payment of 500 euros for more extensive examinations or
special consultations.

Rejection of Eggs from Caged Hens
The husbandry conditions of caged laying hens are unacceptable to REWE Group. Ever since 2010,
REWE Group in Germany has been selling eggs from free-run and free-range hens that meet the
requirements of the German Association for Controlled Alternative Husbandry Methods (KAT). In
2012, the decision was taken to ban the use of eggs from caged hens and small groups also in
processed products. By 2025 at the latest, all international companies in trade should have stopped
using eggs from caged hens. In 2016, REWE Group was honoured with the Good Egg Award of the
organisation Compassion in World Farming for the company’s early decision to drop eggs from caged
hens from its assortment.

Rejection of Beak Trimming and the Slaughter of Male Chicks
Until the beginning of 2017, conventionally run farms generally trimmed the beaks of laying hens as
a way to prevent the animals from picking at and injuring one another. Male chicks are also
slaughtered a day after birth because they are ill-suited for fattening.
REWE Group has set the goal of becoming the ﬁrst trade company in Germany to stop selling
conventional store-brand eggs from laying hens with trimmed beaks in all stores of the REWE and
PENNY sales lines by 31 December 2017. This goal is expected to be reached in September 2017.
In doing so, REWE Group will fulﬁl an agreement of poultry farming associations and the German
Ministry of Food and Agriculture ahead of schedule. This agreement calls for such sales to end by

Ministry of Food and Agriculture ahead of schedule. This agreement calls for such sales to end by
mid-2018. Organic eggs are exempt from this requirement because farms have to reject the practise
of beak trimming in order to qualify for organic certiﬁcation.
In a pilot project, the REWE sales line has already stopped beak trimming and the slaughter of male
chicks. The eggs sold in about 600 stores in North Rhine-Westphalia, in the northern region of
Rhineland-Palatinate and in parts of REWE Region East are being sold under the exclusive brand
“Spitz & Bube”. This brand is scheduled to be introduced in all stores in Germany by August 2017.
The product is being received very well by customers.
At the beginning of 2017, PENNY became the ﬁrst discounter in Germany to introduce fresh freerun eggs under the brand HERZBUBE. In this programme, the beaks of laying hens are not trimmed
and the male chicks are raised.

Creating a New Turkey Breed
Poultry breeding done under organic guidelines has to meet high requirements and creates tough
challenges as a result. Currently, 95 per cent of global turkey breeding is done by two companies
that exclusively use hybrid turkeys. These breeding lines are suitable for organic poultry breeding
only to a limited degree because health problems can arise as a result of the turkeys’ fast growth
and they are not suitable for reproduction. This creates a dependency on the breeder.
REWE Bio is providing pace-setting breeding support to Bioﬁno GmbH. A new breed is being created
by crossbreeding English free-range turkeys of the Auburn breed and a conventional hybrid breed.
This new breed is characterised by its special robustness and vitality. It is also very well-suited for
farms that employ free-range practises and use organic feed. Every animal has about
12 square metres of space in the barn, in the open air and in the covered outdoor area. The longer
fattening period is consciously accepted. In 2016, 30 per cent of the turkey meat produced by
Bioﬁno GmbH came from these turkeys. In 2017, the share will rise to 70 per cent and should reach
100 per cent by 2019.

Systematic Conversion to Free-Run Practises for Rabbits
In 2010, REWE Group began to work with the animal protection foundation VIER PFOTEN
International on plans to convert rabbit breeding from caged to free-run practises. In addition to
providing rabbits with more freedom to move about, the animals are given materials to occupy
themselves. Moreover, the ﬂoor is covered with plastic sheets to protect the balls of the animals’
feet. In the ﬁrst step, REWE Group converted its assortment of frozen rabbit to animals produced on
free-run farms at the end of 2012. Since 1 July 2016, fresh rabbit meat also comes exclusively from
animals raised on free-run farms. In taking this step, REWE Group kept the pledge it made in 2014.
In recognition of the company’s years-long commitment to species-appropriate animal-husbandry
practises, REWE Group was presented the Good Rabbit Commendation by the animal protection
group Compassion in World Farming in 2016.

Marketing of Grass-Fed Cow’s Milk
By selling larger amounts of grass-fed cow’s milk, REWE Group is making a strong contribution to
increased animal welfare in dairy farming. Pasture farming practises come closest to cows’ natural
way of life, both in terms of their diets as well as their movement and social behaviour. In pasture
farming practices, animals spend at least six hours a day on at least 120 days a year in pastures. For
the extended-shelf life milk (ESL milk) in REWE’s assortment, the share of grass-fed milk was
37.2 per cent. In August 2017, REWE began to oﬀer certiﬁed grass-fed milk with the seal “PRO
WEIDELAND – Deutsche Weidecharta” in a number of German states. In addition to fresh milk, the
ﬁrst cheese products have been converted to grass-fed milk. Plans to convert other products have
already been made.

DER Touristik: Chili Against Elephants

As part of the work done by the non-proﬁt organisation DER Touristik Foundation e.V., DER Touristik
supports the project Chili Against Elephants. The conﬂict between wild animals and human beings is
becoming a bigger and bigger problem as populations grow and as people migrate to regions
bordering on nature conservation areas. Elephants frequently destroy the annual harvest of entire
villages and are often killed as a result.
A sensibilisation campaign is designed to raise the awareness level of people in Tanzania about the
promotion of sustainable habitats and biodiversity. There is one simple way to solve the conﬂict with
elephants: The animals have a strong sense of smell and stay away from chili plants. By surrounding
crops with so-called chili fences, about 75 per cent of the original damage can be avoided. The local
population is taught how to grow and maintain the chili fences. The work being carried out with the
project partners Upendo e.V. and the PAMS Foundation is helping both animals and people, as it can
ease the conﬂict over living space and habitat.

Energy, Climate and the Environment
Pillar of Sustainability: Energy, Climate and the
Environment
Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing the community of nations. In an
acknowledgement of this fact, countries that are part of the UN Framework Convention on Climate
Change signed the Paris climate agreement on December 12, 2015. In taking this step, they
pledged to launch eﬀorts designed to keep the rise of global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius
compared with preindustrial levels and to take steps to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees. A rise of
2 degrees would threaten the Earth’s ecosystems and endanger biological diversity and foundation
of life for millions of people.
REWE Group understands its responsibility for the climate: A large portion of global CO2 emissions is
created during the production and consumption of products as well as the provision of services.
Greenhouse gases are also produced in stores, logistics and business locations. On the other hand,
the business operations of REWE Group are also aﬀected to diﬀerent degrees by climate change.
Climate change, increased rainfall and storms can negatively impact its business locations and
aﬀect the products and services of REWE Group, whose business depends on the long-term and
reliable availability of food. Extreme weather events and changing climate conditions can threaten
the cultivation and harvest of raw materials, a development that could drive up prices. In travel and
tourism, climate change can pose a threat to entire destinations over the long term. In particular,
these areas include islands, coastal regions and ski resorts.

Strategic Approach
The strategic goal will be to make an active contribution to climate and resource protection or, at the
very least, to keep impacts on the climate and environment to a minimum. This commitment is
clearly spelled out in the Guidelines for Sustainable Business Practices of REWE Group. The pillar of
sustainability Energy, Climate and the Environment focuses in essence on environmentally relevant
activities that lie in REWE Group’s individual area of responsibility. These include: the construction
and operation of stores, warehouses, administration oﬃces, production sites, logistics operations,
resources and materials needed for the company’s business needs. In these areas, REWE Group
strives to sparingly use resources and to increase the amount of recycled and sustainable materials
it employs. Saving energy and avoiding the use of climate-damaging emissions have been made top
priorities at REWE Group. In a reﬂection of this, REWE Group has introduced a central energy
management system to oversee its eﬃciency measures, has used green power since 2008, taps the
optimisation potential of logistics and has applied a holistic sustainability strategy since 2009 with
its Green Building concept. In 2013, REWE Group modiﬁed the climate goals its set in 2009. As a
result, the company is now working to cut its greenhouse gas emissions per square metre of sales
area in half by 2022 compared with the base year 2006. Each year, REWE Group reviews its
progress in a carbon footprint report, a document that is prepared by independent experts. The
management of all areas of activity is conducted by the project group Energy, Climate and the
Environment. All sales lines and relevant holding areas are represented in the group. The project
group was created in 2016 and has been led since then by Mr Telerik Schischmanow (Divisional

Management Board Trade Germany Administration and Services).

Areas of Action
Three areas of action have been identiﬁed in the pillar “Energy, Climate and the Environment”.
These areas were reviewed in the strategy process for food retail in Germany and approved in
principle for the entire REWE Group. The name of the areas of action has been slightly changed.
They are now called: “energy eﬃciency”, “climate-relevant emissions”, “conservation of resources”.
The review of the areas of action is part of a comprehensive strategy project in which individual sales
lines more carefully adapt their sustainability activities to the speciﬁc requirements of their diﬀerent
business models (for more information, see section Strategy).

Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
In addition to setting the overarching climate goal, REWE Group has deﬁned two KPIs that are used
to monitor measures to achieve energy eﬃciency and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions:
KPI 1 : lowering electricity usage per square metre of sales area (as measured in kWh/m²) by
7.5 per cent between 2012 and 2022.
Status 2016 : The company lowered its speciﬁc energy consumption level in Germany and Austria
by 4.8 per cent between 2012 and 2016.
KPI 2 : Rreducing refrigerant-related greenhouse gas emissions per square metre of sales area (in
kilograms of CO2 equivalent/m²) by 35 per cent between 2012 and 2022
Status 2016 : The company lowered its refrigerant-related greenhouse gas emissions per square
metre of sales area in Germany and Austria by 30.4 per cent between 2012 and 2016.
The KPIs focus on activities in energy, climate and the environment. These are areas where
signiﬁcant levels of consumption occur and where REWE Group can have a direct impact by taking
its own measures: energy eﬃciency (lighting and refrigeration) and refrigerant-related greenhouse
gas emissions.
The goals of each strategic business unit and holding area in Germany and Austria include its own
speciﬁc binding targets and are a major focus of the units’ commercial operations. The investments
that must be made in new technologies and processes to achieve this goal are determined by the
strategic business units and the holding areas themselves. On the basis of this work, steps for future
reporting periods are coordinated. The progress made towards reaching the goals and the impact of
the measures are reviewed annually.

Sustainable Development Goals
With its commitment to the pillars of Energy, Climate and the Environment, REWE Group is also
contributing to global goals of sustainable development. A comparison of the sustainability strategy
and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (see section Strategy) shows that, above all, SDG 7:
Aﬀordable and Clean Energy, SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities and SDG 13: Climate
Action apply to the pillar Energy, Climate and the Environment.

GRI 301: Materials

Management Approach (GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)
In its Guideline for Sustainable Business Practises, REWE Group has committed itself to the
eﬃcient use of the natural resources soil, air and water as well as of raw materials and fuels. As part
of this eﬀort, REWE Group optimises the use of relevant resources in its business processes and
takes product- and raw-material-related steps aimed at both the upstream and downstream links in
the value chain. This work includes the PRO PLANET process in which resource-conservation
activities are addressed (for more information about PRO PLANET, see GRI 204: Procurement
Practices).
Product-related measures are also implemented in the areas of packaging, recycling materials and
optimisation of closed loops. In its own business process, REWE Group focuses on energy
management, optimisation of logistics processes and the use of environmentally conscious paper.

Making Packaging More Sustainable
To make product packaging more sustainable, REWE Group has worked with stakeholders and held
internal workshops to identify improvement ideas and potential. The results of these eﬀorts then
produced momentum for the development of a packaging guideline. In the ﬁrst step, a
comprehensive overview of packaging used for fruit and vegetables was conducted and ways to
more sustainably design packaging were generated. The ﬁrst pilot projects were initiated in 2016.
The focus of this optimisation eﬀort was initially placed on the packaging used for fruit and
vegetables. It will later be extended to other parts of the product range. One idea being considered is
“natural branding”, that is, the use of a laser to directly apply a logo to the skin of fruit and
vegetables. This new label for organic fruit and vegetables could eliminate the need for packaging
whose only purpose is to draw a distinction between organically and conventionally grown products.
As a result, it can help to conserve plastic, paper and metal.
To help reduce plastic rubbish, REWE Group has stopped selling plastic shopping bags. In Germany,
this step was initiated by the sales lines REWE in 2016 and PENNY in 2017. In Austria, it was also
taken by BILLA, MERKUR, PENNY, BIPA and ADEG in 2017 (for more information, see the chapter
on plastic shopping bags in the magazine).

Use of Recycling Materials
REWE Group promotes recycling of plastics by separating packaging waste in stores and warehouses
and by using recycled plastics for packaging and products.
Working with its suppliers and other partners, toom Baumarkt DIY stores have developed packaging
made of nearly 100 per cent recycled plastic. Since 2011, the DIY stores have been selling their
white store-brand paint in containers made from recycled plastic. This range was expanded during
the reporting period. As a result, 77 products were oﬀered in paint containers made of recycled
plastic (Procyclen®) in 2015 and 2016. The CO2 emissions attributed to containers made of
recycled material are up to 50 per cent lower than the levels generated in the production of buckets
made of primary materials. The containers can also be reused as frequently as desired. In January
2015, toom Baumarkt DIY stores added a paint tray made of recycled plastic to its product range.

They are also continuously expanding their range of products made with recycled materials.
REWE Group is a member of the Recyclat Initiative, an alliance of partners from a range of diﬀerent
industries that promotes eﬀective recycling and practises the principle of a circular ﬂow economy.
Their shared goal is to develop sustainable closed loops and to use materials produced by
Germany’s “Gelber Sack” (Yellow Bag) programme in which plastic rubbish is collected from private
households in the country. Packaging for a portion of store-brand products in the product groups
“washing, cleaning, scrubbing” at REWE and PENNY is being gradually switched to materials made
entirely of recycled material. Twenty per cent of this material will come from Gelber Sack collections.
The use of the Gelber Sack material is made possible by sorting technology based on laser optics.
The next goal is to increase the percentage of Gelber Sack material.
In 2014, the BIPA sales line in Austria introduced a new line of cosmetics called bi:good whose
packaging is made of recycled plastic and recycled cardboard.

Optimisation of Closed Loops
REWE Group is committed to eﬀorts to create closed loops for materials. In textiles, REWE Group
uses a strategy designed to close loops along the entire value chain. Among other steps, REWE
Group is planning to set up textile return systems at the stores operated by the PENNY sales line (for
detailed information, see the closed-loop report of REWE Group that can be downloaded here).
Since 2012, toom Baumarkt DIY stores and its partner Lightcycle have been oﬀering a return system
for energy-saving lamps and other types of lighting. toom Baumarkt DIY stores also actively inform
customers about the disposal and recycling of lighting. This campaign included the appearance of
Fabian Hambüchen, the 2016 Olympic horizontal bar champion, at a DIY store in Cologne. With this
initially voluntary service, toom Baumarkt DIY stores are also fulﬁlling a portion of legal requirements
regarding the return of used electric devices that are included in the new version of the German
Electrical and Electronic Equipment Act (Elektrogesetz).

Reusable Systems in Logistics
To reduce the amount of transport packaging rubbish, the logistics operation of REWE Group
employs reusable containers for such products as fruits and vegetables. In addition, conventional
wooden palettes are being replaced by plastic alternatives. The percentage of these palettes among
all palettes used by the company rose to 16 per cent in 2016 compared with 2014. Plastic palettes
are lighter and have more capacity in terms of transportable packaging volume. This, in turn, has a
positive impact on the energy eﬃciency of transports. The plastic palettes can also be completely
recycled and are returned to the recovered substance cycle when a defect occurs.

Low Aromatic Inks for Printed Fliers
In the intense work it has done with printers and ink producers over the years, REWE Group has
worked to replace conventional inks containing mineral oil with low aromatic alternatives. And the
work has paid oﬀ: Since January 2016, only low aromatic inks have been used to produce REWE
Group ﬂiers. In accomplishing this, REWE Group fulﬁlled the requirements of the environmental seal
Blauer Engel (Blue Angel) for printed products (RAL 195) ahead of schedule. The seal called for the
use of low emission paints and inks to start in 2017.
This switch has led to sustainable changes in the industry. It prompted leading ink producers in
Germany, Austria and Switzerland to primarily supply low aromatic ink for heatset printing
processes.
The switch by the printing companies represents a key step in eﬀorts to use recycled paper for food
packaging. Recycling paper may not be used for packaging if conventional inks containing mineral
oil are used on the original paper. The reason: The aromatic substances in inks containing mineral oil
could be transferred to the food. This transfer is considered to be a health threat. REWE Group is

working to turn the use of aromatic-free ink into a printing-industry standard. This would represent a
critical step in the use of recycled paper for food packaging.

Use of Environmentally Conscious Paper
Paper is a key resource that all business ﬁelds of REWE Group use extensively. As a result, REWE
Group encourages the use of recycled paper, which is utilised in particular for ﬂiers and other
printed matter as well as in its administration work. In 2009, the company began to make a
transition to more environmentally conscious paper, a key component of its sustainability strategy.
This eﬀort focuses on using recycled paper (with or without the German environmental seal Blauer
Engel) and paper from sustainable forestry that has been certiﬁed by the Forest Stewardship
Council® (FSC®) or the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certiﬁcation Schemes (PEFC™).

GRI 301-1: Materials used by weight or volume
Paper is a key resource for a trade and tourism company, one that plays a major role particularly in
product advertising. Total paper consumption by REWE Group rose from about 144,300 tonnes in
2014 to nearly 175,600 tonnes in 2016. Flier production is the primary cause of paper
consumption. The rise is also reﬂected in speciﬁc paper consumption, which totalled 18.3 kilograms
per square metre of sales area in 2016. The primary reason for the rise in paper consumption was
increased advertising conducted as part of the competition for customers. This increase was
reﬂected in the higher print runs of products like ﬂiers, catalogues and company publications.

Energy
GRI 302: Energy

Management Approach (GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)
REWE Group continuously works to reduce its energy consumption per square metre of sales area.
This is one of the key contributions that REWE Group makes to environmental protection and the
conservation of resources. REWE Group primarily uses energy for refrigeration and lighting purposes
in its stores. Energy is also used to transport goods. REWE Group has set a goal and deﬁned a key
performance indicator (KPI) regarding its consumption of electricity, the largest source of energy
usage at nearly 60 per cent:

●

KPI 1: lowering electricity usage per square metre of sales area (as measured in kWh/m²) by

Development of electricity usage per square metre sales area (in percent)

Scope: REWE Group Germany and Austria including partners. Units that left REWE Group during the reporting period were excluded: Rothermel.

The company lowered its speciﬁc energy consumption level in Germany and Austria by 4.8 per cent
between 2012 and 2016.
The reduction of energy usage per square metre of sales area plays a key role in eﬀorts to reach
REWE Group’s climate goal . The foundation of REWE Group’s systematic energy-eﬃciency
activities is the group-wide energy management system that the company has been implementing
since 2008 in conjunction with Energie-Handels-Gesellschaft (EHA) of Hamburg. The energy service
provider – which became a wholly owned subsidiary of REWE Group in 2014 – installs measuring
devices in the company’s stores and warehouses that facilitate central, up-to-the-minute monitoring
of energy usage. In addition, a monitoring platform called FRIGODATA keeps close watch on
temperature and energy data.
During the reporting period, REWE Group in Germany and Austria introduced a central energy
management system based on ISO 50001. This system was certiﬁed at the end of 2016. The system
covers the entire REWE Combine in Germany with 150 companies and about 4,800 locations. These
companies and locations range from food retail stores, DIY stores and travel agencies to logistics
centres, administrative oﬃces and online shops. The production operations Wilhelm Brandenburg
and Glockenbrot Bäckerei have been operating an energy management system certiﬁed in

accordance with ISO 50001 since 2014. In April 2016, REWE International AG in Austria received
ISO 50001 certiﬁcation for about 2,100 stores (BILLA, MERKUR, PENNY Austria and BIPA) and the
entire logistics operation. In taking this approach, REWE Group is bundling its many energy-related
activities. At the same time, it is meeting the standards of the European Energy Eﬃciency Directive
and fulﬁlling legal requirements in individual countries (the amended version of the German Energy
Services Act (Energiedienstleistungsgesetz)).
The new management structure is a key aspect of work to further optimise energy consumption. The
detailed tracking of energy consumption will enable central energy goals and subgoals to be set. In
addition, the link between measured energy usage and implemented programmes can be better
understood and monitored. High-impact solutions can be identiﬁed and reﬁned. Local employees
play an important role in addition to administrative employees and energy managers. Through their
actions on the job, they can make a key contribution to the success of the measures and serve as
inﬂuential providers of improvement ideas. REWE Group has set up a central e-mail address to
which employees can send their questions, ideas and suggestions.

GRI 302-1: Energy consumption within the
organization
Energy consumption involves electricity, especially the power used for refrigeration and lighting
purposes, and the petrol consumed to transport products from warehouses to stores and to deliver
goods to online customers. This part of logistics is a category that the company can inﬂuence
directly. As a result, consumption by the group’s own vehicles as well as those of external service
providers in Germany and Austria is addressed here.
Absolute energy usage by REWE Group rose by about 8.3 per cent between 2014 and 2016. A key
reason for this rise was the acquisition of Kuoni Travel Holding Ltd. in 2015. Among other things,
Kuoni owns the aeroplanes used by the airline Novair. These planes were the cause of a 4.8 per cent
rise in energy consumption between 2014 and 2016. The expansion of locations and sales area also
contributed to the rise in absolute energy consumption.
The largest amount of total energy consumption in 2016 was attributed to electricity, at about
58 per cent. It was followed by natural gas at 16 per cent and petrol for cars and lorries at
15 per cent.

sales concepts, including salad bars and fresh-food counters in convenience sections of stores. The
acquisition of travel and tourism operations played a role as well.
A large number of electricity-eﬃciency steps were taken in both stores and warehouses (see KPI 1

GRI 302-4: Reduction of energy consumption
To systematically save electricity and reduce emissions, the company works with Hamburger
Energie-Handels-Gesellschaft (EHA) to monitor electricity and gas consumption in the stores
supplied by EHA. In 2016, REWE Group began to use the new energy management system
ISO 50001 in Germany and Austria. On the basis of collected data, the energy managers of REWE
Group examine current and planned consumption levels and then propose optimisation
recommendations. These measures are primarily designed to optimise lighting, refrigeration and
heating systems. REWE Group is also working to reduce its use of heat. Since the end of 2015,
REWE Markt GmbH has been conducting potential-identiﬁcation analyses to develop optimisation
measures. This work is also focusing on optimising petrol consumption for product transport and
employee mobility.

Lighting

Interior lighting in stores aﬀects customers’ moods and product presentations. As a result, pleasing
lighting becomes an essential part of the shopping experience. At the same time, lighting is
responsible for about 25 per cent of electricity consumption in food stores and around 60 per cent in
toom Baumarkt DIY stores. To reduce this total, energy management is devising eﬃcient lighting
concepts that address the lighting needs of the sales lines. LEDs play a major part in this eﬀort by
saving between 30 per cent and 45 per cent of the electricity required by lighting systems. In 2013
and 2014, the sales lines of REWE Group began to systematically switch to LED lighting in its stores.
In this eﬀort, a group-wide project was initiated during the reporting period to use LEDs (including
retroﬁt solutions) for new and replacement systems. This project also involved developing special
trade lighting concepts that occasionally required new technical solutions. Tremendous advances in
the light colour and life span of LED lighting systems have been achieved in recent years. As a result,
nothing stands in the way of their widespread use any longer. In future, REWE Group will use new
LED lighting concepts in all new and remodelled stores.

Refrigeration
Refrigeration systems consume the most power in grocery stores. For this reason, they are a focal
point of eﬀorts to lower energy consumption. Optimised refrigerated display cases use 20 per cent to
40 per cent less electricity for cooling purposes. Glass doors installed on refrigerated display cases
are a visible, highly eﬀective way to cut energy consumption. Such doors are already standard for
meat products. These systems will also be used for dairy products in new stores and large
remodelling projects.
One other key factor is regular maintenance and professional management of refrigerating systems.
These systems can be energy eﬃcient only if the refrigeration equipment is optimally operated. As
the range of fresh and convenience products grows in stores and as refrigerating needs rise with
them, energy-eﬃcient refrigerated display cases will become increasingly important in future.
Each year, the REWE sales line invites representatives of refrigerating companies and system
suppliers to a refrigerating forum that gives participants an opportunity to discuss their experiences.
During presentations and workshops, the participants delve into such topics as energy optimisation
and operational and temperature reliability. The company also uses the occasion to recognise those
companies that played a major role in energy conservation over the past year. The Austrian sales line
BILLA also presents an energy eﬃciency award to refrigerating companies as part of its refrigerating
partner conference.

Scope: REWE Group Germany and Austria (REWE VS; REWE Lager; PENNY; PENNY Lager; toom Baumarkt DIY stores; headquarters locations; Travel and Tourism;
REWE International (Austria); REWE Systems; Glockenbrot excluding Rothermel; and W. Brandenburg).

The measures taken by the units of REWE Group in Germany and Austria lowered electricity usage
by about 39GWh in 2016 and by 26GWh in 2015. Refrigeration is responsible for more than half of
electricity consumption at full-range and PENNY stores. Many refrigeration steps were taken during
the reporting period to reduce cooling losses. The increased use of LED lighting was the chief reason
for reduced electricity consumption in 2016. In grocery stores, lighting is responsible for about
25 per cent of power usage. In toom Baumarkt DIY stores, the total is almost 60 per cent.

Logistics and Product Transport
REWE Group Logistics ensures that the company’s stores always have the products they need. This
operation is supported by a complex transport and warehouse system that ensures product
availability, quality and freshness. Transport-related emissions cause about 10 per cent of REWE
Group’s total greenhouse gas emissions in Germany and Austria. REWE Group is taking the following
steps to cut these emissions: It has lowered the total of driven kilometres, increased vehicle
utilisation, reduced emissions per kilometre through the use of diﬀerent logistics concepts,
employed eﬃcient technology and modiﬁed driver behaviour.
In 2015 and 2016, the warehouse network structure of REWE Group was further optimised. As part
of this work, two new cross-docking hubs for fruit and vegetables were opened. In addition, storage
and logistics were restructured and reorganised at a number of locations. In addition to the
improvements in the warehouse structure, forecast techniques and route planning are continuously
improved. As a result, further gains were made in vehicle utilisation of the entire lorry ﬂeet, reaching
91 per cent of the entire vehicle ﬂeet in service. REWE Group conducts training programmes in
which its drivers learn petrol-saving techniques. It is also implementing a company-wide system for
monitoring petrol usage. During the reporting period, average petrol consumption fell by
3.8 per cent compared with the period of 2013–2014. To further reduce the carbon footprint of its
vehicle ﬂeet, REWE Group continuously upgrades its vehicles. At the end of 2016, the share of
vehicles that meet the Euro 6 emission standard was 35 per cent of the company’s entire ﬂeet of
lorries. Another key part of REWE Group’s sustainability eﬀorts involves testing alternative drive
technologies to determine their suitability, practicability and eﬃciency within REWE Group Logistics.
An electric lorry is being used in the Berlin metropolitan area, and REWE Region Central is
employing ﬁve lorries powered by natural gas. In Austria, three lorries with organic-fuel drive
systems and three e-hybrid lorries are being used.
REWE Group is also involved in research that is being conducted into promising logistics concepts.
In the research project “Geräuscharme Nachtlogistik” (silent night logistics), existing processes
have been modiﬁed with the goal of integrating electric commercial vehicles into the urban logistics
chain. The aim is to reduce noise and environmental pollution as well as to decrease traﬃc
congestion in urban areas. Three stores of REWE Group are being used to test the developed
concept in real-world operations.

Employee Mobility
Another step being taken to reduce energy consumption is the Mobility Budget that replaced the
Company Car Policy in 2014. Employees entitled to company cars can now ﬂexibly use their budget
and individually design it by doing such things as selecting a smaller model and investing the
remaining budget in various other components. Users of electric vehicles receive a monthly bonus of
150 euros in addition to their mobility budget. The monthly supplement for hybrid vehicles is
25 euros. To encourage mobility with bicycles, all employees of REWE Group in Germany have been
able to purchase a company bike since November 2016 as part of a deferred-compensation model.
Employees can use the bicycles to commute to work and enjoy in the leisure time.

Water
GRI 303: Water

Management Approach (GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)
REWE Group uses water in its stores, production sites, warehouses and administration locations.
Water-saving equipment installed here reduces the company’s low level of fresh water usage even
further.
A bigger role is played by water withdrawal and disposal in the production of products. In this area,
REWE Group conducts product-related projects in its supply chain (for more information, seeGRI
201: Procurement Practices).

GRI 303-1: Water withdrawal by source
REWE Group uses water in its approximately 15,000 stores, at its production sites, warehouses and
administration locations. Almost all water used by the company is obtained from public waterworks
– with the exception of the rainwater used by some Green Buildings. Absolute water usage rose
slightly from about 5.76 million cubic metres (m3) in 2014 to 6.72 million cubic metres in 2016. The
rise was caused in part by the addition of companies to REWE Group. The travel and tourism
provider Kuoni that was acquired in 2015 added 430,000 cubic metres to water consumption by
itself. Water usage also rose in some units that were already part of REWE Group.

Climate Protection
GRI 305: Emissions

Management Approach (GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)
REWE Group understands its responsibility for the climate: A large portion of global CO2 emissions is
created during the production and consumption of products as well as the provision of services. For
this reason, REWE Group has made energy conservation and the avoidance of climatically harmful
emissions a high priority. And this issue will become even more important as energy prices rise. Key
challenges to be faced by REWE Group in future include cutting energy consumption while
addressing rising needs in the areas of freshness and convenience, work that will require increased
transports and refrigeration.

The Climate Target of REWE Group:
The declared strategic goal of REWE Group is to make a measurable contribution to climate and
resource protection or, at the very least, to keep impacts on the climate and environment to a
minimum. This commitment is clearly spelled out in the Guidelines for Sustainable Business
Practices of REWE Group.
REWE Group deﬁned its ﬁrst climate goal in 2009. Thanks to the company’s strong performance,
this goal was reached ahead of time in the summer of 2013 and increased. The new goal is:

●

REWE Group has set the goal of cutting its greenhouse gas emissions per square metre of sales
area in half by 2022 compared with 2006.

Absolute greenhouse gas emissions for Germany and Austria have fallen from 2.37 million tonnes in
the base year of 2006 to about 2.06 million tonnes in 2016. This represents a decrease of
13 per cent. Speciﬁc greenhouse gas emissions (unit: CO2 equivalents per square metre of sales
area) plunged by 38.7 per cent during the same period (see graphic). As this result demonstrates,
REWE Group has made signiﬁcant strides in its eﬀort to cut its speciﬁc greenhouse gas emissions by
2022. In addition to this overarching environmental goal, REWE Group has deﬁned two KPIs with
related goals:

●

KPI 1: lowering electricity usage per square metre of sales area (as measured in kWh/m²) by
7.5 per cent between 2012 and 2022 (see also GRI 302: Energy)

●

KPI 2: reducing refrigeration-related greenhouse gas emissions per square metre of sales area (in
kg of CO2 equivalents/m²) by 35 per cent between 2012 and 2022 (see also the chapter
Refrigerants).

The KPIs focus on activities in energy, climate and the environment. These are areas where
signiﬁcant levels of consumption occur and where REWE Group can have a direct impact by taking
its own measures: energy eﬃciency (refrigeration and lighting) and refrigerant-related greenhouse
gas emissions. The goals of each strategic business unit and holding area in Germany and Austria
include speciﬁc binding targets and are a major focus of their commercial operations. The
investments that must be made in new technologies and processes to achieve this goal are
determined by the strategic business units and the holding areas themselves.

The management of all areas of activity is conducted by the project group Energy, Climate and the
Environment. All strategic sales lines and holding areas are represented in the group.

Carbon Footprint
To document the progress being made in reaching climate goals and to facilitate the monitoring of
the emission-reducing steps, REWE Group has hired independent experts to prepare an annual
carbon footprint report since 2009. During the reporting period, this report was prepared by INFRAS
AG for Germany and by Umweltbundesamt GmbH for Austria. In addition to outlining the achieved
savings, the Carbon Footprint Report highlights the fundamental levers that the company has at its
disposal. The major causes of greenhouse gas emissions are electrical, heating and refrigeration
systems (for information about energy-related steps, see GRI 302: Energy). During the reporting
period, updated emission factors were added to the carbon footprint. One change made in 2016
involved the adjustment of emission factors for electricity in Germany. This change was applied
retroactively and resulted in small changes in totals up to 2010. The basis of the updated emission
factors is formed by new information about Germany’s electricity mix from German energy statistics
and revised power station data from the material-ﬂow-analysis model GEMIS (global emission model
of integrated systems).
Greenhouse gas emissions were calculated in accordance with the GHG Protocol. In determining
CO2 equivalent emission factors, data from the material-ﬂow-analysis model GEMIS, the transport
emission model TREMOD and the life-cycle analysis database Ecoinvent were used once again.

Alternative Energies
At the beginning of 2008, the company shifted the source of the electricity used by its stores,
warehouses and travel agencies in Germany and Austria to certiﬁed green power. This power is
acquired by the Hamburg-based Energie-Handels-Gesellschaft (EHA), a wholly owned subsidiary of
REWE Group. The green power generated by REWE Group Germany meets the requirements of the
Label EE01 of TÜV SÜD, a technical services company in Germany. In accordance with the
convention of the German Environment Agency regarding the calculation of green power, a
regulation that is designed to facilitate the expansion of power produced from renewable sources,
REWE Group now applies the share of new systems pursuant to Label EE01 as an emission-lowering
factor in calculating its carbon footprint (about 25 per cent).
In 2016, 91.3 per cent of green power was produced by hydroelectric sources. The rest was
generated by photovoltaics, biomass and wind power.
In addition, REWE Group employs photovoltaic technology and other regenerative technologies to
produce its own energy. Photovoltaic systems are used in administrative oﬃces, warehouses and
stores in suitable locations (particularly Green Building stores). At the end of 2016, REWE Group
operated photovoltaic systems at 40 locations in Germany. These units have a potential peak power
output of 13,900kWp.

Refrigerants
The greenhouse gas emissions produced by refrigerating systems are largely the result of the
refrigeration agents used in them. For this reason, REWE Group has deﬁned its own KPI to cover this
area:
KPI 2: reducing refrigerant-related greenhouse gas emissions per square metre of sales area by
35 per cent by 2022 compared with the base year 2012.
By 2016, a reduction of 30.4 per cent had already been achieved.
In its eﬀort to cut emissions, REWE Group decided at an early stage to use the most environmentally
conscious refrigeration agents. These agents have low greenhouse gas potential and increasingly

conscious refrigeration agents. These agents have low greenhouse gas potential and increasingly
include natural refrigerants like propane and CO2 . As part of the company’s work, it purchased
about 14,000 refrigerating units that use the natural refrigerant propane for REWE and PENNY
during the reporting period.

Waste
GRI 306: Eﬄuents and Waste

Management Approach (GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)
In dealing with waste and reusable materials, REWE Group and its waste-disposal partners
systematically apply the principle of recycling. In particular, the reusable material found in logistics
is sorted to the greatest extent possible and can thus be optimally provided for further use.
This commitment is especially reﬂected in the high recycling percentage for non-hazardous waste
that can be reused to a large degree.
In 2008, this rate was more than 90 per cent. Since 2012, it has remained relatively constant at
more than 95 per cent. Nearly all paper, cardboard and boxes are recycled. This group makes up the
largest share of all waste at 45.8 per cent. A large amount of plastics, metals, glass and store
rubbish is recycled as well. Organic waste produced in food stores is transported to biogas units,
where it is converted into electricity and heat.
In the area of food, REWE Group strives to keep the percentage of losses to a minimum. State-ofthe-art forecasting systems and automated order processes are combined with short transport
distances and seamless refrigeration to create a needs-driven supply system for stores. As a result,
the percentage of unsold goods can be kept at a low level. A key role in estimating need is the
commercial experience of employees. REWE Group regularly provides training to them in this area.
REWE Group obtains its water from public waterworks. The company does not introduce its eﬄuents
directly into any body of water. Instead, its business locations direct the eﬄuents into normal public
and private wastewater systems.

GRI 306-2: Waste by type and disposal method
The amount of non-hazardous waste in the company group in Germany and Austria totalled about
637,000 tonnes in 2016. Hazardous waste, in particular certain types of used electric equipment,
oils, vehicle batteries and ﬂuorescent lamps, made up only a small portion of overall waste during
the reporting period with an absolute total of 1,453 tonnes (2015) and 1,353 tonnes (2016).
Compared with non-hazardous waste, the amount of hazardous waste totalled signiﬁcantly less than

Green Building
Management Approach (GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)
“More sustainable products belong in more sustainable stores.” With this commitment in mind,
REWE Group set about the task in 2008 to develop a new generation of supermarkets that would
bring sustainability to life for customers and employees as well as foster sustainable progress.
The result of this work is the Green Building concept of REWE Group that combines modern
architecture with energy-eﬃcient technologies and the use of renewable energies. Introduction of
the model concept in 2012 made it possible, for example, to cut primary energy consumption by up
to 40 per cent compared with conventional markets. By successfully introducing the Green Building
concept, REWE Group has made the environmental and business case for building and operating
more sustainable retail properties. Because REWE generally leases its stores, the support of
investors and landlords for more sustainable building concepts must be gained. Such criteria as
economic value, a possible change of use and commercial development costs serve as key
arguments for this proven construction concept. Evidence of customers’ positive responses to this
concept can be seen in above-average customer frequency and the related rise in revenue. REWE
Group informs customers about its Green Building strategy in ﬂiers in weekly advertising, in special
brochures and as part of annual Sustainability Weeks in stores.

Concept
The concept includes the following elements, which are applied in accordance with business
locations’ needs:
1.

Daylight Architecture: Ribbon windows on up to four sides of the building and additional dome
roof lights facilitate the use of natural light, which is complemented by an energy-eﬃcient LED
lighting concept. The natural light tremendously enhances the quality of the time that
customers and employees spend in the store.

2.

Organic Building Materials: The characteristic structural frame of a Green Building is formed by
the renewable resource wood. This is also the case with the front façade and, in many cases,
with the roof shell as well. Environmentally friendly and recyclable building materials are also
used in other areas.

3.

Renewable Energies: Green Building stores use only green power that is 100 per cent certiﬁed.
In instances where it makes sense, photovoltaic systems are installed as well.

4.

Heating: For heating purposes, no fossil fuels are required thanks to the use of heat pumps and
the waste heat of refrigeration systems.

5.

Use of Rain Water: To clean ﬂoors, ﬂush toilets and water outdoor areas, rain water is collected
in containers.

6.

Refrigeration Systems and Units: The natural coolant CO2 is used for normal and combined
refrigeration and deep-freeze systems, and the natural refrigerant propylene for plug-in
freezers. Buﬀer-storage units are used to recover heat. Glass-door refrigerated display cases for
meat and dairy products help to prevent losses of refrigerated air. The energy eﬃciency of
refrigeration units is also increased by using integrated LED lighting systems and energy-saving

fans as well as forgoing the use of defrosters for glass panels on freezer units.
7.

Sociocultural Factors: Green Building stores are largely barrier free. They are also equipped with
restrooms for the physically disabled and diaper-changing tables. Such factors as visual
comfort, ambient air and bicycle parking places near the entrance are considered as well.

Certiﬁcation
REWE’s Green Building concept has received multiple certiﬁcations at the “Gold”* level by the
German Sustainable Building Council (DGNB) since 2012. In 2014, toom Baumarkt DIY stores
received multiple certiﬁcations for its Green Buildings. The PENNY sales line earned multiple
certiﬁcations in 2016. The seal of quality evaluates a wide range of building features. These include
environmental aspects, the stages of the construction process and sociocultural factors regarding
well-being, including visual comfort, ambient air, bicycle parking places and customer restrooms.
Multiple certiﬁcations of the building speciﬁcations signiﬁcantly smooth the certiﬁcation process
because the entire concept has already been subjected to a thorough examination. This is a key precondition for the fast, cost-eﬃcient development of Green Building stores.

* Corresponds to the current classiﬁcation following a change in the criteria by the building council in 2015.

Implementation
The ﬁrst Green Building store was opened in 2009 in Berlin-Rudow and received platinum
certiﬁcation* from the German Sustainable Building Council. REWE has been honoured several
times for the pioneering role it has played in sustainable construction. These honours include being
named “Store of the year 2010” by the German Retail Association (HDE) and being listed among the
world’s 100 best sustainability concepts by the UN Commission on Sustainable Development in
2012. In the same year, the REWE Green Building speciﬁcations received the multiple certiﬁcate
(MNHA12) in silver from the building council. This now corresponds to the gold level following
changes made in the criteria in 2015.
In 2013, REWE Group decided to carry out all new building projects and all new leases on the basis
of the Green Building concept, provided that conditions permit this. In 2014, PENNY also opened a
Green Building store. toom Baumarkt DIY stores now have two Green Buildings that have been
certiﬁed and seven stores that were built according to the Green Building criteria but have not yet
received ﬁnal certiﬁcation. The Green Building criteria are also considered in the construction of
new warehouses. The new structures are then certiﬁed according to the building council’s standard.
The warehouse RED 63 in Neu-Isenburg, Germany, that was completed in 2014 has received the
council’s certiﬁcation in gold. When existing buildings are remodelled, REWE Group applies as many
elements of the Green Building as possible to the stores’ interior.

Employees
Pillar of Sustainability: Employees
REWE Group is facing a broad range of human-resources challenges. As a result of demographic
trends, the number of older employees will rise through 2020, and the shortage of trainees and
skilled workers continues to expand. In addition, the work world is being reshaped by globalisation
and digitalisation – accompanied in part by technological change, the increasing complexity of
markets, shifts in cultural values and growing individualisation. Work World 4.0 will be more digital,
connected and ﬂexible. The future work world for an individual is still up in the air (source: German
Ministry of Labour and Social Aﬀairs 2015).

Strategic Approach
REWE Group applies strategic personnel management in its eﬀorts to position itself for the future as
well as to attract talented individuals and turn them into loyal employees – by oﬀering employeedriven job concepts, providing safe working conditions, giving tailored advanced training and
respecting every individual.
The promotion of satisfaction, performance and productivity plays a major role in this process. To
achieve this goal at such a large and diverse company, it takes a strong sense of togetherness
among all employees and departments in which they work. Dedicated, well-qualiﬁed employees
contribute immensely to the company’s success. To gain their loyalty, the company oﬀers fair pay,
additional company beneﬁts that extend beyond the level of negotiated wages, ﬂexible working
models that can be adjusted to meet individual employee needs and tailored ways to achieve a
work/life balance. The corporate culture of REWE Group is characterised by a trusting and respectful
relationship among employees, customers and business partners. The company is determined to
create a diverse employee structure and to provide its staﬀ, regardless of their gender, age, religion,
origin, sexual identity or disability, with non-discriminating jobs that oﬀer equal opportunities to
each member of the workforce.

Areas of Action
The following areas of action have been deﬁned for the pillar Employees: “fair working conditions”,
“human resources development”, “health management and occupational safety”, “life-phaseoriented personnel policies” and “diversity and equal opportunity”.
The areas of action for food retail in Germany were recalibrated as part of the strategic process for
sustainability in 2016. The new areas of action were redeﬁned as: “values and culture”, “training
and professional growth”, “health and safety”, “job and phases of life” and “diversity and equal
opportunity”.
All areas of action are monitored by the “Employee” project group, a team that has been led by Dr
Büchel, a member of the Divisional Management Board of Trade Germany who oversees HR and
sustainability, since mid-2016.

Key Performance Indicators
As a way of measuring the progress being achieved in the pillar Employees, REWE Group deﬁned key
performance indicators (KPIs) in 2010 and set a deadline for their achievement by 2015: The
objectives for three KPIs were not fully reached. But the desired number of internal hires for
managerial positions was exceeded with a level of 76.2 per cent:
Key Performance Indicator (KPI)

Status 2015

KPI 1: Lowering accidents from 50.6 per 1,000 FTEs (full-time equivalents) in 2010 to 48.0 by 2015

49.8

KPI 2: Reducing paid sick leave from 3.6 per cent to 3.5 per cent by 2015

4.1 %

KPI 3: Increasing the share of trainees from 4.9 per cent in 2010 to 5.3 per cent by 2015

5.0 %

KPI 4: Boosting the share of internal hires for managerial positions from 65.1 per cent in 2010 to 68.4 per cent

76.2 %

The company’s inability to fulﬁl KPI 1 was mainly due to areas related to labour organisation
(including restructuring and new processes) that increasingly resulted in accidents that were caused
by inattention. REWE Group is addressing this area by conducting exact analysis and increasing its
provision of information (instructional brieﬁngs). As part of in-depth analysis, consideration must
also be given to trends in commuting accidents. The company has very few ways of inﬂuencing such
accidents. But these accidents can have a major impact on this metric (up to 15 per cent of
accidents are commuting accidents).
The increase in paid sick leave (KPI 2) also reﬂects the rise of sick leave seen throughout the
economy for years. One out of two employees took sick leave at least once in 2015, according to an
analysis conducted by the German health insurer DAK Gesundheit. As a result of demographic
change, employees are also becoming older. Health problems frequently recur and are chronic.
They are thus more protracted than they are for younger employees.
The number of trainees did rise slightly. But the percentage increase in the number of trainees was
not achieved because of the growth of overall staﬀ ﬁgures (KPI 3). Structural conditions designed to
further increase the percentage of trainees have been put into place.
As part of the company’s strategy process, the KPIs are currently being reviewed and modiﬁed.

Sustainable Development Goals
During the reporting period, REWE Group measured its sustainability strategy against the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It then identiﬁed and prioritised the SDGs that are relevant
to the company (see the chapter Strategy). One of the highest-priority SDGs was included in the
area of responsibility for the pillar Employees: SDG 8: decent work and economic growth.

Employment
GRI 401: Employment

Management Approach (GRI 103-1, 103-2 and 103-3)
Satisﬁed, hard-working employees form the foundation of REWE Group’s long-term business
success. Understanding this, the company oﬀers attractive and fair working conditions to its
employees. These conditions include fair pay, additional company beneﬁts that extend beyond the
level of negotiated wages, ﬂexible working models that can be adjusted to meet individual employee
needs and tailored oﬀers to facilitate a work/live balance.
During the reporting period, REWE Group received a large number of awards, including:

●

Top Employer in 2015 and 2016, Best Place to Learn, Germany’s 100 Top Employers in the
category Student Barometer, Universum The Most Attractive Employers in Germany as well as, in
2016, Germany’s 100 Top Employers in the category Young Professional Barometer and Graduate
Barometer, Kununu Top Company, MINTminded Company, Focus Money Germany’s best training
companies, second place in the Female Recruiting Award.

For its social commitment, REWE Markt GmbH was presented with the CSR Jobs Award 2016 in the
category Our Family Culture. In addition, REWE Markt GmbH was one of the ﬁnalists for the award
Success Factor Family 2016 that is presented by the German Ministry for Family Aﬀairs, Senior
Citizens, Women and Youth. Moreover, the REWE Region South won the HR Excellence Award in the
category Combine Diversity Management in 2016 for its integration concept “KIMAT”. The concept
is designed to foster the integration of migrants into the labour market and into teams. It builds
bridges between migrants’ home of origin and their future.
As a family-friendly company, REWE began to receive certiﬁcation from the berufundfamilie Service
GmbH, an initiative of the non-proﬁt Hertie Foundation, based on the “audit berufundfamilie” in
2009. About 2,400 REWE stores, six administration sites and three logistics locations have been
earning the certiﬁcation for several years now. The stores, headquarters and logistics centres of
toom Baumarkt DIY stores were added to the process on 31 October 2016. As a result, more than
104,500 employees of REWE Group across Germany are being reached and can proﬁt from more
ﬂexible working models as well as more family- and life-phase-focused human resources policies.
REWE is now the largest company in Germany that has received certiﬁcation from “audit
berufundfamilie”. In Austria, BILLA, MERKUR, BIPA, PENNY and REWE Int. Services have also been
awarded certiﬁcation from “audit berufundfamilie”.
REWE Group oﬀers an array of programmes that are designed to put its family-friendly and lifephase-focused human resources policies into practice. These policies have been added to a number
of binding labour-management agreements. They cover such issues as ﬂexibilisation of work
schedules and locations. In addition, REWE Group partners with external organisations like the
employee welfare group Arbeiterwohlfahrt and the German Youth Hostel Association as a way of
helping employees achieve a work/life balance.
REWE Group supports its employees in all phases of their lives in their reconciliation of work and

family life. The support begins even before parental leave starts and continues once the leave
begins. It includes informational events and a contact-maintenance programme. To help employees
as they return to work, the company’s own child-care support and cooperation agreements for
kindergarten slots in some regions have been markedly expanded in recent years. In 2016, company
day-care centres in Cologne and Frankfurt were increased to a total of 115 slots. A day-care centre
was also opened at the REWE headquarters of the Region South of Full-Range Stores. Cooperation
agreements for kindergarten slots have been signed in some regions as well. The partnership set up
in 2008 with the parental-support association ElternService der Arbeiterwohlfahrt (AWO) was
expanded across Germany in 2016. The services are now available to all employees of headquarters
and regional locations as well as stores and logistics sites. About 145,000 employees are reached
with a broad range of programmes that oﬀer counselling and facilitate the provision of services
related to child care and nursing care. Specially furnished parent-child oﬃces at all locations enable
employees to bring their oﬀspring to work in emergencies. As a result, employees can still perform
their regular jobs while keeping an eye on their playing children.
A large number of support options related to child care are also available during holiday periods.
REWE Group oﬀers holiday leisure times, health trips and free youth hostel membership to all
employees across Germany. Regional locations are also increasingly focusing on the issue of child
care. These activities include special regional programmes like child care during company events,
emergency child care, holiday activities and toy boxes and high chairs in canteens.
Support with nursing-care situations is also becoming a higher priority. To supplement the new
German Family Caregiver Leave Act (Familienpﬂegezeitgesetz), REWE Group completed a new
labour-management agreement that oﬀers many beneﬁts to employees in 2015/2016. These
beneﬁts include:

●

Exceeding legal requirements, which specify nursing-care and family caregiver leave for
employers with 25 or more employees, REWE Group provides employees of all companies with
nursing-care and family caregiver leave.

●

Employees are permitted to take two paid hours from work one time. They can use this time to
take care of visits to government oﬃces and prepare required applications for nursing care.

●

Employees return to their original jobs after completing their nursing-care and family caregiver
leave, as long as no important company-related situations arise.

●

The ﬁrst-contact oﬃces staﬀed by internal advisers are being set up to assist aﬀected employees.
During meetings, initial information and emotional support are provided.

Employees also have the option of taking time oﬀ from work as part of a sabbatical. During such a
sabbatical, employees can take up six months oﬀ from work without citing any reasons within a
period of 12 months. During this period, employees receive an adjusted amount of salary as part of
compensation that ensures that social insurance coverage is maintained.
Regular employee surveys are a key aspect of the appreciative human resources management
practised by REWE Group. They reﬂect company morale and identify problem areas. During the
reporting period, REWE Group wrote to nearly 150,000 employees from selected business units
across Europe, or about 50 per cent of all employees. More than half of them responded to the
survey. The evaluation of responses found that employees of REWE Group are satisﬁed with their
jobs. The best grades were given for work environment, transparency and clarity, the mission
statement and identiﬁcation. Each business unit is evaluating the results of the employee surveys
and is developing speciﬁc measures on the basis of them.
REWE Group welcomes the statutory minimum wage approved by the German government in 2014.
In its work with contractors, REWE Group focuses on compliance with minimum social standards. In
2011, REWE Group introduced the “Guideline on Minimum Standards for the Use of Contractor
Employees” on the national level. The guideline applies to the use of both temporary employment
agencies and to work and service agreements. The company will work with only those contract
partners who pledge to apply minimum social standards and to pay any minimum negotiated wages

as well as the statutory minimum wage for their employees. To ensure that the contract partners
comply with the standards, REWE Group has worked with TÜV Rheinland, a leading international
technical service provider in Germany, to develop an auditing process. The audits are conducted in
the areas of product replenishment, picking and cleaning personnel. During the reporting period,
audits were conducted in all strategic business units that work with contract partners.

LaborManagement Relations
GRI 402: Labor/Management Relations

Management Approach (GRI 103-1, 103-2 and 103-3)
Statutory, collective-bargaining and company rules are implemented in a trusting relationship with
employee representatives. Employee co-determination is a high priority at REWE Group. Nearly all
employees in the chain stores, logistics operation and administration are represented by works
councils – an optimal structure for chain-store retailing. The Works Council and management
maintain a trusting working relationship.
In addition, the combine-wide Guidelines for Sustainable Business Practices are applied. These
guidelines are based on the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the conventions of the
International Labour Association (ILO). The Guidelines say: “We respect the right of employees to
form free, independent employee organisations and to conduct free negotiations regarding wages
and employee rights.”

GRI 402-1: Minimum number of weeks’ notice

Minimum notice periods regarding operational changes
In its position as elected employee representatives or through representatives on the Supervisory
Board, the Works Council plays a role in nearly all decisions taken by REWE Group. In observance of
co-determination and other participation rights, employee committees are provided with information
in a timely manner, their views on issues are heard and agreements are reached with them. REWE
Group maintains a dynamic, intense and trusting relationship with Works Councils. Their
representatives are members of a large number of company bodies, including the IT and logistics
committees. Company-related changes are jointly discussed at an early stage.

Occupational Health
and Safety
GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety

Management Approach (GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)
In the summer of 2016, organisational responsibility for combine-wide health management was
transferred from the holding area of Human Resources Combine to HR Services Labour and Health.
This oﬃce coordinates concepts for occupational health management, occupational safety and
occupational medicine. It provides the strategic business units with services in these areas as well as
with assistance with occupational safety, preparation of screening topics for health protection,
Fit.Netz activities and help with projects. During the reporting period, REWE Markt GmbH appointed
its own oﬃcers for occupational health and safety. In REWE supermarkets, trained employees are
responsible for occupational health and safety. This work is carefully coordinated by the manager of
occupational health and safety. At REWE International AG, full-time specialists in occupational
safety and external experts in occupational medicine provide support to the work sites of trade and
headquarters companies in accordance with the German Occupational Safety Act
(Arbeitnehmerschutzgesetz).
In compliance with governmental and employers’ liability insurance association regulations, work
sites are regularly inspected, systematic analysis of accidents is conducted, evaluations of
occupational safety reports by government oﬃcials (including county governments, trade
supervisory centres, the German Occupational Health and Safety Agency and an employers’ liability
insurance association) are performed and regular meetings of the Occupational Safety Committee
are held. Another key goal is to increase employees’ awareness levels about occupational safety as
well as healthful working conditions and processes. As part of a continuous development process,
focal points are regularly reviewed and expanded. One of the focal points is to develop “technically
modern” and eﬃcient risk assessment. The goal is to create a system that can be used to identify
and evaluate risk areas and to develop recommendations for suitable implementation measures.
Risk assessment is based on systematic store inspections using electronic measurement of risks.
The system “Online Risk Assessment” of the employers’ liability insurance association
Berufsgenossenschaft Handel und Warendistribution was introduced by managers with the
assistance of specialists in occupational health and safety. This system was designed in particular
for PENNY, toom Baumarkt DIY stores and REWE Digital (as well as the logistics locations of these
companies). With the help of tablet computers or store PCs, an electronic checklist of relevant
factors is accessed in the process and evaluated in terms of potential risks.
In addition, employee surveys and checklists that are documented in IT systems to the greatest
extent possible are used during psychological risk assessments. This process also uses employeefocused instruments like worker forums, (health) committees, work-situation analysis and other
moderated workshop processes.
To serve as a fundamental instrument for training in REWE and PENNY stores, an e-learning
programme on the topic of occupational health and safety was rolled out in all stores in 2012 and is
attended by employees and managers. Annual reviews are held to ensure that employees retain

what they learned. Special topics, particularly local conditions and the operation and use of
machines and devices, are discussed by managers with users. PENNY also trains ﬁre safety and
evacuation assistants in its stores. In every store, one to two employees and the store manager
complete the e-learning course. They also receive regular practical training. PENNY’s e-learning
course on ﬁre safety has been honoured by the employers’ liability insurance association
Berufsgenossenschaft Handel und Warendistribution.
In 2014 and 2015, PENNY developed an interactive programme (Azupoly) for use during initial
training activities for trainees. The playful approach to conveying information in terms of an
“instructional brieﬁng” is designed to provide young people with comprehensible and practical
knowledge about the topics of occupational health and safety promotion. In 2015, Azupoly was
presented with the Prevention Award by the employers’ liability insurance association. Since then,
the programme has become an annual standard.
In addition to addressing “traditional” occupational health and safety issues, REWE Group
systematically works to promote the good health of its employees. The company’s goal is to further
lower the number of paid sick days. To reach this goal, REWE Group has expanded an array of
health-promotion programmes and projects as well as created new ones. In one reﬂection of this
eﬀort, a single company-wide service provider is responsible for occupational medicine support of
the sales lines of REWE Group (REWE, PENNY, toom Baumarkt and DER Touristik). This work is
overseen nationally by HR Services Labour and Health and is coordinated with the heads of the
business units and occupational safety experts in a needs-based manner that corresponds to
strategic objectives.

GRI 403-2: Types of injury and rates of injury,
occupational diseases, lost days, and absenteeism, and
number of work-related fatalities
The accident statistics tracked by REWE Group cover occupational accidents and
the lost work days caused by them. They also facilitate an evaluation by gender and
work area. Like the statistics of the employers’ liability insurance association, the
ﬁgures involve reportable accidents per 1,000 full-time equivalents (FTEs).
In 2015, the accident rate was 49.9 accidents per 1,000 FTEs. This total was 1.6 accidents per
1,000 FTEs higher than in 2014. In 2016, the rate fell to 46.3 accidents per 1,000 FTEs and was two
accidents per 1,000 FTEs lower than in 2014. The number of occupational and commuting
accidents declined during the reporting period. Regrettably, three fatalities were reported in both
2015 and 2016.
Sick leave at REWE Group rose once again during the reporting period. The total was 6.1 per cent in
2015 and 6.3 per cent in 2016 (2014: 5.9 per cent). Paid sick leave was about 4 per cent during the
reporting period, a minimal rise since 2014 (2014: 3.9 per cent). In general, sick days are rising
throughout Germany.
REWE Group has increasingly focused on the health report covering all types of health insurance
schemes since its introduction in 2008 and discusses it in various committees. The health report
covers cases of work incapacity in REWE Group reported to major health insurance providers. Data
about occupational illnesses are not documented. But experience has shown that only a small
number of recognised occupational diseases are found at REWE Group.
Like for the entire retail business, robberies remain an issue at REWE Group. The aﬀected
employees can suﬀer physical and psychological damage as a result of such incidents, causing them
to miss work for a signiﬁcant period of time. Acute intervention following traumatic events can
provide major assistance. In 2014, 213 employees were victims of robberies in Germany and
Austria. During the reporting period, this total fell to 192 (2015) and to 197 (2016). Use of acute

intervention, a process that provides professional psychological support following a traumatic event,
rose above 60 per cent REWE and PENNY during the reporting period as a result of increased
educational campaigns and process optimisation (the total throughout the area covered by the
employers’ liability insurance association Berufsgenossenschaft Handel und Warendistribution was
about 20 per cent).
REWE Group service providers are generally independent, decentralised contract partners. As a
result, data about accident rates, sick days and fatalities involving external service providers are not
collected currently.

Austrian law does not require a distinction to be drawn between occupational and commuting accidents. For this reason, this
distinction is not available in the systems and cannot be evaluated. Only the total number of accidents (both occupational and
commuting accidents) are reported for Austria. As a result, the ﬁgures for Austria are not included in the total for the area of
application of the sustainability report in the columns occupational accidents and commuting accidents.

GRI 403-3: Workers with high incidence or high risk
of diseases related to their occupation
There is no indication that employees have a high illness rate or health risks as a result of their jobs.
To encourage health-conscious behaviour among the company’s employees, a range of projects was
carried out during the reporting period. The prevention courses oﬀered by Fit.Netz Köln, the
company’s occupational health management, enjoyed high levels of participation: In 2015 and
2016, a total of about 3,000 course slots were ﬁlled. The issue of workplace ergonomics plays a
major role in the company’s stores and logistics operations. The repetitive movements that
employees perform in these areas as well incorrect ways of lifting, carrying and standing frequently
result in pain and missed days at work. For this reason, the ergonomics training courses “lifting and
carrying” and “cash register” were conducted in many regions during the reporting period with the
aim of promoting the proper arrangement and design of workstations. Special days promoting back
health were held as well.
In health promotion activities, dealing with stress and mental strain plays an important role. Mental
strain can sometimes have a devastating eﬀect on people’s employability, motivation and job
performance. For this reason, REWE Group worked with the Institute for Health Promotion in 2011
to develop a project called “LoS! – Lebensphasenorientierte Selbsthilfekompetenz” (Life PhaseOriented Self-Help Skills). From 2013 to 2016, additional colleague-level initial advisers were
trained during nine courses. As a result, the company now has 138 LoS! programme advisers who
can serve as points of contact for employees going through diﬃcult phases in their lives. In addition,
REWE Group provides ﬂu shots, cancer screening and health-focused trips in many sales lines.
The activities of the company health-promotion programmes in REWE headquarters companies in
Austria focus on the biopsychosocial health of employees and managers. They are broken down into
the categories of workplace ergonomics, nutrition, psyche/relaxation, sports/exercise, prevention
and work-schedule ﬂexibility.
On the regional level, REWE – and PENNY on occasion – oﬀered a broad range of preventive
programmes. These included personal consultation at all administrative locations, health days,
ﬁtness checks, individual courses and workshops as well as online coaching courses in connection
with the German health insurer DAK Gesundheit. In addition, in 2015 and 2016, the “Tour de
REWE” was organised in a number of regions. In this programme, the REWE Health Vehicle visited

various stores and oﬀered check-up and information modules like cardiovascular and vein scans for
employees.
In 2016, the “Tour de REWE” campaign in the Lehrte region won the Prevention Award of the
employers’ liability insurance association Berufsgenossenschaft Handel und Warendistribution. In
2015, the company was given gold status as part of a campaign called “Healthy Companies Hesse”
that was conducted in the central German state of the same name. In 2016, the Healthy Companies
Initiative named it one of “Germany’s most active companies”.
In 2016, PENNY organised workshops on the topic of “managing healthfully” for about 350 of its
managers.
During the reporting period, toom Baumarkt DIY stores decentralised health promotion. As part of
this eﬀort, local addiction counselling provided by trained experts was oﬀered in all regions, and
meetings for personal consultation were introduced at the administrative oﬃce of the headquarters.
In addition, the health-promotion programmes include seminars on “managing healthfully”, health
days and a health olympics.
The pilot project “Voll im Leben – Kenn Dein Limit” (Living Life to Its Fullest – Know Your Limit) aims
its addiction prevention activities directly at adolescents and young employees in the full-range
region Southwest. It was conducted in 2013 for the ﬁrst time with about 350 trainees and was
honoured as a “project with role model character” by the employers’ liability insurance association
Berufsgenossenschaft Handel und Warendistribution (BGHW). As a result of the strong response
among young employees, “Voll im Leben – Kenn Dein Limit” became a permanent part of training at
REWE Southwest in 2014.
Company integration management assists employees who return to work after long health-related
absences. It is aligned with legal regulations and takes account of company conditions like location
and employee structures. Furthermore, all employees in the Region South can use the rehabilitation
network Netzwerk Reha REWE – a partnership project organised by REWE, the German State
Pension Agency Bavaria South, Swabia and Northern Bavaria as well as a number of rehabilitation
centres. The network enables employees to receive systematic, high-quality and work-related
rehabilitation.

Education and Training Programmes
GRI 404: Training and Education

Management Approach (GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)
Positioning REWE Group as an attractive employer in order to recruit talented individuals is an
important goal of the company. The demographic shift and the shortage of skilled employees arising
from this trend have turned this goal into an even higher priority. The company is working to recruit
as many skilled employees and executives from its own ranks as possible and to create a long-term
relationship with qualiﬁed and motivated employees.

Training
REWE Group oﬀers training opportunities that extend from retailing, wholesale and international
trade to food production, IT and logistics. And, not least, REWE Group also oﬀers exciting training
programmes in the multifaceted world of travel and tourism.

REWE Group Oﬀers More Than 20 Diﬀerent Training Occupations
As part of its training activities, the company oﬀers classroom instruction and extensively applies elearning and blended-learning concepts that combine classroom and online training. This special
learning concept has been applied successfully by the company for years. By employing it, REWE in
Germany focuses in particular on promoting the professional growth of its trainees. As part of their
programmes, they receive a free tablet computer at the beginning of their apprenticeship that they
can keep after completing the programme. With this tablet computer – or their own smartphone –
and the company’s proprietary learning app, the trainees can study for tests anywhere.
During the reporting period, all product-related subjects taught to all trainees of REWE Markt GmbH
were digitalized and oﬀered via their own e-learning app. In addition, the training programmes of
PENNY launched a partnership with prozubi – an online learning platform for trainees in commercial
occupations. As a result, PENNY’s trainees can prepare for their ﬁnal exams with the help of a large
number of quiz questions based on original tests administered by the German Chamber of Industry
and Commerce.

Dual Study Programme With REWE Group
In addition to traditional trainee occupations, REWE Group gives people an opportunity to take part
in a college-level programme that combines theory and practice. It conducts this programme in
conjunction with such institutions of higher education as the European University of Applied
Sciences (EUFH), the Baden-Württemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW), the University of
Applied Sciences for Business (FHDW) and the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences. The
courses of study focus in particular on the areas of trade management and tourism management as
well as business information technology.

Trainee Programme as an Entry-Level Opportunity for University Graduates
The trainee programmes of REWE Group provide university graduates who have studied a broad
range of topics with interesting and multifaceted career-launching positions. The work performed

during the 18-month to 24-month training programme generally focuses on the particular job area.
Assignments in relevant interface areas are also involved, including those abroad. During the
reporting period, approximately 29 university graduates began their on-the-job training:

●

PENNY: Purchasing (two trainees), marketing (three trainees), national sales (one trainee)

●

REWE: Regional expansion (three trainees), regional sales (eight trainees), regional human
resources (two trainees)

●

- toom Baumarkt DIY stores: Sales and category management (ﬁve to ten trainees)

A trainee programme for independent retailers was launched in 2016. It consists of a 24-month
training phase and a subsequent 12-month assignment as a store manager. The goal is to become
an independent REWE retailer. The programme is aimed at university graduates who want to be selfemployed and have a strong interest in trade. The training includes speciﬁc job assignments in a
number of diﬀerent stores. It also involves work on the ﬁeld sales forces as well as in the respective
regional headquarters and the company’s main oﬃce in Cologne.

Development of Young Employees at REWE Group
The association REWE-Nachwuchsförderung e.V. began to conduct the sustainability competition
“REWE Group Star” in 2013: In a combine-wide team competition, trainees and young employees
can jointly plan and carry out sustainability projects based on one of the company’s four pillars of
sustainability. In doing so, they gain an understanding of the importance of sustainability in trade.
The ﬁnals of the REWE Group Star, including the recognition of the top projects, are held as part of a
ceremony honouring the best work. During the annual ceremony, the best trainees of a training class
throughout the company (all trainees including dual programme students and graduates of
programmes to develop young employees) are honoured by their trainers and members of the
Management Board during a major event that includes an evening programme. All trainees who
complete their programme with a grade of at least 1.9 (upper second-class or 2:1) are invited to the
ceremony.
In 2015 and 2016, a total of 517 trainees and 204 graduates of programmes to develop young
employees were honoured.
In 2012, the individual strategic business units became solely responsible for trainee marketing.
These units can recruit new trainees more systematically and cover the need for skilled employees in
the process.
In 2015/16, new employer campaigns for trainees in many strategic business units were launched,
including one in the job portal “Whatchado”. The question that Whatchado is designed to clarify in
the target group is: What do I want to do later? Both REWE Group and REWE Markt GmbH present
their training and career opportunities there. In separate videos, trainees, managers and
representatives of the company’s management team talk about their everyday jobs. Other employer
campaigns for REWE Group, PENNY and toom Baumarkt DIY stores are also widely communicated.

GRI 404-2: Programs for upgrading employee skills
and transition assistance programs
Programmes that support the continued employability of employees
REWE Group provides all employees and managers with a broad range of internal education and
training programmes that are designed to help these individuals to grow in both personal and
professional terms.
REWE Group constantly expands its range of employee development activities. The challenge of this
work is to design the training courses in such a way that they meet the sale lines’ broad range of

needs while also considering the employees individual requirements. This is done by oﬀering
comprehensive seminar programmes, individual advanced training and coaching sessions to all
employees throughout their entire careers at REWE Group.
As a rule, external training programmes attended while an employee is still working are arranged on
an individual basis and ﬁnancially supported.

Education
A multifaceted range of seminars is also oﬀered to all employees. This program is centrally managed
by a learning centre for REWE Group, REWE Markt GmbH, PENNY, toom Baumarkt DIY stores and
all other companies in Cologne. In all regions, regional programmes are oﬀered in addition to
speciﬁc courses in other strategic business units. The education oﬀerings are complemented by
supplemental topic-speciﬁc academies for particular company areas. These seminars are designed
with the (future) needs of the particular target group in mind, including the Human Resources
Academy with a speciﬁc course programme for (prospective) HR employees or the Real Estate
Academy.
In addition to the broad range of training opportunities for all employees of REWE Group, the
company provides executives with special education programmes like myCampus. This demanding
internal education programme provides needs-based knowledge and fosters cross-company
networking among managers. With classroom courses, lectures, coaching and further learning
opportunities, myCampus supports the continuous professional growth of upper-level managers.
Among other things, managers attend an annual seminar called “Sustainability 2.0” where they have
an opportunity to discuss how sustainability can be integrated into the company’s management and
culture. In 2018, the topic “The Proﬁtability of Sustainability” will be studied during a follow-up
workshop.

Other Educational Opportunities
New, innovative course concepts are continuously tested and implemented in work that extends
beyond the current educational programmes. They include:

●

“Lunch & Learn” – a programme for Cologne headquarters departments: Interested employees
can attend talks or take part in discussions about various topics during their lunch break.

●

toom Baumarkt DIY stores: Web conferences and virtual classrooms used for teaching purposes.

●

REWE Markt GmbH: Training courses and coaching sessions done in cooperation with seminar
actors or boot camps whose content is based on attendees’ needs or is developed in advance by
the students themselves. In addition, the ﬁrst ﬁreside chats with managers and independent
retailers were organised.

Personnel Development Programmes
As part of systematic personnel development activities, every strategic business unit oﬀers
programmes aimed at particular target groups. These courses teach valuable skills to employees
who work in sales or have administrative positions or prepare them for future jobs or roles as
managers, store managers or store-management employees. With its Management Academy, REWE
Group provides programmatic and individual support to high potential candidates working on the
management level below the top executive group. The courses oﬀered by the Management
Academy address the topic of sustainability on a number of diﬀerent levels: Reﬂection and
discussion about an individual’s own attitude in the introductory programme and practical activities
during excursions (including on “Sustainability Day”).
Examples:

●

On the store level, the strategic business unit PENNY develops and fosters prospective and new
store managers with the programme “Manager Development DISCOUNT”, or “FeDI”. This

programme prepares these individuals in professional and personal terms to assume the
responsibilities of a store manager. The company also oﬀers targeted programmes to prepare
employees and managers to assume speciﬁc positions.
●

REWE Markt GmbH operates a Junior Campus that helps young independent retailers to prepare
for self-employment. Twenty-one people began the programme in 2015, 19 of them completed it
in 2016.

●

Many strategic business units also provide trainers with “train the trainer” programmes certiﬁed
by the Chamber of Industry and Commerce as well as with regular trainer workshops.

Digital Learning
REWE Group is increasingly employing digital learning and blended-learning concepts because
digital learning has proven to be an eﬃcient way to reach all employees and gives employees of
some business units the opportunity to study at home. With blended learning, a combination of
classroom seminars and digital courses, knowledge is retained for a longer period of time and the
practical transfer is facilitated by repetition and follow-up work. Furthermore, signiﬁcantly more
training can be oﬀered on the store level than was provided during the pre-digitalization age.
The training portfolio includes obligatory units, some of which are required by law. It covers such
topics as food and personal hygiene as well as contains voluntary courses that include career and
successor planning for employees.
A number of individual e-learning platforms for individual national and international business units
are operated: for the employees of REWE/PENNY (stores) and toom Baumarkt (DIY stores), for
headquarters employees of the strategic business units in Germany (REWE, PENNY, REWE
headquarters organisation, toom Baumarkt DIY stores, REWE Digital, FÜR SIE, Glockenbrot, DER
Touristik) and for regional employees of DER Touristik (including travel agencies and travel
directors). A range of e-learning platforms for diﬀerent business units in Austria has also been
developed. About 100 e-learning courses are currently being oﬀered throughout the company.

The objective of the e-learning courses is to teach practical knowledge, occasionally by taking a
playful approach. The appealing and interactively prepared training units are designed to support
and educate employees through the use of an intuitive learning format.
The innovative training concepts have already received a number of awards, including the ELearning Award 2015 in the category of video training that is presented by the eLearning Journal,
the E-Learning Award 2016 in the category of learning app for the trainee app “Frisches Wissen”
(fresh knowledge) and the HR Excellence Award 2015 in the category of learning and development
strategy.
During the reporting period, several additions were tested and implemented on occasion as part of
the work done to continuously improve the training concepts. This eﬀort included conceiving and

testing a new cloud-based IT platform for the strategic business units of REWE, PENNY and
headquarters departments in Cologne and the regions. The rollout will be done step by step in 2017
and 2018. In addition, semi-annual roundtable discussions with all e-learning managers were held to
discuss projects, challenges and improvement opportunities and to create an internal network.

Sustainability Training
All employees of REWE stores and toom Baumärkte DIY stores take e-learning courses on
sustainability. In addition, all purchasers at REWE Far East and in the non-food area receive training
in relevant sustainability issues, including the Code of Conduct of the Business Social Compliance
Initiative (BSCI). Other courses address raw materials, an area about which REWE Group has
prepared guidelines. These raw materials include ﬁsh, palm oil and soybeans. In addition, the
training focuses on special issues that apply to REWE Group like ways to avoid environmentally
harmful chemicals.

Redundancies
For employees whom REWE Group declares redundant, the company works with employee
representatives to develop a redundancy programme when necessary. Such programmes frequently
include qualiﬁcation activities for the employee that are designed to help him or her ﬁnd another
position.

GRI 404-3: Percentage of employees receiving regular
performance and career development reviews
With its systematic career and succession planning (CSP), REWE Group ensures that the right
employees are at the right place at the right time. It is a key aspect of company-wide talent
management. The career and succession planning process is designed to recruit skilled workers and
managers from the company’s own ranks, to identify high-potential employees at an early stage, to
create a long-term relationship with qualiﬁed and motivated employees and to develop these
individuals’ skills.
To meet these goals, regular performance and job-potential assessments, job-potential conferences
and professional-development dialogues are conducted in the strategic business units and in
company headquarters.
In each strategic business unit as well as in the headquarters, the CSP process begins with a review
of the responsibilities contained in the job description. A manager will evaluate the performance of
an employee on the basis of task fulﬁlment and abilities from the REWE Group skill model. In
addition, a job-potential evaluation is conducted and future professional-growth measures are
agreed upon. This appraisal and the employee’s own self-assessment are then discussed during socalled potential conferences held by management.
During the potential conferences, managers on a particular hierarchical level or in a
segment/department discuss employees whom they directly supervise. The aim is to develop joint
standards for evaluating performance and potential, to set up targeted and eﬀective development
planning and to create the basis for systematic succession planning. The potential conferences for
top executives and for managers on the levels directly below them are held annually. Potential
conferences for other managerial and employee levels can be held every two years.
The subsequent annual development meeting ensures that feedback about work results, aspects of
the working relationship and questions about personal and professional growth are discussed,
documented and systematically addressed. The immediate supervisor conducts the conﬁdential
development meeting with each of his or her employees once a year.
In 2015, the CSP process was conducted for 18,893 employees, from top executives to sales and

logistics managers. The total rose to 20,016 in 2016.
The employee groups covered by the CSP are being expanded annually. During the reporting period,
selected employee groups of the REWE Digital strategic business units were added.
In addition, the conception and implementation of a cloud-based IT platform were initiated for the
strategic business units REWE and PENNY, for headquarters departments in Cologne as well as for
all top executives throughout the company. With the introduction of the Talent Suite, work on the
topic of integrated talent management (ITM) is being intensiﬁed and processes related to recruiting,
learning and talent management linked – with the goal of simplifying the search for talented
individuals, internal hiring and the professional growth of employees. In future, the CSP will be
integrated into a new software. The pilot phase is planned for 2017, followed by rollout at the end of
2018.
The goal of increasing the share of internal hirings of managers to 68.4 per cent by 2015 was
already achieved in 2012. The total was 76.2 per cent in 2015 and 77.3 per cent in 2016.

Diversity and Equal Opportunity
GRI 405: Diversity and Equal Opportunity

Management Approach (GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)
The promotion of diversity in the company is a critical factor in its business success. As a company
that focuses on diversity, REWE Group improves its ability to adapt to changing market conditions
and enhances its competitive position in the race to recruit qualiﬁed skilled employees. With this in
mind, REWE Group focuses its personnel management work on creating a diverse employee
structure and on maintaining a discrimination-free workplace for employees irrespective of their
gender, age, religion, sexual identity, origin or disability in which all employees have equal
opportunities. This also includes equal pay for men and women.
In this eﬀort, the company focuses on the following issues:

●

Generation mainstreaming encompasses respect for all generations in the company’s culture and
the promotion of good working relationships among various age groups. In light of the growing
number of older employees in the company, this work plays an important role.

●

Disability mainstreaming ensures that employees with disabilities are treated equally. This eﬀort
includes work areas and work stations adapted to the needs of the disabled. People with
disabilities and people at risk of disability can turn to the company’s representative for the
disabled at any time. This representative assists them with the preparation of applications to the
German Ofﬁce for Social Services, reintegration into the work world following a long absence due
to illness and all other legal questions.

●

Appreciation of cultural diversity is the focal point of cultural mainstreaming, an eﬀort in which
REWE Group promotes intercultural and open structures and processes.

●

The gender balance is designed to further the gender-speciﬁc promotion of professional and
personal abilities and development opportunities.

The commitment to the discrimination-free formulation of company human resources policies is a
fundamental part of the Guidelines for Sustainable Business Practices at REWE Group. It is also a
fundamental component of the code of conduct that applies to all employees and managers.
In 2014, a network called diﬀerent together, or di.to, was created by Cologne-based employees of
REWE Group. The network is designed to help homosexual employees to network in the work world
and to foster a dialogue outside their own sales lines. A ten-employee working group is responsible
for setting up the network and organising regular meetings and events, among other things. With a
successful rainbow-sticker campaign in June 2016, di.to encouraged all REWE stores to
demonstrate tolerance and diversity by displaying the symbol on the stores’ front doors. di.to also
serves as a contact partner for employees who feel that they are being discriminated against as a
result of their sexual identity. The network now has about 130 members, and more and more
regional networks are being added to it. The Full-Range Store Region South set up di.to South in
2016.
Respectful and responsible interactions with one another are also a fundamental aspect of the
corporate culture of toom Baumarkt DIY stores. toom has been working closely with the

organisations of Lebenshilfe, a group that helps people with disabilities, since 2014. The focus of
this eﬀort involves active diversity and respectful relationships among people with and without
disabilities that are practised as part of joint projects done within the framework of local
partnerships, internships and outsourced workshop jobs.

Integration of Refugees
In response to the refugee situation, REWE Group has intensiﬁed its social commitment. With the
help of the company, refugees could be quickly and unbureaucratically assisted during the initial
arrival process and later with their integration into society and work life.
When the large number of refugees arrived in Germany during the fall of 2015, the business group
and store regions provided fast assistance. As part of this eﬀort, REWE Group donated 11,000
jackets, 2,000 pairs of warm trousers and about 10,000 blankets to a number of cities through the
German Red Cross. It also arranged for and donated care and food packages. Direct local assistance
was provided through the German sales regions of REWE Group. The focus of this work was
supplying initial reception facilities with hygienic and drug store items. A large number of REWE and
PENNY stores also organised spontaneous help campaigns conducted by employees and customers
to provide fast local support to refugees.
REWE International AG expanded its social commitment as well and addressed a number of diﬀerent
areas, with a focus on children and young refugees. A total of 500,000 euros was donated to the
refugee support programme of the Catholic charity Caritas to support children and young people.
The funds were used to set up shared accommodations for minors who came to Germany without
their parents. In addition, the initiative “Lernen macht Schule” (Learning Catches On) was expanded
by adding such things as special German-language courses.
To enable young refugees to more systematically enter the labour market, trainee positions were
ﬁlled by refugees between the ages of 18 and 25 across Germany. REWE Group also continues to
support its partnership with JOBLINGE – an initiative that supports young unemployed individuals.
At the beginning of 2016, a programme called JOBLINGE Kompass was launched as a way of
providing qualiﬁcations to young refugees as early as possible and integrating them into the labour
market. In this eﬀort, employees of REWE Group act as mentors to the young people. As a result,
employees of REWE, DER Touristik, PENNY and toom Baumarkt DIY stores can easily work as
volunteers (programme “Ehrensache”, or Act of Honour). The company also initiated a language
café for the ﬁrst time in 2016: Volunteer employees and refugees meet in the company
headquarters in Cologne to speak German with one another and to help the refugees to gain and ﬁnd
a lingual home.
The integration initiative “KIMAT” was launched in the REWE Region South to help to improve the
integration of migrants into the labour market and to foster intercultural exchanges. The initiative
was presented the HR Excellence Award of Quadriga University and the trade journal Human
Resources Manager in 2016.
In 2017, a pilot project called “REWE Trainees Support Refugees All the Way to Training” will be
launched in the REWE Region Central.

European Recruiting
In future, prospective trainees in full-range stores and college graduates will be systematically
recruited as PENNY store managers in European countries outside Germany as part of the
“European Recruiting” programme. REWE Group intends to provide new employees with a long-term
career opportunity in Germany. In this process, the company will oﬀer both groups a training or job
opportunity. In this connection, PENNY recruited ten employees from Croatia and successfully
assisted them with an intensive orientation programme that included language training.

Advancement of Women

Like many companies, REWE Group continues to focus on the issue of inequality among women and
men in top management positions. REWE Group intends to address this question by conducting a
project called “Equal Opportunity for Women” that is part of the initiative “Diversity at REWE Group”.
In 2016, about 100 female employees from all sales lines attended a series of workshops. The
objective was to determine how female employees of REWE Group view the company’s
(management) culture, what they consider to be factors that foster and hamper career development
and which steps they think should be taken. On the basis of these results, the company developed
measures that are designed to help women to join its managerial ranks and increase the appeal of
managerial positions. In 2017, the related human resources measures will be introduced.
Organisational work/life balance programmes will increasingly support this eﬀort.

GRI 405-1: Diversity of governance bodies and
employees
Women made up 69.4 per cent of the total workforce of REWE Group in 2015 and 69.0 per cent in
2016. They also composed about 48 per cent of the company’s managers (2015: 48.0 per cent,
2016: 48.4 per cent). The share of women among the company’s top management was
11.0 per cent and 10.3 per cent.
The Supervisory Board of REWE-Zentral-Aktiengesellschaft (RZAG) had 18 ordinary members (17
men and one woman) in 2015. The total was 18 (16 men and two women) in 2016. The Supervisory
Board of REWE-ZENTRALFINANZ eG (RZF) had 20 ordinary members (18 men and two women) in
both 2015 and 2016. No women were members of the Management Board in the reporting period.
No women were members of the Managing Board or the Supervisory Board of REWE International
AG.
REWE Group determines the employment rate of people with disabilities in accordance with
section 2 of the German Social Welfare Code (Sozialgesetzbuch) and in Austria in accordance with
the Disabled Persons Employment Act (Behinderteneinstellungsgesetz). Under this deﬁnition, the
employment rate of employees with disabilities at REWE Group was 3.1 per cent in 2016, a slight
increase from previous years (2014: 2.9 per cent, 2015: 3.0 per cent). In Germany, no
comprehensive reporting requirement applies to people with disabilities. For this reason, all
employees with a reported disability are included in this calculation.

Equal Treatment
GRI 406: Equal Treatment

Management Approach (GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)
The corporate culture of REWE Group is characterised by a trusting and respectful relationship
among customers, employees and business partners. This commitment is spelled out in the
company’s fundamental values. In addition, the Guidelines for Sustainable Business Practices
apply to all employees and business partners. These guidelines include a clearly formulated ban on
discrimination: “We do not tolerate discrimination in employment and in the workplace for reasons
of gender, race, religion, ethnic heritage, age, nationality, marital status, sexual orientation,
disability, social background or political orientation.” This principle applies to the hiring of new
employees, current employees and business partners.
Each strategic business unit has a contact partner to whom employees can turn in cases of
discrimination. These advisers are found in compliance sections, the Works Council and the di.to
network (you will ﬁnd more information on the topic of di.to (diﬀerent together) in section GRI 405:
Diversity and Equal Opportunity). In addition, employees can consult with managers and the HR
Department. Any report of discrimination will be thoroughly investigated. Each case will be treated
conﬁdentially. When a case is investigated, personal meetings with the aﬀected employee or
employees are held and the Works Council is consulted.
In 2015, REWE International AG worked with the social company DisAbility Performance to devise a
DisAbility strategy. The DisAbility strategy is a component of the sustainability strategy and includes
speciﬁc goals that are to be achieved by 2019. During the reporting period, a number of steps were
taken, including the creation of the position of “DisAbility manager” who is responsible for reaching
goals and introducing programmes throughout the combine, setting up an internal DisAbility
network and developing a DisAbility charter. The number of people with disabilities (preferential
disability) in the company is to rise from 350 employees to 800.

GRI 406-1: Incidents of discrimination and corrective
actions taken
Incidents of discrimination and corrective actions taken
REWE Group conducts a thorough investigation of discrimination allegations. Should the allegations
turn out to be true, disciplinary and possibly personnel measures are taken. No discrimination cases
were reported in Germany during the reporting period. In Austria, nine cases were reported in 2015
and three in 2016. Meetings were held with the aﬀected individuals in all cases. Some of the cases
resulted in termination of employment. With a campaign called “Sexual Harassment and
Discrimination – NO Thanks!” REWE Group in Austria showed employees how they can ﬁght such
behaviour. Specially trained employees can provide support to aﬀected individuals at any time – by
doing such things as having a conﬁdential conversation with them or actively taking steps.

REWE Group Sustainability Report 2015/2016

Social Involvement
Pillar of Sustainability: Social Involvement
In its role as a reliable partner, REWE Group commits its resources to areas where it does business
and to the world’s more destitute regions. In the process, the company works with strong partners
who can deliver high-impact support as a result of their local experience. One major objective of
REWE Group’s involvement is to create long-term, reliable partnerships for all players. When
possible, REWE Group integrates its customers and employees into its projects. This approach
strengthens the sense of community and expands the projects’ reach.
In its involvement, REWE Group places a high priority on promoting the development of children and
adolescents. One aim of the company’s eﬀorts is to eliminate unequal opportunities. In this work,
the company helps socially disadvantaged young people while they are attending school and taking
steps to enter the work world. REWE Group also plays an active role in projects designed to inform
children and adolescents at an early age about the need to get plenty of exercise and eat balanced
meals. Access to education also plays a major role in the international involvement of REWE Group.
The company supports school construction projects, thus helping to improve educational
opportunities of children and adolescents.
For the concept of sustainability to take root in society, we need well-informed consumers. And it is
easy to understand why: They will be the only individuals who will explore the issue and integrate it
into their shopping decisions. For this reason, REWE Group strives to raise the awareness levels of
children and adults about more sustainable consumption and balanced diets. The company also
integrates these people into its involvement in biodiversity and environmental protection. The
company reaches large numbers of customers in the campaigns it conducts in its stores, sharpening
their focus on more sustainable lifestyles. REWE Group draws on a wide range of formats in this
process – from participatory events and informative action weeks to fund-raising drives conducted
through the sale of selected products.

Areas of Action
REWE Group has identiﬁed ﬁve areas of action as the focal points of its social involvement: the
“support of non-proﬁt organisations and projects”, the “promotion of healthy diets and exercise”,
the “promotion of education and personal growth of children and adolescents”, the “ﬁght against
child prostitution and violence against minors” and “consumer education and information”.
In 2016, the areas of action were redeﬁned and a preamble was added to them: “REWE and PENNY
support non-proﬁt organisations and projects as well as groups that provide consumer education.”
The new areas of action are called “healthy diets and exercise”, “opportunities for children and
adolescents”, “vigilant approach to food” and “biodiversity and environmental protection”. The
areas of action apply to the entire REWE Group. Every sales line covers at least two areas of action
with its involvement.
All areas of action are monitored by the “Social Involvement” project group, a team that has been
led by Dr Büchel, the member of the Divisional Management Board of Trade Germany who oversees

the areas of HR and sustainability, since mid-2016.

Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
As a way of measuring the progress being achieved in the pillar Social Involvement, REWE Group
deﬁned key performance indicators (KPIs) in 2010:
KPI 1: The number of long-term projects should total at least 65 per cent by the end of 2014 and
afterwards.
KPI 2: All long-term projects and measures with budgets of more than 50,000 euros during their
planned terms began to be regularly evaluated by sustainability controlling in 2014.
As part of the company’s strategy process, the KPIs were reviewed in 2016 and modiﬁed in the
following manner:
KPI 1: The number of long-term projects should total at least 70 per cent by the end of 2022 and
afterwards.
Status 2016: The number of long-term projects (covering at least two years) equals 72 per cent.
KPI 2: The most important projects and measures as well as those with budgets of more than
30,000 euros are regularly evaluated by a sustainability controlling unit.
Status 2016: Ongoing

Sustainable Development Goals
The social involvement of REWE Group also contributes to the global goals of sustainable
development, including SDG 12: responsible consumption and production; SDG 4: quality
education; and SDG 1: no poverty. This was demonstrated by an analysis in which REWE Group
measured its sustainability strategy against the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) during the
reporting period. It then identiﬁed and prioritised the SDGs that are relevant to the company (see
the chapter Strategy).

Projects and Sponsorships
GRI 203: Indirect Economic Impacts

Management Approach (GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)
REWE Group considers itself to be a good corporate citizen – this means that it assumes
responsibility within the context of its own capabilities in the places where it does business and
where help is needed. It works in particular on behalf of children and young people, promoting
healthy diets and a conscious approach to food (see the Management Approach under the Pillar of
Social Involvement).

GRI 203-1: Infrastructure investments and services
supported
REWE Group invests in the infrastructure and services of its business locations, travel destinations
and countries where special support is critically needed. One focus of this eﬀort is long-term
partnerships with non-proﬁt organisations. As part of this work, REWE Group has been one of the
main sponsors of the more than 900 local Tafeln food banks across Germany and the national
organisation since 1996 (see the chapter on the Tafeln food banks in the magazine). The national
partnership that toom Baumarkt DIY stores have forged with Lebenshilfe, an organisation that helps
the handicapped in Germany, is a long-term relationship (see the chapter on Lebenshilfein the
magazine ). Another focal point of the company’s support is improving access to education by
taking such steps as building schools and supporting educational institutions. The following section
reports on selected projects undertaken during the reporting period.

Project: “Together for Haiti“
Ever since the devastating earthquake struck in 2010, REWE Group has been working to provide
children and young people with greater access to education as part of a partnership with the
German children’s support organisation Kindernothilfe Haiti.
Thanks to the support of REWE Group and to, above all, the hard work of its employees, more than 3
million euros has been collected. The money was primarily used to rebuild the destroyed Collège
Véréna, a school located in a slum of Port-au-Prince that is attended by 1,500 children from the
area. In April 2015, the primary school became the ﬁrst member of the building complex to be
completed. The secondary-school building was opened in autumn 2016. In addition, two new
education projects for Restavek children – children from rural areas whose impoverished families
sent them to guest families in the city – were initiated to provide them with a basic education. REWE
Group also created a scholarship programme designed for suitable graduates of Collège Véréna who
are in desperate need of assistance and Restavek children to provide them with an opportunity to
learn an occupation or attend university.
In January 2016, REWE Group extended its partnership with Kindernothilfe through 2020 as a way
of providing further support to the new school and of expanding its commitment to other educational
projects.

The DER Touristik Foundation
In 2014, DER Touristik established the non-proﬁt organisation DER Touristik Foundation e.V. that is
dedicated solely to charitable work, including training support to children and young people,
environmental protection and sustainable developmental aid. In particular, DER Touristik has
committed itself to the task of creating school infrastructure and the teaching of children and young
people with its initiative “DER Welt verpﬂichtet – DER Bildung ein Zuhause geben” (Committed to
the World – Giving Education a Home).
Since DER Touristik Foundation was created, ﬁnancial aid has been provided to the construction of
more than 30 schools for over 5,500 children. In 2015/2016, 19 school construction projects were
carried out in 12 countries around the world – in Africa (Kenya, Namibia and Tanzania), Asia
(Cambodia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Nepal) and Central America
(Guatemala and Nicaragua) – with the help of donations. More than 3,500 new school slots were
created in the process.
DER Touristik Foundation also supports the reconstruction and renovation of school infrastructure in
regions aﬀected by natural disasters. As part of this activity, two school projects destroyed by the
catastrophic earthquake that struck Nepal in 2015 were rebuilt with the help of ﬁnancial aid.
In 2016, the sustainability work that DER Touristik does under the banner of “DER Welt verpﬂichtet”
was honoured with the World Tourism Award initiated by the World Travel Market.

Key Charitable Projects During the Reporting Period
1.

Kindergarten Piyawara/Sri Lanka
At the beginning of 2016, the Piyawara kindergarten ﬁnanced by DER Touristik Foundation
opened in Maduraketiya, a town in southern Sri Lanka. Following a construction period of about
nine months, 50 children between the ages of three and ﬁve can be playfully cared for and
prepared for school life. The new building has two classrooms, access to clean drinking water
produced by the school’s own well and sanitary facilities.

2.

Education project KOTO/Vietnam
Financial support began to be provided to KOTO, an educational institution near Hanoi,
Vietnam, in 2016. The project “GROWING SPACES: YOUTH PROJECT” involves the
construction of learning and training centres for extremely disadvantaged and at-risk
adolescents who come from impoverished families and have no futures. The new facilities
provide the young people with a protected space and support with their occupational
development by oﬀering learning materials, coaching and vocational activities.

Project: REWE Far East – WASH Project/India
REWE Far East Ltd. understands its responsibility as a purchasing organisation of REWE Group. In
addition to its sourcing activities, it has been supporting the “Water, Sanitation and Hygiene” project
– or WASH – organised by Save the Children in India since January 2017.
The goal of the project is to provide children and their families in Delhi with access to sanitary
facilities and clean drinking water and to educate them about hygienic practices. As part of the
programme, children learn about hygienic practices and the correct way to use water – things like
washing their hands before they eat meals and after they use the toilet – in primary schools and in
centres of the Indian government’s Integrated Child Development Services programme (ICDS). In
addition, sanitary facilities like toilets and sinks are being installed or upgraded.
The project is being carried out in three slum areas, in seven ICDS centres and four primary schools
in southern Delhi. An additional 40 primary schools and ICDS centres will be included thanks to
further training. As a result, 3,000 children will be directly reached during the three-year project. An
additional 20,000 children and just as many relatives and residents will proﬁt indirectly from the

programme.
The combination of clean water, sanitary facilities and hygienic practices is designed to prevent
avoidable diseases over the long term and maintain the health of children and their families.

Project: Germany and Austria Round Up
A partnership with the non-proﬁt initiative “Deutschland rundet auf” (Germany Rounds Up) has
been maintained since 2012. Customers of PENNY and toom Baumarkt DIY stores can round up
their purchase total at the cash register by a maximum of 10 cents. All donated money is provided to
social projects for children and adolescents in Germany. In 2015, well-known actors, moderators
and comedians provided their support once again at cash registers of various PENNY stores and
toom Baumärkte DIY stores during a donation week. Since the initiative was begun, PENNY
customers have rounded up more than 100 million times and donated about 5 million euros in the
process.
In Austria, REWE International AG has taken part in a similar programme, “Woche des Aufrundens”
(The Week of Rounding Up). “Aufrunden, bitte” (Round Up, Please) has been the motto at BILLA,
MERKUR, BIPA and PENNY as well as at LIBRO since April 2015. Thanks to customers’ many years
of support, the donation level of 500,000 euros was broken in May 2016. The money is used to
support projects by the Catholic charity Caritas, Learning Cafés, special education programmes and
mother-child homes.

GRI 203-2: Signiﬁcant indirect economic impacts
With its approximately 15,000 stores and travel agencies, REWE Group employs about 330,000
people inside and outside Germany. When new stores are opened, communities beneﬁt from
infrastructure investments, taxes and fees as well as from a broad range of social activities
undertaken by employees, store managers and independent retailers. In doing so, REWE Group
generates important momentum for the development and growth of the regions where its stores do
business. REWE Group also actively supports children and young people, focusing on areas related
to its business operations.

Promotion of Healthy Diets and Exercise
REWE Group works with a range of organisations to pique children’s interest in healthy lifestyles.
REWE Group has been supporting the group “Klasse in Sport – Initiative für täglichen Schulsport
e.V.” since 2008. This initiative promotes the well-being and athletic activities of children at selected
schools. As a charter member of the group “5 am Tag” (5 a day) REWE Group encourages eﬀorts to
boost consumption of fruit and vegetables to ﬁve portions a day and to promote healthy diets for
children. As part of this work, REWE stores do such things as distribute fruit-ﬁlled bags to ﬁrstgraders. To help children get their days oﬀ to a healthy start, REWE Group has joined forces with the
food bank organisation Bundesverband Deutsche Tafel e.V. and other partners to distribute socalled Power Kisten (power boxes) to schools. These boxes contain a rotating array of foods selected
by nutrition experts that individual classes use to prepare breakfast. At the end of 2016, eight
schools and about 1,000 children were receiving the power boxes from Monday to Friday. The
project is supported with donations by Chiquita, Danone, Ehrmann, FrieslandCampina, Mondelez,
Nestlé, Unilever, Zentis and the REWE Group production operations Glocken Bäckerei and Wilhelm
Brandenburg, among others.

Opportunities for Children and Adolescents
For years, REWE Group has systematically taken part in projects that promote the development of
children and young people. One important aspect of this work is the support provided by volunteers
who pass on their knowledge and experience in direct relationships. In the education project
“Lernen macht Schule” (Learning Catches On), REWE International AG works with the Catholic
charity Caritas and the Vienna University of Economics and Business to help children and young

charity Caritas and the Vienna University of Economics and Business to help children and young
people who need additional encouragement. The project is conducted by volunteer “learning
buddies” – individuals who are frequently students at the university or employees of REWE
International AG. These buddies help with school work for two to three hours once a week and can
answer any other questions as well. In another mentoring project, REWE Group takes part in the
sponsorship programme EHRENSACHE (Act of Honour) in cooperation with the non-proﬁt
employment organisation Joblinge to provide internships and job-entry qualiﬁcation training to
socially disadvantaged young people. As part of the education initiative ROCK YOUR LIFE!, the
PENNY sales line conducts a two-year training programme called “Zukunftskick” (Future Kick) (for
more information about this work, see the magazine chapter “Joblinge”). The sales line uses the
PENNY Goodwill Basket largely for the purpose of supporting small organisations and projects that
are being conducted in areas near its stores and are designed to encourage children and young
people (for more information about this work, see the chapter on the promotion of projects in the
magazine).

Vigilant Approach to Food
REWE Group strives to keep food waste to a minimum. In doing so, it works with upstream producers
(see the chapter on Naturgut Bio-Helden (Organic Heroes) in the magazine) and in its own stores.
PENNY and REWE sell up to 99 per cent of their foods on average each year. Most of the remaining
1 per cent is donated across Germany to around 900 local Tafel food bank initiatives. REWE has
been making such donations since 1996 and PENNY since 2007 (for more information about this
work, see the chapter on the Tafelnin the magazine). Even though these foods cannot be sold, they
are perfectly good for consumption.
Because consumers are responsible for most food waste, REWE Group conducts information and
educational campaigns aimed at its customers. For years now, the PENNY sales line has played an
active role in this work. It distributed a brochure called “Spar doch grün” (The Green Way to Save)
that contains clever household tips and tricks in 2016 and conducted an educational campaign
about the sell-by date in 2015.

Child Protection
GRI 413: Local Communities

Management Approach (GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)
The holiday is the loveliest time of the year for many people. They enjoy the sun and beach, breathtaking landscapes and exciting new impressions. That means their trip should be carefree, both for
themselves and for the local population. Unfortunately, tourism also has its dark side. More than
2 million children a year become victims of sexual violence and exploitation. In many cases, the
tourism infrastructure is misused for these purposes by sexual oﬀenders. Consequently, the travel
industry has a responsibility to address the issue of child protection.
DER Touristik has introduced a very ambitious child protection policy, one that makes the company
a pacesetter in the tourism industry. DER Touristik has been playing an active role in the child
protection since 2001, when the German Tourism Association (DRV) acted on behalf of all its
members and initiated “The Code”, a document based on the UN Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. ECPAT Deutschland e.V. – a working group
for the protection of children from sexual exploitation – oversees the implementation of the code
and serves as an expert partner for DER Touristik.
In 2012, DER Touristik Hotels & Investments GmbH (DTH) deﬁned a set of principles within its child
protection policy. These principles are designed to protect the children of the holiday country and
those of guests and to observe their rights within the tourism industry. The child protection policy is
widely communicated in all destinations and is a key topic in the training concept used for
employees in destination areas (hotel employees and travel guides). They are sensitised about the
topic and learn what to do if they suspect that something is amiss. Under plans for 2017, the
training concept is to be expanded to employees in headquarters locations, at destination agencies
and for important partners.
Sören Hartmann, CEO of the DER Touristik Group, signed “The Code” at ITB Berlin tourism trade fair
on 11 March 2016. With his signature, DER Touristik expressed its commitment to the code and
pledge to observe and implement the following aspects, most of which have already been
introduced:

●

Implementation of guidelines and measures to prevent the sexual exploitation of children

●

Provision of employee training about the rights of children, the prevention of sexual exploitation
and reporting of suspected cases

●

Acceptance of a clause in hotel agreements rejecting sexual exploitation and refusing to tolerate it
in any way

●

Provision of information to travellers about the rights of children, the prevention of sexual
exploitation and reporting of suspected cases

●

Support of and collaboration with stakeholders in the ﬁght against the sexual exploitation of
children

●

An annual report about the implementation of “The Code”

DER Touristik also vigorously carries out activities as part of its information and prevention concept.

As part of this eﬀort, travellers learn about the protection of children from sexual exploitation during
holiday, tourism students are sensitised about the issue and DER Touristik plays an active role in the
preparations of the programme for an annual destination workshops organised by the German Travel
Association and ECPAT. The workshop is designed for hotels, agencies and tour operators in holiday
locations that have a high risk of sexual exploitation of children. It is conducted in cooperation with
local organisations and authorities. In recent years, workshops have been held in the Dominican
Republic, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Kenya. The most recent ones were held in Bulgaria in
2016 and in Sri Lanka in 2017.
