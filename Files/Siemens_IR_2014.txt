Introduction
The Siemens Annual Report 2014 combines
for the second time our previously separate
Annual and Sustainability Reports. This s­ ingle
report provides an integrated overview of
our ­Company’s key topics – from our strategic
­orientation and business developments at
our Businesses to fundamental aspects of sustainability – relating, for example, to research
and development, customer relations, sup­
pliers, energy-efficient technologies, environmental protection, employees or compliance –
and an outlook for the coming fiscal years.
These Additional Sustainability information to
the Siemens Annual Report 2014 complement
our reporting with further information on
the ­Company’s commitment to sustainability
and additional information. You’ll also find our
reporting in accordance with the Sustainability
­Reporting Guidelines of the Global Reporting
Initiative (GRI) and our progress reports

GUIDED BY MATERIALITY
We regularly identify sustainability topics based on their importance for Siemens and our stakeholders, and prioritize them by
materiality. The prioritization shows the action areas identified
as the key levers for sustainable business success, on which we
will also continue to focus in the future. In fiscal 2014 we
­conducted a comprehensive process to detail the priorities of
“Sustainability and Citizenship” within the “One Siemens
­
­Management model.” The process closely integrated analyses
of general developments, the way we respond to megatrends,
dialog with stakeholders, and assessments from the Company’s specialist functions. The results were then discussed with
our Sustainability Board and the Siemens Sustainability Advisory Board and finally approved by our Managing Board and
Supervisory Board. The outcome is the material and detailed
“Sustainability and Citizenship” priorities within the “One
Siemens Management model:”
Sustainable action is the means to achieve profitable and longterm growth. At Siemens we have a clear commitment to think
and act in the interest of future generations, balancing profit,
planet and people.

SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE
Siemens has been part of the widely respected Dow Jones
­Sustainability Index for 15 consecutive years. In 2014 we were
ranked, within the Index, as Industry Leader in Industrial
­Conglomerates for the seventh time in a row, and as Industry
Group Leader in Capital Goods for the third time in a row. We
also earned high ratings on a number of other indexes and
rankings, including those created by the prestigious CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project). Siemens achieved its best
rating this year and was included by CDP both in the Climate
Disclosure Leadership Index and in the highest performance
band A of the Climate Performance Leadership Index.

Reporting method
Sustainability is for us a guiding principle and a key precept of
our actions. The Additional Sustainability information to the
Siemens Annual Report 2014 complement our reporting in the
Annual Report 2014 where we combine for the second time our
previously separate Annual and Sustainability Reports. The reporting method provides you with details of the key elements
on which our reporting is based.

REPORTING APPROACH
The Additional Sustainability information to the Siemens Annual Report 2014 (hereinafter the Report) describe the strategy,
organization, initiatives and goals for ensuring sustainability.
They complement our reporting in the Annual Report, continue
last year’s reporting and also serve as our annual progress report on implementing the United Nations CEO Water Mandate
and the Global Compact’s ten principles. In addition, our Report
is oriented to version 3.0 of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the recommendations of the Global Compact and of Transparency International regarding anticorruption reporting.

REVIEW PERIOD AND REPORT BOUNDARIES
This Report is based on activities during Siemens’ fiscal 2014
(October 1, 2013 – September 30, 2014). Any exceptions are
indicated as such. In general, all of our fully consolidated
­
­companies are covered by the Report. Here, too, possible exceptions regarding the data are indicated. Minority equity investments are not included in our reporting.

the evidence gathering procedures are more limited than in
a reasonable assurance engagement. The auditors merely confirm that nothing has come to their attention during the review
that would cause them to believe that the information contained in the
C.8 SUSTAINABILIT Y AND CITIZENSHIP chapter in the
SIEMENS ANNUAL REPORT 2014 and in the “Facts and figures”
chapter of this Report has not been prepared, in all material respects, with the criteria of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).

The indicators and information reported in the following relate
to the Company ’s continuing operations, if not otherwise indicated. In order to ensure comparability of the details, those for
the previous year were adjusted accordingly. Deviations are
indicated.

DATA COLLECTION
Given Siemens’ size and global spread, gathering data poses a
major logistical challenge. Moreover, our companies throughout the world are required to comply with local regulations concerning the compilation and definition of performance figures,
which means that the generated data is not always comparable. Where applicable, we point out any significant limitations
in the information presented in the Report. As a rule, no company-wide standards exist for the information published in the
Report. This applies in particular to specific financial figures,
including, for example, the revenue attributable to the Environmental Portfolio. As a result, these figures may not be comparable with the data published under the same or similar designations by other companies. The data published in this Report is
collected through various internal reporting systems which, for
the most part, are different from those applicable to the financial information presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In particular, the standards and controls applied and the
computer systems used during the preparation of the data can
be less comprehensive in comparison. We reserve the right to
change our internal guidelines regarding the inclusion of data
in the Report without prior announcement. Due to rounding,
numbers presented throughout this Report may not add up precisely to the totals provided and percentages may not precisely
reflect the absolute figures.

INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE REVIEW
We prepared our Report to high quality standards. Consequently, as in previous years, we again commissioned an
­in­dependent accounting firm to conduct an assurance review
of the
C.8 SUSTAINABILIT Y AND CITIZENSHIP chapter in the
SIEMENS ANNUAL REPORT 2014 and the “Facts and figures” chapter of this Report to provide a limited degree of certainty.

EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT
New hires were down by 5 % in the year under review. In the
same period, exits were down by 24 %. The percentage of all
Company dismissals was 19 % for the year, compared with 21 %
the year before. All other variations result from changes in the
basis of consolidation and other changes.

fiscal 2012, 73 contractor companies were excluded from
Siemens projects in India as of the end of the year under review. They will not be reconsidered by us as potential contractors until the issues objected to have been rectified and they
have successfully completed our assessment process again.
Significant progress in enhancing the collaboration with contractors and improving the safety culture was made in India
and the Middle East. Currently we are using our experiences
from India and plan to rollout the concept of the successful
“Suraksha” (Hindi for safety) project also in China and intensify
our occupational safety training for contractors and own employees. In fiscal 2015 we plan to roll-out specially devised
health and safety audits at Siemens construction sites and contractors’ locations, which were successfully piloted in India and
Bang­ladesh during fiscal 2013 and 2014.
Additionally, in the year under review, the Zero Harm ­Culture
@ Siemens program was reinforced in all parts of the Company
by facilitated self-assessment and by best practice exchange,
resulting in several improvement measures.

Contractors who bill by time, especially those who work on large project sites.

In order to reduce the number of accidents, we have introduced
additional business-specific actions and programs, particularly
on construction sites and in projects. We also take a very rigorous approach to selecting contractor companies and have introduced even more stringent occupational safety requirements.
Part of this approach is that specifically for the health and
safety management, we require a detailed risk assessment for
every construction site, an appraisal of the risks identified, and
measures to minimize or avoid them. As a result of the systematic assessment process that we developed and introduced in

OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS
The total number of cases of occupational illness relative to the
number of employees has remained at a low level for many
years. The corresponding indicator (occupational illness frequency rate, OIFR) relative to 1,000,000 work hours performed
was 0.36 in the year under review (FY 2013: 0.26). Here we report only the figures for Siemens AG. The OFIR is calculated
solely on the basis of cases of occupational illness recognized
by the Employers’ Liability Insurance Association.

PROMOTING HEALTH
We are convinced that sustainable health promotion among
our employees will only succeed if all health-related measures and initiatives are consistently aligned with the permanently changing requirements of today ’s working environment, and complement each other in a sensible manner.
Simply increasing the number of individual measures in itself
is not enough. A systematic approach is called for, within
which health is actively managed as a resource. Accordingly,
during fiscal 2013, Siemens inaugurated the Company-wide
program “Healthy @ Siemens” which is based on a methodical
approach, and supports a continuous improvement process
within health management – true to the principle: A targeted
approach – that works!

REQUIREMENTS FOR SUPPLIERS

Number

2014

We expect all our suppliers to make a clear commitment to the
principles of sustainability. Our requirements – such as respect
for the basic rights of employees, health and safety, environmental protection and zero-tolerance on corruption and bribery – are defined in the Code of Conduct for Siemens Suppliers.
Under the relevant clauses in our procurement contracts and
our Conditions of Purchase, all Siemens suppliers must undertake to meet these requirements and also promote compliance
with them in their own supply chain. The Code of Conduct for
Siemens Suppliers is based on the ten principles of the UN
Global Compact and reflects the content of our Siemens Business Conduct Guidelines.

IDENTIFYING RISKS AND IMPLEMENTING
MEASURES FOR IMPROVEMENT
We procure from some 90,000 suppliers in over 160 countries
and constantly increase the share of sourcing from Global
Value Sourcing (GVS) countries, which are generally emerging
economies.
Because this supplier network is very large and widely spread,
it is not possible for us to inspect all suppliers to the same extent by auditing them on site. We have therefore established a
risk-based system of appropriate processes to enable us to systematically identify potential risks in our supply chain. It consists of sustainability self-assessments by suppliers, risk evaluation conducted by our purchasing department, sustainability
questions within supplier quality audits, and sustainability
­audits by external auditors.

follow-up audits, which entail revisiting the sites to establish
whether the agreed measures have actually been implemented.
Deviations identified in the audits mainly relate to structural
deficiencies in management systems and the lack of specific
processes and guidelines at the supplier. This includes, for instance, measures to effectively prevent corruption and bribery
and to rule out child labor. Serious deviations were identified at
four suppliers but were corrected by the set deadline.
In the event of substantial deviations or an unwillingness to
­implement measures for improvement, we exclude suppliers
from any business with Siemens. To be faster and more effective in reacting to major breaches of the Code of Conduct
­requirements – e.g. proven child labor issues – we have newly
implemented the process of a “Central Warning Message,”
which allows us to block suppliers for all Siemens organizations worldwide on short term.

Since fiscal 2012, we have tightened the requirements for occupational health and safety standards for suppliers at our project
construction sites. Specifically, for the health and safety management systems, we require a detailed risk assessment for
every site, an appraisal of the risks identified, and measures to
minimize them. For fiscal 2015, we plan to roll-out specially devised health and safety audits which were successfully piloted
in fiscal 2013 and 2014 in India and Bangladesh at Siemens construction sites and our contractors’ locations.

KNOW-HOW TRANSFER
AND COMPETENCE BUILDING

Following the risk-based approach, a system of appropriate processes to enable us to systematically identify potential risks in
our supply chain, we concentrated our capacities on supplier
quality audits with integrated sustainability questions in fiscal
2014. We have therefore been able to decrease the number of
external sustainability audits.

We continue with our strategy and belief that our suppliers’
commitment to complying with our sustainability principles is
most effective when it is based on their own convictions. The
key is to build our suppliers’ competence and intensifying
knowledge transfers related to sustainability. Together with
personal meetings we support our suppliers with an internet-based information and training platform, which is available
free of charge to all suppliers.

If deviations from our requirements are identified, they must
be remedied by the suppliers in question within a reasonable
period of time. In all we do, we are guided by the principles of
developing our suppliers in close partnership and building up
their competencies for the long term. Furthermore we conduct

On top of that, sustainability is an integral part of the Company-wide training programs for buyers. Moreover, all employees
with purchasing responsibility are obligated to take part in intranet-based training on the subject of “Sustainability in the
Supply Chain.”

RESOURCE EFFICIENCY, CLIMATE PROTECTION
AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IN THE SUPPLY
CHAIN
As part of CDP reporting, we collect and publish data on our
greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 3) caused by purchased
products and services. We have also examined our supply chain
with regard to water shortage risks.
We work to minimize the environmental impact within our logistics and transport network. To this end, we have established
a competence center. The measures we have initiated include
the use of carriers with modern fleets, the optimization of our
logistics networks, the contractual commitment of service providers to improving efficiency, and modal shifts, for example,
from air freight to sea freight.
In 2014, we further adapted our internal supply chain processes
to meet new regulatory requirements like the European Union
Timber Regulation or the “Conflict minerals rule” which is mandatory for our customers in the USA. Both regulations require an
in-depth transparency of the several tiers of our supply chain.
Siemens is aware of the difficult situation whereby products
and components purchased from suppliers may contain minerals originating from conflict-affected countries. We have rolled
out a uniform and group-wide process to determine the use,
source and origin of conflict minerals in our supply chain. Close
cooperation with our direct suppliers supports us in carrying
out these steps. Where necessary, we work with suppliers in
order to remediate risks and perform additional due diligence
so that we can continue to source responsibly, building on established management processes.
Siemens actively supported and plans to further support the
“OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains
of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas” as a pilot-member for the development of the respective due diligence processes which expressly recognizes a risk-based due
diligence in the mineral supply chain. We also support industry-wide initiatives like the “Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative.”

Environmental Portfolio
In fiscal 2014 almost three quarters of the solutions in our Environmental Portfolio relate to energy efficiency and underline
Siemens’ continued strategic focus on technologies in this
field. Energy efficiency is not only relevant in the consumption
of energy, where for example Siemens industrial motors used
in conjunction with variable speed drive technology can reduce
energy consumption by up to 70 %. The Environmental Portfolio
also offers solutions that enable the efficient generation of energy, such as our highly efficient combined cycle power plants,
which can achieve an efficiency rating in power production of
more than 60 %.
Renewable energies account for more than 20 % of revenue
generated by the Environmental Portfolio. Siemens is a leader
in this field, with technological innovations such as gearless
six megawatt turbines. Environmental technologies comprise a
range of services and solutions related to water and air pollution control, as well as products from the Healthcare Sector
where an environmental impact reduction is achieved by reducing noise, radiation, or weight.

REPORTING ON ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AND
COLLECTING ENVIRONMENTAL DATA
In fiscal 2014, we used our environmental information system
to analyze 324 reports from sites in 46 countries where defined
threshold values were exceeded for parameters such as energy
use, resource consumption, emissions, and environmental
management. To measure and monitor our environmental impact, we use absolute values such as energy consumption in
gigajoules. We report environmental data on a portfolio-adjusted basis. Extrapolation to 100 % was applied to reflect complete consumptions in our figures. Overall, the extrapolation
was significant only for primary energy with 18 % and for water
and waste water with 10 % to the figures reported. We calculate
our key performance indicators (KPIs) for all office and production sites of environmental relevance using environmental data
gathered quarterly. We calculate environmental performance
on a portfolio-adjusted basis. This approach enables us to survey and compare our environmental performance over time,
regardless of acquisitions and disposals.

2 Energy consumption in fiscal 2013 increased by 6.2% due to a changed
­extrapolation method.

In fiscal 2014, the total consumption of natural and liquid petroleum gases has declined by 11 %. The consumption of other fossil fuels plays a minor role compared to gas consumption and
has decreased by 22 %. In particular, there was a reduction in
the consumption of on-site car fuels and fuel oil. Overall, the
total primary energy consumption decreased by 12 % compared
to the previous year, mostly due to the shorter heating period
in Europe.

Electricity consumption has declined by 5 % year-on-year due to
a slightly lower work load and implemented efficiency measures. The consumption of district heating decreased in line
with the trend recorded for liquid petroleum gas and natural
gas, mostly due to the shorter heating period in Europe compared to previous years by 17 %.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
All our locations have an environmental management system
in place; 262 of them are also certified in accordance with
ISO 14001. The majority of these, 258 sites, are externally certified, while four have been audited and certified by Siemens
internal auditors. The decision as to whether a unit has its
environmental management system certified in accordance
with ISO 14001 is made by the environmental protection executives of the businesses and countries in close consultation
with the environmental protection officers. 27 Siemens locations have implemented an energy management system in
accordance with ISO 50001. Further locations are in the process of implementation.

17

In order to use energy efficiently, the Siemens Energy Efficiency
Program continued in fiscal 2014. Energy-saving projects have
been realized and energy management systems have been implemented at energy-intensive locations. For example at three
Industry Automation sites approximately 10 GWh and 1,800
metric tons CO2 are now saved annually following the establishment of energy management systems.
In addition to energy consumption at the locations reported
above, the energy consumed by the Company’s business vehicles is recorded centrally. Staff vehicles, service vehicles, and

Assurance report and indices

trucks owned by Siemens are grouped together for this purpose. In fiscal 2014, the Company fleet consumed fuel with an
energy content of around 4.2 million gigajoules.

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
Our greenhouse gas balance is made up of the total emissions
at our locations and the emissions caused by Company vehicles
and business travel. We report our greenhouse gas emissions
on the basis of the Corporate Standard of the Greenhouse Gas
Protocol of the World Resource Institute and of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. Direct greenhouse
gas emissions (Scope 1) arise from sources in the Company ’s
ownership or under its control. Indirect greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 2) refer to the consumption of purchased electrical energy and district heating. Business travel is reported in
Scope 3 because it is based on the use of services and vehicles
provided by external companies.

ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTANT EMISSIONS
Other industrial emissions into the atmosphere are also relevant in terms of environmental protection. Volatile organic
compounds (VOC) contribute to the formation of ozone close to
the earth’s surface and are responsible for what is known as
summer smog. We use these organic compounds as solvents in
paints and adhesives, in impregnation processes, and for surface cleaning. We also monitor the use of ozone-depleting substances (ODS) and comply with the Montreal Protocol, an international convention on the protection of the ozone layer, as
well as with country-specific legislation.

This includes technical CO2, SF6, HFC, PFC, CH4 and N2O.

1 R11 equivalent measures ozone depletion potential.

Direct greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1) have been reduced
by 10 %. This is mainly due to lower heat demand, reduced fleet
fuel consumption and the improved handling of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Electricity and district heating emissions (Scope 2)
decreased by 3 %, due to lower consumption of district heating.
Emissions from business travel could be reduced by 2 %. Especially emissions from flights and train travel were reduced. In
total, greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 5 % year-on-year.

The emissions of volatile organic carbon increased due to the
fact that some users of VOC’s expanded their production volumes. The volume of emissions of ozone depleting substances
rose slightly from 0.13 t to 0.15 t R 11 equivalents. However, we
are seeing an increasing awareness to balance emissions and
implement phase out plans for a step by step substitution.
In calculating nitrogen oxides, we have assumed typical combustion conditions in the relevant thermal processes, resulting
in a figure of 185 metric tons for environmentally relevant locations in the year under review. The figure includes nitrogen
oxides released during the incineration of fuels reported in the
section on primary energy.

WASTE
The environmental relevance of waste depends on the type of
waste and its method of disposal. We differentiate between
hazardous and non-hazardous waste. These two groups are further divided into recyclable waste and waste for disposal. We
report waste from construction or demolition work separately
because this kind of waste material arises independently of
production.

Year-on-year, the non-hazardous waste increased by 1 %, however we were able to reduce the volume of hazardous waste by
9 %. Overall, the quantity of waste (excluding construction
waste) remained unchanged. The increased volume of construction waste in comparison to fiscal 2013 was due to the
demolition of an office building in Munich.

demolition projects.

Three incidents were due to nonconformance with terms and
conditions of permits. We remediated the minor damages and
analyzed the incidents to prevent future recurrence. Total fines
from penalties in the year under review were not significant.

BIODIVERSITY
Siemens’ activities have an impact on nature and wildlife at its
own locations. Our employees demonstrate their commitment
to the conservation of nature and wildlife with projects at local level such as planting trees or greening roofs thus restoring green spaces improving the microclimate, and protecting
wildlife.

ENVIRONMENT-RELATED INCIDENTS
AND PENALTIES
In the year under review, we recorded 15 environmentally relevant incidents. These are occurrences that must be notified to
the authorities – notifiable incidents – or that had an external
impact on the environment. One of them involved releases into
bodies of water or sewer networks, ten the discharge of oil,
diesel or resins, and one related to atmospheric emissions.

17

At Siemens, closing material loops (cradle to cradle) is becoming increasingly important for resource conservation in product
development. For this reason, it is included in our internal environmental standard and closes the information loop between
the end of life of one product and the development phase of a
new product for our product designers. It means that by reusing, refurbishing, or recycling products, components, or materials, they go through more than just one lifecycle, and therefore make a substantial contribution to the protection of the
environment. In this context, the use of critical substances in
an electronic product can greatly impact the product’s recyclability. As far as technically feasible, Siemens avoids the use
of all LoDS (List of Declarable Substances) listed substances in
its products worldwide, thereby exceeding existing statutory
requirements.
During the supplier qualification process, new suppliers must
commit to declaring substances listed on the LoDS. These basic
substance declaration requirements are mandatory for our suppliers and are included in procurement and project contracts. In
real terms, this means that our suppliers must notify us if their
products and components contain declarable substances and
must provide us with the relevant detailed information. To
make an easy-to-use method with high data quality readily
available, Siemens relies on an internet-hosted database in
which our suppliers declare the substances they use in their
products.
At the end of the life-cycle, the handling of used electrical and
electronic equipment or its disposal entails much more than
collecting and recycling old devices. It is therefore important to
have an adequate return and recycling system in place for such
devices or even to run a refurbishing process for complete systems as our Healthcare activities demonstrate.

LIFECYCLE ASSESSMENTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL
PRODUCT DECLARATIONS

Corporate Citizenship

We use specific software solutions and scientifically recognized
databases to determine and evaluate the ecological footprint of
our products and solutions on the basis of LCAs. In addition to
detailed lifecycle assessments (full-scale LCAs), we make use,
where appropriate, of simplified lifecycle assessments (screening LCAs) such as CO2 screenings.

We demonstrate our social commitment on the basis of figures.
That is why we provide information about our donations by category and region.

The results of the LCAs are the basis of our environmental product declarations (EPDs) and support product development. In
this way, we help our customers improve their current and future environmental impact. To ensure that our EPDs offer a consistent level throughout the Company, we bring together the
experience of the individual Business Units in the form of a
dedicated panel of experts. To optimize internal processes the
panel of experts developed a process guidance for the preparation of environmental product declarations. In the year under
review this guidance has been verified by an external auditor
for compliance with the criteria set out in ISO 14025. By applying this process guidance, Siemens increases its standard of
quality regarding EPD creation.

Report” in the “Siemens Annual Report 2014” and to the German
PDF-version of the chapter “Facts and Figures” of the report
­“Additional Sustainability information to the Siemens Annual
Report 2014.” The following text is a translation of the original
German Independent Assurance Report.
To Siemens AG, Berlin and Munich

OUR ENGAGEMENT
We have been engaged to perform a limited assurance engagement on the chapter “Sustainability and Citizenship” of the
“Combined Management Report” in the “Siemens Annual Report 2014” and the chapter “Facts and Figures” of the report
­“Additional Sustainability information to the Siemens Annual
Report 2014” of Siemens AG (hereinafter: the sustainability
­reporting) for the reporting period from October 1, 2013 to September 30, 2014.
The Siemens Annual Report 2014 is published as a print version
and as an online version at
WWW.SIEMENS.COM/ANNUALREPORT .
The report “Additional Sustainability information to the
Siemens Annual Report 2014” is published solely as an online
version at
WWW.SIEMENS.COM/AR/SUSTAINABILIT Y-FIGURES .

LIMITATIONS OF OUR ENGAGEMENT
Our engagement is exclusively limited to the German print
­version of the chapter “Sustainability and Citizenship” of the
“Combined Management Report” in the “Siemens Annual
­Report 2014” and to the chapter “Facts and Figures” of the
­report “Additional Sustainability information to the Siemens
Annual Report 2014”. Our engagement did not include any
­prospective statements and links to other web pages.

CRITERIA
We assessed the report against the criteria set out in the
­Sustainability Reporting Guidelines G3.0 issued by the Global
Reporting Initiative (GRI). We believe that these criteria are
suitable for our assurance engagement.

MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY
The Managing Board of Siemens AG is responsible for the
preparation and the content of the sustainability reporting in
compliance with the above-mentioned criteria. This responsibility includes the design, implementation and maintenance of
internal controls for the preparation of a sustainability reporting that is free from material misstatements, in accordance
with the above mentioned criteria and based on suitable methods for gathering source data including judgments and estimates of the individual sustainability data.

Facts and figures

OUR RESPONSIBILITY
Our responsibility is to issue an assurance report on the sustainability reporting based on our work performed.
We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000. This standard requires that we comply with
our professional duties and plan and perform the assurance
engagement to obtain a limited level of assurance to preclude
that the sustainability reporting is not in accordance, in material respects, with the aforementioned reporting principles and
criteria. In a limited assurance engagement the evidence
­gathering procedures are more limited than in a reasonable assurance engagement and therefore less assurance is obtained
than in a reasonable assurance engagement.
During the engagement, we observed the independence requirements of the IFAC Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants.

KEY PROCEDURES
The performance of our engagement mainly involved the following work:
>> Inquiries of employees concerning the sustainability strategy, sustainability principles and sustainability management
including the stakeholder dialog of Siemens AG.
>> Inquiries of employees responsible in the central Corporate
Development Strategy – Sustainability department for the
preparation of the sustainability reporting in order to assess
the sustainability reporting system, the data capture and
compilation methods as well as internal controls to the
­extent relevant for a review of the sustainability reporting.
>> Inquiries of employees responsible in the corporate departments for the topics employees, occupational safety and
health management, research and development, supply
chain management, distribution and customer relations, environmental portfolio, environmental protection and corporate citizenship to assess the data capture and compilation
methods as well as internal controls to the extent relevant
for the review of the sustainability reporting.
>> Inspection of the relevant documentation of the systems and
processes for compiling, analyzing, and aggregating sustainability data in the reporting period and testing such documentation on a sample of basis.
>> Analytical measures at Group level, on the level of sectors
and divisions regarding the quality of the reported data.
>> Inquiries and inspection of documents on a sample basis
­relating to the collection and reporting of the sustainability
data from the topics industrial environmental protection and
occupational safety during site visits
–– at the Energy locations in Berlin and Wuhan (China),
–– at the Healthcare location in Kemnath,

Group’s headquarters, corporate departments, sectors and
divisions and at the sites visited on material qualitative statements in the sustainability reporting as well as the inspection of selected underlying documents.
>> Review of material qualitative statements in the sustainability
­reporting for plausibility and consistency. 

OUR CONCLUSION
Based on our procedures performed to obtain a limited level of
assurance, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to
believe that the information in the chapter “Sustainability and
Citizenship” of the “Combined Management Report” in the
“Siemens Annual Report 2014” and in the chapter “Facts and Figures” of the report “Additional Sustainability Information to the
Siemens Annual Report 2014” has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the aforementioned criteria.

following components:

In the year under review, the number
of sustainability self-assessments added
up to 2,134. We conducted 871 supplier
quality audits with integrated sustainability questions and 49 external sustainability
audits. In the external sustainability
audits, we identified a total of 1,114 potential improvements: 30 % (331) involved
improvements in the area of “respect of
basic employee rights,” and 2 % (24) in the
area of “prohibition of child labor.” 40 follow-up audits were conducted on site to
verify the agreed measures for improvement. The main objections related to poor
aspects of policies and processes, especially in regard to child labor.

The Siemens Business Conduct Guidelines provide the ethical and legal
framework within which we conduct
our business activities. Our compliance system aims to ensure that all
our worldwide business practices
remain within this framework as well
as in compliance with applicable laws.
To serve this purpose, our compliance
system includes three pillars: prevent,
detect and respond.
Compliance Report
SIEMENS ANNUAL REPORT, PAGE 138

We have a system of four compliance
priorities to further develop and
improve our compliance system. These
priorities, which guided our activities
in fiscal 2014, include the conclusion of
project- and market-specific Collective
Action agreements and the launch of
the second funding round of the
Siemens Integrity Initiative. We have
also carried out a project to reinforce
our business-partner compliance due
diligence process. The company’s compliance risk assessment process has
been further developed: Besides other
improvements Data Privacy has been
included therein as part of our activities to integrate Data Privacy into the
Compliance System.

We have introduced a web-based compliance training program, which is mandatory for certain business partners before
they can enter into a business relationship with our Company.

Compliance Report

The second funding round of the Siemens
Integrity Initiative was announced on
June 27, 2013. The selected projects are to
receive approximately US$30.0 million of
total funding over a period of three to five
years. We began concluding the funding
contracts in October 2014.

Mandate in 2008. Our continuing support for the CEO Water
Mandate reflects our commitment on two fronts: Firstly, managing water efficiently in our own facilities. Secondly, providing
solutions that help our customers handle water and waste
­water more economically.

In addition, the Siemens Stiftung drives an entrepreneurial
­approach to supply clean drinking water to communities in
need in developing regions, the safe water enterprises. One of
the major project partners is the SkyJuice Foundation, a humanitarian aid organization incorporated in Australia. SkyJuice
supplies Sky Hydrants™ to people living in remote regions. We
have compiled further information for you on the following

1. OUR OWN ACTIVITIES

WWW.SIEMENS-STIFTUNG.ORG/EN/PROJECTS/SAFE-WATER-­E NTERPRISES

For more information about the resource conservation and water
consumption goals at Siemens locations, see section Environmental Protection ( SIEMENS ANNUAL REPORT, PAGE 222, AND THIS
­R EPORT
PAGE 13) . We are pursuing a new approach to water
­resources management that was developed in 2012. At locations
where there are increased water-related risks – for example, as a
result of aridity, high wastewater loads, or poorly developed
technical infrastructures – we define goals that are matched to
local circumstances. This enables us to effectively reduce risks
and negative impacts on the environment.
Our Business Units offer solutions for drive technologies, energy
distribution and automation for water and wastewater treatment
plants and water transport. Furthermore they provide solutions
for intelligent monitoring and control of water networks.

More information is also available on the SkyJuice Foundation
website: 
WWW.SKYJUICE.COM.AU/SKYHYDRANT.HTM

We support a variety of water-related projects through our corporate citizenship activities. Examples include the provision of
water treatment systems to help the victims of natural disasters like the tsunami in Japan and the floods in Pakistan. Similarly, we have supplied water pumps, dams, water collection
reservoirs and filtration systems that provide sustainable irrigation and clean water as part of the Asha project. The overall
goal of project Asha is to enhance living conditions through
integrated rural development and sustainable, replicable technology in the 350 inhabitant village of Amle near the city of
Mumbai. Read more about our activities on our website at:

Notes and forward-looking ­statements

There is no standard system that applies across companies for
qualifying products and solutions for environmental and climate protection, or for compiling and calculating the respective
revenues and the quantity of reduced carbon dioxide emissions
attributable to such products and solutions. Accordingly, revenues from our Environmental Portfolio and the r­ eduction of our
customers’ annual carbon dioxide emissions may not be comparable with similar information reported by other companies.
Revenues from our Environmental Portfolio and the reduction
of our customers’ annual carbon dioxide emissions are derived
from various internal reporting systems that are generally different from those applicable to the fi
­ nancial information presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements and are, in
particular, subject to less sophisticated internal documentation
as well as preparation and review r­ equirements, including the
IT systems in use and the general internal control environment.
We may change our policies for recognizing revenues from our
Environmental Portfolio and the reduction of our customers’
annual carbon dioxide emissions in the future without previous
notice.
This document contains statements related to our future business and financial performance and future events or developments involving Siemens that may constitute forward-looking
statements. These statements may be identified by words such
as “expect,” “look forward to,” “anticipate” “intend,” “plan,”
­“believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” “will,” “project” or words of similar
meaning. We may also make forward-looking statements in
other reports, in presentations, in material delivered to shareholders and in press releases. In addition, our representatives
may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements.
Such statements are based on the current expectations and

certain assumptions of Siemens’ management, of which many
are beyond Siemens’ control. These are subject to a number of
risks, uncertainties and factors, including, but not limited to
those described in disclosures, in particular in the chapter Risks
in this Annual Report. Should one or more of these risks or
­uncertainties materialize, or should underlying expectations
not occur or assumptions prove incorrect, actual results, per­
formance or achievements of Siemens may (negatively or
­positively) vary materially from those described explicitly or
implicitly in the relevant forward-looking statement. Siemens
neither intends, nor assumes any obligation, to update or
­revise these forward-looking statements in light of developments which ­differ from those anticipated.
This document includes – in IFRS not clearly defined – supplemental financial measures that are or may be non-GAAP financial measures. These supplemental financial measures should
not be viewed in isolation or as alternatives to measures of
Siemens’ net assets and financial positions or results of operations as presented in accordance with IFRS in its Consolidated
Financial Statements. Other companies that report or describe
similarly titled financial measures may calculate them differently.
Due to rounding, numbers presented throughout this and other
documents may not add up precisely to the totals provided and
percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.
This document is an English language translation of the
German document. In case of discrepancies, the German

valid version.
