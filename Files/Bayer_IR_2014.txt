2013 figures restated
1 EBIT = earnings before financial result and taxes
2 EBIT before special items and EBITDA before special items are not defined in the International Financial Reporting Standards and should therefore be regarded
only as supplementary information. EBITDA before special items is a more suitable indicator of operating performance since it is not affected by depreciation,
amortization, impairment losses, impairment loss reversals or special items. By reporting this indicator, the company aims to give readers a clear picture of the
results of operations and ensure comparability of data over time. See also Combined Management Report, Chapter 16.2 “Calculation of EBIT(DA) Before Special
Items.”
3 EBITDA = EBIT plus amortization and impairment losses on intangible assets, plus depreciation and impairment losses on property, plant and equipment, minus
impairment loss reversals. See also Combined Management Report, Chapter 16.2 “Calculation of EBIT(DA) Before Special Items.”
4 The EBITDA margin before special items is calculated by dividing EBITDA before special items by sales.
5 Earnings per share as defined in IAS 33 = net income divided by the average number of shares. For details see Note [16] to the consolidated financial statements.
6 Core earnings per share are not defined in the International Financial Reporting Standards. By reporting this indicator, the company aims to give readers a clear
picture of the results of operations and ensure comparability of data over time. The calculation of core earnings per share is explained in the Combined
Management Report, Chapter 16.3 “Core Earnings Per Share.”
7 Gross cash flow = income after income taxes, plus income taxes, plus financial result, minus income taxes paid or accrued, plus depreciation, amortization and
impairment losses, minus impairment loss reversals, plus / minus changes in pension provisions, minus gains / plus losses on retirements of noncurrent assets,
minus gains from the remeasurement of already held assets in step acquisitions. The change in pension provisions includes the elimination of non-cash
components of EBIT. It also contains benefit payments during the year. For details see Combined Management Report, Chapter 16.5 “Liquidity and Capital
Expenditures of the Bayer Group.“
8 Net cash flow = cash flow from operating activities according to IAS 7
9 Full-time equivalents
10 Percentage changes not based on rounded figures
11 LoPC-IR: rate of incidents in which chemicals leak from their primary container, such as pipelines, pumps, tanks or drums, per 200,000 working hours in areas
relevant to plant safety
12 Portfolio-adjusted in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol
13 Volatile organic compounds (VOC) excluding methane
14 Ozone-depleting substances (ODS) in CFC-11 equivalents
15 1 petajoule = 1015 joules
16 Energy efficiency: quotient of total energy consumption and manufactured sales volume. For MaterialScience, only manufactured sales volumes that also form
the basis for calculating MaterialScience-specific emissions are taken into account.

Chairman’s Letter

Decisive step to create a pure
Life Science company

In 2014, just a year after our 150th anniversary, Bayer opened up
a new chapter in its history: we initiated the decisive step toward
becoming a pure Life Science company. In the future we will
focus our entire innovative capability on designing molecules
and solutions that improve human health or nutrition. Never has
our mission “Bayer: Science For A Better Life” more truly
M@¿@>O@?RCJR@<M@<I?RC<OR@?J
While we continued to harvest the fruits of our own science and
research in 2014 with the global marketing of our recently
launched pharmaceuticals as well as our crop protection products
and seeds, we also successfully acquired the consumer care business of Merck & Co., Inc., United States – making us the global
number two in consumer care. This largely stable business now
helps us to compensate volatility in other businesses.

Bayer MaterialScience also performed well in 2014, successfully
addressing previous challenges. Against this background,

acquisitions.
In recent years, however, Bayer’s strategy and strong performance have increasingly been driven by our success in the
Life Sciences. This has meant that MaterialScience is competing
for resources against businesses that we believe continue to
KMJHDN@NDBID¾><IOGTCDBC@MM@OPMIN /C@M@AJM@R@?@>D?@?OJ
demerge MaterialScience so that it will have independent
access to the capital market, while Bayer focuses solely on the
Life Sciences.
This is a turning point in Bayer’s history. But our action is consistent with what our founders did and what the focus of our
research has been for more than 150 years. The best way we can
innovate is by inventing new molecules that ultimately lead to
innovative applications. The only thing that has changed over
ODH@<M@OC@H<MF@ONJM¾@G?NJA<KKGD><ODJIDIRCD>CJPMHJG@cules deliver the largest value contribution. Today, the focus is on
the Life Sciences. It is crucial for Bayer’s long-term success that
we continually adjust our business portfolio to market requirements and respond to the needs of customers and society.
In September 2014, the Supervisory Board unanimously approved
OC@?@H@MB@MJA(<O@MD<G.>D@I>@RCD>CR@DIO@I?OJ¿J<O
on the stock market by mid-2016. We are all convinced that this
NOM<O@BD>?@>DNDJIRDGG=MDIBBM@<O=@I@¾ON<I?JKKJMOPIDOD@Nð
for Bayer and for MaterialScience. The new, independent
company is set to retain leadership positions in all of its business
areas. We strongly believe in its future success.

Dialogue with physicians: Bayer ceo Dr. Marijn Dekkers and Associate Professor Dr. Jürgen Zumbé, Director of the
Urology Department at Leverkusen Hospital

As a pure Life Science company, Bayer will have a unique research
focus on the health of humans, animals and plants. And this research shows us today that the similarities between the different

species are far greater than was generally assumed just a few
decades ago. This is especially true at the cellular biochemical
level at which our active ingredients operate. While we are still at
an early stage, we are in the best position to potentially leverage
many synergies from species’ common characteristics.
To continue innovating and help physicians to care for their
patients, veterinarians to look after animals and farmers to feed the
growing world population, we must increasingly invest in research
and development (r&d). Our r&d budget for the Life Sciences in
2014 was €3.2 billion. Overall we expect the r&d-to-sales ratio to
continue increasing in the coming years.
The success of our pharmaceutical products, in particular, has great
NDBID¾><I>@DIOCDNM@B<M? 2@<M@<HJIBOC@A<NO@NOîBMJRDIBJA
the world’s major pharmaceutical companies. Last year we lifted
Pharmaceuticals sales by 11.2 percent on a currency- and portfolio-adjusted basis. The increase was driven by our recently launched
products Xarelto™, Eylea™, Stivarga™3J¾BJ™ and Adempas™.
CropScience, too, achieved a sales improvement of 11.2 percent
on a currency- and portfolio-adjusted basis, gaining market share
especially with the new products we brought to market in the past
few years.
.KPMM@?=TOC@N@NP>>@NN@NJPM>JHK<ITeN¾I<I>D<G?@Q@GJKH@IO
has also been outstanding. We can look back at another record
year for Bayer. Revenues increased in 2014 to over €42 billion,
which means we saw more than 7 percent growth after adjusting
for currency and portfolio effects. Our clean ebitda amounted to
€8.8 billion, up by nearly 5 percent compared with the prior year.
Core earnings per share rose by 7.3 percent to €6.02.

company with the highest market capitalization in the German
share index dax.
To continue strengthening our Life Science businesses, we
need not only organic growth but also bolt-on acquisitions. These
improve our regional positioning, round out our product portfolio
and can give us access to major new technologies. In 2014 we
spent a total of €13.5 billion for acquisitions.
The largest among these was Merck & Co., Inc.’s consumer care

non-prescription products across multiple therapeutic categories
and geographies. We also acquired Dihon Pharmaceutical Group
Co. Ltd., China, a consumer care company specializing in dermatology products. And we successfully completed the acquisition
of Algeta asa, Norway, with which we had already collaborated on
the development and commercialization of the cancer drug
3J¾BJ™ since 2009.
Acquisitions in CropScience include the Biagro group in
Argentina. Biagro’s portfolio comprises organic seed treatments
as well as crop protection products based on bacterial and fungal
strains. In addition, we acquired the seed business of Paraguayan
company Granar, which specializes in the breeding, production
and marketing of improved seeds, especially for soybeans.

I would like to emphasize at this point that our excellent
employees are our core business asset. Our corporate values of

organizational obstacles and making improvements every day
remain important elements of Bayer’s culture.
In the future we also intend to intensify the dialogue with our
various stakeholders. We are convinced of what we do and of the
value of our products. We will communicate even more effectively
to customers, society and politicians how our products improve
the lives of millions of people across the globe.
I am concerned by the growing number of critical stakeholders
whose claims and demands are based on emotions and beliefs

society creates the right framework for future innovations. In
this context it is also important to us that economic growth be
achieved in harmony with environmental and social responsibility.
We adhere to the fundamentals of sustainable development and
the ten principles of the Global Compact of the United Nations.
On behalf of the entire Bayer Group management team, I would
like to thank our employees for their dedication, motivation and
ingenuity. Bayer would not be the great company it is today
without them.

Exercise is out of the question for Noémi Baert. Even a
staircase with 20 steps pushes her to the limit. A walk of
just a few hundred meters is more than she can manage.
The 13-year-old from Destelbergen in Belgium isn’t even
able to carry her own schoolbag. Since the age of six,
Noémi has suffered from pulmonary hypertension. This
life-threatening illness can affect people of any age.
It usually begins gradually. The patient tires more easily
than before, and any exertion leads to shortness of
=M@<OC /C@NTHKOJHNM@H<DIIJIîNK@>D¾><NOC@>JI?Dtion progresses. They can include increasing shortness
of breath, a decline in physical strength, chest pains,
water retention in the legs, blue lips and fainting. These
symptoms are caused by a narrowing of the pulmonary
arteries, which can happen for a variety of reasons. As
other, comparatively common conditions involve similar
symptoms, it may be several years before a patient is
diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension. This is the
term physicians use to group together the various forms
of the disease. Noémi was lucky in one respect, as a
cardiologist quickly reached the correct diagnosis. “That
helped my daughter to get the right treatment,” says
Noémi’s mother, Danielle Verbrugghen.
However, Christian Müller from Arnsberg had to wait many
years. His ordeal began in 2004 with a severe pulmonary
embolism caused by a vein thrombosis. Müller, who was 36
at the time, spent several months in critical condition in the
hospital. Even during his subsequent rehabilitation, he just
wasn’t recovering properly. “I wasn’t able to do the exercise section of the program,” recalls Müller, who is trained
in wholesale and export trade. The doctors couldn’t pinpoint the cause and, to alleviate the symptoms, they prescribed oxygen treatment. For the next three years, an oxygen machine was Müller’s constant companion. “I couldn’t
work anymore and it was impossible to live an independent life,” he says. His parents helped him with day-to-day
tasks, but eventually he had to use a wheelchair. When
Müller was admitted to the hospital in the spring of 2007

Whether it is human or animal health, innovative pharmaceutical products or self-medication, the breadth of our
business and portfolio enables us to respond to a rapidly
evolving environment. For example, the boundaries
between “patients” and “consumers” are increasingly
fading, with prevention and well-being becoming almost
as important as the treatment of diseases. The knowhow and expertise within and across our four divisions
enable us to capture our customers’ needs in what we
think is the best possible way.
One of the key pillars of our long-term strategy is research
and development (r&d) across our businesses, aimed at
driving innovation beyond 2020. Some of our current and
recently launched products will run out of patent between
2023 and 2025. It is therefore essential that the next
wave of innovation follow seamlessly to safeguard growth.
Our r&d efforts in this regard focus on the areas in which
we excel and have a proven track record of success, for
example in cardiology, women’s health and some areas of
oncology.

An operation at Cologne
University Hospital: Professor
Stephan Rosenkranz and
surgical nurse Nina Küpper

13-year-old Noémi suffers from pulmonary hypertension. Here in the Wuppertal laboratory, Bayer researcher Professor Johannes-Peter Stasch talks to
Noémi and her mother, Danielle Verbrugghen, about the disease.
Cardiologist Professor Stephan Rosenkranz and his
colleague Dr. Joana Jesus during the morning rounds

following yet another pulmonary hemorrhage, a doctor
there suspected he was suffering from pulmonary hypertension. “He sent me to the cardiac center at Cologne University Hospital for further tests,” Müller explains.
The center is home to cardiologist Professor Stephan
Rosenkranz, one of the few experts on pulmonary hypertension in Germany. He is in charge of the center’s pulmonary hypertension outpatient clinic and knows from
experience that it can still take a long time before a patient with the condition gets to see a specialist. “Early diagnosis is very important for treating this condition – and

diagnosis, it is essential to measure the blood pressure in
the pulmonary arteries and examine the right ventricle of
the heart using a catheter. Further tests are needed to determine the type of pulmonary hypertension affecting the
patient. In Müller’s case, it turned out that his illness was
caused by the pulmonary embolism he had suffered back
in 2004. In this form of the disease, known as chronic
thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (cteph), tiny
blood clots in the small pulmonary arteries are responsible for the increased pressure and associated symptoms.
cteph can occur as a rare complication of acute pulmonary embolism, but the pathogenesis is not completely
understood. “In many cases, this form of pulmonary hy-

of people with pulmonary

hypertension are not correctly
diagnosed until the disease has
reached an advanced stage.

The blood vessels in the lung
are constricted, so the heart has
to work harder to pump blood
through them.
This progressively weakens the

oxygen supply.

pertension is potentially curable with special surgery,”
says Rosenkranz. That was true for Müller, too. Although
he still very much feels the effects of his disease, he can
now live without an oxygen machine again.
This type of surgery is not possible for young Noémi, as
she suffers from a different form of pulmonary hypertension called pulmonary arterial hypertension. She is
helped by various medications that lower the pressure by
expanding the pulmonary arteries and relieving the strain
on her heart. “There are now several drugs that have

of patients with inoperable cteph or persistent or recurrent cteph after surgery,” Rosenkranz reports. Yet there
remains a great need for further research. “We haven’t
achieved our goal yet,” he points out, adding that universities and the research-driven pharmaceutical industry
still have much work to do. “On the one hand, we must
continue to improve existing treatment options. On the
other, we need to identify new targets for active ingredients in order to develop new drugs that inhibit excessive
cell growth. This cell growth is partly responsible for
the narrowing of the pulmonary arteries.”
Developing drugs that can dilate arteries or address the
remodeling or increased formation of tissue in the inner
lining of the arteries is a core area of research at Bayer
HealthCare. Under a co-development and co-commercialization agreement concluded last year, Bayer HealthCare is collaborating with u.s. pharmaceutical company

Consumer Care // With its range of non-prescription
and nutritional products, Bayer aims to help people do
more for their health and well-being. This not only
increases personal quality of life but can also greatly
reduce health care costs.

Human life expectancy is increasing. At the same time,
more and more people are making their own choice of
medicines for the prevention or treatment of day-to-day
ailments. And many people get information from the
internet. “It has never been easier – or so important –
to actively improve your own health,” says Erica Mann,
spokesperson for the World Self-Medication Industry
(wsmi) and Head of the Consumer Care Division of Bayer
HealthCare.
According to forecasts by the u.s. Department of Health
and Human Services‘ National Institute on Aging, the

over-65s are the fastest-growing section of the population. That is causing health care costs to rise, and the
strain on physicians and care givers is growing. Companies in the health care industry have an important contribution to make: “We need a new, innovative approach to
health care,” says Mann. “Instead of waiting until people
become ill before we treat them, we should be giving
them the products and the information they need to help
them stay healthy.” Non-prescription medicines – also
known as over-the-counter (otc) products – and nutritional supplements play a key role in this, as do opportuIDOD@NOJ¾I?JPO<=JPOQ<MDJPNC@<GOCîM@G<O@?OJKD>N

Bayer is the second-leading supplier
of non-prescription products worldwide – and the number one in the
United States, the world’s largest
otc market.

As a global leader in the otc and nutritionals sector,
Bayer is in a good position to provide access to non-prescription products worldwide. After all, the company

years, starting with probably the best-known painkiller of
them all – AspirinTM. Over the decades, the otc portfolio
has been expanded to include everything from products
to treat skin problems, gastrointestinal conditions or
colds to nutritional supplements.
The company’s recent purchase of the consumer care
business of u.s. pharmaceuticals group Merck & Co., Inc.
– the second largest acquisition in Bayer’s history – has
added numerous leading products to this list, mostly in
the cold, allergy, sinus &¿P?@MH<OJGJBTDI>GP?DIBNPI
care), foot health and gastrointestinal categories. “The
expansion of our portfolio makes us an even better partner for consumers worldwide,” comments Bayer HealthCare ceo Dr. Olivier Brandicourt.
Bayer is now the second-leading supplier of non-prescription products globally and has risen to number one
in the u.s., the largest otc market in the world. Following
the takeover of Steigerwald Arzneimittelwerk GmbH in
Germany, Bayer is now active in the area of herbal medicines as well, while the acquisition of Dihon Pharma-

ceutical, a leading company in the manufacture and marketing of otc products in China, opens the door to the

Bayer HealthCare doesn’t only help people through its
products, but offers extensive information on improving and maintaining health. “As standards of living improve around the world, health awareness is growing
along with people’s desire to boost their knowledge of
health issues,” explains Dr. Felix Reiff, a member of
Consumer Care’s global management team.
Bayer supports consumers with a wide range of services.
For example, the company works with the American
Heart Association to provide online information about
how people can lower their blood pressure by changing
their habits. Another website gives professional advice

Bayer’s scientists are working in interdisciplinary teams across subgroup
boundaries: for example, molecular biologist Dr. Wayne Coco (above) and his
team are working to design therapeutic antibodies for use in the treatment of
diseases such as cancer. Meanwhile, Dr. Bernard Haendler from Bayer
HealthCare in Berlin and Catherine Sirven from Bayer CropScience in Lyon
are conducting joint research into gene regulation (left).

MaterialScience // Innovative materials such as those produced and constantly improved by Bayer MaterialScience
are the driving force behind technological progress. The
planned demerger from the Bayer Group is expected to
make MaterialScience the fourth-leading chemical company
in Europe – and enable it to apply its strengths even more
effectively.

His eyes scrutinize it closely as he taps it a few times and
runs his hand over the gleaming black surface – Hans-Jörg
Dahmen nods in satisfaction. “A perfect sample,” he says,
putting the freshly pressed rectangle down in front of the
injection molding machine. Here at the technical center in
Leverkusen, the engineer from Application Development
at Bayer MaterialScience has just examined a new panoramic roof for a car. The sample product is made from
high-performance polycarbonate and was produced in a
single process. And it’s 50 percent lighter than conventional glass roofs. “Automotive manufacturers are grateful
for such developments because the less a vehicle weighs,
OC@BM@<O@MDONAP@G@A¾>D@I>T<I?@IQDMJIH@IO<G>JHK<ODbility,” Dahmen explains.
The automotive sector is just one of many key industries
for which Bayer MaterialScience produces and develops
materials, and polycarbonate is one of its main products.

holstered furniture. And in the form of rigid foam, they
serve primarily as insulation for buildings and refrigeration equipment. Polyurethane chemistry is also the basis
for precursors used in coatings, adhesives and sealants,
RCD>C<GNJŵAJMHK<MOJAOC@<T@M(<O@MD<G.>D@I>@KJMOî
folio. The company holds leading positions on the world
market in all of these segments.
Whether protective coatings, insulating foam or lightweight
polycarbonate: products like these can help to master the
challenges posed by climate change, increasing mobility
and the growth of cities. “With this in mind, we develop
sustainable solutions that contribute to preserving the environment, improve our quality of life and create value,”
says ceo Patrick Thomas. The foundations underlying all
this are a culture steeped in innovation and our proximity
to customers all over the world.
Added to these factors are a strategy aligned to technological and cost leadership, along with highly modern, competitive large-scale facilities in which the company continues to invest. In late 2014, for example, MaterialScience

friendly plant at its site in Dormagen, Germany, for the

production of the polyurethane component tdi. Total investment in the plant came to €250 million.
Independence is intended to put the company in a position
to apply its strengths even more effectively, rapidly and
¿@SD=GT<B<DINOOC@BGJ=<G>JHK@ODODJI (JNODHKJMO<IOGT
it will then be easier for MaterialScience to raise the capital it needs to continue developing its business and align
its organization, processes and corporate culture solely toward its own industrial environment and business model.
The plans call for MaterialScience to be a stand-alone
company with a new name by mid-2016 at the latest –
likely as the fourth-largest chemical company in Europe,
with approximately 16,800 highly skilled employees who
have every reason to be optimistic for the future. //

Patrick Thomas, Chairman of the
Executive Committee of Bayer MaterialScience,
on the subgroup’s strategy

“Our company combines
many advantages”
!JGGJRDIBOC@<IIJPI>@H@IOJAOC@KG<II@?¿JO<ODJI
all eyes are now on Bayer MaterialScience and there are
high expectations – among employees, customers and
potential investors. I am convinced that we are optimally
equipped for the future. We know this because our company has many advantages: a consistent focus on innovation and sustainability, outstanding employees, marketleading positions, and locations close to its customers.
Then there are our advanced technologies and safe plants,

About this Report
Reporting principles

Reporting principles
This Annual Report provides comprehensive and
transparent information on all the topics we believe
are important for the company and its stakeholders.
The consolidated financial statements of the Bayer
Group were prepared according to the International Financial Reporting Standards (ifrs) and the
applicable provisions of the German Commercial
Code. The combined management report complies
with the German Commercial Code and German
financial reporting standards.
The financial statements of Bayer AG were prepared
according to the requirements of the German Commercial Code and Stock Corporation Act. The Compensation Report for the Board of Management and
the Supervisory Board complies with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code.
The consolidated financial statements and the combined management report are published in line with
statutory disclosure requirements.
The Bayer Group’s sustainability reporting is aligned
to the g3.1 guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (gri) and the ten principles of the un Global
Compact (ungc). The gri has checked and confirmed
that level a+ has been maintained. The logo and a
gri index listing the corresponding ungc principles
can be found in the “Further Information” section
under “gri Index and un Global Compact Principles.”
A comprehensive overview of the gri indicators
and an outline of our progress in implementing the
10 ungc principles (corresponding to the Advanced
Level) are available online. Our reporting is also
aligned to international guidelines and recommendations, including those on the definition and selection
of non-financial indicators and on reporting.
We follow the oecd guidelines and comply with the
iso 26000 standard. In selecting and measuring our
key data we also take into account the recommendations of the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies (effas) in the case of non-financial
indicators, and those of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol regarding greenhouse gas emissions. We also
consider the recommendations of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (wbcsd)
and the European Chemical Industry Council (cefic).
This year we will again submit a declaration of
conformity with the German Sustainability Code.

DATA COLLECTION FOR FINANCIAL AND
NON-FINANCIAL INDICATORS

Credible reporting is based on transparency and data
validity. We collect the data of all relevant organizational units and companies worldwide that fall within
the scope of the Bayer Group’s consolidated financial
statements.
All hse (health, safety and environmental protection)
performance indicators for the Group are collated
in our Group-wide site information system (BaySIS).
The hse data cover all fully consolidated companies
in which Bayer owns at least 50% of the shares.
The performance indicators of these companies are
fully consolidated regardless of the exact proportion
of the shares held by Bayer. Data on occupational
injuries, transport accidents and environmental incidents are collected at all sites worldwide. Environmentally relevant indicators are measured at all production sites.
We mainly use sap systems to collect financial data
worldwide. We use the global sap hr information
system and the associated reporting application – the
Sustainability Management Annual Reporting Tool
(smart) – to collect hr indicators and social data.
As the indicators in this report are stated in accordance with commercial rounding principles, totals
and percentages may not always be exact.

Investor Information

The stock market in 2014
STOCK MARKETS END THE YEAR WITH GAINS FOLLOWING A VOLATILE PERFORMANCE
2014 was dominated by stock market gains, interspersed with considerable volatility. Sentiment was
held back by emerging economic concerns in Europe, the Ukraine crisis and the related sanctions, and
conflicts in the Middle East. By contrast, low capital market rates and the economic upturn in the United
States were sources of optimism. The dax topped 10,000 points several times in the first half of the year,
dropping back to below 8,600 in mid-October. It then rallied strongly to a new high for the year, reaching 10,087 at the start of December, and ended the year up 2.7 percent at around 9,800 points.
The European equities index euro stoxx 50 (performance index) rose 4 percent, ending the
year at 5,851 points. Share prices also rose in the United States and Japan. The s&p 500 index gained
11.4 percent, while the Nikkei 225 rose by 7.1 percent.
RETURN ON BAYER SHARES WELL ABOVE MARKET
Including the dividend of €2.10 per share paid at the end of April, the return on Bayer stock was
13.2 percent in 2014, a far better performance than most of the benchmark indices. The share price
performance in the second half of the year was particularly encouraging. Bayer stock ended the year at
€113.00, having reached a high for the year and an all-time high of €120.95 in late November and early
December.
The euro stoxx Health Care Index (performance index) rose by 8 percent in 2014, while the
euro stoxx Chemicals Index (performance index) advanced by 3 percent.
More than 95 percent of the roughly 30 equity analysts who regularly rate our company had a buy or
hold recommendation on our stock at the end of last year.

FAVORABLE FINANCING CONDITIONS FACILITATE EXTENSIVE BOND ISSUANCE BY BAYER
Issue volume on the corporate bond market was significant in 2014, with interest coupons at a historic
low, and demand from investors consistently high. Supply was mainly driven by increasing mergers and
acquisitions activity. Investors were interested in both short and medium-term maturities, depending on
how they expected interest rates to develop. At the same time, demand for subordinated debt remained
high throughout the year thanks to higher returns.
The development of risk premiums is apparent from the trend in credit default swaps (cds) shown in
Graphic 2.2. On the derivatives market, the price of these tradable insurance contracts, which are used
to hedge against default of a borrower, show how market participants rate a company’s credit standing.
As can be seen from the graphic, 2014 was characterized by little volatility and low rate levels. Looking
at the overall cost, there was a further drop in refinancing costs for companies compared with 2013
because credit premiums were relatively stable and the risk-free interest rate declined significantly
during the year.
Bayer used this attractive environment for strategic refinancing and issued several emtns with a total
nominal volume of €3.0 billion, two hybrid bonds with a total nominal volume of €3.25 billion and, for
the first time since 1998, 144a/RegS bonds denominated in u.s. dollars with a total nominal volume of
us$7.0 billion. The issues comprised a total of eleven tranches with maturities of between two and ten
years and 60 or 61 years for the hybrids. Most were issued with fixed-rate coupons, although some of
the shorter maturities have floating-rate coupons based on the 3-month euribor or 3-month usdlibor.
A €1.3 billion bond issued in 2009 matured in 2014 and was repaid. Further details of outstanding
bonds are given in Note [27] to the consolidated financial statements.

LONG-TERM RETURN ON BAYER STOCK WELL AHEAD OF THE MARKET
A long-term investor who purchased Bayer shares for €10,000 five years ago and reinvested all dividends would have seen the value of the position grow to €22,991 as of December 31, 2014, giving an
average annual return of 18.1 percent. This was well above the return on the dax and the euro stoxx
50 (performance index) in the same period. Bayer stock also outperformed these indices on a three-year
view and in 2014.

DIVIDEND INCREASE TO €2.25 PER SHARE
The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose to the Annual Stockholders’
Meeting that the dividend be increased by €0.15 to €2.25 per share. Thus we once again intend that
our stockholders should participate in last year’s positive business performance. The resulting payout
ratio of 37.4 percent calculated on core earnings per share is within our target corridor of 30 to
40 percent (for details of the calculation of core earnings per share, see Chapter 16.3 of the Combined
Management Report).
The dividend yield calculated on the share price of €113.00 at year end 2014 amounts to 2.0 percent
and the total dividend payment to €1,861 million.

100 percent free float as defined by Deutsche Börse, the operator of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
ACCOLADES FOR EXCELLENT CAPITAL MARKET COMMUNICATION
Bayer’s investor relations activities in 2014 were dominated by structural and strategic decisions.
Investor interest focused on portfolio adjustments already undertaken or announced, such as the
decision on the planned stock market flotation of MaterialScience and the acquisitions of Algeta asa,
Norway, and the consumer care business of Merck & Co., Inc., United States.
Our “Meet Management” conferences in Leverkusen, New York and London gave investors and analysts
an opportunity for direct dialogue with our top management. We were present at 18 brokers’ conferences and conducted 30 roadshows. These activities took place in a total of 22 financial centers. As in
previous years, private investors also had an opportunity to find out about our company at various
stockholder forums at which the Investor Relations team was present.
We received a number of awards for our ir work in 2014. For example, in the Thomson Reuters Extel
Survey 2014 we were awarded three first prizes in the chemicals sector: for the best cfo, the best ir
professional and the best ir work in the sector. We were also ranked third among dax 30 companies in
a report by the German Investor Relations Association (dirk) and the German business magazine
Wirtschaftswoche.

We have also adopted a clearer position as we compete to attract the best talent, using the slogan:
“Passion to Innovate, Power to Change.” Further details can be found in the Chapter “Employees.”

1.2 Group Strategy
In line with our mission “Bayer: Science For A Better Life,” we aim to improve people’s quality of life.
For this endeavor, we focus on our core competency of developing and successfully commercializing
innovative products and solutions based on scientific knowledge.
ENTIRE FOCUS ON LIFE SCIENCE BUSINESSES
Bayer in future will focus entirely on the Life Science businesses – HealthCare and CropScience – and
intends to float MaterialScience on the stock market as a separate company by mid-2016 at the latest.
This move is designed to give MaterialScience direct access to the capital market for the continued
development of its business. MaterialScience will align its organizational and process structures and
corporate culture with its own industrial environment and business model in order to become a leading
polymers company.

OUR OBJECTIVE: PROFITABLE GROWTH
Our corporate strategy is aligned toward profitable growth that will increase corporate value in the long
term. We place special importance on developing new products and solutions that create significant
value for customers and patients, and on serving the Emerging Markets, particularly those of Asia and
Latin America. In this way we are giving more and more customers access to our products and establishing a solid basis for further growth.

THE FOUNDATION FOR OUR SUCCESS: INNOVATION
Bayer is steadily opening up new, attractive market segments in fast-growing and research-driven
areas of the Life Sciences. Our success is based on the development of new molecules, technologies,
processes and business models. In the long term we expect additional growth impetus to come from
interdisciplinary and interspecies research as we build on successful first steps in these areas. We aim
to drive growth in our established business areas through investment in research and development as
well as through acquisitions and collaborations. We are investing heavily to deliver organic growth in
all areas of activity. Bayer plans to invest a total of over €6 billion in research and development and
in property, plant and equipment in 2015.

OUR ACTIONS: SUSTAINABLE
Sustainable business practices are essential to the Group’s future viability. We therefore endeavor to
balance our economic objectives with social and ecological requirements in the development, manufacturing and marketing of our products. We aim to ensure broad social acceptance for our business
through responsible practices in the areas of compliance (e.g. anti-corruption and responsible marketing), human resources policy, product stewardship, health, environmental protection, safety and supplier management and by taking into account the expectations of important stakeholders.

OUR MOST CRUCIAL RESOURCE: THE EMPLOYEES
Motivated employees are especially important for the successful development of our business. Bayer
embraces a performance- and development-oriented corporate culture, coupled with a pronounced
sense of social responsibility. We encourage human and cultural diversity within the company, placing
special importance on pleasant work environments, flexible working conditions and excellent vocational
and advanced training opportunities. We offer excellent career prospects and aim to continue attracting
the most talented people to support our company’s successful and sustainable development.

1.3 Targets and Performance Indicators
To consistently implement our strategy, we have set ourselves ambitious Group targets and measure
their attainment annually in terms of selected performance indicators. This program encompasses not
only financial targets and innovation goals, but also sustainability objectives that are aligned to important areas along the value chain. Our aim is to make clear the challenges we have identified in our
core business in the context of sustainable development, and at the same time to highlight the continuous improvements we are committed to making throughout the Group. The current status of our progress in these areas is documented in the following table and the respective chapters.

1. Bayer at a Glance

Details of further key financial data are found in Chapter 20 “Future Perspectives.”
Information on our Group targets is also provided in the relevant chapters. This is indicated by the
reference to “Group target” in the margin.

1.4 Internal Management System
The economic planning and steering for the business units is carried out within a framework laid down
by the Group Management Board that is refined during the strategic planning process. Operational
planning then translates this framework into specific, measurable targets. Continuous monitoring of
business developments complements the planning and management process, and key management and
performance indicators are regularly updated. This process also involves tracking the implementation of
the strategic objectives and adopting countermeasures in the event of deviations from the budget.
KEY INDICATORS
One of the prime objectives of the Bayer Group is to steadily increase enterprise value. We use the
following steering parameters to plan, steer and monitor the development of our business:
See Chapter 16.4

The key performance indicators at the strategic level are cash value added (cva), which is a value-based
steering parameter, and cash flow return on investment (cfroi). These indicators support management
in its decision-making, especially in the areas of strategic portfolio optimization and the allocation of
resources for acquisitions and capital expenditures. (See Chapter 16.4 “Value Management” for further
details.)

See Chapter 16.2

The principal economic steering parameters within the Bayer Group at the operational level are sales
and earnings figures. With regard to earnings, special attention is paid to ebitda (earnings before financial result, taxes, depreciation and amortization) before special items. The ebitda margin before special
items, which is the ratio of ebitda before special items to sales, serves as a relative indicator for the
internal and external comparison of operational earning power. (See Chapter 16.2 “Calculation of
ebit(da) Before Special Items” for further details.)
Targets and performance indicators are defined and established in areas such as innovation, supplier
management, safety and product stewardship to align the Group toward sustainability. Bayer AG, as the
strategic management holding company, has implemented management systems in close coordination
with the subgroups to steer the Group’s sustainable development.

1.5 Value Creation
The value added statement shows Bayer’s contribution to public and private incomes and is a measure
of the value the company’s business activities create for its stakeholders. We define value added as the
company’s total operating performance in the previous fiscal year less the costs of procured and consumed goods and services, depreciation and amortization.
The total operating performance of the Bayer Group in 2014 was €43.3 billion. Value added increased
by 5% to €15.3 billion. Of the value added, €9.8 billion (64%) was distributed to employees, €1.9 billion
(12%) to stockholders, €0.7 billion (5%) to lenders and €1.3 billion (9%) to governments. The remainder was allocated to reserves.

In addition to direct cash flows, the company creates value for its stakeholders in various ways, in particular by focusing on innovative products and solutions in our core businesses. We operate production
sites throughout the world, invest locally in research and development, work with international and local
suppliers and contribute to the economic development of our target markets. As an employer, we provide jobs in industrialized, emerging and developing economies and create purchasing power through
the salaries we pay. We also support public infrastructure through payments of regional taxes.

1.6 Corporate Environment
Bayer’s business activities are impacted by economic and social conditions. At the same time, Bayer
contributes to shaping these conditions.
ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
Global economic growth in 2014 was at the level of the previous year but below expectations. While
the upswing in the United States continued, Europe’s economic recovery was hesitant. Development
in Europe was held back by continuing high unemployment, especially in the countries of southern
Europe. The pace of growth in the emerging markets declined. China continued to experience a high,
though weaker, rate of growth. Positive stimuli for the world economy came mainly from the persistently expansionary monetary policy of the industrialized countries and the drop in the oil price, which
strengthened private consumption.

SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT
As a commercial enterprise, Bayer is part of society, and the company’s business activity is therefore
closely linked with the social environment. The influence of stakeholders (see Graphic 3.1.5) on our
business activity has steadily increased in recent years. Their expectations regarding sustainable
development affect public acceptance of the company and thus our commercial success. We take the
wide-ranging requirements of our stakeholders seriously and consider them wherever possible in our
business activities. Evaluating their expectations and requirements provides significant impetus for the
continued development of our activities, our risk management and our reporting. At the same time,
open dialogue with our stakeholders gives us an opportunity to explain the value that our products and
services hold for society. This is of growing importance for the success of our business model.

3. Strategies of the Subgroups

3. Strategies of the Subgroups
HEALTHCARE
The rise in life expectancy and the associated increase in chronic diseases are driving the demand for
innovative medicines. Due to the need to contain costs in the health care systems of the industrialized
regions, particularly North America, Europe and Japan, cost carriers are exerting more and more pressure on drug prices and increasing their demands for the health care industry to demonstrate the value
added by new therapies. In the emerging economies, patients and consumers are gaining improved
access to health care and thus the opportunity to benefit from innovative medicines.

See Chapter 1.2
for Bayer Group
strategy

In this environment, our strategy is geared toward achieving above-average, profitable and sustained
growth by continuously developing innovative health care products with a positive cost-benefit ratio and
strengthening our consumer health business.
In our largest segment in terms of sales, Pharmaceuticals, we intend to step up our activities in cardiology, oncology, gynecology, hematology and ophthalmology. To achieve our medium-term growth
targets, we are relying particularly on our recently launched products Xarelto™, Eylea™, Stivarga™,
Xofigo™ and Adempas™. We plan to steadily expand the indications for these medicines through comprehensive study programs and thus make them available to further patient groups. We also consider
entering into partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies.
To safeguard long-term growth, we will further increase our investment in research and development.
Among other projects, we plan to achieve crucial progress in the development of five drug candidates in
cardiology, oncology and gynecology. In addition, we are selectively expanding and supplementing our
development portfolio through licensing agreements and acquisitions. In March 2014, we acquired
Algeta asa, Norway, which specializes in the development of novel cancer therapies. We had partnered
with Algeta in the development and marketing of Xofigo™ since 2009. In June 2014, we entered into a
licensing agreement with Orion Corporation, Finland, concerning the global development and marketing of the development candidate odm-201 for the treatment of prostate cancer.

Innovative products for
profitable and
sustainable growth

This focus on certain therapeutic areas is supplemented by specific measures for key markets such as
Japan, Germany, Brazil, China and Russia. In the medium term, we aim to strengthen our presence in
the United States. We want to maximize the potential of our extensive portfolio of established products,
especially in the Emerging Markets.
We are developing concepts to facilitate access to our products, especially in developing and emerging
countries, as part of our “Access to Medicine” (atm) activities.
online annex: 3-3-bhc-1:
In the field of hormonal contraception, we partner in family planning programs with international
development organizations such as the United States Agency for International Development (usaid),
the United Nations Population Fund (unfpa) and the non-governmental organization International
Planned Parenthood Federation (ippf). We support the World Health Organization (who) in the fight
against neglected tropical diseases. In some markets where large segments of the population have no
access to innovative medicines, we offer patient assistance programs. Detailed information on all
events can be found on our website.
TARGETED FAMILY PLANNING
We support family planning programs by offering a broad range of hormonal contraception methods.
In addition to oral contraceptives, these products include monthly and three-monthly injections as
well as the Jadelle™ contraceptive implant, a reversible long-term contraceptive method used for a
period of up to five years. In 2014 we made available 25.8 million cyps of oral contraceptives, injections and implants, an increase of 18.5% compared with the previous year. (The figures for 20112013 were calculated using the msi Impact Calculator version 1.2, while the figures for 2014 were
obtained using version 2.0. In order to compare the figures from the last two years, 2013 was recalculated using the most recent version. This resulted in an overall increase of 18.5%.) The indicator

cyps (Couple Years of Protection) denotes the number of couples who used the contraceptives provided for a year.
In addition to our commitment to family planning programs run by aid organizations, we are finding
new ways to give women in developing countries secure, long-term access to our contraceptives. In
2009, for example, we established the Contraceptive Security Initiative (csi) together with usaid and
introduced the oral contraceptive Microgynon™ Fe to the African market at a reduced price. In addition to subsidized aid programs, csi aims to make contraceptive pills available particularly to middleclass couples in developing countries. Since January 2013, a partnership between HealthCare and
the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, United States, has expanded access to our contraceptive implant Jadelle™. As part of this agreement, we reduced by more than half the price of the Jadelle™ implant, which has been prequalified by the who. The agreement provides for up to 27 million women
in the world’s poorest countries to receive access to this reversible, long-term contraceptive method
by 2018.
Another cornerstone of our commitment is education for youths and young adults. Together with
the German Foundation for World Population, we have established an innovative education and
advancement program for young people. Adolescents between the ages of 10 and 14 receive ageappropriate information on sexuality and contraception. The Young Adolescents Project (yap) was
launched in Uganda in 2009 and extended to Kenya in 2013.
TACKLING NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
Many diseases that primarily affect the poorest sections of the population can only be combated with
a substantial international effort. In 2012 prominent stakeholders such as HealthCare established the
biggest initiative to date in the fight against neglected tropical diseases. The goal of the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases is to contain or, if possible, eliminate 10 of these tropical
diseases by 2020. For more than 10 years now, HealthCare has supported the who by providing
medicines to treat African sleeping sickness and Chagas’ disease free of charge.
In the fight against river blindness, HealthCare and the non-profit organization DNDi (Drugs for
Neglected Diseases) have entered into a new collaboration to develop emodepside, a macrofilaricidal
drug, to treat this neglected tropical disease. Emodepside originates from the Japanese company
Astellas and was developed by HealthCare’s Animal Health Division for use in veterinary medicine.
This active ingredient may provide an effective way to treat river blindness by killing the threadworms that cause the disease in humans.
PROGRAMS FOR IMPROVED ACCESS TO MEDICINES
In some countries where large sections of the population have no access to innovative medicines,
patient assistance programs are being established for selected products. These programs, which are
carried out jointly with partners from local health systems and non-governmental organizations, help
to satisfy unmet medical needs. This applies both to treatment with innovative products, e.g. in oncology, and to therapies for chronic diseases such as multiple sclerosis and hemophilia. These programs are developed locally and regionally to do maximum justice to specific patient needs. Patient
assistance programs exist in the United States, China, India, certain south and southeast Asian countries, and a number of countries in southeastern Europe.

3. Strategies of the Subgroups

Our investment in the Consumer Health segment is concentrated on fields of business in which we are
aiming for leadership.
The strategy of the Consumer Care Division is aimed at building on our position in the over-thecounter (otc) medicines business. In 2014, we expanded our Consumer Care portfolio by acquiring the
consumer care business of Merck & Co., Inc., United States, adding leading brands such as Claritin™,
Coppertone™ and Dr. Scholl’s™. We also acquired Dihon Pharmaceutical Group Co. Ltd., China, which
offers self-medication products in the fields of dermatology and traditional Chinese medicine, and now
are primarily focusing on integrating these acquired business areas. We intend to continue exploiting
external growth opportunities through acquisitions and inlicensing as part of the global consolidation of
the otc industry.
To sharpen our regional focus, we are expanding our position in important markets such as the
United States, Brazil, Russia and China. We aim to strengthen our established brands, such as Aspirin™,
Aleve™ and Berocca™, through product line extensions and geographical expansion. We are also working to get certain prescription products transitioned to otc status.
The Medical Care Division comprises two business units, Diabetes Care and Radiology.
At Diabetes Care, we are focusing on our core business of innovative blood glucose meters and developing strategic partnerships for further market penetration, such as the collaboration with Medtronic in
the United States.
In the Radiology business unit, we aim to defend our leading position through innovative product and
service offerings and by streamlining our portfolio. Against this background, we divested our Interventional business with thrombectomy and atherectomy systems to Boston Scientific, United States, in September 2014.
Our Animal Health Division aims to strengthen its position in the already heavily consolidated market
for veterinary medicines. Here we rely not only on organic growth, such as through the increased use of
existing distribution channels, especially specialist retail chains, but are also adding to our portfolio
with targeted inlicensing and acquisitions.
CROPSCIENCE
Sustainable agriculture, higher crop yields and improved crop quality are becoming increasingly important. Global agricultural production must increase by approximately 60% by 2050 in order to ensure
adequate nutrition for a growing world population despite the limited amount of arable land and the
increased demand for animal feed and renewable raw materials. CropScience is aligning its corporate
planning to these long-term trends in the agricultural markets. Our aim is to help shape the future of the
agricultural industry, increase its productivity and thus generate profitable and sustainable growth for
our business. CropScience’s strategy is built on four key elements:
•
•
•
•

enhancing the Crop Protection and Environmental Science portfolio,
increasing customer centricity along the entire value chain,
leading the way in innovation,
and expanding the Seeds business.

Our activities focus on implementing these elements.
We aim to enhance our Crop Protection and Environmental Science portfolios by adding new and improved products, concentrating on core brands and offering integrated solutions in major crops. Support for this endeavor is provided by our important technology platform for both chemical and biological crop protection. We are investing heavily in the expansion of our production capacities to meet
rising demand for our products.

3. Strategies of the Subgroups

Another major part of our strategy is to strengthen customer centricity along the entire value chain and
continuously optimize distribution. In this context we are also steadily expanding the successful business model of food chain partnerships in the form of collaborations with food processors and retailers.
This furthers our objective of sustainably increasing productivity through a joint effort with our customers. In these projects, CropScience works with all participants in the food chain to safeguard and increase yields, and to improve the quality of harvested produce. To strengthen customer centricity, we
are also increasing our commitment to direct cooperation with farmers as part of the Bayer Forward
Farming initiative. At these “ForwardFarms” we can demonstrate the advantages of our integrated
solutions and services to interested stakeholders.
To lead the way in innovation, we aim to build on our expertise in the integration of seed technology
with chemical and biological crop protection in order to develop holistic solutions. New areas of innovation, such as digitization in agriculture, account for a major part of this.
Another key element in our strategy is the expansion of our Seeds business. We plan to further
strengthen our positions in our established crops – cotton, oilseed rape / canola, rice and vegetables –
and to build significant positions in soybeans and wheat. For example, we intend to gain long-term
access to high-quality breeding material through acquisitions, inlicensing and partnerships and to
steadily expand our existing breeding expertise.

MaterialScience
helps to address
global challenges

MATERIALSCIENCE
MaterialScience, with its high-tech polymer materials and application solutions, is helping to address
the global challenges posed by population growth, the depletion of fossil resources, climate change and
increasing urbanization. We are steadily developing our product portfolio, which mainly comprises
components for polyurethane foams, high-tech polycarbonate plastics and raw materials for coatings
and adhesives. These products are supplied to key industry sectors such as automotive, construction
and electronics. Our innovations extend not only to products, but also to the production processes,
which we design to be as environmentally friendly and efficient as possible, always observing the highest levels of safety and reliability at our plants. Our activities are based on a comprehensive approach to
sustainability: we aim to burden the environment as little as possible, benefit society and create value.
Against this background, the strategy of MaterialScience is aimed at ensuring long-term, profitable
growth. We aim to sustainably earn a return that exceeds our capital costs and thus helps to increase
the company’s value. We intend to safeguard or expand our leading competitive positions in world
markets in a challenging environment. This applies to the established core markets of Europe and the
United States, as well as to emerging countries such as China. Our investment policy there is aligned to
the needs of the market.
In the Polyurethanes (pur) business unit, we intend to safeguard our strong position on the world
market as an integrated raw material and systems supplier, mainly for rigid and flexible foams. Demand
for these products is expected to rise further. Flexible foam ensures added comfort in everyday life
through its use in products such as mattresses and upholstery. Rigid foam serves above all as an insulating material for buildings and refrigerated appliances, and thus helps to lower energy consumption and
greenhouse gas emissions. In the manufacture of polyurethane components, we are focused on achieving further improvements in the efficiency of our facilities through new process technologies. At the site
in Dormagen, Germany, for example, a large-scale, state-of-the-art facility was commissioned at the end
of 2014 for toluene diisocyanate (tdi), a key precursor for flexible foams. In the future we plan to produce the second polyurethane component, polyol, with the help of carbon dioxide, initially in limited
quantities. It is planned to build a production line for this purpose in Dormagen. co2 can partly replace
the traditional raw material, oil, as the carbon base. In the rigid foam business, we further increased
capacities for the precursor mdi (diphenylmethane diisocyanate) at the Shanghai, China, site in 2014 in
view of the demand situation in Asia.

4. Economic Environments of the Subgroups

The global polycarbonate market is focused on Asia. In this region, the Polycarbonates (pcs) business
unit operates several large-scale facilities for this high-tech plastic, which boasts numerous favorable
properties such as low weight, stability, durability and relatively high design freedom. We plan to gradually raise production capacity in Shanghai to safeguard our position in the world market. We also intend to further improve the efficiency of our plants worldwide. It is planned to more closely align the
product portfolio to applications that make particularly high demands on the material – so that customers in the automotive, consumer electronics and other industries can derive maximum benefit from the
respective products.
The Coatings, Adhesives, Specialties business unit (cas) develops and manufactures polyurethanebased raw materials, mainly for coatings and adhesives. The main areas of application include transportation and traffic, infrastructure and construction, and wood and furniture. Our aim is to maintain our
leading position in our core business. The focus here continues to be on market- and customer-centric
solutions for coating and adhesive applications that offer protection, attractive design and high functionality in numerous areas. As one of the leading suppliers, we also offer a broad range of waterborne
polyurethane dispersions. We see these products as innovative system solutions and plan to replace
solvent-based coatings by waterborne solutions. In addition to our core business, we are working in
further growth areas such as cosmetics, medicine and textiles.
The Industrial Operations unit (io) supports the business units. It is responsible for ensuring a dependable supply of raw materials and services, developing modern production technologies to enable
the efficient use of resources, and for the safety and reliability of operations. It also manufactures and
markets basic chemicals such as chlorine, sodium hydroxide solution and hydrochloric acid.

4. Economic Environments of the Subgroups

HEALTHCARE
The pharmaceuticals market saw significantly higher growth in 2014 than in the previous year. In the
United States in particular, there was a marked increase in sales of pharmaceuticals, mainly as a result
of new product introductions and a smaller impact from patent expirations. Despite a persistently restrictive health policy environment, growth was stronger in a number of European countries due to the
launch of new products. Pharmaceuticals growth in the emerging markets was comparable with the
prior year.
Following the high growth in the previous year due to the strong cold season, the consumer care
market resumed a normal growth rate in 2014, which was thus slightly below the 2013 rate. The
shrinkage in the medical care market was due to the weakening of the diabetes care market, while the
market for contrast agents and medical equipment (Radiology business unit) nearly reached the previous year’s level. Growth in the animal health market in 2014 picked up in the second half of the year
and showed an increase for the year as a whole.
CROPSCIENCE
The global seed and crop protection market continued to show dynamic development in 2014. There
was a further tangible increase in the demand for high-value seeds. The global crop protection market
also expanded, albeit at a slower rate than in the prior year.
Growth in the global seed and crop protection market last year was again driven by Latin America,
particularly Brazil and Argentina. The European market also showed strong growth in 2014 thanks to
generally favorable weather conditions. While growth rates were moderate in the Mediterranean region,
they were above average in Eastern Europe despite the Ukraine conflict. In Asia / Pacific, too, the generally positive market trend persisted in 2014, with the Chinese and Indian crop protection markets showing the strongest momentum. Growth rates in North America, however, were below the average for the
global market. This was mainly the result of a late start to the season in the corn- and soybean-growing
areas caused by adverse weather conditions.
MATERIALSCIENCE
Global development of the principal customer industries for MaterialScience (automotive, construction, electrical / electronics and furniture) in 2014 was slower than expected overall. This was partly due
to the continued weakening of the business environment in the eurozone. The slower growth in China
and some other emerging economies was offset by stronger-than-expected growth in North America.
The global automotive industry recorded moderate, albeit slightly slower, growth overall in 2014 than
in the previous year. Strong demand across all vehicle segments led to robust growth in North America
and Asia. Development in Western Europe was likewise positive, bolstered by a number of government
incentive programs and continued strong demand for premium class vehicles. By contrast, Latin America, particularly Brazil and Argentina, posted considerable declines. In addition, 2014 was marked by
numerous vehicle recalls affecting all the main automakers in all geographies.
Growth in the global construction industry improved year on year. The development was characterized
by a sustained recovery in both Western and Eastern Europe, continuing positive development in the
United States and a stabilizing trend in Latin America. Growth in Asia was steady overall with a slight
weakening in China, the region’s most important market.
The global electrical and electronics industry posted robust growth once again in 2014. While the high
growth rates experienced in past years continued in Asia, driven mainly by China, growth in Europe and
North America was slower than in 2013.

5. Research, Development, Innovation

Growth of the global furniture industry improved in 2014 compared with the previous year, with the
industry benefiting from the progressive market recovery in North America and Europe. Growth in Latin
America, however, slowed. Market development in Asia was satisfactory, driven by exports. Domestic
demand in this region, however, increased only slightly.

5. Research, Development, Innovation
Innovation and the skills of our employees form the basis for our success as a company. We drive
innovation by continuously developing new molecules, technologies and business models in our research centers, investing in research and development projects, supporting the development of our
employees and expanding our activities through acquisitions or collaborations with external partners.
Strengthening our innovative capability enables us to address the challenges of our time and achieve
profitable corporate growth.
In 2014 we raised our research and development spend by 5.3% (Fx adj.) to €3,574 million. Adjusted
for special items of €2 million (2013: €212 million), this represented a 12.2% increase (Fx adj.). The
ratio of research and development expenses to sales before special items was 8.5%. Approximately
14,000 employees worldwide work in this field.

As well as investing in research and development, Bayer promotes an innovation culture based on
openness to new approaches and internal interdisciplinary cooperation. We are building a national and
international network of outstanding scientists to further increase our expertise and extending this
network through collaborations with external partners.
online-annex: 3-5-1
We offer our leading r&d experts special opportunities for professional advancement through the
Expert Career initiative. In addition, the approximately 120-member Expert Club – headed by the
member of the Board of Management responsible for Innovation – promotes dialogue between scientific experts from different subgroups.
We also ensure that special contributions by individuals or employee groups are announced and
honored. For example, we bestow research awards such as the Otto Bayer Medals, which are presented every two years to teams of scientists for outstanding achievements.

5. Research, Development, Innovation

Scientists from our company are involved in constant dialogue with renowned research institutes,
support partnership projects in the public and private sectors (e.g. in rice growing with the International Rice Research Institute), hold professorships at universities worldwide (e.g. in Germany and
China) and regularly invite scientists, university students and schoolchildren to attend various events
such as symposiums on health topics or research days for school students. We also view this commitment as an investment in the future, because as a research-based company, we rely heavily on the
availability of talented and highly trained people and on society’s acceptance of technology.
Our global internet platform WeSolve promotes joint problem-solving by employees from all subgroups and service companies. Topical issues in research and development, marketing or production
are announced via the WeSolve platform and jointly discussed to identify the best solution approaches. Employees use the Bayer Group’s suggestion system, known as the Bayer Ideas Pool, mainly to
propose improvements to methods or processes. In 2014 the employees once again displayed their
commitment to the company by submitting some 4,850 valuable suggestions to the Bayer Ideas Pool.
Of the suggestions for which processing was completed in 2014, 49% were put into practice, resulting in calculable savings of more than €5.1 million in the first year of their implementation. In 2014
we paid out a total of over €1 million in special employee bonuses for the suggestions implemented.
Our collaborations and alliances with leading universities, public research institutes and partner companies are supplemented by incubators, crowdsourcing and science hubs in Asia and the United States
to tap into external innovative potential using the open innovation approach. Some of our collaborations
are supported by public funding.
online-annex: 3-5-2
In Germany alone, Bayer participated in more than 80 publicly funded projects in 2014, receiving a
total of about €8 million in grants. This is equivalent to roughly 0.3% of our annual r&d expenses.
Reliable, global protection of intellectual property rights is essential for an innovation company like
Bayer. The Bayer Group endeavors to obtain patent protection for its products and technologies in the
major markets. The degree of protection a patent provides varies from one country to another and depends on the type and scope of the patent claim and the options available for enforcing our rights. At
the end of 2014, we owned approximately 68,200 valid patent applications and patents worldwide relating to some 8,300 protected inventions.

www.annualreport
2014.bayer.com/
political-position-ip

online annex: 3-5-3
Patent terms vary according to the laws of the country granting the patent. In view of the high investment required for product research and development, the European Union countries, the United
States, Japan and some other countries extend patent terms or issue supplementary protection certificates to compensate for the shortening of the effective patent protection period due to regulatory
approval processes for new drugs. We endeavor to obtain such extensions wherever possible.
The term of a patent is normally 20 years. Since it takes an average of 12 years to develop a new
medicine, for example, only eight years of patent protection generally remain following the product’s
approval. In most cases it would be impossible to cover the substantial costs incurred in the research
and development of innovative medicines or of new indications or dosage forms for existing drugs
without patent protection. We are therefore committed to protecting both the international patent
system and our own intellectual property worldwide. Further details are given in the political positions posted on our website.

STRENGTHENING RESEARCH IN THE LIFE SCIENCES
Bayer is the only global company simultaneously researching improvements in human, animal and plant
health. Systematic and intensive collaboration among researchers from both Life Science subgroups is
providing new impetus. Researchers from HealthCare and CropScience are collaborating on projects
involving central biological processes such as gene regulation or energy metabolism. Such projects are
aimed at developing a better understanding of diseases, deciphering mechanisms of action, personalizing therapies or explaining resistance mechanisms. The joint use of technology platforms is being expanded. These projects have been supported since 2012 by Bayer’s internal Life Sciences Fund and are
mostly implemented in collaboration with external partners.
HEALTHCARE
Research and development expenses at HealthCare rose by 3.6% (Fx adj.) in 2014 to €2,301 million.
Adjusted for special items of €4 million (2013: €190 million), this represented a 13.0% increase (Fx adj.)
and was equivalent to 11.5% of HealthCare sales. At the end of the reporting period there were 8,100
employees working in research and development at HealthCare.
PHARMACEUTICALS
Research areas and sites
Drug discovery in the Pharmaceuticals segment focuses on the areas of cardiology, oncology, ophthalmology, hematology and gynecology. We conduct research activities at six centers. Work in Berlin and
Wuppertal, Germany, focuses on the discovery, optimization and development of new active substances.
Research is also carried out at these sites in the fields of drug metabolism, pharmacokinetics, toxicology
and clinical pharmacology. On the other hand, our u.s. research and development activities in the
Mission Bay district of San Francisco and in Berkeley, California, are focused on hematology. In Turku,
Finland, polymer-based release systems are being developed for fertility control. At our site in Oslo,
Norway, we are carrying out research on Thorium Conjugate for use in cancer. We also operate innovation centers in Beijing, China; Singapore; and Osaka, Japan, which focus on coordinating our research
partnerships in Asia.
Research activities in 2014
We conducted clinical trials with several drug candidates from our research and development pipeline
during 2014 to drive the development of new substances for treating diseases with a high unmet medical need. At the focus of our clinical development are five active substance candidates currently in
Phase ii trials. These are finerenone, vericiguat and molidustat in the cardiology and cardiorenal syndrome areas, copanlisib in oncology and vilaprisan in gynecology. We strengthen our already approved
products, such as the anticoagulant Xarelto™ (rivaroxaban), the cancer drugs Stivarga™ (regorafenib)
and Xofigo™ (radium-223 dichloride), the eye medicine Eylea™ (aflibercept) and Adempas™ (riociguat)
for treatment of pulmonary hypertension, through life cycle management activities in order to further
enhance their use and / or expand their spectrum of indications.
Some of our development candidates are being investigated for the treatment of illnesses that are
serious but at the same time very rare – also known as orphan diseases. For example, ciprofloxacin dpi
(dry powder for inhalation) for therapy of non-cystic-fibrosis bronchiectasis (ncfb) was classified by the
regulatory authorities as an orphan drug.

Clinical trials account for a major portion of the development process for medicines. They are an essential tool for determining the safety and efficacy of new developmental products before they can be used
to treat diseases. The benefits and potential risks of new medicines must always be scientifically proven
and well documented. All studies at Bayer satisfy strict international guidelines and quality standards,
as well as applicable national laws and standards.
online annex: 3-5-bhc-1
Bayer implements the internal processes for the planning and implementation of clinical trials using
a globally uniform procedure. The company sets high standards in clinical trial design and ensures a
high level of transparency.
Consistent with these objectives, HealthCare’s “Trial Finder” database contains publicly accessible
information on clinical trials sponsored by Bayer. This information is made available to patients,
health care professionals and the general public in order to increase the transparency of our clinical
research.
In May 2014, Bayer joined the portal www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com. Upon request, Bayer now
grants researchers access to anonymized data at the patient level for clinical trials sponsored by
Bayer. In this way we are assisting the progress of medical science and helping to improve patient
care.
Further information on our globally uniform standards, the monitoring of studies and the role of the
ethics committee can be found on the internet.

in the prevention of atherothrombotic events secondary to acute coronary syndrome (acs). A new
Phase ii study will now investigate rivaroxaban in combination with a single platelet aggregation inhibitor for long-term prevention in patients with acs. Xarelto™ is marketed in the United States by Janssen
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson.
In May 2014, we submitted rivaroxaban to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (mhlw)
for marketing authorization to treat patients with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and
for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism.
Beyond the already approved indications, rivaroxaban is also being investigated in other cardiovascular
disorders. Ongoing Phase iii clinical trials include compass and commander-hf. The aim of the
compass study is to investigate the potential of rivaroxaban in the prevention of major adverse cardiac
events. The commander-hf study is evaluating the potential additional benefit of rivaroxaban in combination with standard therapy in the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with chronic heart
failure and significant coronary heart disease.
In 2014, the study program for rivaroxaban was expanded to include new trials: the einstein choice
trial is evaluating two different doses of rivaroxaban for the long-term, secondary prevention of deep
vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The mariner trial is evaluating the efficacy and safety of
rivaroxaban to reduce the risk of post-hospital-discharge symptomatic venous thromboembolism (vte)
in patients who were hospitalized for acute medical illness. The esus navigate study is investigating the
efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in patients following embolic stroke of undetermined source. A further Phase iii study (voyager pad) to investigate the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in patients with
peripheral artery disease (pad) following surgery is in preparation.
Rivaroxaban was invented by HealthCare and is being jointly developed with Janssen Research & Development, llc, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson.
Adempas™ (active ingredient: riociguat) is the first member of a new class of vasodilating agents known
as soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) modulators. Administered in tablet form, riociguat is currently being
investigated as a new, specific approach for the treatment of various forms of pulmonary hypertension.
Adempas™ was approved in the United States in 2013 for the treatment of inoperable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (cteph) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah). In March 2014,
Adempas™ was also approved by the European Commission in both indications. In Japan, the drug was
approved for cteph in January 2014 and was submitted for approval to treat pah in April 2014.
In 2014 the study program for riociguat was expanded to include new trials: a Phase iiib pilot study was
launched in March 2014 to evaluate the effect of riociguat in patients with pah who demonstrated an
insufficient response to treatment with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (pde-5i) either as a monotherapy
or in combination with an endothelin receptor antagonist (era). In June 2014, we commenced the
Phase iib study rise-iip to investigate the safety and efficacy of riociguat in patients with symptomatic
pulmonary hypertension associated with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (iip). Outside of the pulmonary hypertension indication, riociguat is also in Phase ii testing for the treatment of patients with diffuse systemic sclerosis.

pathways that are responsible for tumor growth.
Stivarga™ is approved in the United States, Europe, Japan and several other countries for the treatment
of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). In 2013, Stivarga™ was also approved in the United States, Japan and other countries for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (gist). In July
2014, the European Commission granted approval for the treatment of gist.
In February 2014, we initiated a Phase iii trial investigating the effect of regorafenib as an adjuvant
treatment option for colorectal cancer patients following resection of liver metastases with curative
intent and completion of all planned chemotherapy.
Stivarga™ was developed by Bayer. In 2011, Bayer and Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a subsidiary of
Amgen Inc., United States, agreed that Onyx would receive royalties on global sales of Stivarga™ in the
area of cancer treatment.
Xofigo™ (active ingredient: radium-223 dichloride) is approved in the e.u. and the United States for the
treatment of adult patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (crpc) with symptomatic bone metastases but no known visceral metastases.
In April 2014, a new Phase iii trial began that is evaluating radium-223 dichloride in combination with
abiraterone acetate and prednisone / prednisolone for the treatment of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with bone-predominant metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have not
received chemotherapy.
We are jointly developing and commercializing our cancer drug Nexavar™ (active ingredient: sorafenib)
with Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., United States. The active ingredient sorafenib, which targets both
cancer cells and the vascular system of the tumor, is registered in more than 100 countries for the
treatment of liver cancer and advanced kidney cancer. In May 2014, Nexavar™ was approved by the
European Commission for the treatment of patients with progressive, locally advanced or metastatic,
differentiated thyroid carcinoma refractory to radioactive iodine. In June 2014, the Japanese mhlw
approved sorafenib for the treatment of patients with unresectable differentiated thyroid carcinoma.
Two clinical Phase iii trials with sorafenib failed to meet their respective primary endpoints in March
and July 2014. The trials investigated sorafenib as an adjuvant treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma
and as a combination therapy for breast cancer.
Copanlisib is a novel, intravenous phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) inhibitor currently in Phase ii

Ophthalmology
Eylea™ (active ingredient: aflibercept) is our joint developmental project with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., United States. Aflibercept blocks the natural growth factor vegf (vascular endothelial growth
factor), thus preventing the abnormal formation of new blood vessels that tend to leak blood. The medication is administered directly into the eye. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. holds exclusive rights to
the product in the United States, while in other countries it is marketed by Bayer.
Eylea™ is approved in more than 80 countries for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (amd). In 2013, Eylea™ was also approved in Europe, Japan, the United States and further countries
for the treatment of visual impairment due to macular edema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion
(crvo). In August 2014, the European Commission approved Eylea™ in the treatment of diabetic macular edema (dme). The Japanese mhlw approved Eylea™ in this indication in November 2014. We also
submitted the first applications – to the European Medicines Agency (ema) in June 2014 and to the
Japanese mhlw in September 2014 – for marketing authorization of aflibercept in the treatment of patients with visual impairment due to macular edema secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion (brvo).
In September 2014, the mhlw approved Eylea™ for the treatment of myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV). Pathologic myopia and the associated myopic CNV is the second most common cause of
blindness in Japan.
Hematology
In May 2014, the recombinant Factor viii Kogenate fs (octocog alfa) was approved in the United
States for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adults with
hemophilia a.
In December 2014 we submitted applications for marketing authorization to the European Medicines
Agency (ema) and the u.s. fda for bay 81-8973 for the treatment of hemophilia a in adults and children.
bay 81-8973 is a full-length recombinant factor viii (rFVIII) which has demonstrated clinical evidence of
efficacy when used for prophylaxis twice or three times per week, with standard dosages.
In February 2014, a Phase iii study with damoctocog alfa pegol (Bay 94-9027), a long-acting recombinant Factor viii, reached its primary objective of ensuring effective protection against bleeding caused
by hemophilia a with fewer infusions.
We consider that gene therapy holds potential to offer new long-term treatment options for hemophilia
a. Gene therapy could transform the treatment of hemophilia by inserting a correct version of the faulty
gene responsible for the disease. We are currently working with our partner Dimension Therapeutics on
a treatment option of this kind.
Gynecology
Vilaprisan (sprm) is a novel oral progesterone receptor modulator that is currently being investigated in
a Phase ii trial for the treatment of uterine fibroids.
In February 2014, we successfully concluded the registration procedure in the European Union for a
new transparent low-dose contraceptive patch (fc-Patch Low).

In June 2014, we entered into an agreement with Dimension Therapeutics concerning the joint development and commercialization of a novel gene therapy for the treatment of hemophilia a.
In July 2014, we entered into a strategic research alliance with the University of Oxford, u.k., in the area
of novel gynecological therapies. The collaboration focuses on innovative treatment options for women
with endometriosis and uterine fibroids.
In October 2014, we began our strategic pharmaceutical collaboration with Merck & Co., Inc. in the area
of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) modulation. This collaboration includes Adempas™ (riociguat), which
was developed by Bayer and is already approved for the treatment of certain forms of pulmonary hypertension, and its development for additional indications. The development candidate vericiguat also
forms part of the collaboration.
In the area of oncology, we began collaborating in 2014 with the md Anderson Cancer Center, United
States, for early clinical development.
In April 2014, we announced our participation in the “High-Tech Gründerfonds ii,” in which we are the
first investor from the pharmaceutical industry. This fund supports and finances promising start-ups in
the life sciences and other areas in Germany. In November 2014, we also announced that we will participate as a strategic investor in the newly established “Versant Venture Capital V” fund. In this way we
aim to support the development of new therapies in areas with a high unmet medical need.
Since 2009 we have been operating an internet platform called “Grants4Targets,” through which
researchers at universities, other research institutions or start-up companies can propose biological
targets for a collaboration with Bayer. In 2013 we added two more platforms: “Grants4Leads” for proposals concerning biologically active molecules as leads, and “Grants4Apps” for proposals regarding
it solutions with potentially multiple applications in the health care field. In August 2014 a further initiative was launched: the “Grants4Apps Accelerator Program.” Five start-ups with innovative health care
and therapy-relevant solution approaches are each receiving a start-up package under this program.
Since 2012, we have run the CoLaborator™, a center in the Mission Bay district of San Francisco with
laboratory facilities for bioscience startup companies. With this incubator concept, the scientists benefit
both from the laboratory infrastructure and from the expertise of the Bayer researchers, which can
facilitate the professional, goal-oriented design of development programs, for example. At the same
time, we aim to be the first contact point for young companies in their search for possible cooperation
partners. We opened a second CoLaborator™ at the Berlin site in May 2014.
CROPSCIENCE
Research and development expenses at CropScience rose by 13.6% (Fx adj.) in 2014 to €974 million.
Adjusted for special items of €0 million (2013: €3 million), this represented an increase of 14.0% (Fx adj.)
and was equivalent to 10.3% of CropScience sales.
CropScience maintains a global network of research and development facilities employing some 5,000
people. Our largest r&d sites for chemical and biological crop protection products are located in Monheim and Frankfurt am Main, Germany; Lyon, France; and Sacramento, California, United States. The
major research centers of the Seeds unit, which focuses on improving seed through seed technology
and breeding, are located in Ghent, Belgium; Haelen, Netherlands; and Lubbock, Texas and Morrisville /
Raleigh, North Carolina, United States. While research is carried out centrally at a small number of
sites, our development and plant breeding activities take place both at these sites and at numerous field
testing stations across the globe. This ensures that future active substances and crop varieties can be
tested according to specific regional and local requirements.

In Crop Protection / Seeds, our scientists working in the areas of seed technology, agricultural chemistry and biologics are closely collaborating as part of our integrated research approach. This bundles the
technical expertise acquired in chemical and biological research and field development, aligning it to
our long-term research objectives and business strategies for the various crops.
In the Crop Protection unit, we identify and develop innovative, safe products for use as insecticides,
fungicides, herbicides or seed treatments in sustainable agriculture. In the fields of chemistry, biology
and biochemistry, modern technologies such as high-throughput screening and bioinformatics play an
important role in identifying new chemical lead structures.
In addition, we are steadily broadening the range of uses for our active ingredients by developing
new mixtures or innovative formulations so that they can be applied in additional crops or in different
regions or be made easier to handle. Successful collaborations with external partners complement our
own activities.
In March 2014, CropScience signed an agreement to acquire Biagro Group, a producer and distributor
of biological seed treatment solutions based in Argentina. Its portfolio of established brands includes
biological seed treatment products, plant-growth-promoting microorganisms and other products for
integrated pest management based on bacterial and fungal strains.
Also in March 2014, CropScience announced plans to significantly expand its research site in Wismar,
Germany, in order to serve the growing global demand for biological crop protection solutions. The
planned investment includes the construction of a new manufacturing facility for biological crop protection products along with the necessary infrastructure. The production capacities will be expanded in
stages, and work should be completed by 2016 at the latest. The planned total investment amounts to
approximately €18 million.
In May 2014, CropScience’s rice herbicide Council™ Complete received regulatory approval in South
Korea – its first registration worldwide. The market launch in South Korea is scheduled for 2015, with
other major rice-growing countries in Asia to follow. Council™ Complete is based on two innovative
active ingredients, triafamone and tefuryltrione, which considerably improve integrated weed control.
In 2014 Bayer CropScience also launched a new nematicide based on the active ingredient fluopyram
and marketed under the brand names Velum™ and Verango™. In field trials, these products have shown
a significant increase in yield and quality in a broad spectrum of crops such as fruit, vegetables and
tobacco. We plan to launch several more new products based on chemical and biological crop protection mechanisms in the coming years. For example, in 2015 we expect to launch a further insecticide
under the Sivanto™ brand, a new insecticide class for the control of sucking insects.
In September 2014, we combined our u.s. research and development activities in vegetable seeds and
biological crop protection products at a new, integrated site in West Sacramento, California. Our goal is
to better exploit the potential of our global research and development capacities by merging and expanding activities.
Research in our Seeds unit is devoted to optimizing plant traits. We are developing new varieties in our
existing core crops – cotton, oilseed rape / canola, rice and vegetables. We have now expanded our
research activities to include two new core crops – wheat and soybeans. Our work focuses on improving
the agronomic traits of these crops. Our researchers are working to increase the quality and yield potential of crop plants – for example, by improving the profile of rapeseed (canola) oil or enhancing the
properties of cotton fibers. We are also targeting the development of plants that have high tolerance to
external stress factors, such as drought, and can more efficiently utilize water. Further areas of focus
include developing new herbicide tolerance technologies based on alternative modes of action, and
improving insect resistance and disease tolerance. To do this we employ modern breeding techniques
ranging from marker-assisted breeding to plant biotechnology methods.

In January 2014, CropScience signed two new agreements with Cellectis Plant Sciences, United States.
The extended partnership aims to develop plant traits specifically for canola seed using new breeding
methods. The collaboration also gives Bayer access to technologies that enable the direct engineering
of plant genomes in order to develop improved crop varieties.
We aim to jointly develop advanced hybrid rice varieties with Kaiima Bio-Agritech Ltd., Israel. The goal
of the multi-year collaboration is to breed new high-yielding hybrid rice varieties.
In June 2014, the first global soybean brand from CropScience – Credenz™ – was launched in the United
States. Under this brand, the company intends to offer soybean growers innovative varieties and traits.
hbk™ Seed, the brand of Hornbeck Seed Company, United States, which CropScience acquired in 2011,
will also be sold under the Credenz™ name.
At the end of September 2014, we acquired the seeds business of Granar s.a., headquartered in
Encarnación, Paraguay, a company specializing in the breeding, production and marketing of improved
seed, especially soybean seed. Granar has a strong presence in Paraguay and Uruguay, and an increasing presence in Brazil. At the focus of the acquisition is Granar’s Igra™ Semillas brand. Granar retained
responsibility for marketing Igra™ seed until the end of 2014. For CropScience, this acquisition represents one more step towards achieving an international platform of excellence in soybean seed. It also
underscores the importance of the Latin American region for the soybean seed business.
Our proprietary glyphosate herbicide tolerance technology GlyTol™ has been available in FiberMax™
cotton seed varieties in the United States for several years. In 2014 we launched a new combination of
insect resistance and herbicide tolerance for cotton that for the first time contains both TwinLink™ and
GlyTol™ technology, offering farmers integrated pest and weed control.
In the 2014 planting season, CropScience began marketing a new canola variety in Canada under the
InVigor™ brand. The hybrid variety features a new trait that prevents the pods from opening prematurely, thus enabling higher yields.
In the coming years we plan to market numerous new hybrid rice and canola varieties with improved
stress and insect resistance under the Arize™ and InVigor™ trademarks.
We plan to launch the first CropScience wheat seed in 2015. In September 2014, CropScience announced plans to invest a total of €1.5 billion in the research and development of wheat seed and crop
protection products for wheat between 2010 and 2020.
With many crops, such as vegetables, major success can be achieved using conventional plant breeding
methods. As vegetables are mostly intended to be marketed and eaten fresh, merchants and consumers
have particularly strict requirements regarding their appearance, nutrient content, taste and shelf life.
We are launching a succession of new vegetable seed varieties that satisfy these requirements.

See Chapter 1.3
for Group targets

Our integrated product pipeline for crop protection and seed technology contains a total of 25 individual
projects, along with numerous new seed varieties and improved products that have estimated launch
dates between 2011 and 2016. We believe these products have a combined peak sales potential of more
than €4 billion. In Crop Protection, we plan to have launched around 10 products by the end of this
period. In our Seeds business, we plan to bring some 15 projects to market for the broad-acre crops of
cotton, oilseed rape / canola, rice, wheat and soybeans, along with several hundred new vegetable varieties, over the same period.
In Environmental Science, we evolve chemically and biologically based solutions for consumers and
professional users by tailoring substances from our Crop Protection unit or external partners for use in
non-agricultural scenarios. Current development projects include insect gels and baits, herbicides,
fungicides and products for the control of disease-transmitting insects.
In 2014 Environmental Science expanded its portfolio in all business segments. We strengthened our
range of turf care products for golf courses with the introduction of the new fungicide Mirage™ in the
United States and the new herbicide Tribute™ in South Korea. In the area of professional pest control,
we launched new formulations of the insecticides Maxforce™ (Maxforce™ Fusion, Maxforce™ Prime) in
Europe. The herbicide Esplanade™ (active ingredient: indaziflam), which is already used very successfully in the u.s. industrial vegetation management sector, became available to customers in Canada in
2014. We launched a number of new insecticides for private customers in Europe. In addition, we
expanded the Natria™ range of biological solutions in the United States.
In October 2014, CropScience announced plans to purchase certain assets of DuPont Crop Protection’s
land management business in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand. The transaction was closed at the beginning of December 2014 after it received regulatory approvals. This acquisition will enable Environmental Science to offer a comprehensive portfolio of effective weed control products for industrial vegetation management. In addition, the company will gain access to the growing
forestry and range and pasture business segments in North America. DuPont will continue to sell its land
management products outside the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand.
OPEN INNOVATION
CropScience is part of a global network of research and industry partners from diverse segments of the
agriculture industry, chemical and biological research, and the food industry. These cross-industry
partnerships enable us to better understand and do justice to the needs of our customers over the long
term. An example is the partnership between CropScience and the u.k.-based Innovative Vector Control
Consortium (ivcc). We are cooperating with ivcc to develop new substances for use against mosquitoes
that transmit diseases such as malaria and dengue fever.
Bayer has played an active role for over 50 years in the fight against malaria, which remains among
the most dangerous tropical diseases. The product portfolio of CropScience enables it to offer a unique
range of solutions. For example, CropScience – through its Environmental Science operating segment
– is a leading producer of indoor spray insecticides to control malaria mosquitoes. Over the past three
years, Ficam™ has played a particularly important role in controlling mosquitoes resistant to pyrethroids. In 2014, CropScience once again made an important contribution to malaria protection by
supplying Ficam™ in Ethiopia. After the who had already recommended our new, long-acting and thus
more cost-effective deltamethrin-based spray insecticide K-Othrine PolyZone™ in 2013, national registration applications were submitted in 2014 in several countries of sub-Saharan Africa.

In April 2014, CropScience and Targenomix GmbH, Potsdam, Germany, entered into a five-year
research collaboration to jointly develop and apply systems biology approaches to gain a better understanding of genetic and metabolic process regulation in plants. The aim is to use novel active substances and plant traits to develop innovative crop protection and plant health solutions.
CropScience also continued its wheat research collaboration with the Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organisation (csiro) in Australia. This strategic collaboration, which began in 2009,
is aimed at raising wheat yields and thus boosting global wheat production in the long term.
Special mention should be made of our food chain partnerships, in which CropScience supports all the
players in the food chain – from farmers and food processors to importers, exporters, wholesalers and
retailers. CropScience has now been working in food chain partnerships for 10 years, helping to improve the quality of crops and raise yields. It has initiated such projects for over 40 crops in more than
30 countries, mainly in Asia, Latin America and Europe. Our experts advise farmers on sustainable
growing methods – from seed selection and the controlled, eco-friendly use of crop protection products
to the transparent monitoring of production.
We also worked with certifier global g.a.p. to lay the foundation for training designed to help small
farmers understand and meet the requirements of good agricultural practice using CropScience’s training programs. It is planned to introduce “BayGAP foundational training” throughout the world in 2015,
enabling small farmers to supply local customers according to their needs.

Our activities in the Polyurethanes (pur) business unit include work on products and material solutions
to drive forward the use of environmentally friendly wind energy. The most recent developments include
polyurethane infusion resins used in the interior of wind turbine rotor blades to bond fiber layers to a
stable core. The resin is better distributed and cures more quickly than conventional infusion material,
thus significantly reducing production times and saving costs. The material can also be used without
difficulty for very long rotor blades capable of generating larger quantities of electricity.
In the area of process development, we are progressing with the use of carbon dioxide as a new source
of carbon for polyurethanes in order to reduce dependence on petrochemical raw materials. In 2014, for
example, we began transitioning an existing research project (“Dream Production”) to commercial use.
The goal is to begin marketing an innovative form of the polyol component of polyurethane with a co2
content of around 20% in 2016. At the laboratory level, we also succeeded in producing another polyol
type through direct and indirect integration of co2 using 40% alternative raw materials – a further contribution to resource efficiency.
Our activities in the Polycarbonates (pcs) business unit are mainly geared to the development of products for the automotive and electrical / electronics industries as well as the it sector. The focus here is on
reducing weight, improving energy efficiency and safety, and enabling greater design freedom.
In the automotive industry, our focus is partly on exterior applications. Not only add-on components
such as spoilers, but also glazing and entire panorama roofs and their frames are increasingly being
manufactured from polycarbonate or polycarbonate blends that weigh up to 50% less than equivalent
glass or steel components. This supports the industry’s efforts to produce cars that are as light as possible and therefore more fuel-efficient. We are working to further improve the properties of these products and the respective manufacturing processes.
Light-emitting diodes also contribute to sustainability in vehicles and in other applications, as they
require significantly less energy and last longer than traditional light sources. We have developed special materials for channeling, scattering and reflecting led light that feature high transparency, design
freedom and heat resistance. Special materials can also be used in the production of thermally conductive parts, helping to make led light sources last longer.
We are also working on the evolution of polycarbonate-based composite materials that address the
needs of the automotive, consumer electronics and other industries. In this area we are developing
especially lightweight, continuous-fiber-reinforced materials that can be used in the future in applications such as chassis and structural components, or as housing materials for ultra-mobile laptops, tablet
computers and smartphones.
In the Coatings, Adhesives, Specialties (cas) business unit, we are driving the development of raw
materials for high-performance polyurethane coatings, colorants, adhesives and sealants. Among our
fields of research and development are coatings for textiles and synthetic leather. For these coatings we
have developed a new generation of purely waterborne polyurethane dispersions. This technology,
which was launched in mid-2014 under the name Insqin™, enables all types of coated textiles and synthetic leather to be manufactured without using solvents.
Our development activities as a whole are focused on eco-friendly products that spare resources and
can be more efficiently applied. The use of renewable raw materials is also playing an increasingly
important role.

OPEN INNOVATION
In line with the open innovation approach, MaterialScience collaborates with external scientific institutions and with start-up companies and academic spin-offs. These collaborations are mainly based in
Europe, the United States, China or Japan.
Our partners in Germany include rwth Aachen University, Germany, with which we jointly operate the
cat Catalytic Center. In China we maintain a close alliance with Tongji University in particular, while in
the United States we support research activities at renowned universities.
In the scientific field, we take either a leading or an advisory role in numerous publicly funded projects.
We also participate in industry associations and other organizations such as the German Chemical
Society (GDCh), the dechema Society for Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology in Germany and the
American Chemical Society. Our innovation capability is also spurred by collaborations with customers
or other industry sectors, an example being the “future_bizz” corporate network.
BAYER TECHNOLOGY SERVICES
Bayer Technology Services is a major driver of innovation for the subgroups in the areas of technology
development, engineering and production. All Bayer subgroups work closely with this service company
worldwide on technology solutions, particularly in the fields of process technology, engineering, and
the safe and efficient operation of production facilities.
online annex: 3-5-4
Together with the subgroups, Technology Services is developing process technology, biotechnology
and systems biology platforms to support the research, development and production of new products
and applications – with a deliberate focus on open innovation. Development activities at the invite
research center, a collaborative venture with Dortmund Technical University, include work on new
flexible, modular production concepts. At the Joint Research Center on Computational Biomedicine,
a collaboration with rwth Aachen, computer-based models and methods for investigating key biological mechanisms are researched and developed for clinical use together with Aachen University
Hospital.

6. Sustainability Management and Governance
To us, sustainability basically means future viability and, as part of corporate strategy, is integrated into
everyday procedures. We underline our mission as a sustainably operating company through our commitment to the u.n. Global Compact with its internationally recognized 10 principles and to the Responsible Care™ initiative, and through our active global involvement in leading (industry) forums such as
the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (wbcsd).
Responsibility for steering and aligning our Group-wide sustainability strategy lies with the Group
Management Board member responsible for Human Resources, Technology and Sustainability in his
function as Chief Sustainability Officer, and with the Sustainable Development (sd) Committee chaired
by the Group Head of Environment & Sustainability.

World Business Council for Sustainable Development

The sd Committee, on which all subgroups are represented, sets targets, draws up initiatives, management systems and Group regulations, and is responsible for monitoring these aspects. In order to operationalize the Group strategy and make it measurable, we have set ambitious non-financial targets and
indicators all along the value-added chain. Further information about our target program can be found
in Chapter 1.3 “Targets and Performance Indicators.” Internal Group regulations ensure the implementation of our sustainability principles in business operations. These principles are realized through
corresponding management systems, regulations and processes at the subgroup level.
online annex: 3-6-2
These Group regulations include the “Sustainable Development Policy,” our “Human Rights Position,” the “Corporate Compliance Policy,” our “Supplier Code of Conduct,” the “Responsible Marketing & Sales Policy,” our “Directive on Process and Plant Safety,” and positions, for example, on the
key issues of climate, water and biodiversity. Implementation in the subgroups is enacted via appropriate management systems, regulations and processes.

MATERIALITY ANALYSIS
We analyze and evaluate what the major stakeholders expect and require from the Group. This approach enables us to identify early on any opportunities and risks relevant to sustainability, along with
key non-financial areas of activity, and to react to them.
We updated our materiality analysis during 2014. First, relevant external stakeholder sources were analyzed to identify the main non-financial issues for Bayer. The analysis was conducted with the support of
an international management consultancy company to ensure neutrality in the process. The relevance to
Bayer of the most important 24 issues identified in this way was evaluated in respect of sales, costs, risk
and reputation by selected representatives of the Bayer holding company and the three subgroups in the
form of interviews and a global online survey. Internal and external views were then entered into the
following matrix for discussion and confirmation by the sd Committee. The matrix was formally accepted
by Bayer’s Chief Sustainability Officer. Next year, reporting will be structured according to the new gri
g4 guidelines on the basis of the non-financial subject areas identified.

STAKEHOLDER DIALOGUE AT BAYER
Bayer considers itself a part of society and of public life. Society’s acceptance and appreciation of our
corporate activities are therefore essential to Bayer’s reputation and business success. Involving the
different interest groups among Bayer’s stakeholders is a vital element of the company’s activities with
the goal of creating better mutual understanding and trust in respect of our work and products.
online annex: 3-6-4
We believe that systematic dialogue with the stakeholders relevant to us offers a vital key to understanding their viewpoints and expectations and being able to incorporate them into our business
decision-making processes as far as possible. This procedure helps us to identify social and market
trends early, avoid risks, assess our contribution and thereby set focus areas for our activities.
We systematically involve our stakeholders using the Stakeholder Engagement Process. This describes how – throughout the Group and on a project-by-project basis – stakeholder groups can be
identified, their expectations charted and dialogue with them steered. The engagement process
requires regular review and needs to be reflected against social trends.

To ensure the long-term acceptance and appreciation of our business, we seek to link the interests of
our stakeholders even more closely to our corporate strategy. It is important to approach key social
and political players right from the start of a new project and to canvass their support early on and
seek open dialogue. The Group has developed a guide to engaging stakeholders in strategic decision-making processes such as investment projects and launching new products. The platform that
emerged from this offers tools for identifying social and political trends at an early stage and successfully incorporating them into project planning. The concept is currently being applied to various
projects at Bayer, and the practical experience gathered hereby is being channeled back into further
refinements.

6. Sustainability Management and Governance

Bayer’s day-to-day stakeholder activities range from targeted dialogue at the local, national and international levels and active involvement in committees and specialist workshops, through to comprehensive information programs and participation in international initiatives and collaborations. Our
stakeholder dialogue therefore includes both communication with the individual target groups and
also issue-related multi-stakeholder events.
The Group also divides the stakeholders with whom it mainly interacts into four groups: partners,
regulators, financial market participants and a wide variety of social interest groups. Below are some
examples of the commitment Bayer has shown during 2014:
OUR PARTNERS
Customers and suppliers
Collaborative partnerships and a high level of customer satisfaction are vital for the long-term success of the Group. Each subgroup communicates with the relevant customers, has specific systems in
place for measuring customer satisfaction and operates its own management systems for recording
complaints. More on this topic can be found in Chapter 9 “Products, Distribution and Markets.”
Sourcing products and services in differentiated markets represents a particular challenge for the
procurement organizations in the subgroups. Dialogue with suppliers is very important for ensuring
smooth production processes. More information can be found in Chapter 8 “Procurement and Production.”
Employees
The expertise and commitment of our employees form the basis of Bayer’s long-term business success. To sustain this, the Bayer Group needs modern human resource and talent management of its
human resources coupled with competitive structures and processes. This includes regularly providing the workforce with up-to-date information, as well as involving employees in active and targeted
dialogue. More information about internal communications can be found in Chapter 7 “Employees.”
Associations, universities, scientific institutions and schools
Alongside our business activities, Bayer is also an active member of or holds leadership positions on
numerous national, European and international associations and their committees, such as the
Federation of German Industries (bdi; from 2015 Vice-Presidency), the German Chemical Industry
Association (vci; Presidency), the German Equities Institute (dai; Presidency), the European Chemical Industry Council (cefic; membership of the Board and Executive Committee), BusinessEurope
and the International Council of Chemical Associations (icca). Bayer also currently chairs econsense,
German industry’s sustainable development forum.
The subgroups are also active members of their respective industry associations. For instance,
HealthCare is represented on the Executive Board of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers and Associations (ifpma); CropScience is a member of the Board of CropLife International (cli) and its European association, the European Crop Protection Association (ecpa); and the
ceo of MaterialScience is the current President of the European plastics manufacturing association
PlasticsEurope.
Bayer’s research and development activities are supported by an international network of collaborations with leading universities, public-sector research institutes and partner companies. More
information can be found in Chapter 5 “Research, Development, Innovation.”
You can find more information on Bayer’s comprehensive activities in dialogue with school and university students in Chapter 13 “Social Commitment.”

REGULATORS
Legislators, authorities and politicians
The framework for the company’s operations is significantly determined by authorities, legislators
and politicians in terms of statutory regulations and licensing, for example. The dialogues Bayer is
currently pursuing with authorities and ministries at the local, national and international levels include targeted discussions with political decision-makers and active involvement in specialist workshops and cooperation projects. Our active participation in political decision-making processes is also explicitly sought here by the key players involved.
Lobbying
In its Bayer Group Regulation “Code of Conduct for Responsible Lobbying,” Bayer sets out clear and
binding rules for its involvement in political matters, aiming to ensure transparency in any collaboration with the representatives of political institutions. The Group’s Public and Governmental Affairs
Committee is responsible for the strategic planning of Bayer’s political work. This especially includes
developing the company’s political standpoints, as well as determining the position of the Bayer
Board of Management on important political issues. In 2014 Bayer’s political lobbying again focused
on the acceptance of products and technologies in society, on submitting proposals for creating sustainable health care systems, on chemicals and energy policy, and on climate protection. Bayer also
actively promotes the protection of intellectual property in order to be able to continue developing
innovative products. More information about Bayer’s political principles is available on the internet.
Our liaison offices in Berlin, Brussels, Washington, Moscow, Brasilia and Beijing are key points of
contact between the Group and the political arena. Bayer actively participates in existing transparency initiatives. It publishes details of costs, employee numbers and any of the other statistics required
in each country, e.g. in the transparency registers of the European Parliament or the u.s. Congress.
Bayer goes way beyond the statutory requirements in doing so. For instance, the Group also publishes data for countries, e.g. in Germany, where there is no legislative requirement to publish such information. In 2014 the costs incurred at the liaison offices for human resources, material and projects totaled approximately: €1.2 million in Berlin, €2.5 million in Brussels, €5 million in Washington,
€0.25 million in Moscow and €1.2 million in Brasilia.

In keeping with our Group Regulation, we have committed not to make any direct donations to political parties, politicians or candidates for political office. However, some associations to which we belong make donations on their own initiative, in compliance with statutory regulations.
In the United States, a number of employees use the Bayer Corporation Political Action Committee
(BayPac) to make private donations supporting candidates for congressional office. Political action
committees in the United States are government-regulated, legally independent employee groups. In
the United States, companies are legally prohibited from donating to political candidates directly.
Consequently, such donations are not donations made by the company. The BayPac contributions are
regularly reported to the u.s. Federal Election Commission and can be viewed on its website.
FINANCIAL MARKET PARTICIPANTS
Stockholders, capital investment companies, institutional investors, banks, insurance
companies and rating agencies
Intensive dialogue with the capital market is a high priority for Bayer. In its dealings with analysts,
investors and rating agencies, the Group aims to contribute to achieving a fair share price and an
appropriate credit rating. These efforts are focused on ensuring a comprehensive, consistent and
prompt exchange of information between the company and the various members of the financial
community. More information about the capital market can be found in the Chapter “Investor Information.”

SOCIAL INTEREST GROUPS
Non-governmental organizations, the public, local community, competitors
Bayer is involved in a variety of projects, thematic initiatives and specialist conferences at a national
and international level in order to play an active role in the common task of shaping sustainable development. Alongside exchange and cooperation with ngos and supranational organizations, this
primarily involves dialogue with the public.
Among other activities, Bayer is actively engaged in the u.n. Global Compact and its initiatives, the
ceo Water Mandate and Caring for Climate, as well as the Global Compact lead network and local
Global Compact networks. We have also acted as an organizational stakeholder in the Global Reporting Initiative (gri) since 2004.
HealthCare is an active participant in the social dialogue addressing sustainability issues and creates
forums to encourage exchange and develop viable solutions together with partners. The subgroup
has supported the International Dialogue on Population and Sustainable Development conference for
10 years now in close collaboration with different governmental and non-governmental organizations. The conference is a forum for exchanging experience and formulating recommendations regarding the realization of the Millennium Development Goals, which are then made available to policy-makers in development. Education and access to family planning are two of the key themes of this
dialogue.
Together with the dsw (Deutsche Stiftung Weltbevoelkerung – the German Foundation for World
Population), HealthCare organizes an annual parliamentary evening where experts in development
cooperation and representatives from politics, foreign agencies, medical research, international ngos
and think tanks discuss issues related to development policy and population growth.

CropScience wishes to bolster social discourse addressing the advantages of science and innovation
in agriculture and to expand discussion with the public on the potential and challenges for currentday agriculture. One example is the new “Farming’s Future Dialogues” online discussion forum for
agricultural issues. A new training program has the primary goal of teaching young people in particular more about food and agriculture. It includes visits to CropScience facilities so people can see
for themselves how contemporary sustainable agriculture looks in practice, as well as offering scholarships and running a program for fostering the exchange of ideas about the future of agriculture.
Further information about the program is available at www.ag-education.bayer.com.
The communities surrounding Bayer’s sites play a key role in our stakeholder dialogue. The Group is
working at all sites on being recognized as a reliable partner and attractive employer that is aware of
its social responsibility. For example, the involvement of the local community plays a decisive role in
the success of any investment projects.

tdi-project

As part of a project at the Dormagen site in Germany lasting several years, MaterialScience opened
a new world-scale plant for the production of the chemical toluene diisocyanate (tdi) at the end of
2014. The company pursued an active information policy from the very early stages of planning at
the end of 2008 onward. In accordance with our stakeholder guideline, MaterialScience sought
open dialogue with relevant stakeholders, including environmental groups, politicians, residents,
citizens’ groups and media representatives. The company issued regular progress reports for this
project and set up its own website offering detailed information about the construction plans.

www.pipeline.
bayer.de

The company has long pursued an intensive information policy regarding its planned carbon monoxide pipeline between its Dormagen and Krefeld-Uerdingen facilities in Germany. As well as regular
media updates, the exchange of information and dialogue with the local community play an important role. Some residents living nearby lodged a complaint against the project, which has delayed
the commissioning of the pipeline. In its decision of August 2014 the Higher Administrative Court in
Münster expressed no fundamental objections to the design of the pipeline in terms of safety and
route. The court saw the need for further clarification regarding the constitutionality of the Pipeline
Act that the project is subject to. It therefore decided to stay the proceedings and petition the Federal
Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe. The dialogue forum initiated by MaterialScience to discuss the

carbon monoxide supply line also convened on several occasions throughout 2014. Contingencies
were drawn up, including together with medics and other experts, to better secure the basic supply
in case of any carbon monoxide disruption in North Rhine-Westphalia.
CropScience also regularly uses forums, print media and personal discussions with citizens’ initiatives, representatives of the church communities and the regional press to keep its neighbors continually informed, for instance at the Dormagen, Frankfurt-Hoechst and Knapsack sites in Germany.
Stakeholder dialogue is also performed at sites in other countries such as in Muskegon and Institute
in the United States and Hangzhou in China.
Local dialogue at the Lower Rhine sites in Germany (Dormagen, Krefeld-Uerdingen and Leverkusen)
is supported by the Currenta neighborhood offices.

7. Employees
Our business success is largely attributable to the knowledge, skills and commitment of our employees.
It is their ability to innovate and their willingness to embrace continuous development that drive our
position as a world-class innovation company. This is clearly reflected in our new employer branding:
“Passion to innovate | Power to change,” which shows what the Bayer Group expects of its employees
and what it can offer them. It translates Bayer’s mission statement “Science For A Better Life” into the
world of work. Following introduction in China, Brazil, Germany and the United States, it will be in use
worldwide by the end of 2015.

Our success in recruiting employees is attributable to our attractiveness as an employer, which was once
again confirmed by numerous awards around the world in 2014, for example in Brazil and Germany.
In addition, it is due to our foresighted recruitment policies in all countries where we operate. We
maintain close contact to leading universities throughout the world to draw the opportunities offered by
Bayer to the attention of gifted students as early as possible. In some regions, this also enables us to
selectively cover our recruitment needs. In 2014 we expanded our activities in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Finland and the Philippines. Raising our profile in this way encourages an increasing number of young people to apply to Bayer, so we are not currently facing a significant skills shortage in Germany. Nevertheless, as a prudent company we are already addressing the foreseeable consequences of demographic
change by stepping up our activities to recruit staff, especially from the younger generation, retain
knowledge in the company and foster the health of our employees worldwide.
We therefore give young people an opportunity to gain an insight into working for our company at an
early age. Overall, Bayer provided around 3,100 demanding professional internships to students around
the world in 2014. We also train young people for more than 20 different occupations. In Germany
alone, nearly 900 young people embarked on a vocational training course at Bayer in 2014. We intend
to step up this commitment in the coming years.

PRESENT EMPLOYEE DATA
On December 31, 2014, Bayer had around 118,900 employees worldwide. This increase of just over 5%
compared with the previous year was mainly driven by acquisitions. In Germany there were 35,800
employees (2013: 35,300), which was 30% of the total Group workforce.

In 2014 we were again successful in retaining staff in the company for long periods. On the reporting
date, our employees had worked for the company for an average of 12 years, the same as in the previous year.
Group-wide, the fluctuation rate was around 11% in 2014 and thus down 3 percentage points on the
year. The proportion of employee-driven terminations (voluntary fluctuation) in 2014 was around 5%.

In Germany, Bayer also uses temporary personnel from staffing agencies on a small scale, based on
stringent rules that are rooted in the life values.
online annex: 3-7-4
Temporary personnel from staffing agencies are only used where this is unavoidable as a result of
short-term personnel requirements, fluctuations in order levels, temporary projects or long-term illness. The proportion of temporary staff employed in Germany is around 1.2% of the total workforce.
UNIFORM GROUP-WIDE PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
In 2014 we started to introduce “Bayer Competencies” throughout the Group. The aim is to enhance
development opportunities for employees and at the same time provide guidance on career paths. There
are 16 clearly defined core and leadership competencies, which have been introduced as a reference
base for personnel management in all areas. They are intended to ensure that in the future managers
and employees use uniform terminology and criteria to assess professional activities in all situations,
ranging from recruitment interviews to the Development Dialogue. The Bayer Competencies help put
the life values into practice and ensure fair and transparent discussion.
As part of Bayer’s global performance management system, employees agree individual objectives with
their supervisor. These are based on corporate goals. At the end of the year, attainment of these objectives is evaluated by each supervisor and discussed individually with employees. The results are documented in the employee portal so they are transparent to each employee. In 2014, this system covered
more than 83,000 employees, i.e. about two-thirds of our total workforce. Of the participants, 41% were
female and 59% male. The system is mandatory for all managerial employees. This ensures that they
receive feedback on how well they have applied our corporate values in the fulfillment of their individual
objectives. Observing the life values is as important as meeting business targets and therefore affects
the level of their variable compensation.
In addition, more than 26,500 Development Dialogues were held with employees in 2014 as part of the
performance management system. They are an opportunity for employees to discuss their personal
strengths and development needs, career expectations and professional aspirations. We aim to step up
the Group-wide rollout of the Development Dialogue and give it a firm place in our global leadership
culture.
EMPLOYEE COMMUNICATION
Our Group-wide Employee Survey is an important element in our intensive dialogue with our employees and a key feedback tool for the entire Group. It is conducted every two years and gives us competent feedback from our employees on our strategy, culture and working conditions. In 2014, a record
79% of employees took part in the third Group-wide Employee Survey. Compared with the previous
survey in 2012, the findings show an improvement in all areas covered. Particularly high scores were
once again registered for employee engagement, with an overall result of 87% (+2%). This shows we
are meeting our goal of a continuous improvement in employee satisfaction. The survey revealed improvements but also showed that the willingness to embrace new ideas needs further encouragement.
For example, there is a need to improve the basis for open exchange of ideas with direct colleagues. In
addition, Bayer would like to strengthen communication between senior management and employees.

The results of the employee survey are used to bring about further improvements in specific aspects
of Bayer’s corporate culture. Before the next survey, Bayer intends to step up its already strong innovation culture in all areas of its business. The most recent survey showed that 77% of employees are
of the opinion that the company is working to steadily improve the service offered to customers. 80%
of employees feel personally encouraged to suggest innovative solutions to work-related problems.
Activities to drive forward our innovation culture help to implement the key promises Bayer makes to
its employees in its new employer branding “Passion to Innovate | Power to Change.” To foster individual innovative capability, a workshop format, “Leading Innovation,” has been added to our management training. A further 138 employees took part in this program in 2014. A total of around 700
managers from the Group Leadership Circle and selected managerial staff have therefore been
trained in methods and strategies for effective innovation management since 2012.
Dialogue with employees includes informing staff promptly and extensively about upcoming changes, in
compliance with the applicable national and international regulations.
online annex: 3-7-6
The human resources and communications departments work together closely to ensure timely
communication of far-reaching changes through a wide range of carefully coordinated media. In
Germany we combine providing timely information to the employee representatives in the Economics
Committee of the company concerned with coordinating and jointly deciding on the proposed communication measures.
We actively involve our employees in dialogue through a range of offerings and specifically encourage
open discussion. Particular attention is paid to explaining strategic issues, business performance, research, innovation and sustainability.
We regard providing regular, up-to-date information for our employees and involving them through
active dialogue as an integral part of modern human resources and talent management based on competitive structures and processes.

ADVANCING KNOWLEDGE AND LEADERSHIP SKILLS
Fostering employees’ individual abilities, talents and strengths is another key factor for Bayer’s future
success. Sustained success is only possible if we create working conditions that allow all employees to
utilize their talents optimally and therefore contribute to innovative solutions. We therefore actively
support lifelong learning as part of our philosophy of people development and managing demographic
change. Our aim is to empower all employees to broaden their knowledge and skills and keep up with
the latest changes throughout their working lives.

At the heart of our ongoing training concept is the Group-wide Bayer Academy, which bundles our
extensive continuing education opportunities. Alongside systematic development of managerial employees, it offers continuous professional training through various functional academies. In 2014, the
Bayer Academy was honored with the renowned Brandon Hall Group Excellence Award in bronze in the
“Best Leadership Development Program” category.
15,269 managers from various management levels have received training through the various programs
offered by the Bayer Academy for managers since 2013, including 9,536 in 2014.
Harmonization of our employee training concept has also improved reporting on participation rates. Our

Well-trained employees who keep up with the latest developments expect to be offered new perspectives. Thanks to its wide-ranging business activities, Bayer can offer them development opportunities
within the Group. Vacancies in the Bayer Group, from non-managerial right up to senior management
level, are advertised via a globally accessible platform. In 2014 we posted around 11,900 vacancies in
62 countries on this platform.
DIVERSITY AND INTERNATIONALITY
A diverse employee structure is vital for our company‘s future competitiveness. This is particularly true
for our management throughout the Group. Diversity improves our understanding of changing markets
and consumer groups, gives us access to a broader pool of talented employees, and enables us to benefit from the enhanced innovative and problem-solving abilities that are demonstrably associated with a
high cultural diversity within the company.
A better gender and cultural balance at the management level is important for our success as a company. Our activities in this area are bundled in “Leading Across Cultures and Genders.” At the heart of this
program are special training sessions for managers. These provide an opportunity for them to consider
the economic benefits of greater diversity, cultural and gender-specific differences and positive examples from within the Group in order to develop action plans for their own areas of responsibility.
Furthermore, since November 2014 Bayer has been a member of the Gender Parity Council of the
World Economic Forum in Davos.

Group target 2015:
increase in the
proportion of senior
managers from outside
the European Union,
the United States or
Canada to 25%

Overall, the Bayer Group employs people from 150 different nations. Of the members of our Group
Leadership Circle, in which 35 nationalities are currently represented, around 66% come from the
country in which they are employed. The Group Leadership Circle comprises managers who perform
senior functions at Bayer AG and in the subgroups and service companies. Five years ago, 23 nationalities were represented in the Group Leadership Circle. At the end of 2013, 82% of senior managers in
our five top contract levels came from Western Europe, the United States and Canada and 18% came
from other countries. By the end of 2014, the proportion of employees in the latter group had increased
by two percentage points.

Group target 2015:
increase in the
proportion of women
in senior management
to 30%

At the end of 2010 we set ourselves the target of shifting the proportion of women to men in senior
management (the five highest contract levels) from a ratio of 21% to 79% to a ratio of 30% to 70% by
the end of 2015. At the end of 2014, the ratio was 26% to 74%. Our gender balance has therefore improved by five percentage points in four years.

See Chapter 1.3
for Group targets

In our Group Leadership Circle, the ratio had improved from 93% men and 7% women at the end of
2010 to 87% men and 13% women by year-end 2014.

WORK-LIFE BALANCE
Our employees’ lifestyles are as diverse as they are. Bayer therefore offers employees in all countries a
wide range of options to help them balance employment with their personal and family lives. Today’s
employees and prospective employees attach great importance to flexible working arrangements and to
support in caring for children and close relatives. Bayer offers a variety of flexible working opportunities
throughout the world. In many countries, these go well beyond the statutory requirements. In 2014 we
continued to expand our benefits and services in this area.
In 2014 the Bayer Group had around 9,500 part-time employees, just under 8% of the total workforce.

By the end of 2014, around 81% of employees in Germany who took statutory parental leave or participated in the company’s more far-reaching “Family & Career” program over the past five years had returned to work. Roughly 60% of the returnees were female and 40% were male. Since national parental
leave regulations vary widely from country to country, we only compile data for Germany.
online annex: 3-7-11
The next table shows the number of employees who have returned after the standard statutory parental leave program and the Bayer “Family & Career” model since 2009. It also shows the number of
employees who terminated their employment contracts at the end of their parental leave. It covers all

A General Works Agreement on caring for close relatives came into effect at Bayer in Germany in April
2014. The agreement makes it easier for employees to combine working with their role as a carer.
online annex: 3-7-12
Under this agreement, employees can take up to 10 days’ paid leave to provide emergency care for
family members. For longer periods, they are entitled to work part-time. During this time, their salary
can be topped up by drawing funds from their long-term account. Alternatively, employees who need
to care for close relatives full-time can take unpaid leave for up to six months (or up to one year in
exceptional cases).
Bayer also extended the range of flexible working arrangements offered to employees in many regions
such as in Costa Rica, Poland, Slovenia, South Korea and East Africa. In many cases, the offerings go

Bayer’s compensation philosophy is rooted worldwide in the life values. A basic salary reflecting performance and responsibility is combined with elements based on the company’s success, plus extensive
additional benefits. In this way, we aim to offer our employees working conditions that give them a high
degree of security and reliability. Raises based on continuous benchmarking are designed to ensure that
our compensation is always internationally competitive. We also attach great importance to equal pay
for men and women, providing fair compensation worldwide and informing our employees transparently about the overall structure of their compensation.

At Bayer, individual salaries are based on each employee’s personal and professional abilities and the
level of responsibility assigned to them. At the managerial level, this is based on uniform evaluation
of all positions throughout the Group using the internationally recognized Hay method. In areas of
the Group and jobs that fall within the scope of binding collective bargaining agreements, there are
no differences in pay based on gender either. This also applies for the compensation of trainees.
In the Emerging Markets and developing countries, too, our compensation levels are aligned to local
market conditions. In keeping with our Human Rights Position, our goal is to pay our employees adequate salaries that ensure they and their families have an appropriate standard of living. In all
Emerging Markets where Bayer has a significant presence, the lowest salary paid by Bayer is at least
in line with the applicable minimum wage and in most cases higher.
To provide a transparent overview of their compensation, including all additional benefits provided
by the company and employer pension and social insurance contributions, more than 30,000 employees in 12 countries receive an extensive annual Total Reward Statement containing all relevant
information. This will be rolled out progressively to many countries in the next few years.

Consolidated
Financial
Statements
Note 26.6

Under our Group-wide Short-Term Incentive program alone, variable one-time payments totaling
around €900 million are earmarked for our employees for 2014. In many countries, employee stock
programs enable our staff to purchase shares in Bayer at a discount. This offers them a further opportunity to participate in the company and its business performance. We also offer senior managers
throughout the Group a uniform stock-based compensation program known as “Aspire” (see Note [26.6]
to the consolidated financial statements). This is based on ambitious earnings targets and – in the case
of the Group Leadership Circle members – requires an appropriate personal investment in Bayer stock.
In 2014 our personnel expenses amounted to €9,845 million (2013: €9,430 million). The change was
mainly due to an increase in employee numbers, higher employee bonuses and salary adjustments.

HUMAN RIGHTS AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Our social responsibility as a company and an employer is based on our corporate values and our unreserved commitment to supporting and fostering human rights in our sphere of influence. Bayer’s Human Rights Position is set out in a binding Group-wide directive. Alongside working conditions in the
Bayer Group, this outlines our expectation that human rights will be respected at all stages in the supply
chain, as detailed in our Supplier Code of Conduct. In addition, our mission statement, life values and
Corporate Compliance Policy commit all employees around the world to fair and lawful conduct toward
staff, colleagues, business partners and customers. We are a founding member of the un Global Compact and respect the United Nations’ Declaration of Human Rights and a range of globally recognized
declarations applicable for multinational corporations.

These include, in particular, the oecd Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy, and the core labor standards of the International Labour Organization (ilo).
We also observe the u.n. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which were adopted
in 2011. We play an active role in their implementation, one example being the consultation process
initiated at the end of 2014 by the German government to define a national action plan.
To enhance our employees’ awareness of the importance of human rights in their day-to-day activities,
we organized a variety of training seminars in 2014 on the main aspects of our Human Rights Position.
Courses totaling 240,000 hours in duration were offered and were attended by approximately 53% of
our workforce.
The compliance organizations at the Group and country levels monitor compliance with the relevant
directives. If there are signs of violation, employees can contact their Compliance Officer at any time,
anonymously if required. For further details see Chapter 18.3 “Compliance.”
At Bayer, social responsibility includes ensuring safe working conditions and thus an environment
where our employees can work and undertake international business travel without fear. We support
our employees by providing training to prepare them for business trips, including training in the correct
conduct in emergencies.
Our social responsibility is also reflected in our approach to necessary changes and restructuring
measures. In Germany, which remains the company’s largest operational base with 35,800 employees,
business-related dismissals are excluded through the end of 2020 for a large proportion of employees
under an agreement with the employee representatives.
The reduction of around 700 positions at MaterialScience worldwide over a period of four years, which
was announced in September 2013, will also be undertaken in a socially compatible manner wherever
possible, such as by utilizing natural fluctuation and avoiding business-related dismissals. Approximately 350 of these positions were shed in 2014.
In 2014 the working conditions for around 52% of our employees worldwide were governed by collective or company agreements. The contractually agreed working hours of our employees do not exceed
48 hours a week in any country. At various country companies, the interests of the workforce are represented by elected employee representatives who have a right to be consulted on certain personnelrelated decisions.

Our understanding of our role as a socially responsible company includes a commitment to helping
disadvantaged people. Some 2,500 people with disabilities are employed in 27 countries. That is around
2% of our total workforce. 35% are female and 65% male. Most of them work for our companies in
Germany, where they made up 4.7% of the workforce in 2014.
Our sustainable human resources policy also includes ensuring a high level of social protection for our
employees. Alongside competitive compensation, we offer our employees a wide range of additional
benefits, for example almost all employees worldwide have either statutory health insurance or can
obtain health insurance through the company. In 2014, we once again expanded or improved the quality
of the health benefits provided for employees in many countries. 77% of employees have access to a
company pension plan.

2 programs to supplement statutory pension plans

To supplement health insurance, Bayer actively encourages awareness of healthy lifestyles, especially in
view of the challenges facing us as a result of demographic change and the raising of the retirement age
in many countries.
Bayer has therefore introduced a wide range of workplace health management programs at all levels,
which are being expanded in response to employee surveys. This is designed to provide all employees
with access to adequate, affordable and targeted health offerings such as sports programs, regular
medical check-ups, help in overcoming illness and on-site medical care. The type and scope of the
health promotion programs offered by Bayer Group companies worldwide varies depending on national
health systems and their accessibility. In many countries, preventive health care measures are a discretionary benefit provided by the company, while in others they are required by law.

Group-wide initiatives to foster employees’ health and maintain their employability in view of the rise in
the retirement age include the 2010 General Works Agreement on lifetime working and demographic
change in Germany.
online annex: 3-7-15
This innovative agreement contains measures to reduce the workload of older shift workers and to
ease the return to work after long-term illness as well as an extensive health screening program for
all employees. In 2014 626 employees took part in the program to reduce the workload of older employees. This is around 98% of those who are eligible.

8. Procurement and Production
Our procurement function ensures the timely, global supply of goods and services at suitable market
conditions, in the required quality and in accordance with the Group’s ethical, ecological and social
standards. The principles of our procurement policy are defined in a directive that is binding for all
employees throughout the Group.
We exert considerable influence on society and the environment in many regions through our procurement volume. In 2014, goods and services were procured from some 112,000 (2013: some 107,000)
suppliers in 147 (2013: 138) countries for approximately €20.3 billion (2013: €18.7 billion) and recorded
in the Group-wide reporting system.
The procurement volume in Germany, the United States and Japan in 2014 accounted for nearly 66% of
the expenditures in the countries of the oecd (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development), or about 52% of the Bayer Group’s total procurement spend. Brazil, India and China together
accounted for about 70% of the expenditures in the non-oecd countries or about 14% of the total
spend.

Direct and production-related procurement at Bayer is organized decentrally in the subgroups. Indirect
and non-production-related goods and services are sourced in each case by the organizational unit that
is their major user within the Bayer Group. Our Group-wide procurement strategy and application of the
major-user principle enable us to realize synergy potentials in the form of standardization, volume pooling and streamlining of negotiations. The activities of the various procurement organizations are coordinated through the Group Procurement Committee, which reports to the Chief Financial Officer.

8. Procurement and Production

Important raw materials are procured on the basis of long-term supply agreements and an active supplier management to minimize procurement risks such as supply shortages or substantial price fluctuations. Regular sustainability and quality audits of our suppliers ensure compliance with internal and
external standards. This is the case, for instance, when raw materials are procured, for which sustainability aspects are becoming increasingly important due to legal standards – an example being the purchase of minerals from conflict areas.
online annex: 3-8-2
International regulations such as the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States increasingly obligate companies to disclose the origin of certain raw materials used in their products. “Conflict minerals” from
the Congo region are one example. Bayer investigated whether minerals from this region – such as
tin, tungsten and tantalum ores or gold – could have found their way into our products through the
supply chain. We identified about 100 Bayer suppliers who could potentially be impacted by this issue. One-third of these suppliers were questioned about the use of conflict minerals in 2014, including all identified suppliers of CropScience and MaterialScience. HealthCare intends to have finished
questioning all potentially impacted suppliers by the end of 2015. Suppliers who have already been
questioned provided written confirmation that they do not procure potential conflict minerals from
the Congo region.
SUSTAINABILITY IN SUPPLIER MANAGEMENT
Bayer regards adherence to sustainability standards within its supply chain as a crucial factor in the
value chain. By acting responsibly in collaboration with our suppliers, we aim to minimize risks and
create stable, long-term business relationships with our partners. This is also an important strategic
lever for Bayer in safeguarding both its global competitiveness and the supply of materials and services.
For this reason, we apply not just economic standards, but also environmental, social and corporate
governance (esg) standards in choosing new suppliers or continuing our relationships with existing
ones. These standards are defined in Bayer’s Supplier Code of Conduct, which is based on the principles of the u.n. Global Compact and our Human Rights Position. The Code forms the general basis for
our collaboration. It is legally binding and integrated into electronic ordering systems and contracts
throughout the Group.
Group targets for
supplier management

See Chapter 1.3
for Group targets

In order to continuously drive and measure sustainability in supplier management, we have set ambitious targets. By 2017, we plan to evaluate all our strategic suppliers with respect to sustainabilityrelevant aspects. By 2020, we also aim to evaluate all those suppliers with significant Bayer spend that
are regarded as potential high-risk suppliers. Another objective is the development and establishment of
a new sustainability standard for our supply base by 2020. This is to be driven forward in tandem with
relevant industry initiatives. So far we have evaluated the sustainability performance of 66% of the
Bayer Group’s strategic suppliers and 61% of potential high-risk suppliers with significant spend.
For the development and introduction of new sustainability standards for our suppliers, we collaborate
with the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (psci) as well as with Together for Sustainability (TfS),
an initiative co-founded by Bayer that is being established as an association under Belgian law. Bayer is
engaged in these initiatives to successfully address the diverse challenges of a sustainable supply chain
and to leverage synergies together with other companies.
online annex: 3-8-3
In both initiatives, we focus on the standardization of sustainability aspects in the relevant industries
in order to establish corresponding social, ethical and environmental practices among our suppliers.
We have already developed uniform criteria that the member companies take into account in sustainability assessments and audits. The exchange of supplier assessments and audits among member
companies enables access to additional sustainability assessments of suppliers who also work for
Bayer. In both initiatives, assessments and audits are exchanged through it platforms.
The TfS initiative consists of the six founding members as well as six new members. psci had
18 member companies at the end of 2014.

Evaluating the sustainability performance of our suppliers
The sustainability performance of our suppliers is monitored through online supplier assessments and
on-site audits.
The assessments are carried out on our behalf by a leading web-based service platform for sustainability performance monitoring (EcoVadis). They are based on a web-supported, modular questionnaire
completed by the supplier, coupled with accompanying verification documents and 360° screening.
Suppliers are selected for these assessments based on a combination of country and material risks as
well as strategic importance in accordance with our Group targets.
We conduct the on-site audits with external, independent auditors. Here, too, we apply the standard of
the respective industry initiatives in which we participate in order to benefit from synergies. In addition,
internal auditors perform inspections focusing on health, safety, environmental protection and sustainability.

3 Health, Safety, Environment

Within the TfS initiative, a total of 2,605 suppliers were assessed using EcoVadis and 93 audits conducted in the course of 2014. The TfS audit program was executed in China and in additional countries (such as India and Brazil). In psci, the member companies carried out seven joint audits in four
countries (including India, Saudi Arabia and the United States) in 2014.
All assessment and audit results are thoroughly analyzed and documented. Wherever the results are
unsatisfactory, we develop improvement measures together with our suppliers to ensure that they observe social, ethical and environmental standards in the future. During the reporting period 5% of the
assessments had a critical result. In each of these cases, we initiated measures ranging from action
plans through the improvement of defined weaknesses to the reduction of the procurement volume. In
2014, Bayer was not prompted to end a supplier relationship due solely to sustainability performance.
Interaction and communication on the subject of sustainability
Procurement of products and services in differentiated markets and locations represents a particular
challenge for our procurement organization. Dialogue with our suppliers is essential to ensure smooth
production routines and to build up reliable relations. In particular, our goal is to make the principles of
our procurement policy and our sustainability requirements clear to our suppliers. In return, we would
like to know more about the suppliers’ situation in order to be able to identify and remove obstacles in
our collaboration at an early stage. Our procurement staff plays an important intermediary role here. We
therefore offer both our procurement colleagues and suppliers a wide range of training and exchange
opportunities.

online annex: 3-8-5
We offer training activities to help procurement staff worldwide create awareness of sustainability
and possible risks in dialogue with our suppliers. Training for employees in procurement in the
Bayer Group includes attending courses on sustainability in supplier management. In 2014 we continued the Group-wide training program on our sustainability assessment process via our collaboration platform EcoVadis. A further 337 employees received comprehensive training. In addition, the
subgroups organized specific training events in 2014, such as courses for selected procurement employees on the issue of sustainability audits or sustainability roadshows for different procurement
categories and local procurement organizations at HealthCare.
In 2014 we organized the second Group-wide Bayer Supplier Day in Leverkusen with 300 participants, including representatives of 90 strategically important suppliers from all over the world. Suppliers were honored at the event for successful partnerships in areas such as sustainability and contractor safety. Our subgroups and country companies also organized local Supplier Days such as the
events held by HealthCare in Turkey or by our Indian country company in connection with the annual
BayBuy Award.
The continuous development of suppliers in terms of sustainability is also a key objective of the industry initiatives TfS and psci. A joint supplier day of the TfS member companies was held for the
first time in Shanghai, China, in 2014. The TfS initiative also offers online sustainability training
courses on its website. psci additionally provides comprehensive information at its website, as well
as training and information events. Webinars were offered in 2014 on the topic of sustainability in
the supply chain, and a capability building conference was organized in Suzhou, China, for Chinese
suppliers of active ingredients.
Tackling child labor in the supply chain
For Bayer, responsible corporate governance includes recognizing and respecting human rights both
internally and within our external sphere of influence. This includes the supply chain. Our Human
Rights Position is unequivocal and includes a strict ban on child labor. We obligate our suppliers along
our supply chain to refrain from employing children. Particularly when working with suppliers in developing countries or emerging markets, we take care that they do not engage in child labor – which is still
widespread in these regions.
For many years, CropScience has taken systematic action to prevent child labor in the seed supply chain
in India through its Child Care Program. For example, teams from Bayer visit the fields used in cotton,
rice and vegetable seed production throughout the season in order to raise awareness of the issue and
the Bayer requirements and to determine the age of the workers there. Thanks to this stringent monitoring system, there are now only very few instances of child labor among our contractors, and we are
closely tracking these cases. The system has now also been introduced in those countries in Asia in
which CropScience seed is produced, such as Bangladesh and the Philippines (both rice seed).

Suppliers who show that they are strictly observing our ban on child labor receive a bonus from
Bayer along with training in agricultural efficiency. Graduated sanctions are applied for noncompliance. These range from written warnings to termination of the contract in the case of repeated
non-compliance.
Once a year, the audit firm Ernst & Young (India) conducts unannounced inspections of randomly selected farms. The two indicators highlighted in the table are used to measure the success of our extensive package of measures.
We regard school attendance not only as essential for children’s development but also as a tool to
drive the elimination of child labor. We therefore also visit the parents of children we find working in
the fields to convince them of the importance of school education. As an important part of the child

protection program, our “Learning for Life” initiative consists of projects aimed at ensuring that children and young people get a proper education and covers everything from reintegrating children into
the regular school system to vocational training measures. Between 2005 and the end of 2014, the
“Learning for Life” educational programs benefited more than 5,800 children and young people.
The CropScience Child Care Program has received broad public recognition. It is a multi-disciplinary
project involving management, specialists from the Child Care Team, and staff from the seed production team and Corporate Communications, who play a key role in raising awareness for this issue.
PROCUREMENT AND PRODUCTION IN THE SUBGROUPS
Both procurement and production are decentrally organized in the Bayer Group and are aligned to the
individual requirements of the respective subgroups’ businesses.

Benefits from the
production network

HEALTHCARE
The Product Supply unit of HealthCare steers the subgroup’s entire supply chain, from raw material
procurement to manufacturing to product shipment, utilizing a global production network consisting of
its own sites and those of subcontractors. The manufacturing of pharmaceutical and medical products is
subject to extraordinarily stringent quality requirements that are based on internationally recognized
standards. Compliance with these requirements at Bayer is regularly audited by internal experts, regulatory authorities and external consultants.
online annex: 3-8-bhc-1
Quality standards are developed according to regulatory requirements, approvals and authorizations,
relevant standards of non-governmental organizations and industry associations, and requirements
resulting from customer expectations. These requirements are evaluated by HealthCare and integrated into an internal quality management (qm) system that is based on international standards of the
iso (e.g. iso 9001 and iso 13485) and the ich (International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use), as well as on rules for
“good working practice” (GxP) in the development and manufacture of pharmaceuticals (e.g. “Good
Manufacturing Practices” (gmp), Good Distribution Practices (gdp) and Good Clinical Practices
(gcp)). With the help of our qm system, we effectively and transparently implement and manage the
quality processes and responsibilities according to established, documented and binding processes
and methods. The goal is to ensure the quality of our products throughout their entire life cycle and
safeguard the value chain over the long term.
The Pharmaceuticals segment generally procures the starting materials for the active ingredients of its
prescription pharmaceuticals from external suppliers.
Our active ingredients are manufactured primarily at the sites in Wuppertal and Bergkamen, Germany,
and Berkeley, California, United States. These substances are processed into finished products and
packaged worldwide. Our medicines come in a wide range of delivery forms including solids such as
tablets, coated tablets or powders; semi-solids such as ointments or creams; and liquid pharmaceuticals
such as those used in injections or infusions. Our hormonal contraceptives are supplied as sugar- or
film-coated tablets or used in intrauterine systems (coils), for example. Among the sites where formulating and packaging take place are Berlin, Leverkusen and Weimar, Germany; Garbagnate, Italy; Beijing,
China; São Paulo, Brazil; and Turku, Finland. Our hemophilia drug Kogenate™ is manufactured by a
biotechnological process at Berkeley, California, United States.
For the Consumer Care Division of the Consumer Health segment, we produce certain active substances, such as acetylsalicylic acid and clotrimazole, in La Felguera, Spain. The principal raw materials we purchase from third parties include naproxen, citric acid, ascorbic acid, other vitamins and
paracetamol. Among the division’s production sites are the facilities in Myerstown, Pennsylvania, United
States; Cimanggis, Indonesia; Lerma, Mexico; Bitterfeld-Wolfen, Darmstadt and Grenzach-Wyhlen,
Germany; Madrid, Spain; and Segrate, Italy. Our production network has expanded through the acquisitions of the consumer care business of Merck & Co., Inc. and Dihon Pharmaceutical Group Co. Ltd.

8. Procurement and Production

The Diabetes Care products (such as blood glucose meters) of our Medical Care Division are mainly
procured from original equipment manufacturers. We hold strategic reserves of certain materials and
finished products so that we can supply our customers consistently and reliably. The contrast agents for
diagnostic imaging procedures are produced mainly in Berlin, Germany. Medical devices such as contrast agent injectors and sterile consumable articles are manufactured primarily at the u.s. sites near
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Most of the materials and components needed to manufacture our medical
devices are procured from external suppliers.
The Animal Health Division procures the pharmaceutical active ingredients for its veterinary medicines
both from within the Bayer Group and from external suppliers throughout the world. Our animal health
products are manufactured mainly at the sites in Kiel, Germany, and Shawnee, Kansas, United States,
and marketed worldwide.
CROPSCIENCE
CropScience, too, manages procurement and production as a single organizational unit. This enables
an integrated supply chain from raw material purchase through end-product manufacture to warehousing, followed by a two- or three-step distribution system depending on local market conditions. Unitary
management is also intended to help us steadily improve our cost structures, increase our flexibility,
ensure a swifter response to market volatility and meet our high quality and safety standards.
Our principal procurement countries, representing the bulk of our procurement volume, are centrally
managed. This enables us to operate efficiently in procurement markets and optimize our cost position.
Crop Protection and Environmental Science products are mainly manufactured at our own production
sites and formulation facilities. Among the largest are the facilities in Dormagen, Knapsack and Frankfurt am Main, Germany; Kansas City, Missouri, United States; and Vapi, India. Our network of decentralized formulation and filling sites enables us to respond rapidly to local market needs. At these sites the
active ingredients are processed into herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, seed treatment products and
Environmental Science products according to local requirements and application areas. Packaging of
the products also takes place in these facilities.
Production in the Seeds business unit takes place at locations close to our customers in Europe, Asia,
and North and South America at our own farms or under contract.
We invest continuously in our global production network in order to create capacities for new products
and technologies and to improve manufacturing processes. We plan to significantly increase our capital
investment to meet the steadily rising demand in a competitive and timely manner. We intend to invest
approximately €2.4 billion in property, plant and equipment between 2013 and 2016.
Our CropScience products are manufactured according to high quality standards based on din iso 9001.
80% of CropScience production sites are certified to this standard, and the compliance of the production processes and registered product specifications is regularly monitored by external auditors.
MATERIALSCIENCE
Procurement at MaterialScience is centrally steered and managed by the Procurement & Trading unit
so as to leverage synergies globally.
MaterialScience applies very high standards for the quality of the raw materials it uses and their further
processing into high-tech plastics and polymer precursors. A quality management system was implemented for this purpose that is certified to the international standard iso 9001. In terms of total energy
consumption, over 99% of the reporting MaterialScience sites worldwide are certified. This is regularly
monitored by internal and external auditors. Certification takes place not just in Procurement and Production but also in most other organizational units.

9. Products, Distribution and Markets

Key raw materials for our MaterialScience products are petrochemical feedstocks such as benzene,
toluene and phenol. The operation of our production facilities also requires large amounts of energy,
mostly in the form of electricity or steam. In steam and electricity generation, we aim for close-tomarket price indexing, diversification of fuels and a mix of external procurement and captive production
to minimize the price fluctuation risk.
The principal production facilities of MaterialScience are at Dormagen, Krefeld and Leverkusen,
Germany; Shanghai, China; and Baytown, Texas, United States. These supply all the subgroup’s business units and are centrally managed by the Industrial Operations unit. Further major production sites
are located at Antwerp, Belgium; Brunsbüttel, Germany; Map Ta Phut, Thailand; and Tarragona, Spain.
Each of these sites is managed by the respective business unit.
World-scale facilities
reduce costs for
commodities

In the field of commodities, we endeavor to reduce costs by operating high-capacity production facilities
that enable us to supply our markets on an international basis. We maintain a relatively large number of
production facilities in selected countries to serve our differentiated businesses. These facilities include
systems houses, where we formulate and supply customized polyurethane systems, and plants where
we compound polycarbonate granules to meet specific customer requirements or manufacture semifinished products (polycarbonate sheets). We also operate regional production facilities for functional
films made of polycarbonate or thermoplastic polyurethane.

9. Products, Distribution and Markets
Bayer markets its products globally through a market- and customer-specific distribution network.
Responsible marketing and distribution is a top priority for Bayer, which is why we do not tolerate legal
violations in the marketing of our products. The necessary code of conduct is established in our Group
directive on “Responsible Marketing & Sales.” This Group directive and the respective training programs
are implemented decentrally in the subgroups. Our distribution activities are primarily aimed at ensuring
that our products are available on the market. A high level of customer satisfaction is essential for the
long-term success of our business. This necessitates the systematic analysis of customer satisfaction and
complaints, but especially partnership-based cooperation and the willingness to engage in dialogue.

Broad product portfolio
in the Pharmaceuticals
segment

HEALTHCARE

9. Products, Distribution and Markets

The portfolio of our Consumer Health segment mainly comprises non-prescription products. The
Consumer Care Division specializes in over-the-counter (otc) medicines – those available without a
prescription – and is the second-leading supplier in the global otc market with a portfolio covering all
the major therapeutic areas. Our offering includes the pain relievers Aspirin™ and Aleve™ and the
otc medical skincare products Bepanthen™ / Bepanthol™ and Canesten™. The product range also includes cough-and-cold and allergy products such as Alka-Seltzer Plus™ and Claritin™, nutritionals such
as One A Day™, Berocca™ and Supradyn™, and products to treat gastrointestinal complaints, such as
Miralax™ and Rennie™. Other otc products include Coppertone™ sunscreen products and Dr. Scholl’s™
foot care products. We also offer prescription dermatology products. The division’s sales and distribution channels are generally pharmacies, with supermarket chains and other large retailers also playing a
significant role in certain important markets such as the United States.
In the Medical Care Division we offer blood glucose monitoring devices such as Contour™. We also
market the Contour™ usb meter, which features integrated diabetes management software and direct
plug-in to computers. Outside Europe, these products are generally sold to consumers through pharmacies, drugstores, mass merchants, hospitals or wholesalers. In Europe, they are sold mainly through
pharmacies. We are among the principal players in the area of blood glucose meters and are also one of
the leading suppliers of contrast agent injection systems for diagnostic and therapeutic medical procedures in X-ray, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Examples from our portfolio of
contrast agents for diagnostic imaging are Ultravist™, Gadovist™ / Gadavist™ and Magnevist™. Our
products are marketed to radiologists, cardiologists and other specialists in medical imaging in hospitals and out-patient clinical sites through a global direct sales organization, supplemented in some cases
by local distributors.
The Animal Health Division offers an extensive portfolio of animal health products for farm and companion animals. Depending on local regulatory frameworks, we market our products through veterinarians and other distribution channels such as pharmacies or retail stores. Our Advantage™ family of
products protects dogs and cats from parasite infestation and supports our number two position in the
parasiticides market. The innovative Seresto™ collar provides dogs and cats with lasting protection
against parasites through a modern system for controlled release of the active ingredients and reinforces our leading market position. Other important products include Baytril™ and Veraflox™ for the
control of infectious diseases, the Drontal™ line of wormers, and Baycox™ to treat coccidiosis in livestock.
Responsible business practices in marketing and distribution
In marketing its medicines, HealthCare applies strict standards and observes the relevant international
industry codes. This includes all codes of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
& Associations (ifpma) and of regional associations such as the European Federation of Pharmaceutical
Industries and Associations (efpia) concerning relations with health care professionals and patient
organizations. These codes include rules governing the distribution of advertising materials and product
samples, cooperation with health care and pharmacy professionals under speaker and consultancy
agreements, and scientific studies. HealthCare has also undertaken to implement the efpia transparency
code. The codes apply to prescription medicines. There are also local laws and codes applicable to all
medicines.
online annex: 3-9-bhc-1
The ifpma code applies not only to prescription medicines but also to over-the-counter products that
are directly advertised to health care professionals. The ifpma code, as a binding global minimum
standard for HealthCare, also includes basic principles for cooperation with patient groups. The efpia
Code of Conduct for cooperation with patient organizations mandates universal transparency and
requires that these organizations’ independence not be compromised by the provision of support to
patient organizations. Under the code, donations to health care professionals or organizations must be
disclosed annually on a publicly accessible website. This information must be published for the first
time by June 30, 2016, and must include the relevant donations made in the 2015 calendar year.

9. Products, Distribution and Markets

These local codes serve to bring the provisions of the global or regional codes mentioned above into
line with local laws. In the event of discrepancies among the rules we have committed to respect,
HealthCare always observes the more stringent requirement.
The who’s Ethical Criteria for Medicinal Drug Promotion, together with national ethical standards,
represent the minimum standard for the advertising of pharmaceutical products at HealthCare. National
ethical standards are usually enshrined in industry codes at the local level, an example being that of the
association “Voluntary Self-Regulation for the Pharmaceutical Industry” (fsa). The main principles for
ethically and legally acceptable advertising for pharmaceuticals and medical products are also set out in
the internal HealthCare directive “Compliance in Product-Related Communications”. This directive in
turn is based on our “Group-wide Responsible Marketing & Sales Policy” and the “Directive on Integrity
& Responsibility in Communications and Marketing.”
HealthCare has summarized the key requirements for compliant and ethical conduct in the global
“Anti-Corruption Compliance Manual”.
online annex: 3-9-bhc-2
Published in 2014, this manual summarizes existing internal anti-corruption regulations at
HealthCare within a standard document. It applies to all HealthCare divisions and therefore governs
the marketing of prescription medicines, as well as over-the-counter, medical and animal health
products. It establishes the minimum global standard for responsible marketing and ethically
acceptable dealings with important stakeholders such as officials, health care professionals and
patient organizations.
The specific global anti-corruption training program launched a number of years ago was continued
in 2014. The comprehensive training materials are available in 11 languages. Courses are offered
both in the form of web-based compliance programs and face-to-face programs. The web-based programs were honored with the Brandon Hall Excellence in Learning Award, receiving the silver medal
in the “Best in Compliance Training” category. In conjunction with all training courses, employees
can receive further information as part of our newly launched “Integrated Compliance Management
(icm)” project (see Chapter 18.3 Compliance) and can also request additional support.
Any suspected violation of our responsible marketing policy is recorded and investigated as part of our
compliance management. This applies to complaints received from inside or outside the company.
Customer dialogue
Bayer utilizes a broad range of measures and quantitative targets to increase the value of its commercial
distribution activities. In addition to internal monitoring, customer satisfaction is evaluated in core
markets. The results of these evaluations help Bayer to continuously improve its offering in line with the
needs of its customers.
The HealthCare divisions maintain their own active dialogue with their specific customer groups. The
various sales organizations carry out customer satisfaction studies – for example with physicians from
different disciplines. Different legal requirements apply for prescription medicines than for nonprescription or medicinal products. This makes the conditions under which customer satisfaction data
are gathered in the health sector correspondingly complex. For example, patients may not be surveyed
directly about the effects and side effects of prescription medicines. HealthCare therefore conducts
primary market and data research in this area.

online annex: 3-9-bhc-3
Customer groups from four therapeutic areas in the Pharmaceuticals segment have been surveyed in
11 countries since 2012. Long-term customer relationships and the performance of the sales employees were identified as key factors in customer loyalty and positive differentiation from competitors. The results of the studies are regularly integrated into brand planning. Country coverage was
further expanded in 2014, and the studies now include 14 key markets.
In order to improve customer orientation, Consumer Care launched pilot projects in key markets in
2014 for the excellence program initiated in 2013. Global rollout of the program is planned for 2015.
The initiative focuses on the identification of best practice models for distribution and trading.
At Animal Health, the methods for measuring customer satisfaction are dependent on the market
segment. The division also carries out market research projects on specific disease-related issues
and measures satisfaction with its own products and the image of the company brand.
Information on health care topics and customer services for orders, product and delivery information,
complaints or the handling of general inquiries pertaining to HealthCare are addressed by the relevant business units and country organizations, and contact information is made available online.
As the Bayer Group is headquartered in Germany, HealthCare operates a customer service center in
that country that since 2008 has had a quality management system certified to iso 9001:2008.
CROPSCIENCE
CropScience offers its customers in the Crop Protection / Seeds operating segment an outstanding range
of products including high value seeds, innovative crop protection solutions based on chemical and
biological modes of action as well as an extensive customer service for modern, sustainable agriculture.
In the field of non-agricultural applications (Environmental Science operating segment), CropScience
has a broad portfolio of pest control products and services for areas including the home and garden
sector, professional applications for golf courses and forestry.
CropScience markets its products in more than 120 countries. In the coming years we intend to
continue expanding our business, particularly in the emerging markets, by deploying innovative, leading-edge technologies in order to meet the increasing global demand for high-quality food and feed.
The marketing and distribution activities of the Crop Protection / Seeds operating segment have a
product-specific alignment.
The Crop Protection business is based on a broad portfolio of highly effective herbicides, fungicides,
insecticides and seed treatment products with chemical or biological modes of action. Our innovation
capability and long years of experience with crop protection products have placed us among the leading
companies in the world.
The activities of the Seeds unit are focused on the crops cotton, oilseed rape / canola, rice, soybeans and
vegetables. We market high-value seeds based on our own research and breeding expertise. In our core
crops, we have achieved strong market positions and are internationally represented.
Our Crop Protection products are primarily marketed through two- or three-step distribution systems,
either via wholesalers or directly to retailers. We also sell products directly to customers in selected
markets where farmers and market conditions require this mode of distribution.

9. Products, Distribution and Markets

Our seeds are sold to growers, plant raisers, specialist retailers and the processing industry. Plant traits
developed using modern breeding methods are either incorporated into our own seed varieties or licensed to other seed companies.
The products of our Environmental Science operating segment are based on both proprietary and
inlicensed active ingredients and designed for non-agricultural uses. We market pest control and plant
care products both to private customers in the home and garden sector and to professional users in the
green industry (including public parks and golf courses), forestry, professional pest control and public
health (vector control to combat malaria and dengue fever). CropScience ranks among the world’s leading suppliers of crop protection products for non-agricultural uses. The Environmental Science products
are mainly sold through wholesalers and specialist retailers. A large part of our business in the area of
vector control is transacted in response to tendering by government agencies and non-governmental
organizations.
CropScience follows the International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides
issued by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (fao). This forms the basis for
CropScience’s expanded Product Stewardship Policy, which satisfies the requirements of the Group’s
position on responsible marketing and sales. Training materials to explain this Group position have
been distributed throughout the global organization and are available on the Bayer intranet.
online annex: 3-9-bcs-1
The issue of responsible marketing and sales is addressed at CropScience in compliance training
courses and is also an integral element of marketing and sales excellence training measures. By the
end of 2014, we had trained approximately 3,700 employees worldwide in three- and one-day
courses, including some 1,300 employees in 2013 and 2,400 in 2014.
Customer dialogue
CropScience investigates the satisfaction of its customers using standardized surveys as part of its
commercial excellence activities, among other tools. In addition, CropScience completely overhauled its
internal customer relationship management (crm) processes in 2014 so as to establish a new understanding of crm. Alongside farmers, this new approach also focuses on distribution channels in all markets. A centralized, global crm platform will also standardize core processes. Furthermore, CropScience
is intensifying its direct cooperation with farmers through the Bayer Forward Farming initiative. Our
solutions for sustainable agriculture in practice are demonstrated at Bayer ForwardFarms.
MATERIALSCIENCE
One of the world’s largest polymer companies, MaterialScience is a manufacturer and supplier of precursors for rigid and flexible foams, plastic granules, and raw materials for coatings and adhesives. The
subgroup holds leading competitive positions in these product groups. We also manufacture and market
plastic sheets, functional films and selected inorganic basic chemicals. The latter serve as raw materials
for the manufacture of our products. Others are generated as by-products of our production and sold to
external customers.
Our products are used mainly in the automotive, construction, electrical / electronics, furniture, wood,
textile, sports and leisure goods, medical equipment and chemical industries.
Rigid or flexible polyurethane foams based on our diphenylmethane diisocyanate (mdi), toluene diisocyanate (tdi) or polyether (pet) raw materials have found a broad range of applications in a variety of
industries. Automotive uses include the manufacture of car seats and components. They are also used in
the construction industry and the refrigeration chain as insulating materials, and in the furniture industry for cushioning and mattresses.

9. Products, Distribution and Markets

Our polycarbonates are marketed as granules (Makrolon™, apec™, Makroblend™, Bayblend™), sheet
and films. Their uses include electrical appliance housings, cds / dvds, roof structures and automotive
headlamps.
The Coatings, Adhesives, Specialties business unit manufactures raw materials for car and commercial
vehicle coatings and for footwear and textile adhesives, for example. Specialties include films used in id
and credit cards, along with raw materials for cosmetic and medical products.
We market our products mostly through regional and local distribution channels. Here three regional
Supply Chain Centers serve as the central link to the customer. We make use of e-commerce platforms
and other channels for order processing.
online annex: 3-9-bms-1
This structure pools all information streams from order acceptance to dispatch planning, delivery
and complaint acceptance in the Europe/Middle East/Africa, Latin America, nafta and Asia/Pacific
regions. In particular, that gives us a high level of expertise in order management and in transaction,
supply chain and logistics solutions. Our customers can check the status of their orders at any time
through the online information platform BayerONE.
The top quality objective targeted by MaterialScience is completely error-free operation so as to
achieve a high level of customer satisfaction. Our supply, production and delivery processes are
therefore certified to din iso en 9001 and are regularly audited both internally and externally.
To systematically increase customer satisfaction and ensure optimal quality of service, we regularly
evaluate the complaints registered in our global management system and by the individual business
units. We also analyze in detail the evaluations performed by our customers. Through dialogue with
internal stakeholders, corrective and preventive measures are undertaken to further increase quality
and customer satisfaction while at the same time lowering the error rate and ultimately also the incidence of complaints. In 2014, for example, a total of 4,835 complaints by around 1,990 customers
were registered. This yields a rate of 7.18 complaints per 1,000 deliveries, about the same as in 2013
(7.44 complaints per 1,000 deliveries).
We also work with trading houses and local distributors who are responsible for business with small
customers. Major customers with global operations are serviced directly by our key account managers.
In the marketing of our products, we also take into account all the requirements of the Group’s position
on responsible marketing and sales. The importance of observing antitrust law and preventing corruption is regularly emphasized in training programs, internal communications and discussions with management. In 2014, antitrust law was a particular focus of our training measures. Around 3,000
MaterialScience employees took part in Group-wide, web-based courses and supplementary target
group-oriented, on-site training sessions.

10. Product Stewardship

10. Product Stewardship
We assess the possible health and environmental risks of a product along the entire value chain. This
starts with research and development and continues through production, marketing and use by the
customer through to disposal.
At issue here are not just the safe handling and use of our products, but also the transparent communication and transfer of product safety information. Product stewardship involves both compliance with
statutory requirements and voluntary commitment. Here, we also take into account the precautionary
principle as explained in Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration of the United Nations and communiqué
com (2000) 1 of the European Commission.
online annex: 3-10-1
We accept the precautionary principle as a possible tool for consumer protection and/or risk management. It is applied whenever there is no final scientific certainty in a given area and evidence also
exists that people or the environment could suffer significant or irreversible damage that must be
rectified. However, a balance between risks and opportunities must always be ensured. The focus
should not unilaterally be on the hazard potential.
Bayer monitors all products that are already on the market. Furthermore, we have established processes in all subgroups aimed at addressing inquiries on product safety or problems with our products. This feedback is systematically accounted for in our assessment of risks, which also covers substances that are regarded as potentially high-risk by regulatory authorities and independent institutions.
As a contribution to the safe handling of chemicals, risk assessments are carried out applying recognized scientific principles such as those described by the echa (European Chemicals Agency) in its
Guidance on Information Requirements and Chemical Safety Assessment.
Should this assessment or new findings reveal that it is not safe to use a certain chemical, we take
the necessary steps to mitigate risks. Such measures can range from revised application recommendations through the withdrawal of support for a certain application to the substitution of a substance.
In this case, a replacement substance must be sought that is economically and technically feasible.
The substitution of chemicals is basically a continuous task of the chemical and pharmaceutical industry so as to obtain new or substantially improved products and processes. This is the basis of the
reach (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals) Regulation, and is also
integral to our commitment to Responsible Care.
Since 1994 Bayer has supported the voluntary Responsible Care™ initiative of the chemical industry,
which was globalized in 2006 with the introduction of the Responsible Care™ Global Charter. We cover
all main elements of the charter at all Group sites with our hseq (health, safety, environmental protection and quality) management systems and activities. We are also actively involved in the further development of scientific risk assessment through our work in associations and initiatives.

online annex: 3-10-2
International associations such as the European and international chemical industry associations
(cefic,ௗicca) and the oecd (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), as well as initiatives such as the ecetoc (European Centre for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals) and the
epaa (European Partnership for Alternative Approaches to Animal Testing), work to evolve the scientific assessment of chemicals, research new test methods and monitor the implementation of statutory regulations. Bayer actively accompanies these efforts in its association activities. We are also involved in the icca Long-Range Research Initiative, for example, and endorse the goals of the who
and e.u. action plans for improving health and environmental protection, for example with the further development of human biomonitoring through an alliance with the German Chemical Industry
Association (vci) and the German Federal Ministry of the Environment.
IMPLEMENTATION OF REGULATIONS AND VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS PERTAINING TO
CHEMICALS
Since 2007 we have operated in accordance with the European chemicals regulation reach (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals). It affects all our activities as a manufacturer, importer and user. To adequately address the scope and complexity of the reach requirements,
we have approved Group-wide and subgroup-specific regulations. The registration obligation under
reach applies irrespective of marketing activities for all substances that we produce or import in quantities of more than one metric ton.
online annex: 3-10-3
We observe the required registration phases for existing chemicals. The final registration phase will
end on June 1, 2018. Substances registered already during the first two phases are now being assessed by the component authorities. In the future this could result, for example, in additional testing
requirements, new risk management measures or inclusion in the authorization procedure.
A number of Bayer substances are also affected by the reach authorization procedure, which restricts
the use of particularly hazardous substances or can lead to their replacement or ban.
The authorities enforce the implementation of reach through regular inspections. So far none of the
inspections at Bayer has resulted in complaints. As we also use many products from other manufacturers, we maintain close contacts with our suppliers and ensure that they confirm conformity with reach
for these products.
The Bayer Group’s product stewardship target is to conclude the assessment of the hazard potential of
all substances used in quantities exceeding one metric ton per annum by 2020. In this way we exceed
statutory requirements and are ensuring that substance assessments comparable to those established
under reach will also be applied at Bayer sites that are not subject to this European regulation. The
procedure for the implementation of this target is established in our Bayer Group Regulation “Substance Information and Availability.”
At the same time, we are implementing the Globally Harmonized System (ghs) for the classification and
labeling of chemicals, which came into force in the European Union (e.u.) in 2009. The purpose of this
regulation is to achieve a globally standardized system for classifying chemicals and labeling them
appropriately on packaging and in material safety data sheets.
We also support the Global Product Strategy (gps), a voluntary commitment by the chemical industry
initiated by the International Council of Chemical Associations (icca). Its objective is to improve
knowledge about chemical products, especially in emerging and developing countries, and thus increase safety in the handling of these products. The icca has established an information portal through
which summarized details on products (gps Safety Summaries) are made available. gps is of particular
relevance for MaterialScience.

10. Product Stewardship

In accordance with the respective product safety and information obligations, all subgroups compile
product information, whether on raw materials, intermediates or end products. To ensure worldwide
access to this information, our subgroups use appropriate it systems, including ones for product
labeling.
PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP IN THE USE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY
The product development departments in our Pharmaceuticals and Crop Protection businesses make
use of biotechnological methods. Biotechnology has already gained significant importance in pharmaceutical product development. The HealthCare products Betaferon™ / Betaseron™, Kogenate™ and
Eylea™ are manufactured by a biotechnological process.
Plant biotechnology can help to improve crop yields, yield security and the stress tolerance of plants
through both genetic engineering and conventional breeding methods without the need for an increased input of resources.
Safety is Bayer’s top priority in the use of biotechnology, too. Beyond our observance of all relevant
legal provisions, we have formulated a Bayer Group Regulation “Position on the Responsible Use of
Gene Technology” and specific regulations for the subgroups and service companies.
online annex: 3-10-4
Before any product reaches market maturity, we subject it to a stringent approval procedure to determine whether it is safe for human health, animals and the environment.
HealthCare has established strict safety measures for handling biological agents in research, development and production in its “Biological Safety” regulation and its “Requirements for the safe handling of biological agents” procedure.
CropScience maintained its focus on product stewardship for customers both within and outside the
company through its activities in the context of the industry’s Excellence Through Stewardship Program. Product stewardship and quality management processes are the top priority in all activities
connected to plant biotechnology.
We provide our stakeholders with comprehensive, transparent and reliable information about our products and services in accordance with our Bayer Group Regulation “Responsible Marketing & Sales.”
FOCUSING ON ANIMAL WELFARE
Animal studies are legally required and essential from a scientific viewpoint to assess the effects of our
products, especially on people, but also on nature and the environment. During research into new active
pharmaceutical ingredients, they are only replaceable to a certain extent. In our handling of animals, we
respect all legal requirements pertaining to animal welfare. If animal studies are required to assess our
substances, Bayer respects the so-called 3Rs principle:
• replace: prior to each project, we check whether an approved method is available that does not rely
on animal studies and then apply it.
• reduce: in case no alternative method exists, only as many animals are used as are needed to achieve
scientifically meaningful results based on statutory requirements.
• refine: we make sure animal studies are performed in a way that minimizes suffering of animals.
This year for the first time, we are offering an internal 3r Award that rewards and publicizes within the
company special contributions to animal welfare.

www.animalstudies.

Our principles also apply to both the research institutes we commission and our suppliers, whose compliance with our animal welfare requirements we regularly monitor. The information provided in supplier self-evaluations is verified through on-site audits. Current figures and further information are available at our website.

Bayer’s Global Animal Welfare Committee monitors compliance with our principles on animal welfare
and animal studies within the Bayer Group and in external studies.
online annex: 3-10-5
Comprised of the animal welfare officers at our research sites and further Bayer experts, this committee has defined performance indicators. Each year we analyze the development of animal numbers, the distribution according to species, the burden placed on our test animals and the ratio of
regulatorily required studies to exploratory studies, and discuss possible steps in accordance with
the 3Rs principle. We are thus able to demonstrate that since 2005 the number of study animals used
per €1 million research budget (including animals in Bayer studies performed by contract research
organizations) has declined from around 96 animals to around 51 animals in 2013.
We have also established an internal database that combines all information about our own animal
studies and the evaluation of our cooperation partners and makes it available to all employees in this
area. All subgroups apply clear rules to ensure that animal welfare standards are comprehensively
observed by our partners.
Bayer also participates in several European consortia that aim to reduce the number of animal studies or improve their validity: we are active, for example, in the European Partnership for Alternative
Approaches to Animal Testing (epaa) and our HealthCare subgroup is involved in the leadership of
the eTOX project and the marcar project of the Innovative Medicines Initiative (imi). We participate
in the lri (Long-Range Research Initiative), which is currently pursuing projects connected with the
issue of “eye irritation.” In Germany, we support the Foundation for the Promotion of Alternate and
Complementary Methods to Reduce Animal Testing (set).
PROTECTION AGAINST PRODUCT COUNTERFEITING
Illegal trade with counterfeit medicines and crop protection products is on the rise worldwide. Counterfeit products harbor substantial risk for patients and consumers, and substandard quality also causes
considerable financial damage for producers and users.
Industry, associations, governmental agencies and non-governmental organizations must join together
to fight product counterfeiting. Bayer continuously advocates the strengthening and expansion of existing laws and provisions aimed at the identification and confiscation of illegal products. We undertake a
wide range of measures to inform our customers about both the danger posed by, and the insufficient
effectiveness of, counterfeit products.
online annex: 3-10-6
According to a report by the European Commission, counterfeit pharmaceuticals rank near the top of
the e.u.’s customs statistics. For example, the authorities confiscated around 3.7 million counterfeit
pharmaceutical products in 2013 – a five-fold increase compared with the previous year. In close cooperation with the authorities, Bayer works to protect the health of patients, customers and users.
The focus is on raising awareness and providing information to ensure the reliable identification of
our original products, as well as on legal steps aimed at minimizing illegal trade.
Through the internet platform “Beware of Counterfeits,” HealthCare informs patients about the risks
of counterfeit pharmaceuticals and provides patients with tips on how they can protect themselves.
Bayer participates in the Pharmaceutical Industry Initiative to Combat Crime (piicc) of Interpol to
counteract pharmaceutical counterfeiting through global prosecution and the elimination of related
criminal networks.
We also support the establishment of a pan-European system for the verification of pharmaceutical
packaging that satisfies the requirements of the e.u. Falsified Medicine Directive. We participate in
the SecurPharm project in Germany.
According to the most recent estimate by Europol, illegal products account for more than 10% of the
crop protection market and 25% in some e.u. member states. CropScience provides information,
training materials and services (manuals, workshops, chemical analysis, etc.) to dealers, farmers and

authorities to ensure that counterfeit products can be accurately identified and combated. In 2014
training courses were conducted, for example, in China and in e.u. countries in which Bayer warned
of the dangers of product counterfeiting and explained options for better combating it. In this connection, we also support initiatives by global and regional association committees such as the AntiCounterfeiting Expert Group of the European Crop Protection Association (ecpa) and the AntiCounterfeiting Steering Committee of the industry association CropLife International (cli). One example is the training of national industry associations at the European Association Network AntiCounterfeiting Forum.
CropScience works together intensively with national and international authorities. This frequently
enables the confiscation of counterfeit products, as was the case again in 2014 due to the company’s
clear support for the European authorities in the investigation of criminal networks. CropScience
works together with shipping companies and European ports of entry to prevent the transport of
counterfeit products by more closely inspecting freight and customers, among other measures. Most
counterfeit products originate in Asia and reach Europe through European cargo ports. With our
support, substantial quantities of illegal products were confiscated by the port authorities again in
2014. CropScience also carries out its own inspections of suspicious goods shipments. We have registered noticeable progress in our longstanding active efforts to combat illegal parallel trade (for example in Germany). Far fewer illegal parallel trade product samples were found in 2014 than in 2013.
Legal steps were successfully initiated here as well.
HEALTHCARE
BENEFIT-RISK MANAGEMENT FOR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS AND MEDICAL DEVICES
HealthCare continuously assesses the medical benefit-risk balance of its medicinal products and medical devices throughout their entire life cycle. For this process, experts from various disciplines form
cross-functional Safety Management Teams (smts). These teams jointly evaluate the available benefit
and risk data along with other relevant information on the product in order to identify possible safety
risks at an early stage and assess the medical benefit-risk balance. The evaluation also makes use of
external databases so as to ensure as broad a base of data as possible. Should significant risks be identified, HealthCare immediately takes measures to minimize them, such as updating the product information for patients and physicians.
online annex: 3-10-bhc-1
Further tools in risk minimization programs can include targeted information, e.g. patient education
brochures, and training measures for physicians and patients. smts compile medical benefit-risk data
and information and produce detailed safety risk management plans. These plans are updated as
soon as relevant new benefit-risk data become available. Implementation of risk minimization activities is coordinated by local smts in the country organizations.
The Global Pharmacovigilance unit of HealthCare pools safety-relevant information on our products in
the company’s own global pharmacovigilance database on an ongoing basis. This information is continuously updated and evaluated by experts. In this process, Bayer works closely with the responsible
regulatory and supervisory authorities at the international, national and regional levels. These include
the u.s. Food and Drug Administration (fda), the European Medicines Agency (ema) and Germany’s
Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM).
HealthCare’s quality and risk management functions make further contributions to increased safety.
We examine external and internal quality assurance requirements for our products through systematic
internal inspections – not just in research and development, but also in production. These inspections
also cover institutes sub-contracted by us and our suppliers. Through our safety risk management system, drug product risks are systematically identified and assessed, and the necessary steps initiated.
Countries and regions receive continuous support to help them comply with regulatory requirements for
pharmaceuticals.

Scientific publications by our researchers satisfy recognized international standards that we have committed ourselves to observe in our Good Publication Policy. We base the implementation of all clinical
studies on the Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the World Health Organization (who) and on the
guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization (ich). We disclose the methods and results
of clinical trials.
ANALYSIS OF PHARMACEUTICAL TRACE AMOUNTS IN THE ENVIRONMENT
Active pharmaceutical ingredients can enter the environment through human excreta or livestock
excrement, improper disposal by users or residues in wastewater from pharmaceutical production.
Measurements carried out by authorities and scientific institutes have revealed that the concentration
of individual active pharmaceutical ingredients from human or veterinary medicines present in drinking
water is lower than the level that would have pharmacological effects in humans. On the basis of our
current knowledge, the presence of individual active pharmaceutical ingredients in bodies of water or
drinking water does not pose any risk to humans. This is also confirmed by the most recent who Report
on Pharmaceuticals in Drinking Water.
To assess the potential environmental impact of our pharmaceutical products, HealthCare carries out
ecotoxicological investigations of the environmental behavior of trace amounts and degradation products.
When submitting dossiers to European regulatory authorities for both veterinary and human pharmaceuticals, an environmental assessment is required that is published in the European public assessment
reports (epar). The u.s. Food and Drug Administration (fda) also requires the submission of an environmental compatibility assessment. It must be demonstrated during the approval procedure that no
significant risk exists for the environment when the drug products are used correctly.
Internal company wastewater threshold values ensure that no risk to the environment results from the
release of traces of active ingredients in wastewater from production sites. All HealthCare production
sites worldwide are evaluated with regard to these threshold values. Site-specific measures aimed at a
further reduction are proposed should it not be possible to observe these standards over the long term.
Additional active ingredient-specific retention measures are applied in addition to biological treatment
in water treatment facilities.
HealthCare maintains regular contact with various stakeholder groups with regard to these issues.
online annex: 3-10-bhc-2
HealthCare has committed itself to continue developing its strategy for dealing with pharmaceutical
residues in the environment. At the scientific level, HealthCare participates in projects aimed at further researching pharmaceutical residues in the environment and introducing targeted measures.
Bayer is represented on the Scientific Advisory Board of noPILLS, the e.u.-sponsored project to
reduce pharmaceutical trace amounts in water. The project studies the question of whether and to
what extent strategies can be successful that are applied at the source – in other words at the point
where residues enter water – rather than at the wastewater treatment stage. The city of Dülmen,
Germany, has been selected as a model for more closely studying such pathways. The preceding
project – pills – had come to the conclusion that although the content of active ingredients in
wastewater can be reduced through the establishment of treatment facilities in hospitals that employ
special water purification technology, such technology would still result in substantial costs. Building
on the pills project, noPILLS now expands the focus to pharmaceutical residues in wastewater
overall and the change in consumer behavior in test regions, for example as regards the disposal of
expired drug products. In 2014 HealthCare advised two of the project partners in the preparation of a
campaign to collect iodinated X-ray contrast media in hospitals.
In Germany, HealthCare participates in the “Risk Management of Emerging Compounds and Pathogens in the Water Cycle” (RiSKWa) initiative sponsored by the German Ministry for Education and
Research. HealthCare is a member of the steering committee.

SAFETY AND QUALITY STANDARDS AT ANIMAL HEALTH
In line with the statutory requirements, strict quality standards apply to all Animal Health product classes. Safety and quality standards comparable to those governing human medicine apply for veterinary
pharmaceuticals such as parasiticides, dewormers (anthelmintics) or antibiotics. Within the scope of the
approval procedures, Animal Health carries out studies in order to ensure the quality, efficacy and safety
of its products, as well as minimize the environmental impact of the products’ use.
We partner with veterinarians, farmers and private users to promote the responsible use of our products. The prudent use of antibiotics is especially important for public health. For this reason, we have
established clear guidelines for the use of fluoroquinolones. In this context, we also support the European Platform for the Responsible Use of Medicines in Animals, which brings together various partner
organizations from politics, industry and society.
CROPSCIENCE
Safety is also the top priority with products from CropScience. We analyze already prior to the development of a product whether the envisaged solution is compatible with our sustainability approach.
During the development phase, we examine the products in stringent tests that are monitored by the
authorities. At issue here are an active ingredient’s toxicological properties on the one hand and on the
other hand the question of how significant the remaining trace amount of a crop protection product is
following proper application to the plants. Before a product is introduced to the market, we conduct
numerous further safety tests with regard to its use and environmental behavior, depending on the
product area.
CropScience allowed the sale of all remaining who Class i insecticide formulations for leaf and soil
applications and seed treatments to expire at the end of 2012. All insecticides affected were replaced by
modern, targeted and more environmentally friendly formulations.
CropScience observes the International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides of the
United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (fao). The principles of this code cover the entire life
cycle of a product, from its development to its application and beyond. We implement all major aspects
of responsible product handling in our Product Stewardship Program, which is based on the principles
of our Product Stewardship Policy.
online annex: 3-10-bcs-1
Even beyond its core business, CropScience participates specifically in projects aimed at increased
product stewardship. We are a member of the Better Sugarcane Initiative, which works to promote
sustainable sugarcane cultivation in Brazil, and the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification
organization, which is working to establish a system for certifying biomass and bioenergy. We also
take part in the Round Table for Responsible Soy, which works to promote sustainable soybean production, as well as in the Round Table for Sustainable Palm Oil Production.
RESPONSIBILITY FOR CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS
The application of crop protection products requires the greatest possible care. Supporting our customers and partners in the proper and safe handling of the products is therefore a focus of product stewardship at CropScience. We address farmers and dealers particularly through numerous programs worldwide. Targeted workshops are aimed at enabling effective application of our products and ensuring the
safety of users, the environment and consumers. Furthermore, we provide our customers with guidelines explaining the safe use, storage and disposal of all of our products.

online annex: 3-10-bcs-2
Our training activities focused on the Asia and Latin America regions again in 2014. In India, for example, CropScience has trained more than 32,000 farmers in good agricultural practice. They learn
how they can enhance the growth of their produce, use crop protection products effectively and safely,
and thus increase the quality of the goods they produce. Furthermore, they are also shown new ways
of marketing their products, which particularly help smallholders gain increased profit from them.
Promoting agricultural development is often a more effective way to fight hunger and poverty than
other forms of support. Higher incomes in turn enable farmers to improve their standard of living
and invest more in their children’s education and their own businesses. Value is created for society
as a result of the increased production of high-quality food. With the help of these measures, we contribute to the sustainable development of agriculture.
In Latin America, we combined all our activities dealing with product safety measures within our
AgroVida program. This comprises various initiatives with which we have been continuously increasing the farmers’ safety awareness and specialist expertise since the 1990s. Safety training offerings for
farmers play a role here, for example. In 2014 we trained almost 25,000 farmers in the Andean region
and approximately 24,000 farmers in the Central America and Caribbean region (excluding Mexico),
for instance. We also carried out safety training measures in numerous African countries in 2014.
In the area of water pollution control, we offer customers a biological purification system
(Phytobac™). This is intended to prevent the discontinuous discharge of crop protection active ingredients in the disposal of residual liquids that are generated during the filling and cleaning of spraying
devices. In Europe, there are already approximately 3,000 Phytobac™ facilities. The system was introduced in China in 2014.
We also make the online tool “DressCode” available for determining the optimal protective clothing
for the handling of our crop protection products – e.g. in the mixing and application of the products
and the cleaning of spraying equipment.
Our product stewardship measures also include internal employee training measures. Our aforementioned Product Stewardship Policy also provides information on all principles for the responsible
handling of our products, combined with specific instructions for use for our employees and those
who work with our products.
BEE HEALTH AND CROP PROTECTION
Products to protect crops and keep them healthy are necessary to safeguard harvests and thus guarantee the supply of nutrition for a growing world population both now and in the future. At the same time,
it is essential to protect pollinators of plants that contribute to a wide variety of foods. The debate surrounding the use of certain neonicotinoid crop protection products and the subjective assessment of
their impact on bee health has had an effect at the political level. As a result, the European Commission
has suspended the use of a number of products in this active ingredient class for certain applications in
Europe. Bayer considers the decision by the European Commission to be scientifically unjustified and
legally flawed. The active ingredients in question were extensively examined with regard to their impact
on bee health already during the approval procedure. Bayer has appealed the decision by the European
Commission in order to ensure legal certainty for approval procedures. A decision is not yet available.
Through its Bee Care Program, Bayer continues to work on behalf of bee health and the responsible use
of crop protection products. The company invests in research to minimize the effects of crop protection
products on honey bees.

With our worldwide Bee Care Program, we aim to promote a better understanding of the many factors that can impact bee health. This program included the construction of the first Bayer Bee Care
Center at the site of CropScience and HealthCare’s Animal Health Division in Monheim, Germany.
CropScience’s center in Monheim combines Bayer’s extensive knowledge and expertise in bee
health under one roof. It also serves as a platform for dialogue with stakeholders who share our interest in promoting bee health worldwide. A second Bayer Bee Care Center opened in 2014 that
deals specifically with bee health issues in North America. This center is located at the u.s. headquarters of CropScience at Research Triangle Park near Raleigh, North Carolina, United States, and
brings together important technological, scientific and academic resources.
There is broad consensus among scientists who work in the area of bee health that the difficult-tocombat Varroa mite presents the main risk to bee health, partly because this parasite can transmit
numerous viral diseases to bees. The Animal Health Division of HealthCare is working with numerous researchers in Europe and the United States to develop the Varroa gate – an innovative way to
control Varroa mites that is intended to keep this parasite from infesting beehives. However, another
important factor that can impact bee health is generally more intensive agriculture in some regions,
which limits suitable food sources for bees and wild bees and also breeding places. Bayer is active
here as well, supporting the establishment of flowered areas and studying biodiversity promotion
measures on agricultural land that are designed to benefit pollinators.
Also important to us are product stewardship measures associated with the use of our crop protection products to improve their bee-friendly application. These initiatives include: a conveyor technology in the United States for sowing machines that reduces friction and thus promotes the even flow
of seed; the additional labeling of seed sacks; two technologies developed in Europe to treat waste
air during sowing; and even more stringent quality control standards for seed dressing.
We have also launched an extensive bee monitoring program that is being implemented in five European countries (France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Hungary and Poland). The tests are carried
out on winter oilseed rape, a crop that is very attractive for bees and that was treated with neonicotinoid seed dressings until the restrictions went into effect in the e.u. Monitoring activities can be
undertaken despite these restrictions, as Bayer has received special exemptions for the aforementioned studies. The monitoring includes a scientific study led by an independent research institute
that will be implemented at various sites in the above countries and that began with the sowing of
winter oilseed rape in the summer of 2014. In addition, a network of agricultural demonstration facilities has been established in the same countries to illustrate these activities, which are targeted to
last for two to three years.
Bayer is convinced that neonicotinoids are safe for bees if they are used responsibly and properly.
Our view is supported by the analysis of monitoring studies that were carried out by independent institutes in addition to the studies generated in extensive approval procedures. The current findings
and many years of safe application of these products in agricultural practice confirm the results of
the risk assessments performed by the regulatory authorities in numerous countries around the
world on neonicotinoid seed dressings. These results state that the products are harmless to bee colonies provided they are used according to the product information. The above additional monitoring
study has been initiated independently of the numerous scientific studies that confirm the safety of
neonicotinoids.

MATERIALSCIENCE
The products of MaterialScience satisfy the most stringent of safety requirements. This applies not just
to those substances subject to standard review in accordance with the European reach Regulation.
Within the context of the voluntary Global Product Strategy (gps) of the chemical industry, we also
assess the substances we use and reduce potential health and environmental risks that could result from
our chemicals. The product safety assessments apply to the entire life cycle of a product – from research
and procurement through production and logistics to application, disposal and recycling. Our product
stewardship does not just end with our company, but also includes suppliers, customers and partners.
gps is accessible at MaterialScience through the “Product Safety First” internet portal, and is available
worldwide in seven languages. Through this website, we inform customers and other interest groups
about our activities and product safety assessments.
online annex: 3-10-bms-1
A product safety assessment at MaterialScience takes place in several steps: first, chemicals that are
subject to statutory regulations are identified and the corresponding rules compiled. We then examine their risk potential so as to provide a basis for the effective minimization of risks. Such steps can
include proposals for technical measures such as protective clothing, or marketing restrictions. Finally, we produce the legally required material safety data sheets, technical information sheets and labeling for the chemicals.
For especially important products such as mdi, tdi, polycarbonate and polyether, MaterialScience additionally works with associations to draw up environmental product declarations and eco-balances certified according to iso 14040 and 14044 and based on industry averages.
With regard to substances that come into direct contact with food, MaterialScience is following the
scientific discussion about the chemical bisphenol a (bpa), a feedstock for various plastics. Critics are
concerned that health risks could result for users if traces of bpa are released from polymers. As documented by numerous scientifically valid studies, we are convinced that bpa can be safely used in its
existing areas of application. This assessment is consistent with evaluations by the authorities responsible for food safety in Europe, the United States, Australia, Japan and other countries. In cooperation
with the PlasticsEurope association, we work to make the discussion more objective based on scientific
analysis.

11. Safety
Safety management and the continuous development of safety culture are a cornerstone of corporate
responsibility in the Bayer Group. All injuries and incidents we record are analyzed and evaluated in
detail to enable adequate measures to be introduced to avoid them in the future. Preventing accidents
and incidents in day-to-day work, when operating production facilities, and on work-related travel and
transportation routes where people or the environment could suffer harm or damage has top priority
for us. Responsibility for health, safety, environmental protection and quality (hseq) is thus directly
assumed by the Group Board of Management. Our hseq activities are geared toward ensuring the occupational health and safety of employees, contractors and suppliers on our company premises and under
the supervision of Bayer, and the smooth and safe operation of our facilities. In this way, we also reduce
running costs by avoiding damage as well as work and production disruptions.
At the Group level, responsibilities and framework conditions for hseq are regulated through appropriate directives. Operational responsibility lies with the boards of management / executive boards of the
respective subgroups and service companies and the corresponding line organizations, who have their
own management systems, committees and working groups to steer hseq. Continuous review and revision of directives and regular internal audits ensure our hseq management systems at all sites meet the
specific requirements in each case.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY
The rate of occupational injuries with lost workdays at Bayer has been decreasing for several years. In
2014 intensive training and awareness-raising once again helped enable the Bayer subgroups and service companies to report a reduction in injury figures.
Group target 2020:
reduction of 35% in
occupational safety
incident rate
See also Chapter
1.3 for Group
targets

We record all injuries to Bayer employees requiring medical treatment that goes beyond simple first aid.
These are indicated by the Recordable Incident Rate (rir), which includes both injuries with lost workdays and those without. In 2014 this rate dropped to 0.43 cases per 200,000 hours worked (2013: 0.47)
throughout the Group, corresponding to 534 occupational injuries worldwide. This means that, in statistical terms, one recordable incident occurred for around every 465,000 hours worked.
The rate of recordable occupational injuries with lost workdays (ltrir, Lost Time Recordable Incident
Rate) also fell. In 2014 it stood at 0.22 (2013: 0.26).
Unfortunately, there were four fatalities in work-related accidents in 2014, three of which concerned
Bayer employees and one a contractor employee. One employee was killed in switching work in Wesseling, Germany. In La Tupia, Colombia, a tank wagon caught fire while gasoline was being transferred.
Four workers sustained burns of varying degrees. The Bayer employee’s burns were so severe that he
died. A comprehensive root cause analysis was performed. Prevention and improvement measures were
introduced. A third employee died in Brazil in a traffic accident, as did a contractor employee in Sanchor, India.

11. Safety

Since 2012 workplace-related illnesses have additionally been recorded separately from legally listed
recognized occupational diseases and are included in the ltrir parameter. In 2014 there were 11 cases
attributable to work-related factors recorded throughout the Group. We report such cases when they
have been diagnosed and officially recognized by a medical officer.
As in previous years, we hardly recorded any sector-typical accidents involving contact with chemicals
in 2014. The absolute number of injuries declined further. A significant proportion of our work-related
accidents and injuries relate to behavior-linked errors. In 2014 we therefore placed the topic at the heart
of numerous programs and training courses under the umbrella term “Behavioral Safety.” In 2014 behavioral safety was therefore also the focus of our annual global Safety Day.
online annex: 3-11-2
The Behavioral Safety (bs) initiative was adopted at the start of 2014 by the Bayer Safety Council
headed up by the Chairman of the Board of Management. The initiative focuses on the human factor
and the safety-conscious behavior of employees. Behavioral Safety involves identifying and preventing unsafe working methods and reinforcing and consolidating safe working methods at all levels.
This approach is by no means limited to production plants, but is also intended to cover areas of
work such as Research & Development, Marketing & Sales and Administration. In 2014 bs pilot projects were initiated by the subgroups at various locations around the world or were already being implemented. HealthCare has placed emphasis on sales, while CropScience and MaterialScience focus
more on production and administrative areas.
Our campaigns on traffic safety and preventing accidents caused by tripping, slipping and falling
were continued in 2014 by the subgroups with country-specific accident prevention measures.
PROCESS AND PLANT SAFETY
Through the Group-wide Top Performance in Process and Plant Safety (topps) initiative, Bayer is continuously working to improve the safety culture and corresponding standards in plants and laboratories
and to optimize safety technology. The corresponding Bayer Group Regulation “Process and Plant Safety” specifies uniform procedures and standards. The methods and criteria for identifying and assessing
the risks posed to people and the environment by plants and processes underwent further development
and were globally standardized.
online annex: 3-11-3
A key measure from the topps initiative is the intensive training of all Bayer employees who are able
to influence process and plant safety in their work environment. This involves approximately 26,000
production and engineering employees around the world who receive regular training in compulsory
seminars tailored to their areas of activity. Both traditional and web-based training was devised for
craftsmen and chemical technicians in the production facilities. To ensure the standard achieved is
maintained in the long term, we have firmly established the process and plant safety training program in the subgroups’ hseq management systems.
A globally standardized kpi for plant safety incidents, Loss of Primary Containment (LoPC), applies to all
Bayer plants and is integrated into Group-wide safety reporting. LoPC refers, for example, to chemicals
in amounts above defined thresholds leaking from their primary container, such as pipelines, pumps,
tanks or drums, and is thus an indicator of incidents in production facilities. We use the LoPC Incident
Rate (LoPC-IR) to determine the number of LoPC incidents per 200,000 working hours in areas relevant
to plant safety. In 2014 this was 0.23 (2013: 0.35).

Group target 2020:

The causes of every reported incident are carefully analyzed. The results of the cause analysis are
published Group-wide to improve employees’ safety awareness. The reporting threshold is set so low
that even material and energy leaks that have no impact on employees, members of the surrounding
communities or the environment are systematically recorded and reported. This approach is in line
with our commitment to maintaining the integrity of our facilities at all times. As expected, the evaluations from the first few years have indicated areas where there is room for further improvement in
the safety of existing facilities. The introduction of both this parameter and the globally established
training program mentioned above is helping us to raise awareness of the significance of minor leaks
and releases.
An example of the systematic, global optimization of our safety programs is the CropScience project
for global standardization of safety measures to prevent fire, explosions, leaks and spills.
The Bayer Group’s competence center for process and plant safety, together with the Group hseq Platform for Process and Plant Safety, is managed by Technology Services. This comprises three regional
competence centers, which are located in Leverkusen, Germany; Shanghai, China; and a combined
center at the Baytown and Kansas City sites in the United States.
online annex: 3-11-5
We participate in international working groups of the International Council of Chemical Associations
and the American Petroleum Institute that focus on developing a global reporting standard for key
performance indicators in plant safety. We also are involved in an intensive sharing of experiences in
this area at an industrial level.
TRANSPORTATION SAFETY
Transportation safety has a very high priority within the Bayer safety culture. The relevant Bayer Group
directive specifies procedures that ensure all transported materials are handled in line with applicable
regulations and their hazard potential. Logistics service providers are selected following a defined procedure, and their fulfillment of safety and quality standards is assessed regularly. Under the directive,
people responsible for implementation are appointed in every organizational unit concerned.
In 2014 the Group-wide Transportation Safety Platform focused, for example, on regulations management, sustainable training tools for transportation safety, reviewing internal procedures and evaluating
and selecting our logistics service providers. These topics are documented in appropriate hseq targets.
In addition, as part of our Responsible Care activities, transportation safety instructions are also being
drawn up for non-hazardous materials, and transportation risk analyses carried out for the transportation of hazardous materials that go beyond what is required under transportation legislation. To support
knowledge sharing within the Group, a Global Transportation Safety Symposium was held for the first
time in 2014 with 160 participants from 20 countries.
The transportation safety management of the subgroups is part of the audit system of the Bayer Group
specified in the Bayer Group Regulation “Health, Safety, Environment and Quality (hseq) Audits.”

We classify critical incidents during the transportation of our products as transport incidents. These
include accidents that cause personal injury, significant damage to property, environmental impact
through the release of substances, or leakage of hazardous materials. We record transport incidents
using defined criteria. Assessment is based on the leaked load, graded according to the volume and
hazardous material class, personal injury and blocked transportation routes. We take into account both
our own chemical transport movements and those we commission and pay third parties to perform on
our behalf.
In total, well over one million transport movements took place in 2014. Despite extensive safety precautions and training activities, it is unfortunately impossible to prevent transport incidents from occurring
altogether. We analyze and evaluate all incidents carefully so that adequate steps can be taken to prevent a recurrence. The number of transport incidents increased from 11 to 12 in the reporting period.

12. Environmental Protection
Bayer takes its responsibility to protect the environment very seriously. It is constantly working to reduce environmental impact and find innovative product solutions that benefit the environment. Our
environmental standards apply worldwide.
Eco-efficient processes help cut the costs associated with materials, energy, emissions and disposal.
After all, an efficient approach to raw materials and energy is now more than ever an economic imperative, too. Ever increasing costs oblige us to take measures to improve resource and energy efficiency
that relieve the strain on the environment while also cutting costs.
Our commitment to environmental protection, health and safety extends beyond the scope of legal
requirements. It includes factoring in environmental aspects in a particular way and performing a voluntary ecological assessment for capital expenditure projects exceeding €10 million, for example. In the
case of acquisitions we examine prior to the transaction whether the applicable environmental and
occupational safety regulations and fundamental employee rights are complied with at the production
sites in question.
We are committed to the chemical industry’s Responsible Care™ initiative and have set out the basic
principles of this commitment in our Bayer Sustainable Development Policy. Certified hseq management systems control its operational implementation.

12.1 Energy Consumption
Energy and material consumption and emission levels are essentially dependent on the manufactured
sales volume, which does not include intermediates.
In 2014 Bayer’s manufactured sales volume rose by 2.7%. Total energy consumption in the Group also
rose, namely by 5.5% to 85.3 petajoules. We differentiate between primary energy consumption at our
sites – mainly of fossil fuels for our own generation of electricity and steam – and secondary energy
consumption that reflects the purchase of electricity, steam and refrigeration energy and the use of
process heat. Primary energy consumption fell by 4.2%, while secondary energy consumption rose by
19.5%. Volumes of natural gas and crude oil used as energy sources were up on the previous year but
considerably less coal, waste and other primary energy sources (e.g. hydrogen) were used in our own
in-house energy generation processes. In the case of secondary energy sources, the use of steam has
risen significantly. Consumption of electricity and process heat was also above the prior-year level (see
Table 3.12.1).
The rise in total energy consumption (primary and secondary energy sources) is mainly caused by increased production activities and the resulting growth in manufactured sales volume. This development
could be observed in particular at the Baytown site in the United States. However, the inclusion for the
first time of the energy-intensive MaterialScience site in Maasvlakte, Netherlands, in our environmental
reporting in 2014 also had a major effect. It was included in the scope of consolidation in 2013 and
retroactively for 2012. This site alone is responsible for 4.8% of the Group’s energy consumption. Production in Maasvlakte is exclusively of intermediates, which according to our definition are not included
in the manufactured sales volume. The energy necessary for their manufacture is included in full in the
total energy consumption, however. Without this special factor the trend away from a correlation between manufactured sales volume and energy consumption already identified in previous years would
have still been recognizable.

4 Energy efficency: quotient of total energy consumption and manufactured sales volume. For MaterialScience, this does not include either the

Bayer utilizes primary energy as efficiently as possible and applies combined heat and power processes
in more than 90% of its energy generation. The electricity and heat generated are used in our own
production facilities and third-party facilities (especially of Lanxess Deutschland GmbH as the other
shareholder of our service company Currenta). The (secondary) energy purchased via us is also used at
third-party production facilities. Furthermore, we purchase electricity on the market – through electricity exchanges, for example. The proportion of renewable energies is determined by the energy mix of
our energy suppliers. We comment in detail on these issues in the cdp (previously Carbon Disclosure
Project) Report.

12.2 Air Emissions
At Bayer, air emissions are caused mainly by the generation and consumption of energy. Our commitment to greater energy efficiency helps reduce both costs and emissions. In addition, we aim to contribute to climate protection on several levels and have established a Group-wide Climate Program for
this purpose.
CLIMATE PROGRAM
For some years, we have been working through our Climate Program to improve resource and energy
efficiency, one objective being to reduce greenhouse gas emissions during production operations. We
also offer market solutions aimed at protecting the climate and adapting to climate change.

10% improvement in
energy efficiency
See also Chapter
1.3 for Group
targets

Group target:
MaterialScience –
improvement in
production process
technology to achieve
better energy
efficiency

As part of our package of targets for the Group, we slightly increased the existing emissions reduction
target in 2013 and additionally formulated an energy efficiency target. According to this, between 2012
and 2020, Bayer intends to cut its specific greenhouse gas emissions by 20% and improve its energy
efficiency by 10%. 2012 was taken as the base year for both targets. Specific greenhouse gas emissions
amounted to 1.02 metric tons of co2 equivalents per metric ton of sales product. Energy efficiency in
2014 was at 3.37 MWh per metric ton.
Alongside aiming to achieve the overall Group climate target, the Bayer Climate Program reflects a
commitment to three specific areas:
1. More efficient production: reducing emissions at Bayer’s own production facilities by increasing
energy efficiency and by developing and utilizing new, innovative technologies.
online annex: 3-12.2-1
The STRUCTese™ (Structured Efficiency System for Energy) energy management system has been
installed in 58 particularly energy-intensive MaterialScience plants in Europe, Asia and North America. This system, designed by Bayer itself, enables the individual energy consumption of the production plants to be optimally controlled and reduced by an average of a tenth. In 2014 the annual energy saving amounted to around 1.5 million MWh, while co2 emissions were cut by around 428,000
metric tons per annum. MaterialScience completed the introduction of STRUCTese™ in 2014. The
energy management system is also set to be used in other plants, too, however, including in the new
large-scale tdi (toluene diisocyanate) production plant in Dormagen, Germany.
Innovative production processes help reduce electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.
The use of oxygen depolarized cathode (odc) technology in chlorine production cuts electricity requirements, for example, by 30% compared with the standard process. This was revealed in a test
run at a demonstration plant with an annual capacity of 20,000 metric tons of chlorine. The plant has
been operating successfully at the Krefeld-Uerdingen site in Germany for almost four years. The process is marketed globally by MaterialScience and our development partner Thyssen Krupp Electrolysis. If odc technology were introduced throughout Germany’s chlorine industry, for example, it
would cut the country’s total electricity consumption by 1%.
A further process innovation is gas phase technology in the manufacture of the polyurethane precursor tdi. This technology uses up to 60% less energy and up to 80% less solvent. Among other locations, the process is used at the new tdi plant with an annual capacity of 300,000 metric tons that
went into operation at the Dormagen site in Germany at the end of 2014, at an investment cost of
€250 million.
Partially replacing crude oil with co2 in the production of plastics could help conserve resources. In
this process, polyol, another precursor required to make polyurethane, can also be manufactured
with the help of co2. MaterialScience has developed a process for this that is now market-ready and
is to be used commercially. In this connection, plans are in place to build a production line at the
Dormagen site in Germany that will manufacture co2-based polyols starting in 2016.
2. Market solutions: using Bayer products – particularly in the areas of building insulation, lightweight
construction and agriculture – to reduce customer emissions. Our products play their part in saving
energy and conserving resources in many different ways. They help customers reduce emissions and
provide them with solutions for adapting to climate change.
online annex: 3-12.2-2
Products and solutions from MaterialScience help conserve resources and save energy in a number
of key industries and areas of life, thereby also cutting emissions. Prime examples include lightweight construction in the automotive sector and the insulation of buildings and refrigeration equipment. For instance, a particularly fine-pored rigid polyurethane foam has been developed that can
bring about a further significant improvement in the insulating performance of refrigerators and
freezers. Reducing the size of the foam pores by up to 40% compared to conventional products lowers the thermal conductivity of the new material by as much as 10%.

» TABLE OF CONTENTS COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT
Bayer Annual Report 2014
Combined Management Report
12. Environmental Protection

MaterialScience has also demonstrated potential applications for polymers in the construction industry through its EcoCommercial Building Program. This Bayer-led global initiative involves numerous
industrial partnerships with leading construction companies that develop and provide product solutions for sustainable construction. Its primary goals are to reduce the energy requirements, emissions and life cycle costs of buildings and to increase user comfort. Reference buildings are used to
demonstrate the positive contribution of insulating materials to the energy balance of a building.
The transparent, high-performance plastic polycarbonate also paves the way for energy-efficient
market solutions supporting, for example, energy-saving led technology that can be used in the automotive industry and for innovative street lights. The latter consume up to 70% less energy than
conventional models.
Materials from MaterialScience also play a role in generating renewable energies. For example, in
the area of wind power the company has developed new polyurethane infusion resins for rotor blades
that outperform rotors based on the previously used epoxy resins in terms of production speed,
lightness and durability.
CropScience’s seed and crop protection strategy actively helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions per
yield. The Tabela program in Indonesia enables a reduction in water consumption of up to 20%
through the direct seeding of pregerminated rice. Owing to the minimization of anaerobic conditions
it is also possible to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gas methane by up to 30%. In this initiative, the subgroup is working with local partners to demonstrate just what can be achieved with the
help of a customized package comprising seeds and crop protection products. The benefits include
enhanced water efficiency, lower greenhouse gas emissions, higher rice yields and improved incomes for farmers.
More information about combating the growing threat of malaria resulting from climate change can
be found in Chapter 5 “Research, Development, Innovation,” in the CropScience section.
3. Supporting activities: reducing emissions in non-production areas – such as the vehicle fleet and it –
involving the workforce in the process.
online annex: 3-12.2-3
Bayer maintains a number of initiatives to cut emissions and costs in the Group’s non-production areas by saving energy and fuel. These include improvements in the global Group fleet of over 25,000
vehicles, and in information technology. A new reduction target was implemented in 2013 as part of
the Bayer EcoFleet initiative. Bayer plans to reduce its specific co2 emissions for new vehicles to
110 g/km by 2020. The average co2 emission level for the approximately 6,700 newly registered vehicles in 2014 was 148 g/km. Training in energy-saving driving will be added to the driving safety
training courses in 2015.
In the area of communication, Bayer is increasingly using energy-efficient workstation solutions with
integrated voice and video functions. Such it solutions reduce the number of business trips necessary and thus emission levels.
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
Bayer reports all Group greenhouse gas emissions in line with the requirements of the Greenhouse Gas
Protocol (ghg Protocol). Direct emissions from our own power plants, waste incineration plants and
production facilities (corresponding to Scope 1 of the ghg Protocol) are determined at all production
locations and relevant administrative sites.

12. Environmental Protection

The total volume of greenhouse gas emissions Group-wide climbed in 2014 by 4.2%. While direct emissions fell by 1.7%, indirect emissions rose by 9.7%. This increase is also primarily due to the inclusion
for the first time of the MaterialScience site in Maasvlakte, Netherlands, in the environmental reporting
of the Group.

3 Typically, CO in incineration processes accounts for over 99% of all greenhouse gas emissions. We therefore base our calculation of indirect
2
emissions on CO2 only.
4 Specific Group emissions are calculated from the total volume of direct and indirect emissions of the subgroups, including from the vehicle fleet,
divided by the manufactured sales volume of the three subgroups. Quantities attributable to the supply of energy to external companies are
deducted from the direct and indirect emissions. At MaterialScience the by-products sodium hydroxide solution and hydrochloric acid generated
during production are not included in the production volume, nor are trade products.
5 The manufactured sales volume includes all products sold in 2014, inclusive of secondary and trade products.

Owing to the inclusion for the first time of the Maasvlakte site, Netherlands, in our environmental reporting, specific greenhouse gas emissions for 2014 were up on the 2013 level, at 1.02 metric tons of
co2 equivalents per metric ton of sales product.
online annex: 3-12.2-4
Thanks to their environmentally friendly and resource-efficient combined heat and power technology, our power plants convert approximately 80% of the fuel energy used into electricity and heat.
Despite this, they cause a significant proportion of the Group’s direct greenhouse gas emissions.
It is important to note that, in line with the regulations of the ghg Protocol, we include in our energy
figures all greenhouse gas emissions from the conversion of primary energy sources into electricity,
steam or refrigeration energy, even though a significant proportion of direct emissions result from
the generation of energy that is supplied to third parties (other companies). Consequently, our
absolute figures for greenhouse gas emissions are higher than the actual emissions resulting from
Bayer’s business activities. The level of specific greenhouse gas emissions is a more meaningful statistic. This indicates only the greenhouse gas emissions for which Bayer is responsible in relation to
the manufactured sales volumes of the three Bayer subgroups; see Table 3.12.2-1 in the following
online annex.
The waste incineration plants operated by Currenta generate roughly 1 million metric tons of steam
per annum from the incineration of approximately 280,000 metric tons of hazardous waste. Compared to fossil fuel use, this reduces emissions by 200,000 metric tons of co2 per year.

Emissions from the Group’s vehicle fleet amounting to 0.1 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents have been recorded since 2013 but are not
assigned to specific subgroups. Instead, they are reported in the Group emissions under direct emissions (see Table 3.12.2 “Group
Greenhouse Gas Emissions”).
2 The significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions at MaterialScience to 5.67 million metric tons is due to the inclusion for the first time of
the propylene oxide production unit in Maasvlakte, Netherlands, in our environment reporting. This site alone is responsible for around
330,000 metric tons of CO2. Without the inclusion of Maasvlakte, specific emissions did not increase in 2014 but fell. Retrospective correction
of the yearly figures was abstained from in line with internal regulations.
3 Total greenhouse gas emissions for Technology Services and Business Services. These companies’ production facilities were incorporated
into other subgroups in 2012.
4 The emissions reported for Currenta are attributable to the provision of energy to external companies at the Chempark sites.
5 The by-products sodium hydroxide solution and hydrochloric acid generated during production are not included in the manufactured sales
volumes, nor are trade products.

The reporting of all relevant indirect Scope 3 emissions under the ghg Protocol is bindingly regulated
by the Corporate Value Chain Accounting & Reporting Standard. Following a thorough examination,
Bayer has identified nine essential Scope 3 categories, which we report on in detail in the cdp Report.
online annex: 3-12.2-6
As part of the cdp, we will again be publishing a detailed report for 2014 on these emissions that result from the value-added chain. We take particular account of those emissions where there is significant potential for reduction. These include our transport-related emissions resulting from business
trips.
In 2014 the Bayer Group was involved in European emissions trading with 19 plants in total. The greenhouse gas emissions of these plants amounted to approximately 2.29 million metric tons of co2 equivalents.
OTHER DIRECT EMISSIONS INTO THE AIR
Emissions of ozone depleting substances (ods) fell by 5.6%. Emissions of volatile organic compounds
excluding methane (vocs) decreased by 6.5%. The main source of both types of emissions remains the
CropScience site in Vapi, India, which accounts for 68.2% of voc emissions and 94.9% of ods emissions. The project initiated there three years ago to reduce these emissions continues to have an impact.
voc emissions have fallen by a further 9.5%, which is equivalent to 7.2% of the Group total. ods emissions there decreased by 3.4%. By 2016 at the latest, a central waste air treatment system will bring
together the many different sources of emissions in Vapi and significantly reduce these emissions.

12.3 Use of Water and Emissions into Water
The continuous availability of clean water in sufficient quantities is essential for supplying our production sites and the surrounding areas. However, this can no longer be taken for granted in many parts of
the world. We make sure we have all the water we need while also ensuring that industrial water usage
does not lead to local problems such as water scarcity for the people living in the area.
www.annualreport2014.bayer.
com/CDP-Water

Bayer supports the ceo Water Mandate of the u.n. Global Compact with the goal of working with key
stakeholders to develop sustainable strategies for water usage. Our cdp Water Disclosure reports on our
water usage and the associated risks.
online annex: 3-12.3-1
In the last few years, we have been actively involved in the ceo Water Mandate’s working group and
in drawing up the new version of the Corporate Water Disclosure Guidelines. The updated guidelines
were published in September 2014. We provide details of our commitment, the measures implemented and the results achieved within the Group in our annual cdp Water Disclosure response,
which represents a progress report for the ceo Water Mandate. In this survey initiated by the cdp, institutional investors call on more than 800 of the world’s biggest companies to disclose details of
their water management, their company-specific water footprint, and the opportunities and risks they
have identified in connection with the use of water. In addition, Bayer also took part in 2014 in a cdp
Water Disclosure pilot project to develop a standardized assessment and comparison method for
companies’ water stewardship.

Group target 2017:
establishment of water
management at all
sites in water-scarce
areas
See also Chapter
1.3 for Group
targets

Based on our company’s Water Position and the analysis of environmental aspects in our existing Bayer
environmental management systems, we have established a program for the targeted and ongoing
improvement of our water-related operating procedures. This covers both the conservation and the
efficient use of resources. In 2013 we used the wbcsd (World Business Council for Sustainable Development) Global Water Tool™ to screen all of our environmentally relevant sites in terms of water
scarcity. As a result, we identified sites whose location in water-scarce areas exposes them to particular
risks in terms of water availability and quality. In line with our Group target, these sites are to establish
water management with local targets by 2017 (see also Chapter 1.3 “Targets and Performance Indicators”). The existing water management at over 80% of these sites have already been reviewed in 2014.
This review examined, for example, whether water-relevant strategies, objectives and initiatives and an

appropriate risk management system were already in place. On the basis of this review, individual steps
to improve water management will be agreed on with the sites in question. In addition, our three subgroups use specific systems and standards to address their own individual challenges in handling water.
online annex: 3-12.3-2
In its Water Protection Directive, HealthCare commits itself to responsible water usage. At the
Bergkamen site in Germany – Bayer’s largest production site for active pharmaceutical ingredients –
all wastewater produced on the site premises is treated in the central wastewater treatment plant
(zaba). Its state-of-the-art membrane technology retains all biomass from biological wastewater
treatment. The ultrafiltration cleans the water so effectively that it can be fed straight into the River
Lippe. Before treatment in the zaba, water containing high levels of solvents first goes through the
decentralized process water treatment plant. Solvent material is separated off, cleaned as far as possible and reused. Non-recyclable materials are incinerated. The facility considerably reduces the organic material content (toc load): approximately 96% of materials are filtered out in this way, before
the water goes to the zaba for processing. In addition, a rainwater collection, treatment and usage
project was completed in 2014 to reduce water consumption from other sources and achieve further
benefits.
CropScience is a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development’s Water Programme Leadership Group. At the site in Quart de Poblet, Spain, we conducted a pilot project for assessing the sustainable use of water and determining the potential for improvement as part of the
European Water Stewardship (ews) Programme. This assessment formed the basis for the certification in the ews water project achieved in 2014.
MaterialScience regulates the resource-friendly use of water in its hseq policy. This policy includes
a commitment to handle resources carefully. The company also feels it has a responsibility to continuously improve its contribution to environmental protection and energy efficiency. As part of its environmental management system, the Tarragona site has set itself various goals to reduce the discharge of emissions into water and the total water volume. The measures initiated to this end cover
the use of rainwater for the site cooling tower and the recycling of wastewater from the public treatment plant, for example.
WATER CONSUMPTION AND USAGE
In 2014 total water consumption in the Group fell by 3.1% to 349.8 million cubic meters. Major reductions were observed at the Chempark Dormagen site in Germany, and at the u.s. sites in South Charleston and Institute. As a result of the phased closure of the CropScience site in Institute, water consumption
there fell by a further 2.2 million cubic meters to 15.2 million cubic meters.
71.1% of all water used by Bayer is once-through cooling water. This water is only heated and does not
come into contact with products. It can be returned to the water cycle without further treatment in line
with the relevant official permits. The total volume of once-through cooling water was 248.7 million
cubic meters in 2014. In our production activities, we endeavor to use water several times and to recycle it. Water is currently recycled at 35 sites, e.g. in closed cooling cycles, or through the reuse of treated wastewater or the recirculation of steam condensates as process water. A total of around 12.8 million
cubic meters of water was reused in 2014.

WASTEWATER AND WASTEWATER DISCHARGES
The total volume of process wastewater rose by 6.1%. All wastewater is subject to strict monitoring and
analysis before it is discharged into disposal channels. Some 75.5% of Bayer’s process wastewater
worldwide was purified at wastewater treatment plants (Bayer or third-party facilities). Following careful
analysis, the remaining 24.5% was categorized as environmentally safe. Part of it contained nutrients and
was therefore used to water gardens and agricultural land, as in the previous year.

Our goal is to minimize emissions into wastewater. The amount of phosphates released into wastewater
fell by 12.6%. Total organic carbon emissions (toc) fell by 21.6%. This is primarily due to lower toc and
phosphate discharges at the CropScience site in Kansas City, United States. Maintenance and inspection
work at the wastewater treatment plant there was completed by the end of 2013, and a new wastewater
laboratory also began operations. This considerably improved the cleaning performance and wastewater
monitoring. HealthCare’s site in Berkeley, United States, was also able to reduce phosphate discharges
into wastewater in 2014 via the elimination rate of the local wastewater treatment plant.

We recorded an increase of 11.3% in the emission of nitrogen compounds into the wastewater in 2014.
This was primarily caused by increased production volumes at CropScience’s Dormagen site in Germany, but also by the situation at MaterialScience’s Baytown site in the United States, where the denitrification process did not work to an optimal level of effectiveness as a result of operational disturbances.

12.4 Waste and Recycling
Systematic waste management minimizes material consumption and disposal volumes. Safe disposal
channels with separation according to the type of waste and economically expedient recycling processes serve this purpose. Production fluctuations and building refurbishment / land remediation work also
influence waste volumes and recycling paths.
In 2014 the total volume of waste generated remained approximately at the prior-year level.

The increase in hazardous waste generated, especially at the German sites in Dormagen, Frankfurt and
Leverkusen, is essentially due to an increase in the production volume.
The volume of waste disposed of fell by 1.9%. Less waste was disposed of than in the previous year at
the HealthCare sites in Bergkamen and Kiel, both in Germany, as a result of the completion of building
work. At the CropScience site in Institute, United States, the volume of waste disposed of again fell
significantly in 2014 owing to progressive dismantling.

Bayer serves as a certified waste disposal plant operator at various sites. At these locations, Bayer disposes not only of its own waste but also
of waste from third parties (companies not belonging to the Bayer Group). For that reason the volume of waste disposed of differs slightly
from the volume of waste generated by Bayer.

RECYCLING
In addition to satisfying economic and environmental criteria, the recycling and treatment of our materials also has to comply with legal requirements. This results in restrictions, in particular in the areas of
pharmaceuticals and crop protection. Throughout the Group, we are developing opportunities for recycling within the framework of legal regulations.
In 2014 the volume of waste recycled was 260,519 metric tons. The proportion of recycled waste that
made up the total volume of waste disposed of thus rose by two percentage points to 29% compared
with the previous year. This resulted from the recycling of slag granules as a building material at the
Krefeld-Uerdingen site in Germany. Examples of recycling measures provide proof of Bayer’s commitment to recycling.
online annex: 3-12.4 2
At the Bergkamen site in Germany, HealthCare binds iodine released during the incineration of
waste from X-ray contrast medium production and processes it into an iodide solution that can be
marketed. This process enabled us to recover and recycle around 281 metric tons of iodine in 2014.
The Consumer Care site in Myerstown, United States, is continually working on achieving resourceefficient production. In 2014, for example, 73.5% of production waste (more than 2,500 metric tons)
was fed into the recycling process.
CropScience supports the drawing up of guidelines on the return of crop protection product packaging in collaboration with national and international industrial associations. The subgroup is also
globally committed to establishing efficient take-back systems with the corresponding reclamation
organizations. The international industrial organization for the crop protection industry (Crop Life
International) has established 35 take-back systems worldwide for empty crop protection product
packaging. In Germany, as part of the pamira system for the safe and environmentally friendly
disposal of crop protection and liquid fertilizer packaging, approximately 3,000 metric tons of packaging were accepted in 2014 for controlled, environmentally responsible, primarily mechanical
recycling.

» TABLE OF CONTENTS COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT
Bayer Annual Report 2014
Combined Management Report
12. Environmental Protection

MaterialScience’s sustainability strategy also covers the end-of-life product phase. This is implemented in product and plant recycling, production, and targeted involvement in initiatives.
For example, the subgroup supports the recycling of its plastic products and articles made from
them. In its own production operations, too, MaterialScience uses material recycled from plastic
waste. These kinds of high-quality secondary raw materials are used to manufacture certain grades
of engineering thermoplastics, such as a flame-retardant plastic compound for television set housings that is produced using 30% recyclate from old pet water bottles.
In 2014 the Global Sideline Business unit at MaterialScience continued to sell plants and tools that
are no longer in use on the open market, thus feeding them back into circulation. Approximately 135
tangible assets were sold to third parties worldwide in 2014. Furthermore, around 2,600 metric tons
of scrap metal were returned to the material cycle from plants in Germany alone. Metal scrap was also recycled at other MaterialScience sites.
The subgroup’s commitment to recycling also extends to intensive involvement in the committees of
associations such as PlasticsEurope and along the entire value added chain as a shareholder of bkv
GmbH, German industry’s competence platform for recycling plastic.
MaterialScience also continues to support PlasticsEurope’s “Zero Pellet Loss” initiative, with the
goal of developing measures to prevent the loss of plastic pellets on the way from production to the
finished article. After the successful launch of two pilot projects in German production areas, the
initiative was rolled out globally and transferred to the logistics processes.
The process developed by Currenta for the thermal treatment of composite materials is successfully
being used for the efficient recycling of lithium-ion batteries. Almost 1,500 metric tons of batteries
were treated in the rotary kiln in 2014. All combustible ingredients are destroyed and the heat released is harnessed to generate steam. This leaves the precious metals, which are then sent for recycling.
Using a new process for recycling polymer residues from plastics production at the Chempark Krefeld-Uerdingen site, Currenta is reducing waste volumes in one plant by 30% and thus also reducing
the volume of starting materials, since the recycled substances can be reused in production. Thanks
to other, conventional recycling measures, Currenta was able to return around 53,000 metric tons of
construction materials, fgd gypsum and slag, 27,800 metric tons of metals and 14,200 metric tons of
chemicals such as sulfuric acid or solvents to the material cycle in 2014.

12.5 Biodiversity
The Group-wide biodiversity position takes into account influences on biodiversity along the whole
value-added chain and the sustainable use of raw materials.
In this position, all subgroups commit themselves to the Convention on Biological Diversity. Under this
Convention, the industrialized nations entered into an undertaking to provide developing countries with
greater support in implementing international biodiversity goals.
online annex: 3-12.5-1
Great importance is also attached to the protection of biodiversity as part of the European Union’s reform of its Common Agricultural Policy in line with the Convention on Biological Diversity. CropScience supports a wide variety of activities to promote biodiversity in agriculture. A key part of this
is the optimal use of high-yield areas to cultivate food, feed and renewable raw materials. This must
be harmonized with the preservation and protection of natural resources by transforming less highyield areas into habitats for animals and plants. The company’s experience shows that cutting-edge
agriculture and the promotion of biodiversity are not mutually exclusive. For example, Bayer has for
many years been working successfully with farmers and experts from nature conservation associa-

139

140

Bayer Annual Report 2014
Combined Management Report
12. Environmental Protection

tions, business and academia. Together, the experts at Bayer develop and test measures for promoting biodiversity in agriculture, collect data and assess the changes in species diversity. The goal is to
integrate the measures expediently into the operational procedures used by the farmers.
To protect and encourage pollinating insects, several strips of flowers have been planted in front of
and on the grounds of the CropScience site in Monheim, Germany. Under the motto “Blühende
Wege” (Areas in bloom), CropScience also supports municipalities in Germany and Austria in turning
unused strips of grass into feeding areas for bees. In 2014 a total of 30 sites with a total area of
96,000 square meters were supported with special “bee meadow” seeds, and an expansion of the initiative is planned for 2015.
HealthCare also attaches great importance to maintaining biological diversity. As a member of the
Association of Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies, we support the association’s position on
the u.n. Convention on Biological Diversity. The HealthCare policy on biodiversity is implemented at
the subgroup’s sites. Among other factors, it takes into account that the subgroup concentrates on
the chemical synthesis of substances using state-of-the-art technologies in medicinal, combinatorial
and computational chemistry. Research into natural substances is not a focal point of our work, accounting for less than 5% of research activities. If such substances are used during research into
new pharmaceuticals, they are first checked with respect to the Convention on Biological Diversity.
The use of renewable raw materials still plays only a minor role at Bayer. We are using them more intensively when it makes technical, economic and ecological sense to do so.
online annex: 3-12.5-2
At HealthCare, some hormones are synthesized by way of certain sterols or phytosterols generated
as by-products of the manufacture of vegetable oils from soybeans, oilseed rape or sunflowers. Palm
oil or palm kernel oil is not used due to its low sterol content. We also purchase various steroids that
are manufactured from diosgenin. Today, this substance is usually obtained from yam grown in countries such as China. In the fermentation process, we also use raw materials such as water, glucose,
yeast, soybean starch, castor oil and corn steep water. Extracts of plant leaves (Centella asiatica) are
used in some Consumer Care products. This plant is widely found in Asia and is not an endangered
species. We also take great care with the cultivation and harvesting of the raw materials for manufacturing plant-based pharmaceuticals for holistic treatments. They are collected and cultivated in line
with the requirements of the gacp (Good Agricultural and Collection Practice) guidelines of the European Medicines Agency.
On the European market, CropScience offers a mild weed control product based on fatty acids derived from palm oil. As the production of palm oil is often associated with social and ecological problems, Bayer has joined the Round Table for Sustainable Palm Oil (rspo). This underscores our commitment to responsible materials procurement. Bayer purchases GreenPalm certificates, which support the production of sustainable palm oil.
MaterialScience is experimenting with the replacement of crude oil-based raw materials as part of
its innovation and cooperation projects. For example, the subgroup is testing a biotechnological process that is based on the conversion of biomass by microorganisms and can supply material for the
production of plastics.

A Group-wide directive on process and plant safety stipulates that new production sites must not be set
up in areas that are protected by statutory requirements of the countries concerned relating to natural
characteristics, biodiversity or other factors.
online annex: 3-12.5-3
In 2013 Bayer Real Estate, the Bayer Group’s real estate service provider, used its global site register
to compare the geographical coordinates of relevant production sites that currently apply against
those of internationally recognized protected areas (asean Heritage, Barcelona Convention, unescomab Biosphere Reserve, Wetlands and World Heritage Convention and Ramsar Convention). This
analysis showed that three of our sites lie less than three kilometers from protected areas. These are
Schorren van de Benenden Schelde, Belgium; the Wadden Sea of Lower Saxony, Germany; and
Blesbokspruit, South Africa. As part of the comparison, we checked water usage and discharge at the
company’s water-intensive sites so as to prevent significant extractions of water and wastewater discharges that could adversely affect the protected areas.

12.6 Environmental and Transport Incidents
Bayer uses the term “environmental incidents” to define incidents in the course of our business activities that result in the release of substances into the environment. Factors that determine whether there
is a reporting obligation include, in particular, the nature and quantity of the substance, the amount
of damage caused or any consequences for nearby residents. In accordance with our internal voluntary
commitment, we report any leakage of substances with a high hazard potential from a quantity of
100 kg upward.
Despite extensive safety precautions and training, it is unfortunately impossible to prevent environmental incidents altogether. In 2014 the number of environmental incidents fell from ten to four.

Standard practice at Bayer is to record every fatality reported to us relating to our business activities. A difference between the number of fatalities in Table 3.11.1 “Occupational
Injuries” and the above Table 3.12.8-5 may occur because for occupational injuries, by definition, we show only fatalities of Bayer and contractor employees who were under
immediate Bayer supervision.

12.7 International Standards and Certifications
To ensure high health, safety, environmental protection and quality (hseq) standards throughout the
Group, Bayer has established management systems that are aligned to acknowledged international
standards and are regularly evaluated and updated. They form an integral part of all our business processes. Regular upkeep of the management systems and appropriate training and certification also
demonstrate our commitment to the guidelines of the chemical industry’s Responsible Care Global
Charter.
With regard to the coverage of our business activities with hseq management systems based on energy
consumption, in 2014 around 94% of all our production sites featured an hse management system
audited by Bayer. 95% of our entire business activities were certified externally to at least one internationally recognized standard in 2014. As part of a Group-wide certification plan, it is planned to achieve
virtually complete coverage in both environmental and occupational safety management based on energy consumption by 2017. One hundred percent coverage is not feasible owing to changes in our site
portfolio, however.

We began introducing iso 50001 in 2012. This standard defines the requirements for introducing, maintaining and improving an energy management system. In this report, we are for the first time publishing
the coverage for the Group.
All subgroups also have industry-specific international quality management systems such as iso 9001,
iso 17025, iso 13485 or gmp (Good Manufacturing Practice). Group-wide, its coverage by certification is
over 98%. More information about quality management can be found in Chapter 8 “Procurement and
Production.”

13. Social Commitment
Throughout the world, Bayer actively supports charitable causes in the core fields of education and
science, health and social needs, and sports and culture. Through our corporate foundations – the Bayer
Science & Education Foundation and the Bayer Cares Foundation – we support cutting-edge research,
talented young people and sustainable educational and social projects. In line with our understanding of
Bayer as an innovation company, the Group and its foundations base their social commitment as well on
the potential that new approaches harbor to bring about change. Initiative and pioneering spirit are
therefore overarching funding criteria.
The Group provided €49 million for non-profit investment in the future well-being of society in 2014
(2013: €50 million).

The Foundation & Donations Management Department within the Corporate Office of Bayer AG is responsible for strategically aligning and coordinating our social commitment, as well as for monitoring
and reporting activities. The country companies bear responsibility for implementing a large number of
the initiatives.
online annex: 3-13-2
All project sponsoring is subject to the provisions of a Group-wide donation directive that establishes
a framework for its content-related and strategic alignment, as well as the proper handling of the
funds. We steer the selection of the projects through allocation guidelines comprising, among other
aspects, the indicators “social relevance” and “thematic proximity to the company’s fields of expertise.” In all activities, we focus on countries in which Bayer is represented and on areas that are of
relevance to the Group’s business strategy. Neither Bayer AG nor other Bayer Group companies
make donations to political parties or associations affiliated with them.
EDUCATION AND SCIENCE
The Bayer foundations and the country companies offer funding at all stages of the educational path –
from kindergarten to high-level research.
When it comes to scientific funding, Bayer focuses on supporting outstanding research achievements,
developing international young scientists and engaging in dialogue in Life Science fields.

The Bayer Science & Education Foundation awards prizes in recognition of outstanding achievements
among both established researchers and young scientists. Professor Frédéric Merkt from the eth
Zurich, Switzerland, for instance, received the Otto Bayer Prize 2014 for his outstanding contributions to the field of molecular spectroscopy. The award, worth €75,000, is highly regarded in the research community. An Early Excellence in Science Award – with prize money amounting to €10,000
– went to Dr. Steven Spoel from the United Kingdom in 2014. Working at the University of Edinburgh’s Institute of Molecular Plant Sciences, the project manager is successfully expanding our understanding of how living cells translate signals from their environment into changes in their gene
expression.
Bayer also supports the scientific education of young people. We want to help awaken and promote an
interest in science, technology and medicine through initiatives for schoolchildren and scholarship
programs. In this way, we are helping talented young people at an early age to go on to become leading-edge researchers.
The foundation’s scholarships enable students and trainees to carry out ambitious projects abroad.
When it comes to supporting the talents of schoolchildren, Bayer is banking on the commitment and
creativity of subject teachers – total funding of €500,000 was approved in 2014 for 53 projects in which
they are exploring new, practical ways of teaching science. All kinds of schools are eligible for funding –
from elementary school to high school, including special schools and vocational schools.
With this funding portfolio, the Bayer foundations recognize excellence in natural science and medicine
in particular – the very scientific fields that form the basis for Bayer’s business model as a researchoriented Life Science company.
HEALTH AND SOCIAL NEEDS
In many parts of the world, our social commitment includes involvement in improving health care,
treating neglected diseases and providing better social living conditions in the communities around our
sites. To this end, we work together with the World Health Organization (who) and local nongovernmental organizations, for example.
online annex: 3-13-4
As part of its Access to Medicine activities, Bayer provides free medication to treat neglected tropical
diseases. In particular, the company has for over 10 years been supporting the who in the fight
against Chagas’ disease, which is widespread in Latin America, and African sleeping sickness. In
2014 we again provided the who with one million Lampit™ tablets (active ingredient: nifurtimox
120 mg) to treat Chagas’ disease, as well as us$300,000 for logistics and distribution. We are also
currently developing a smaller nifurtimox tablet with a lower active ingredient content (30 mg) to
simplify the treatment of children with Chagas’ disease.
We have been supporting the who in the fight against African sleeping sickness – especially in eastern and southern Africa – since 2002. In 2014 we again provided 10,000 ampoules of Germanin™.
Every year since 2009, Bayer has also donated 400,000 tablets with the active ingredient nifurtimox
to the who for use in a combination therapy with an active ingredient from another manufacturer to
treat West African sleeping sickness, the most widespread form of the disease.
For the fifth time, the Bayer Cares Foundation in 2014 honored innovative initiatives in social medicine with its Aspirin Social Award. The first prize, worth €15,000, was awarded to the “Explain tb”
project with its novel concept for educating people about tuberculosis: a mobile app gives patients
extensive information on the disease in the form of fact sheets and videos in 33 different languages.
Half a million people still become ill with tuberculosis every year in Europe.

13. Social Commitment

After the international expansion of the volunteering program in the previous year, the Bayer Cares
Foundation provided funding of around €317,000 for 92 voluntary initiatives in 2014. These projects are
primarily put forward by Bayer employees who are committed to improving the living conditions in the
communities around Bayer’s sites in some 40 countries worldwide.
2014 once again saw the Bayer Cares Foundation involved in disaster aid. After the devastating destruction caused by Typhoon Haiyan on the Philippines, for example, the foundation joined forces with local
partners to launch three reconstruction projects. They provide health care and permanent accommodation for the people affected. These measures were made possible by funding to the tune of €280,000
financed in equal part by Bayer employees and the company itself.
SPORTS AND CULTURE
Bayer has been actively involved in supporting sports and culture for more than a century, thereby
making a sustainable contribution to the cultural life and sports opportunities in the catchment areas of
its sites in Germany. Some Bayer sports clubs offer a wide range of prophylactic exercise programs that
health insurers have approved as preventive health measures. In 2014 the company provided funding of
some €14 million for recreational, disabled and competitive sports activities.
online annex: 3-13-5
Bayer is realigning its charitable sponsorship of sports in the communities near its Lower Rhine sites
in Germany. These activities will be gradually concentrated at six major clubs by 2015. Bayer’s involvement in professional soccer at Bayer 04 Leverkusen GmbH is not part of its social sports sponsorship activities because it belongs to the company’s image advertising.

FULL YEAR 2014
Bayer had a very successful year in 2014, both operationally and strategically. We set new records for
sales and for ebitda before special items. The growth momentum in our Life Science businesses –
HealthCare and CropScience – persisted, driven by sales of our recently launched products. MaterialScience also registered encouraging sales gains. Group ebitda before special items advanced significantly. Tangible volume growth and a modest rise in selling prices more than offset higher selling and
r&d expenses and negative currency effects.
In 2014 we set the course for the Bayer Group to focus on the Life Science businesses – HealthCare and
CropScience. MaterialScience is to be floated on the stock market as a separate company by mid-2016
at the latest. We considerably strengthened our Consumer Health segment by acquiring the consumer
care businesses of Merck & Co., Inc., United States, and Dihon Pharmaceutical Group Co. Ltd., China.
Our Pharmaceuticals business benefited from the acquisition of Algeta asa, Norway, with which Bayer
was already collaborating to develop and commercialize the cancer drug Xofigo™.

ebit of the Bayer Group rose by 11.6% to €5,506 million (2013: €4,934 million) after net special charges of €438 million (2013: €839 million). The special charges mainly included €173 million for the derecognition of goodwill as a result of the sGC collaboration agreement with Merck & Co., Inc, United States,
€153 million in integration costs for acquired businesses, and €89 million in accounting measures for
litigations. These amounts were partly offset by a one-time net gain of €77 million from the sale of our
Interventional device business to Boston Scientific, United States. ebit before special items rose by
3.0% to €5,944 million (2013: €5,773 million).
ebitda before special items increased by 4.9% to €8,812 million (2013: €8,401 million) despite negative currency effects of approximately €410 million or 4%. The good sales development was accompanied by higher selling and r&d expenses. At HealthCare, ebitda before special items improved by 2.8%
to €5,484 million (2013: €5,334 million; currency effect approx. minus 6%). While earnings of the
Pharmaceuticals segment improved, those of Consumer Health declined. ebitda before special items of
CropScience rose by 5.0% to €2,360 million (2013: €2,248 million; currency effect approx. minus 2%)
as a result of volume gains and higher selling prices. ebitda before special items of MaterialScience
advanced by 10.7% to €1,187 million (2013: €1,072 million; currency effect 0%), mainly thanks to
higher volumes and lower raw material and energy costs.

Gross cash flow climbed by 16.9% in 2014 to €6,820 million (2013: €5,832 million), mainly because of
the improvement in ebit. Net cash flow moved ahead by 12.4% to €5,810 million (2013: €5,171 million)
after a business-related increase in cash tied up in working capital and €778 million in deferred income
from the one-time payment received in connection with the sGC collaboration with Merck & Co., Inc.,
United States. In 2014 we paid income taxes amounting to €1,835 million (2013: €1,281 million). Net
financial debt rose by €12.9 billion against December 31, 2013, to €19.6 billion as a result of acquisitions. The net defined benefit liability for post-employment benefits – the difference between benefit
obligations and plan assets – increased from €7.3 billion to €12.2 billion over the same period, mainly
due to a decline in long-term capital market interest rates for high-quality corporate bonds.
Total assets increased in 2014 by 36.9% to €70.2 billion. Noncurrent assets rose by 48.7% to
€48.0 billion, mainly as a result of acquisitions. Goodwill rose by €6.3 billion to €16.2 billion and other
intangible assets by €6.7 billion to €15.6 billion. The carrying amount of current assets increased by
16.8% to €22.2 billion. Equity decreased by €0.6 billion to €20.2 billion. Liabilities increased by
€19.5 billion against December 31, 2013 to €50.0 billion, mainly due to a €12.8 billion acquisitionrelated increase in financial liabilities and a €4.9 billion increase in pension provisions.
FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014
Group sales in the fourth quarter of 2014 rose by 6.9% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to €11,039 million
(reported: + 11.6%). Sales of HealthCare gained 7.8% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to €5,598 million (reported:
+ 13.3%). Business in the Pharmaceuticals segment expanded by 10.1% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to
€3,271 million (reported: + 9.9%), driven by the encouraging development of our recently launched
products. Sales at Consumer Health came in 4.2% ahead of the prior-year quarter at €2,327 million
(reported: + 18.5%). CropScience sales climbed by 8.3% (Fx & portfolio adj.) in the fourth quarter to
€2,195 million (reported: + 12.5%) as a result of higher volumes. Sales of MaterialScience rose by
5.5% (Fx & portfolio adj.) against the prior-year period, to €2,948 million (reported: + 9.6%), thanks
primarily to volume increases.

14. Overview of Sales, Earnings and Financial Position

ebit of the Bayer Group declined by 14.4% in the fourth quarter of 2014, to €561 million (q4 2013:
€655 million). Earnings were diminished by net special charges of €442 million (q4 2013: €439 million).
The special charges mainly included €173 million for the derecognition of goodwill as a result of the
sGC collaboration agreement with Merck & Co., Inc, United States, €89 million in accounting measures
for litigations and €86 million in integration costs for acquired businesses. ebit before special items fell
by 8.3% to €1,003 million (q4 2013: €1,094 million).
ebitda before special items rose in the fourth quarter of 2014 by 4.4% to €1,846 million (q4 2013:
€1,769 million), mainly as a result of higher volumes in all subgroups. Earnings were held back by
higher selling and r&d expenses. HealthCare registered a 6.7% increase in ebitda before special items
to €1,426 million (q4 2013: €1,337 million), while CropScience posted a 15.7% gain to €369 million
(q4 2013: €319 million). ebitda before special items of MaterialScience came in at €217 million
(q4 2013: €248 million), down 12.5% against the prior-year quarter.
After a financial result of minus €347 million (q4 2013: minus €84 million), income before income taxes
fell to €214 million (q4 2013: €571 million). The financial result mainly comprised net interest expense
of €148 million (q4 2013: €61 million), interest cost of €111 million (q4 2013: €62 million) for pension
and other provisions, and exchange losses of €66 million (q4 2013: €29 million). After taxes and noncontrolling interest, net income amounted to €224 million (q4 2013: €455 million). Earnings per share
declined to €0.27 (q4 2013: €0.55). However, core earnings per share rose to €1.19 (q4 2013: €1.10),
calculated as explained in Chapter 16.3 “Core Earnings Per Share.”
Gross cash flow of the Group advanced by 61.0% to €1,575 million (q4 2013: €978 million) and net cash
flow by 41.1% to €2,230 million (q4 2013: €1,580 million). The sharp rise in net cash flow was largely
attributable to the €778 million in deferred income from the one-time payment received in connection
with the sGC collaboration with Merck & Co., Inc., United States. Net financial debt rose by €11.1 billion
in the fourth quarter of 2014 to €19.6 billion (September 30, 2014: €8.5 billion), mainly due to higher
borrowings for acquisitions. The net defined benefit liability for post-employment benefits increased by
€0.9 billion against September 30, 2014, to €12.2 billion, mainly due to a decline in long-term capital
market interest rates for high-quality corporate bonds.

15. Business Development by Subgroup, Segment and Region

Sales of the HealthCare subgroup rose by 7.5% (Fx & portfolio adj.) in 2014, to €19,975 million
(reported: + 5.6%). This encouraging growth was driven by our recently launched pharmaceutical
products. Sales at Consumer Health came in slightly ahead of the prior year.
The integration of the businesses acquired from Merck & Co., Inc., United States, and from Dihon
Pharmaceutical Group Co. Ltd., China, in the fourth quarter of 2014 is progressing on schedule.

ebit of the HealthCare subgroup advanced significantly by 9.8% in 2014 to €3,581 million. This increase
was largely attributable to considerably lower special charges of €331 million (2013: €713 million). ebit
before special items declined by 1.5% to €3,912 million. By contrast, we raised ebitda before special
items by 2.8% to €5,484 million. This increase was driven by the gratifying business development in
Pharmaceuticals, while earnings in Consumer Health posted a slight decrease. Earnings at HealthCare
were diminished by higher selling expenses in both segments, higher research and development spending in Pharmaceuticals and negative currency effects of approximately €360 million.

Sales of the Pharmaceuticals segment climbed by a substantial 11.2% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to
€12,052 million. This very good performance was driven by our recently launched products Xarelto™,
Eylea™, Stivarga™, Xofigo™ and Adempas™, which posted combined sales of €2,908 million (2013:
€1,522 million). Our Pharmaceuticals business grew in all regions on a currency-adjusted basis, particularly in China, the United States and Western Europe.

15. Business Development by Subgroup, Segment and Region

Our oral anticoagulant Xarelto™ maintained its growth momentum, with strong sales gains especially in
Japan, France and Germany. Royalties received and recognized as sales in the United States, where
Xarelto™ is marketed by a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, more than doubled. Following its approval
in additional indications, sales of our eye medicine Eylea™ continued to rise substantially, particularly in
Europe. The cancer drug Stivarga™ developed positively, and the cancer drug Xofigo™ (sales in 2014:
€157 million; 2013: €41 million) also made a pleasing contribution to sales growth, especially in the
United States. The market introduction of Adempas™ to treat various forms of pulmonary hypertension
continued successfully in additional countries. Since October 2014, we have been collaborating
with Merck & Co., Inc., United States, in the development and commercialization of Adempas™. The
sales attributable to Bayer amounted to €89 million in 2014 (2013: €3 million). The one-time payment of
€793 million from the sGC cooperation will be recorded as sales and earnings over a 13.5 year period.
€15 million of this was accounted for in the fourth quarter.
Sales of the hormone-releasing intrauterine devices of the Mirena™ product family rose mainly as a
result of higher prices and volumes in the United States. The cancer drug Nexavar™ posted gains, mainly as a result of price increases in the United States. Adalat™ for the treatment of hypertension and
coronary heart disease, Aspirin™ Cardio for secondary prevention of heart attacks and our oral diabetes
treatment Glucobay™ benefited from further rising demand in China.
Sales of our blood-clotting medicine Kogenate™ receded, due partly to the temporary use of production
capacities to develop our next-generation hemophilia medicines. Sales of the multiple sclerosis drug
Betaferon™ / Betaseron™ fell particularly in the United States due to increased competition there. Business with our yaz™ / Yasmin™ / Yasminelle™ oral contraceptives was held back especially by generic
competition in Western Europe and lower demand in Japan. Despite higher volumes in China, sales of
the antibiotic Avalox™ / Avelox™ declined overall, due particularly to the expiration of the patent in
Europe and the United States. Sales of Levitra™ for the treatment of erectile dysfunction were down
primarily in the United States.
ebit of the Pharmaceuticals segment rose by a substantial 16.7% in 2014 to €2,371 million. This was
mainly due to lower special charges of €286 million (2013: €521 million), which mainly included
€173 million for the derecognition of goodwill as a result of the sGC collaboration with Merck & Co.,
Inc., United States, and €88 million in accounting measures for litigations. ebit before special items
increased by 4.1% to €2,657 million. We raised ebitda before special items by 6.0% to
€3,699 million. This earnings growth was mainly attributable to the encouraging business development and especially to the strong sales gains for our recently launched products, while earnings were
diminished by higher selling and r&d expenses and roughly €330 million in negative currency effects.

15. Business Development by Subgroup, Segment and Region

Sales in the Consumer Care Division rose by 5.3% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to €4,245 million. The business
acquired from Merck & Co., Inc., United States, on October 1, 2014, accounted for €289 million of sales
in the fourth quarter, which is traditionally weaker for seasonal reasons. We registered considerably
higher sales of our pain reliever Aleve™ in the United States due mainly to a product line expansion.
Our skincare product Bepanthen™ / Bepanthol™ posted considerably higher sales on a currencyadjusted basis. Higher volumes in all regions contributed to this growth. Sales of our antifungal
Canesten™ expanded particularly in the Emerging Markets. Driven partly by product line expansions,
sales of our dietary supplement Supradyn™ developed positively in Europe. Business with the pain
reliever Aspirin™ was held back mainly by a weak cold season in Europe. Business with our dietary
supplement One A Day™ was held back mainly by lower demand in the United States.
Sales of the Medical Care Division fell by 3.7% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to €2,360 million. Sales of the Diabetes Care business declined overall despite positive development in the Emerging Markets. Business
with our Contour™ line of blood glucose meters was held back, especially in the United States, due to
reimbursement pressure and price decreases, mainly in the first half of the year. Sales of our contrast
agents and medical equipment in the Radiology business were flat with the prior-year period on a currency-adjusted basis.
Business in the Animal Health Division improved by 4.0% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to €1,318 million. We
raised sales of the Advantage™ product family of flea, tick and worm control products due to good development in Europe. Business with the Seresto™ flea and tick collar advanced substantially in Europe
and the United States.
ebit of the Consumer Health segment edged down by 1.5% in 2014 to €1,210 million after net special
charges of €45 million (2013: €192 million). Reflected here are expenses of €122 million for the integration
of acquired businesses and a one-time net gain of €77 million from the divestiture of the Interventional
device business to Boston Scientific, United States. ebit before special items fell by 11.7% to
€1,255 million. ebitda before special items, at €1,785 million, was below the prior-year level (2013: €1,844
million). This was due to lower earnings at Medical Care and Animal Health along with negative currency
effects of around €30 million. However, there was a positive effect from earnings growth at Consumer
Care, to which the business acquired from Merck & Co., Inc., United States, contributed €73 million.

CropScience registered sales gains in all regions:
Sales in Europe rose by 7.4% (Fx adj.) to €2,957 million, driven by positive development at Crop Protection/Seeds. Sales at SeedGrowth and Fungicides registered double-digit percentage increases, while
sales at Herbicides rose moderately. Business at Insecticides declined slightly overall. Seeds registered
growth in all units. Business at Environmental Science developed positively. A strong consumer business more than offset the decline in sales of products for professional users.

15. Business Development by Subgroup, Segment and Region

Sales in North America advanced by 10.2% (Fx adj.) to €2,334 million. This was primarily attributable
to the good development in Herbicides, particularly for use in corn and cereals, and in SeedGrowth.
Business with cotton seed expanded briskly compared with the weak prior year and the soybean seed
business also developed very well. The Fungicides business saw positive development, while sales at
Insecticides declined due to lower pest pressure. Sales advanced at Environmental Science.
Sales in the Asia / Pacific region advanced by 5.5% (Fx adj.) to €1,374 million, thanks particularly to
increased sales in Fungicides. Our Seeds business also developed well. Sales improved in the Insecticides and Herbicides businesses as well, but receded at SeedGrowth. Sales at Environmental Science
expanded substantially. The region as a whole benefited especially from a significant business improvement in India, while sales in Japan and Australia also developed positively.
The strongest growth was recorded in Latin America / Africa / Middle East. Sales in that region climbed
by a substantial 20.6% (Fx adj.) to €2,829 million. We achieved double-digit growth in Crop Protection /
Seeds in a very positive market environment. Sales in Fungicides saw particularly robust expansion,
especially for products used in soybeans. Herbicides also recorded strong growth. The SeedGrowth and
Insecticides businesses also developed very well. Sales in Seeds also advanced considerably, particularly for soybeans, cotton and vegetable seeds. Sales in Environmental Science also moved ahead. Brazil,
Argentina and Mexico accounted for a major part of the region's positive sales development overall.

ebit of CropScience advanced by 4.5% in 2014 to €1,806 million (2013: €1,729 million) after special
charges of €32 million (2013: €72 million), which were primarily related to the planned consolidation of
production facilities. ebit before special items rose by 2.1% to €1,838 million. ebitda before special
items improved by 5.0% to €2,360 million. The earnings contributions from the very positive business
development – marked by considerable volume gains and higher selling prices – were partially offset by
higher selling and r&d expenses and negative currency effects of around €50 million.

Sales of the MaterialScience subgroup advanced in 2014 by 4.8% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to €11,651
million (reported: +3.7%). This growth was due to higher volumes for Polycarbonates; Polyurethanes;
and Coatings, Adhesives, Specialties. Volumes increased in Europe, North America and Asia / Pacific,
while in Latin America / Africa / Middle East they were flat with the previous year. However, selling
prices showed a slight decline.

The Polyurethanes business unit raised sales by 4.9% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to €6,285 million. This increase was driven by higher volumes in all regions that in turn were attributable to improved demand in
nearly all the main customer industries. Selling prices overall were below the prior-year level. Volumes
of diphenylmethane diisocyanate (mdi) and toluene diisocyanate (tdi) improved, while selling prices
receded. This led to an increase in overall sales of mdi and a decrease in sales of tdi. Both volumes and
selling prices for polyether (pet) increased.
Sales of the Polycarbonates business unit increased by 7.2% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to €2,820 million,
with volumes up in all regions except Latin America / Africa / Middle East. This was mainly attributable to
improved demand from customers in the automotive, electrical / electronics and construction industries.
Selling prices were down overall compared with the prior year.

ebit of MaterialScience advanced by 27.6% to €555 million in 2014 (2013: €435 million), reflecting
special charges of €43 million for restructuring (2013: special gains of €6 million). ebit before special
items improved by a clear 39.4% to €598 million. ebitda before special items rose by 10.7% to
€1,187 million. This was particularly due to higher volumes, efficiency improvement measures and
lower raw material and energy costs. However, earnings were held back by lower selling prices.
Currency effects as a whole were neutral to earnings.

15.5 Business Development in the Emerging Markets
The Emerging Markets again accounted for a disproportionately large share of sales growth in 2014.
For reporting purposes we have defined the Emerging Markets as Asia (excluding Japan), Latin America, Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East.
Sales in these markets rose by 11.3% (Fx adj.) in 2014 to €15,919 million (2013: €15,040 million), with
encouraging gains in Latin America, Asia and Eastern Europe. The Emerging Markets accounted for
37.7% of sales (2013: 37.5%).

HEALTHCARE
HealthCare raised sales in the Emerging Markets by a substantial 12.9% (Fx adj.) in 2014 to
€6,493 million (2013: €6,236 million). The strongest absolute growth was recorded in China. The Latin
America region posted strong currency-adjusted increases, particularly in Brazil and Argentina. We
achieved very gratifying sales growth in Russia, primarily in Consumer Care. The Emerging Markets
accounted for 32.5% (2013: 33.0%) of total HealthCare sales.
CROPSCIENCE
CropScience improved sales in the Emerging Markets by 16.6% (Fx adj.) in 2014, to €4,409 million
(2013: €3,959 million). Business developed particularly well in Latin America, especially in Brazil and
Argentina. We posted encouraging sales gains in Eastern Europe and Africa / Middle East, where we
also achieved double-digit (Fx adj.) growth rates. Business in Asia expanded as well. The Emerging
Markets’ share of total CropScience sales in 2014 was 46.4% (2013: 44.9%).
MATERIALSCIENCE
In the Emerging Markets, MaterialScience had sales of €4,951 million in 2014 (2013: €4,761 million),
up 5.4% (Fx. adj.) year on year. Here we achieved our strongest growth in Asia, while gains were also
registered in Eastern Europe and Latin America. Sales in Africa and the Middle East were below the
prior-year level. The Emerging Markets accounted for 42.5% (2013: 42.4%) of total sales at
MaterialScience.
We are active in the Emerging Markets in a variety of ways. Information and selected examples are
contained in the
online annex: 3-15.5-1
HealthCare is steadily expanding its activities in the Greater China region to strengthen global research, development and production capacities and to incorporate the clinical profiles and medical
needs of Asian patients into drug development activities at an early stage.
In January 2014, Bayer HealthCare and Peking University, Beijing, China, entered into a three-year
strategic partnership in the area of translational research and its use in drug discovery. The Innovation Center China established by HealthCare in 2009 celebrated its fifth anniversary in 2014.

15. Business Development by Subgroup, Segment and Region

We plan to expand our production facility at the Beijing site by the end of 2016. The roughly €100
million in capital expenditures decided upon in March 2014 will nearly double the production capacity in Beijing.
The acquisition of Dihon Pharmaceutical Group Co. Ltd., China, adds traditional Chinese medicine
and other areas to our Consumer Care portfolio.
To improve comprehensive health care, the subgroup is also working with the Chinese health ministry to organize training measures for physicians in the western part of the country.
CropScience aims to contribute to increased agricultural productivity in regions such as Africa and
intends to expand its presence there. The subgroup’s range of products and services is tailored to the
needs of African farmers and includes integrated crop solutions based on improved seed varieties
and modern crop protection technologies. We also run product safety programs and provide training
in good agricultural practice. Furthermore, we view our involvement in public-private partnerships
(ppps) such as the German Food Partnership project of the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (bmz) as an important way to help further expand value chains in Africa and
safeguard food supplies. We cooperate with local governments, farmers' associations and cooperatives, non-governmental organizations and agricultural input industries, as well as banks and insurance companies.
CropScience also aims to help raise living standards in rural areas of India by boosting value added
and ensuring it is reinvested in the community. An example is the Model Village Project launched in
2010. The goal of this project is to train farmers in sustainable cultivation methods and show them
new ways of irrigating their land in order to improve productivity. Parallel measures are also being
taken to improve general living conditions, such as the commissioning of a drinking water purification plant and the launch of health promotion and children’s educational programs. The Bayer Prayas
Rural Development Association coordinates the activities at the local level in the model villages in the
state of Karnataka in southwest India.
In cooperation with external partners, MaterialScience is evolving and implementing technical solutions to help low-income people in developing countries and Emerging Markets gain improved access to high-quality, safe and easy-to-build yet affordable housing. These activities currently focus on
Asia. The company is mainly contributing its expertise in the field of rigid polyurethane foam for the
construction industry.

Sales of the Bayer Group rose to €42,239 million (+ 5.2%). The increase after adjusting for currency and
portfolio effects was 7.2%.
The cost of goods sold increased by 3.8% to €20,266 million, mainly due to higher volumes at
HealthCare and MaterialScience. The ratio of the cost of goods sold to total sales was 48.0%
(2013: 48.6%). The selling expenses of €11,018 million (+ 6.8%) amounted to 26.1% of sales
(2013: 25.7%). Research and development (r&d) expenses rose in 2014 by 4.9% to €3,574 million,
the increase being attributable to HealthCare and CropScience. The ratio of r&d expenses to sales
remained level at 8.5% (2013: 8.5%). General administration expenses, at €1,741 million, were
slightly above the prior year (+ 1.7%). The ratio of general administration expenses to total sales was
somewhat lower at 4.1% (2013: 4.3%). The negative balance of other operating income and expenses
was reduced considerably to minus €134 million (2013: minus €277 million), mainly because special
charges for accounting measures related to legal claims were lower in 2014 (see also Chapter 16.2
“Calculation of E Before Special Items”).
ebit climbed by 11.6% in 2014 to €5,506 million.

16. Earnings; Asset and Financial Position of the Bayer Group

The financial result fell by 34.9% to minus €981 million. It comprised €356 million (2013: €355 million)
in net interest expense, €322 million (2013: €297 million) in interest cost for pension and other provisions, and a €248 million (2013: €120 million) net exchange loss. The year-on-year increase in the net
exchange loss was mainly due to exchange rate effects in Venezuela, Ukraine and Argentina, higher
exchange hedging costs and the fact that the prior year’s financial result included a one-time gain of
€77 million from the sale of Bayer’s interest in Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc., United States.
Tax expense in 2014 increased to €1,082 million as a result of earnings growth (2013: €1,021 million).
Income after income taxes came in at €3,443 million. Income attributable to non-controlling interest
rose by €20 million to €17 million. Bayer Group net income for 2014 was €3,426 million (2013:
€3,189 million).

16.2 Calculation of EBIT(DA) Before Special Items
Key performance indicators for the Bayer Group are ebit before special items and ebitda before special
items. These indicators are reported in order to allow a more accurate assessment of business operations. The special items – comprising effects that are non-recurring or do not regularly recur or attain
similar magnitudes – are detailed in the following table. ebitda, ebitda before special items and ebit
before special items are not defined in the International Financial Reporting Standards (ifrs) and should
therefore be regarded only as supplementary information. ebitda before special items is a meaningful
indicator of operating performance since it is not affected by depreciation, amortization, impairment
losses, impairment loss reversals or special items. By reporting this indicator, the company aims to give
readers a clear picture of the results of operations and ensure comparability of data over time. The
ebitda margin before special items, which is the ratio of ebitda before special items to sales, serves as a
relative indicator for the internal and external comparison of operational earning power.
Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses increased by 1.4% in 2014 to €2,936 million
(2013: €2,896 million), comprising €1,592 million (2013: €1,572 million) in amortization and impairments of intangible assets, €2 million (2013: €13 million) in impairment loss reversals and €1,346 million (2013: €1,337 million) in depreciation and impairments of property, plant and equipment. A total of
€68 million (2013: €268 million) in depreciation, amortization and impairments constituted special
items. This amount comprised €70 million (2013: €259 million) in impairment losses and €0 million
(2013: €22 million) in depreciation and amortization, less €2 million (2013: €13 million) in impairment
loss reversals.

16.3 Core Earnings Per Share
Earnings per share according to ifrs are affected by the purchase price allocation for acquisitions and
other special factors. To enhance comparability, we also determine core net income after eliminating
amortization and impairment losses / impairment loss reversals of intangible assets, impairment losses /
impairment loss reversals of property, plant and equipment and special items, and the related tax effects.
From this core net income we calculate core earnings per share in the same way as earnings per share.
Core earnings per share form the basis for our dividend policy. Core earnings per share in 2014 rose by
7.3% to €6.02 (2013: €5.61).

16.4 Value Management
SYSTEM BASED ON CASH VALUE ADDED
The principal value-based steering parameters in the Bayer Group are the cash value added (cva) and
the cash flow return on investment (cfroi). If the cva is positive, the respective company or business
entity has exceeded the minimum requirements of the equity and debt capital providers and has created
value. The cfroi is a ratio indicating the profitability of the Group or of individual business entities and
must be compared to the cost of capital.
CALCULATING THE COST OF CAPITAL
Bayer calculates the cost of capital according to the debt / equity ratio at the beginning of the year using
the weighted average cost of capital (wacc) formula. The cost of equity capital is the return expected by
stockholders, computed from capital market information. The cost of debt capital used in calculating
wacc is based on the terms for ten-year Eurobonds issued by industrial companies with an “a–” rating.
Cost of capital for
the Bayer Group

7.6%

To take into account the different risk and return profiles of our principal businesses, we calculate
individual capital cost factors after income taxes for each of our subgroups. These were 7.9% for
HealthCare, 7.3% for CropScience and 6.9% for MaterialScience. The capital cost factor for the Group
as a whole in 2014 was 7.6%.

16. Earnings; Asset and Financial Position of the Bayer Group

GROSS CASH FLOW, CASH VALUE ADDED AND CASH FLOW RETURN ON INVESTMENT AS
PERFORMANCE YARDSTICKS
The gross cash flow is the measure of our internal financing capability. Bayer has chosen this parameter
because it is relatively free of accounting influences and is therefore a more meaningful performance
indicator.
Taking into account the costs of capital and of reproducing depletable assets, we determine the gross
cash flow hurdle. If the gross cash flow hurdle is exceeded, the cva is positive and thus the required
return on equity and debt plus the cost of asset reproduction has been earned.
The cfroi is the difference between the gross cash flow and the cost of reproducing depletable assets,
divided by the capital invested. The capital invested is calculated from the statement of financial position and basically comprises the property, plant and equipment and intangible assets required for operations – stated at the historical cost of acquisition or construction – plus working capital, less interestfree liabilities (such as current provisions). To mitigate the effect of fluctuations in the capital invested
during the year, the cfroi is computed on the basis of the average capital invested for the respective
year.
The gross cash flow hurdle for 2014 was €4,447 million.
Actual gross cash flow came in at €6,820 million, exceeding the hurdle by 53.4%. Thus the entire cost
of capital and asset reproduction costs were earned in 2014. The positive cva of €2,373 million shows
that Bayer exceeded the minimum return and reproduction requirements and created value. A cfroi of
11.9% was achieved in 2014.
HealthCare and CropScience exceeded their required returns (including asset reproduction), raised
their cva and helped to increase the value of the Group. In 2014 MaterialScience reduced the gap to the
gross cash flow hurdle, which continues to be impacted by growth investments.

retirements of noncurrent assets, minus gains from the remeasurement of already held assets in step acquisitions. The change in pension
provisions includes the elimination of non-cash components of EBIT. It also contains benefit payments during the year.

OPERATING CASH FLOW
Gross cash flow climbed by 16.9% in 2014 to €6,820 million (2013: €5,832 million), mainly because of
the improvement in ebit. Net cash flow moved ahead by 12.4% to €5,810 million (2013: €5,171 million),
after a business-related increase in cash tied up in working capital and €778 million in deferred income
from the one-time payment received in connection with the sGC collaboration with Merck & Co., Inc.,
United States. Income taxes paid in 2014 amounted to €1,835 million (2013: €1,281 million).

classified as debt according to IFRS

Net financial debt of the Bayer Group increased in 2014 to €19.6 billion, mainly as a result of cash
outflows for acquisitions. As of December 31, 2014, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of
€1.9 billion (2013: €1.7 billion). Financial liabilities at the end of the reporting period amounted to
€21.6 billion (2013: €8.5 billion), with three subordinated hybrid bonds reflected at €4.6 billion overall.
Net financial debt should be viewed against the fact that Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s treat 75%
and 50%, respectively, of the hybrid bond issued in July 2005 with a nominal volume of €1.3 billion as
equity. Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s treat 50% of the hybrid bonds issued in July 2014 with nominal
volumes of €1.75 billion and €1.5 billion, respectively, as equity. The hybrid bonds thus have a more
limited effect on the Group’s rating-specific debt indicators than conventional borrowings. Our noncurrent financial liabilities increased in 2014 from €5.6 billion to €18.5 billion, while current financial
liabilities remained unchanged at €3.4 billion.

Total assets as of December 31, 2014, increased by 36.9% to €70.2 billion. Noncurrent assets rose by
48.7% to €48.0 billion due mainly to acquisitions. This was due to the €6.3 billion increase in goodwill
and the €6.7 billion rise in other intangible assets. The carrying amount of current assets climbed to
€22.2 billion.
Equity was lower by €0.6 billion at €20.2 billion. The positive effects from the net income of €3.4 billion
and the exchange differences of €1.4 billion (2013: negative effect of €0.7 billion) were offset by the
negative effect from the increase of €3.5 billion (2013: positive effect from the decline of €1.3 billion) –
recognized outside profit or loss – in post-employment benefit obligations and the dividend payment of
€1.7 billion (2013: €1.6 billion). The equity ratio (equity coverage of total assets) as of December 31,
2014 was 28.8% (2013: 40.5%).
Liabilities increased by €19.5 billion compared with December 31, 2013, to €50.0 billion, due to the
acquisition-related €12.8 billion increase in financial liabilities and the €4.9 billion increase in provisions
for pensions and other post-employment benefits.

The net defined benefit liability for pensions and other post-employment benefits increased from

high-quality corporate bonds.

16.7 Financial Management of the Group
The financial management of the Bayer Group is conducted by the strategic management holding company Bayer AG. Capital is a global resource, generally procured centrally and distributed within the
Group. The foremost objectives of our financial management are to help bring about a sustained increase in corporate value and to ensure the Group’s liquidity and creditworthiness. This involves optimizing the capital structure and effectively managing risks. The management of currency, interest rate,
raw material price and default risks helps to reduce the volatility of our earnings.
The contracted rating agencies assess Bayer as follows:

Rating

[Table 3.16.11]
Long-term rating

Outlook

Short-term rating

Standard & Poor’s

A–

stable

A–2

Moody’s

A3

stable

P–2

These credit ratings reflect the company’s high solvency and ensure access to a broad investor base for
financing purposes. It remains our goal to achieve and maintain financial ratios that support an “a”
category rating in order to maintain our financial flexibility.
We pursue a prudent debt management strategy to ensure flexibility, drawing on a balanced financing
portfolio. This is based on bonds – predominantly a multi-currency European Medium Term Notes program –, syndicated credit facilities, bilateral loan agreements and a global commercial paper program.
We use financial derivatives to hedge against risks arising from business operations or financial transactions, but do not employ contracts in the absence of an underlying transaction. It is our policy to diminish default risks by selecting trading partners with a high credit standing. We closely monitor the execution of all transactions, which are conducted in accordance with Group directives.
Further details of our risk management objectives and the ways in which we account for all the major
types of hedged transactions – along with price, credit and liquidity risks as they relate to the use of
financial instruments – are given in Chapter 20.3 “Opportunities and Risks Report.”

17. Earnings; Asset and Financial Position
of Bayer AG
Bayer AG is the parent corporation of the Bayer Group and functions as a management holding company. The principal management functions for the entire Group are performed by the Board of Management of Bayer AG. These include strategic planning, resource allocation, executive management and
financial management. The performance of Bayer AG is largely determined by the business performance of the Bayer Group.
The financial statements of Bayer AG are prepared in accordance with the German Commercial Code
(hgb) and Stock Corporation Act (AktG).

In fiscal 2014 Bayer AG’s net income was €2,454 million, which was around the same level as in the
previous year (2013: €2,498 million). The main decline was in income from investments in affiliated
companies. This was largely offset by lower tax expense.
The income from investments in affiliated companies declined year on year by €329 million to €3,213
million (2013: €3,542 million). Bayer Pharma AG posted income of €2,158 million (2013: €1,934 million), which was once again by far the largest contribution. The improvement in this subgroup’s earnings was mainly due to a substantial increase in business with recently launched high-margin products.
Bayer CropScience AG contributed €787 million (2013: €1,379 million) to Bayer AG’s income. The previous year’s figure included one-time income of €570 million from the intra-Group sale of seed technologies. Having made a loss of €20 million in the previous year, Bayer MaterialScience made a positive
earnings contribution of €154 million in 2014. The main reasons for this were an improvement in operating earnings resulting from lower procurement prices for raw materials and energy, and higher dividend income. Other significant earnings contributions comprised €146 million (2013: €213 million) from
a subsidiary that receives foreign dividend income. Bayer Business Services GmbH posted a loss of €75
million (2013: €74 million), and Bayer Technology Services GmbH reported a loss of €18 million (2013:
€30 million).

Bayer Annual Report 2014
Combined Management Report
17. Earnings; Asset and Financial Position of Bayer AG

Net interest expense was €341 million, an increase of €26 million compared with the previous year. This
was mainly attributable to a rise in interest expense resulting from higher financial debt, principally as a
consequence of bond issuances during the fiscal year. This was not fully compensated by lower interest
rates. Of the net interest expense, €255 million was attributable to transactions with third parties and
€86 million to intra-Group transactions.
Other financial income and expenses yielded a positive balance of €129 million (2013: €110 million).
This mainly comprised income of €180 million (2013: €162 million) from the subgroups and service
companies to cover pension expenses for retirees remaining with Bayer AG following the hive-down of
the operating business. The non-interest portion of the corresponding expense, amounting to €19 million (2013: €26 million), is included in other financial expenses; the remainder is reflected in net interest
expense. A further charge of €20 million (2013: €14 million) resulted from the translation of foreign
currency receivables and payables and from currency derivatives.
General administration expenses relating to Bayer AG’s performance of its functions as a holding company amounted to €272 million (2013: €266 million). Miscellaneous operating expenses relating to these
functions, net of the respective miscellaneous operating income, came to €19 million (2013: €30 million).
The increase in administration expenses was attributable in part to a slight increase in the number of
employees.
Pre-tax income decreased to €2,710 million (2013: €3,041 million). Tax expense was also lower at €256
million compared with €543 million in 2013. After deduction of taxes, net income was €2,454 million
(2013: €2,498 million). An allocation of €593 million was made to other retained earnings, leaving a
distributable profit of €1,861 million.
The Board of Management and Supervisory Board will propose to the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on
May 27, 2015 that the distributable profit be used to pay a dividend of €2.25 per share (826,947,808
shares) on the capital stock of €2,117 million entitled to the dividend for 2014.

The asset and liability structure of Bayer AG is dominated by its role as a holding company in managing
the subsidiaries and financing corporate activities. This is primarily reflected in the high level of investments in affiliated companies and of the receivables from, and payables to, Group companies.
Total assets of Bayer AG as of December 31, 2014 were €45.4 billion (2013: €38.5 billion), which was
€6.9 billion more than at the start of the year. Non-current assets rose by €5.6 billion and current assets
by €1.3 billion.

Bayer Annual Report 2014
Combined Management Report
17. Earnings; Asset and Financial Position of Bayer AG

Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets totaled €18 million (2013: €21 million) and were
therefore of secondary importance. Financial assets increased by €5.6 billion, from €35.3 billion in the
previous year to €40.9 billion at year end 2014, principally as a result of capital increases at subsidiaries. Investments in affiliated companies continued to account for by far the largest item in total assets,
amounting to 88.3% (2013: 89.7%).
Receivables from subsidiaries amounted to €2.7 billion (2013: €1.7 billion) while payables to subsidiaries totaled €18.2 billion (2013: €17.0 billion). These amounts accounted for 6.1% of total assets and
40.1% of total equity and liabilities, respectively.
Including the deferred charges, the other receivables reflected in current assets were almost unchanged
at €460 million (2013: €455 million) and were of only secondary importance in relation to total assets.
Cash and cash equivalents were €271 million higher than in the previous year at €1,243 million (2013:
€972 million) due to higher bank deposits.
Bayer AG had equity of €15.5 billion (2013: €14.8 billion), giving an equity ratio of 34.2% (2013:
38.5%). Net income for 2014 was €2,454 million while equity was diminished by the €1,737 million
dividend payment for 2013. Despite the absolute rise in equity of €0.7 billion, the equity ratio declined
by 4.3 percentage points as a result of the considerable increase in total assets.
Provisions decreased by €0.6 billion to €2.4 billion (2013: €3.0 billion). Pension provisions and provisions for taxes accounted for roughly equal proportions of the decline. Pension provisions decreased by
€294 million to €1,868 million (2013: €2,162 million) while tax provisions were €283 million lower at
€399 million (2013: €682 million). The other provisions were virtually unchanged at €139 million (2013:
€132 million).
Other liabilities rose by €6.8 billion to €27.4 billion (net of deductible receivables; 2013: €20.7 billion),
mainly due to the €6.1 billion increase in financial debt. Bonds with a total nominal amount of €5.25
billion were issued in 2014. In addition, the commercial paper program was increased by €0.5 billion
and intra-Group debt rose by €0.7 billion. A promissory note with a face value of €0.25 billion was repaid in 2014 and other debt was reduced by €0.1 billion. Bayer AG had financial liabilities of €28.2
billion at year end 2014 (2013: €22.1 billion). After deduction of cash and cash equivalents of €1.2 billion, net debt was €5.9 billion higher than in the previous year at €27.0 billion (2013: €21.1 billion).

*not part of the audited management report
BAYER IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE GERMAN CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE CODE
Bayer has always placed great importance on responsible corporate governance and will continue to do
so. In 2014 the company was able to issue a declaration that it had fully complied with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in the past and continued to do so.
In 2014, the Board of Management and Supervisory Board again addressed the question of compliance
with the German Corporate Governance Code, including the Code amendments of June 24, 2014. The
resulting declaration, which is reproduced on the previous page, was issued in December 2014 and
posted on Bayer’s website along with previous declarations.
DUTIES AND ACTIVITIES OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT
Bayer AG is a strategic management holding company, run by its Board of Management on the Board’s
own responsibility with the goal of sustainably increasing the company’s enterprise value and achieving
defined corporate objectives. The Board of Management performs its tasks according to the law, the
Articles of Incorporation and the Board’s rules of procedure, and works with the company’s other governance bodies in a spirit of trust.
The Board of Management defines the long-term goals and the strategies for the Group, its subgroups
and its service companies, and sets forth the principles and directives for the resulting corporate policies. It coordinates and monitors the most important activities, defines the portfolio, develops and deploys managerial staff, allocates resources and decides on the Group’s financial steering and reporting.
The members of the Board of Management bear joint responsibility for running the business as a whole.
However, the individual members manage the areas assigned to them on their own responsibility within
the framework of the decisions made by the entire Board. The allocation of duties among the members
of the Board of Management is defined in a written schedule.
The entire Board of Management makes decisions on all matters of fundamental importance and in
cases where a decision of the entire Board is prescribed by law or otherwise mandatory. The rules of
procedure of the Board of Management contain a list of topics that must be dealt with and resolved by
the entire Board.
Meetings of the Board of Management are held regularly. They are convened by the Chairman of the
Board of Management. Any member of the Board of Management may also demand that a meeting be
held. The Board of Management makes decisions by a simple majority of the votes cast, except where
unanimity is required by law. In the event of a tie, the Chairman has the casting vote.
According to the Board of Management’s rules of procedure and schedule of duties, the Chairman bears
particular responsibility for leading and coordinating the Board’s work. He represents the company and
the Group in dealings with third parties and the workforce on matters relating to more than one part of
the company or the Group. He also bears special responsibility for certain departments of the Corporate
Center and their fields of activity.
The responsibilities of the members of the Board of Management were redistributed effective October 1,
2014. Under the schedule of duties as of that date, responsibility is assigned to one member for Strategy and Portfolio Management; to one member for Finance; to one member for Human Resources, Technology and Sustainability (this member also serving as the Labor Director); and to one member for
Innovation. In addition, three of the members are each responsible for a particular geographical region.

18. Corporate Governance Report

No committees of the Board of Management have been set up in view of the small number of members
and the role of Bayer AG as a strategic management holding company.
SUPERVISORY BOARD: OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS
The role of the 20-member Supervisory Board is to oversee and advise the Board of Management. Under
the German Codetermination Act, half the members of the Supervisory Board are elected by the stockholders, and half by the company’s employees. The Supervisory Board is directly involved in decisions on
matters of fundamental importance to the company, regularly conferring with the Board of Management
on the company’s strategic alignment and the implementation status of the business strategy.
The Chairman of the Supervisory Board coordinates its work and presides over the meetings. Through
regular discussions with the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board is kept constantly informed
of business policy, corporate planning and strategy. The Supervisory Board approves the annual budget
and financial framework. It also approves the financial statements of Bayer AG and the consolidated
financial statements of the Bayer Group, along with the combined management report, taking into account the reports by the auditor.
COMMITTEES OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
The Supervisory Board currently has the following committees:
Presidial Committee: This comprises the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Supervisory Board along
with a further stockholder representative and a further employee representative. The Presidial Committee serves primarily as the mediation committee pursuant to the German Codetermination Act. It has the
task of submitting proposals to the Supervisory Board on the appointment of members of the Board of
Management if the necessary two-thirds majority is not achieved in the first vote at a plenary meeting.
Certain decision-making powers in connection with capital measures, including the power to amend the
Articles of Incorporation accordingly, have also been delegated to this committee.
Audit Committee: The Audit Committee comprises three stockholder representatives and three employee representatives. The Chairman of the Audit Committee in 2014, Dr. Klaus Sturany, satisfies the
statutory requirements concerning the independence and the expertise in the field of accounting or
auditing that a member of the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee is required to possess. The
Audit Committee meets regularly four times a year. Its tasks include examining the company’s financial reporting along with the financial statements of Bayer AG, the consolidated financial statements of
the Bayer Group, the combined management report, the proposal for the use of the distributable profit
of Bayer AG, and the interim financial statements and management reports of the Bayer Group, all of
which are prepared by the Board of Management. On the basis of the auditor’s report on the audit of
the financial statements of Bayer AG, the consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group and the
combined management report, the Audit Committee develops proposals concerning the approval of
the statements by the full Supervisory Board. The Audit Committee is also responsible for the company’s relationship with the external auditor. The Audit Committee submits a proposal to the full Supervisory Board concerning the auditor’s appointment, prepares the awarding of the audit contract to the
audit firm appointed by the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting, suggests areas of focus for the audit and
determines the auditor’s remuneration. It also monitors the independence, qualifications, rotation and
efficiency of the auditor.
In addition, the Audit Committee oversees the company’s internal control system – along with the
procedures used to identify, track and manage risk – and the internal audit system. It also deals with
corporate compliance issues and discusses developments in this area at each of its meetings.

Human Resources Committee: On this committee, too, there is parity of representation between
stockholders and employees. It consists of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and three other
members. The Human Resources Committee prepares the personnel decisions of the full Supervisory
Board, which resolves on appointments or dismissals of members of the Board of Management. The
Human Resources Committee resolves on behalf of the Supervisory Board on the service contracts of
the members of the Board of Management. However, it is the task of the full Supervisory Board to
resolve on the total compensation of the individual members of the Board of Management and the
respective compensation components, as well as to regularly review the compensation system on the
basis of recommendations submitted by the Human Resources Committee. The Human Resources
Committee also discusses the long-term succession planning for the Board of Management.
Nominations Committee: This committee carries out preparatory work when an election of stockholder
representatives to the Supervisory Board is to be held. It suggests suitable candidates for the Supervisory Board to propose to the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting for election. The Nominations Committee
comprises the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the other stockholder representative on the Presidial Committee.
Detailed information on the work of the Supervisory Board and its committees is provided in the Report
of the Supervisory Board on page 34ff. of this Annual Report.
OBJECTIVES FOR THE COMPOSITION OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
The Supervisory Board should be composed in such a way that its members together possess the necessary expertise, skills and professional experience to properly perform their duties. In view of Bayer AG’s
global operations, the Supervisory Board has set itself the goal of always having several members with
international business experience or an international background. A further objective concerning the
composition of the Supervisory Board is that, absent special circumstances, a member should not hold
office beyond the end of the next Annual Stockholders’ Meeting following his or her 72nd birthday.
With a view to avoiding potential conflicts of interest, the Supervisory Board has set itself the goal that
more than half of the stockholder representatives be independent and also that at least three quarters of
the total Supervisory Board membership (stockholder and employee representatives) be independent.
The Supervisory Board assesses the independence of its members according to the recommendation
contained in Section 5.4.2 of the German Corporate Governance Code. In assessing independence, the
Supervisory Board also considers the criteria given in the recommendation of the European Commission
of February 15, 20051.
Another goal for the composition of the Supervisory Board is that women continue to account for at
least 20% of the members of the Supervisory Board in the medium term, subject to any future changes
in the law, and that the female membership be distributed as evenly as possible between the stockholder and employee groups.
The goals described refer to the Supervisory Board as a whole unless resolved otherwise. However,
since the Supervisory Board can only nominate candidates for election as stockholder representatives, it
can only take the targets into account in these nominations.
Implementation status of the objectives
Taking into account the new appointments in 2014, the Supervisory Board continues to have several
members with international business experience and other international connections. The objective that
a member should step down from the Supervisory Board at the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting following
his or her 72nd birthday is being met. One member, Ernst-Ludwig Winnacker, who has been elected to
serve until the Annual Stockholders' Meeting in 2016, had already reached 72 years of age at the time
of the Annual Stockholders' Meeting 2014. However, he was proposed for reelection at that Meeting so
that the Supervisory Board would continue to have one member with particular expertise in research
until one or more members with similar experience can be appointed. One member of the Supervisory
Board, Werner Wenning, was the Chairman of the company’s Board of Management until 2010. One

member, Ernst-Ludwig Winnacker, has been a member of the Supervisory Board since 1997, and thus
has served more than three terms of office. However, neither Werner Wenning nor Ernst-Ludwig
Winnacker has any personal or business relationship with the company or a governance body of the
company that in the opinion of the Supervisory Board gives rise to a material conflict of interest of a
more than temporary nature. In 2014 the proportion of women on the Supervisory Board reached the
target of 20% set by the Supervisory Board itself for the minimum percentage of women members.
DISCLOSURE OF SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS BY MEMBERS OF THE BOARD

COMMON VALUES AND LEADERSHIP PRINCIPLES
Bayer has committed itself to the values of Leadership, Integrity, Flexibility and Efficiency, or “life” for
short. These values provide guidance to all Bayer employees, both in business dealings and in working
together within the company. All employees are obligated to align their work to the life values. This is
taken into account in human resources development and the regular performance evaluations.
SYSTEMATIC RISK MANAGEMENT
The established internal control system enables the company to identify any business or financial risks
at an early stage and take appropriate action to manage them. This control system is designed to ensure
that risks are monitored in a timely manner, all business transactions are properly accounted for, and
reliable data on the company’s financial position is always available.
When acquisitions are made, we aim to bring the acquired units’ internal control systems into line with
those of the Bayer Group as quickly as possible.
However, the control and risk management system cannot provide absolute protection against losses
arising from business risks or fraudulent actions.
DETAILED REPORTING
To maximize transparency, we provide regular and timely information on the Group’s position and significant changes in business activities to stockholders, financial analysts, stockholders’ associations, the
media and the general public. Bayer complies with the recommendations of the Corporate Governance
Code by publishing reports on business trends, financial position, results of operations and related risks
four times a year.
In line with statutory requirements, the members of the Group Management Board provide an assurance that, to the best of their knowledge, the financial statements of Bayer AG, the consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group and the combined management report provide a true and fair view.
The financial statements of Bayer AG, the consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group and
the combined management report are published within 90 days following the end of each fiscal year.
During the fiscal year, stockholders and other interested parties are kept informed of developments by
means of the half-year financial report and additional interim reports for the first and third quarters.
The half-year financial report is voluntarily subjected to an audit review by the auditor, whose appointment by the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting also relates specifically to this audit review.
Bayer also provides information at news conferences and analysts’ meetings. In addition, the company
uses the internet as a platform for timely disclosure of information, including details of the dates of
major publications and events, such as the annual report, quarterly financial reports (Stockholders'
Newsletters) or the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting.
In line with the principle of fair disclosure, all stockholders and other principal target groups are
treated equally as regards the communication of valuation-relevant information. All significant new facts
are disclosed immediately to the general public. Stockholders also have immediate access to the information that Bayer publishes locally in compliance with the stock market regulations of various countries.
In addition to our regular reporting, we issue ad-hoc statements on developments that otherwise might
not become publicly known but have the potential to materially affect the price of Bayer stock.

18.3 Compliance
Bayer manages its businesses responsibly and in compliance with the statutory and regulatory requirements of the countries in which it operates.
We define compliance as legally and ethically impeccable conduct by all employees in their daily work –
because the way they carry out their duties affects the company’s reputation. Bayer does not tolerate
any violation of applicable laws, relevant codes of conduct or internal regulations.
The Board of Management is unreservedly committed to corporate compliance and Bayer will forgo any
business transaction that would violate our compliance principles. These principles are enshrined in our
Corporate Compliance Policy, which is available in 42 languages. This document details our commitment to fair competition, integrity in business dealings including zero tolerance of corruption, the principles of sustainability and product stewardship, the upholding of foreign trade laws and insider trading
laws, the separation of business and private interests, proper record-keeping and transparent financial
reporting, fair and respectful working conditions, and avoidance of all forms of discrimination. Every
employee is required to immediately report any infringement of the Corporate Compliance Policy (except in France where this requirement does not apply due to national law). Managerial employees have
a vital part to play in implementing the Corporate Compliance Policy. As role models, they must help to
ensure that this important code of conduct is adhered to in practice. Managers may lose their entitlement to variable compensation components and be subject to disciplinary measures if systematic violations of applicable law entailing loss or damage to Bayer have occurred in their sphere of responsibility
and could have been prevented if they had taken appropriate action. Compliant and lawful conduct
forms part of the performance evaluations of all managerial employees.
Bayer’s Corporate Audit department regularly verifies adherence to the Corporate Compliance Policy. In
2014, 219 audits, including 62 compliance audits, were performed on the basis of a risk-oriented audit
plan that takes potential corruption and other risks into account. Such audits were either preventive or
incident-related. Observance of the Corporate Compliance Policy is also a focus of all regular audits.
The head of Corporate Audit regularly attends the meetings of the Audit Committee of the Supervisory
Board and provides it with a list of conducted audits and their outcomes at least once a year.
The head of the Bayer Group’s compliance organization is the Group Compliance Officer, who regularly
reports directly to the Chairman of the Board of Management and to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board. A central compliance department supports the Group Compliance Officer in steering and
implementing the Group-wide compliance activities. Each subgroup and service company has its own
compliance officer, who is responsible for ensuring its adherence to Group-wide standards and to any
applicable subgroup- or industry-specific standards. There is a central Compliance Officer for each
country and country group, supported where necessary by further compliance functions, to advise employees on lawful and ethically correct behavior in business-related situations.
The compliance organization operates in accordance with international standards such as the oecd
Recommendations of the Council for Further Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.
Compliance is crucial to the success of our business. Bayer adopted a Group-wide Compliance Charter
in 2013 to integrate compliance even more closely into all operating units and their work processes.

» TABLE OF CONTENTS COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT
Bayer Annual Report 2014
Combined Management Report
18. Corporate Governance Report

As part of the Charter's implementation we have launched the Group-wide Integrated Compliance Management (icm) project to turn the compliance organization's role into that of a proactive and preventive
business partner. icm fosters close, systematic collaboration between the compliance experts and the
managers responsible for business operations in order to identify business-relevant risk areas and minimize existing risks. We plan to carry out comprehensive, preemptive risk assessments in all three subgroups by the end of 2015. The project also includes regular self-monitoring by the operational business
units based on appropriate auditing and inspection procedures. icm is focused on the areas of antitrust
law, anticorruption measures, export controls, conflicts of interest, insider trading, antidiscrimination
policies and data privacy.

See Chapter 1.3
for Group targets

online annex 3-18.3-1
A systematic process is in place involving roundtable meetings to discuss identified compliance risks
and coordinate steps to avert them. The participants in these roundtables are the respective compliance functions and the managers responsible for the business concerned. The results of the
roundtables are entered and tracked in a Group-wide compliance risk management database. 65
roundtables were held following their introduction in May 2014.
Group-wide training programs tailored to requirements and target groups, along with extensive communications activities, help to raise the employees' awareness for compliance issues and the risks these
involve.
online annex 3-18.3-2
Our training and communications activities are designed to support our employees by explaining to
them the significance of compliance and how important it is to the company that the respective rules
be observed. The goal is also to ensure that employees do not overstep boundaries out of ignorance
or uncertainty. Our subject-specific communication and training activities reflect the icm focus areas.
The compliance training courses are available in various formats to meet the needs of different employee groups. Some take the form of web-based training (wbt) programs, while others are face-toface training sessions or workshops.
In 2014, 36,288 Bayer managers, or 94% of the global total, took at least one compliance trainng
course. Starting in 2015, all managers worldwide are to receive compliance training at least annually,
depending on their risk category, in line with our Group target.
In 2014 we also implemented a new global web-based training program in 75 countries on the subject of antitrust violations. This program, available in 10 languages, has already been completed by
27,435 employees.
In addition, we have developed a standardized web-based training program for new hires incorporating basic information on the subjects of compliance, anticorruption measures and antitrust law. This
program was completed by 3,145 newly hired employees in 2014.
In view of the particularly strict compliance rules in the area of health care, special training courses
have been developed for our HealthCare subgroup. These courses are based on a global directive,
the Bayer HealthCare Anti-Corruption Compliance Manual, which applies to all divisions of
HealthCare. The training courses outline the minimum requirements to be observed throughout the
world when working with HealthCare's principal stakeholders, such as physicians, hospitals or patient organizations. These minimum standards are based on laws, industry codes and in-house regulations. The courses not only explain general compliance principles but also give specific instructions
in relation to non-reciprocal benefits and the exchange of services with health care professionals.

We again ran an extensive communication campaign about compliance in 2014, aimed at providing
all employees with more detailed information, explaining who is now available to advise them under
the new partnering concept, and raising awareness for compliance-critical situations. A quarterly
newsletter for employees is published on the compliance intranet site.
The communications activities in 2014 mainly focused on avoiding corruption or antitrust violations.
Apart from specific training programs there was an interactive quiz on both topics along with inhouse publications such as flyers and articles, and videos accessible via Bayer News Channel or the
compliance website.
Compliance violations can be reported – anonymously if desired – via compliance hotlines that have
been set up worldwide. In 2014 the compliance organization registered 70 reports via the central compliance hotline and email address. Of these, 14 were from Germany and 56 from other countries. 60
reports were received by email (17 of them anonymously) and 10 by telephone (eight of these anonymously). Suspected compliance violations may also be reported to the Compliance Officers, to Bayer’s
Corporate Audit department or via local hotlines set up by the country organizations.
All suspected compliance violations in the Group are recorded according to uniform criteria and dealt
with according to the rules set forth in the Directive on the Management of Compliance Incidents.
online annex 3-18.3-3
Where an investigation confirms that a compliance violation has occurred, the company has a graduated set of measures at its disposal. These include a verbal or written warning, transfer to a different
unit, cancellation of a planned promotion, a reduction in the short-term incentive payment, downgrading to a lower collectively agreed pay rate or managerial contract level, or ordinary or extraordinary termination. This does not preclude the company from asserting further claims against the employee for cost reimbursement or damages or initiating a criminal prosecution. The action taken in a
particular case depends on the gravity of the compliance violation and on applicable law.

18.4 Compensation Report
The Compensation Report describes the essential features of the compensation system for the members
of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board and explains the compensation of the individual members. The report conforms to the requirements of the German Commercial Code including the
principles of German Accounting Standard No. 17 (drs 17). It also complies with the recommendations
of the German Corporate Governance Code and the International Financial Reporting Standards (ifrs).

18.4.1 Compensation of the Board of Management
OBJECTIVES
The structure of the compensation system for the Board of Management of Bayer AG is aimed at ensuring performance-oriented corporate governance and a long-term increase in the company’s value. The
core elements of the system include fixed compensation, which takes into account the tasks and duties
of the Board of Management members, and an incentivized component – the short-term incentive
(sti) –, which depends on the attainment of the annual corporate performance targets. In addition to the
compensation directly related to each year of service, there are two long-term stock-based components
that are directly related to the development of Bayer’s share price over time and thus are intended to
create an incentive for a sustained commitment to the company. The system is also designed to enable
the company to successfully compete for highly qualified executives and to ensure statutory and regulatory compliance. Board of Management compensation is in line with the basic principles of the compensation structure for managerial employees in the Bayer Group. The appropriateness of the system and
the compensation level are regularly reviewed by the Supervisory Board, which then makes any necessary adjustments.

COMPENSATION STRUCTURE
The compensation paid to the members of the Board of Management includes both non-performancerelated and performance-related components. The compensation structure, based on average total
annual compensation and 100% target attainment, is as follows:

Short-term variable

~ 30% Virtual shares

excluding fringe beneﬁ ts and pension entitlements

The non-performance-related compensation comprises the fixed annual compensation along with fringe
benefits. The performance-related compensation partly comprises a variable component (sti), of which
50% takes the form of short-term variable cash compensation and 50% consists of long-term cash
compensation involving a grant of virtual Bayer shares that are retained for three years. The other performance-related compensation component serving as a long-term incentive is the stock-based cash
compensation program Aspire, where a four-year retention period applies.
The individual performance-related components are capped at the grant date. To comply with the
recommendation newly included in the 2013 version of the German Corporate Governance Code, caps
have also been agreed for the disbursement of the performance-related components and for the compensation as a whole (total of the annual fixed compensation and the variable components) with effect
from the fiscal year 2014. The cap on the total compensation is 1.8 times the respective target compensation and is determined annually when the fixed compensation is set.
The members of the Board of Management also receive pension entitlements for themselves and their
surviving dependents.
Non-performance-related components
Fixed annual compensation
The level of the non-performance-related, fixed annual compensation takes into account the functions
and responsibilities assigned to the members of the Board of Management as well as market conditions.
The fixed compensation is regularly reviewed by the Supervisory Board in light of the consumer price
indexes and adjusted if necessary. It is paid out in twelve monthly installments.
Fringe benefits
This component mainly includes perquisites such as a company car with driver or the use of the company carpool, payments toward the cost of security equipment, and the reimbursement of the cost of
annual health screening examinations. Fringe benefits are reported at cost or the amount of the pecuniary advantage gained.

Bayer Annual Report 2014

Performance-related components
Short-term variable cash compensation
The short-term variable compensation (short-term incentive, or sti) is based on a set percentage of
the fixed annual compensation (target value). This amount is adjusted according to the target attainments of the Bayer Group, the subgroups and the individual Board of Management member.
The Group component is determined in relation to core earnings per share of the Group, while the subgroup components are governed by the weighted average target attainments of the HealthCare, CropScience and MaterialScience subgroups. The annual subgroup targets are derived from the respective
business strategies and operational priorities. The target attainment for HealthCare and CropScience is
mainly based on the comparison of target and actual values for the ebitda margin before special items
and sales growth. At MaterialScience it is measured in terms of the cash flow return on investment
(cfroi). Target attainment also takes into account qualitative objectives including safety, compliance
and sustainability aspects.
The target attainment for the individual component of the variable compensation is determined by the
Supervisory Board. One half of the sti for each year is paid out in the second quarter of the following
year, while the other half is granted in the form of virtual Bayer shares.

Long-term variable cash compensation based on virtual Bayer shares
Both the number of virtual shares granted and the amount of the payment at the end of a three-year
retention period are based on the average official closing price of Bayer shares over the last 30 trading
days of the respective year in the Xetra system of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. A cash payment with
respect to the number of virtual shares held is made at the end of the three-year period according to the
market price of Bayer shares at that time. In addition, the members of the Board of Management receive
an amount equal to the total dividends paid on the equivalent number of real shares during the period.
Payment is made in January of the year following the end of the three-year period. This payment is
capped at 200% of the amount converted into virtual shares at the beginning of the three-year period.
No option exists for the Board of Management members to extend the retention period or defer the
payout. When a member leaves the Board of Management, the retention period for two-thirds of each
tranche is shortened to two years. If the member leaves during a fiscal year, payment is made immediately with respect to two-thirds of any tranche that has already been retained for more than two years.
The remaining one-third of each tranche continues to be subject to the three-year retention period.

Long-term stock-based cash compensation (Aspire I)
Members of the Board of Management are eligible to participate in the annual tranches of the long-term
stock-based compensation program Aspire i (“Aspire”) on condition that they purchase a certain number of Bayer shares – determined for each individual according to specific guidelines – as a personal
investment and for as long as they continue in the service of the Bayer Group. The payments made
under this program are based on the Aspire Target Opportunity, which is a contractually agreed percentage of fixed annual compensation. Depending on the performance of Bayer stock, both in absolute
terms and relative to the euro stoxx 50 benchmark index, participants are granted an award of between 0% and 300% of their individual Aspire Target Opportunity at the end of the respective performance period. The payout / performance matrix according to the absolute and relative development of
Bayer’s share price is explained at http://www.investor.bayer.com/en/stock/stock-programs/aspire/.

performance period

When a member of the Board of Management retires, current tranches may be shortened, thus reducing
their value. In this case, tranches up to the one issued in 2011 are shortened on a pro-rated basis according to the duration of the member’s active service on the Board of Management during the period
of the tranche; tranches issued in 2012 or later are shortened according to the duration of the member’s
active service on the Board of Management during the first year of the tranche.
Expanded Share Ownership Guidelines
On top of the requirement for participants in the Aspire program to make a personal investment in Bayer
shares, the members of the Board of Management have undertaken to comply with expanded Share
Ownership Guidelines. These require the Chairman of the Board of Management to build a position in
Bayer shares to the value of 150% of his fixed annual compensation, and the other members to the value
of 100% of their fixed annual salaries, within four years and to continue to hold them for as long as they
remain Board of Management members. Half the number of virtual shares granted to them through conversion of 50% of the sti into virtual shares counts toward this position. The Board of Management
members must provide documentary evidence of their compliance with this obligation for the first time
at the end of the four-year position-building period and again yearly thereafter. In the event of significant
changes in fixed annual compensation, the value to which shares are held must be adjusted accordingly.
Pension entitlements (retirement and surviving dependents‘ pensions)
The members of the Board of Management appointed prior to 2013 are generally entitled to receive a
lifelong company pension after leaving the Bayer Group, though not before the age of 60. This pension
is normally paid out in the form of a monthly life annuity. Dr. Marijn Dekkers has the option to receive a
capital sum in place of an annuity.
The annual pension granted equals at least 15% of final fixed annual compensation. This percentage
can increase with continuing service on the Board of Management up to a maximum of 60%. The arrangements for surviving dependents basically provide for a widow’s pension amounting to 60% of the
member's pension entitlement and an orphan's pension amounting to 15% of the member's pension
entitlement for each child.

Future pension payments are annually reviewed and adjusted based on the development of consumer
prices. Pension rights are suspended if a Management Board member works for a competitor of
Bayer AG or of another Group company before the age of 65 without the prior written consent of the
Supervisory Board.
The annual pension entitlement for members of the Board of Management appointed in 2013 or thereafter is based on contributions. Bayer provides a hypothetical contribution amounting to 33% of the
respective fixed compensation each year. This percentage is comprised of a 6% basic contribution and
a 27% matching contribution – three times the member’s personal contribution of 9%. The total annual
contribution is converted into a pension module according to the annuity table for the applicable tariff
of the Rheinische Pensionskasse VVaG pension fund. The annual pension entitlement upon retirement
(at 62 years of age at the earliest) is the total amount of the accumulated pension modules including an
investment bonus. The investment bonus is determined annually based on the net return on the assets
of the Rheinische Pensionskasse VVaG minus the minimum return on the contributions that is guaranteed under the tariff and approved by the German Financial Supervisory Authority. Kemal Malik has
been granted, in addition, a vested entitlement to a fixed annual pension of €80 thousand starting
on his 65th birthday. This is subject to a pro-rated reduction in the event that his term of office ends
prior to his 65th birthday under certain conditions.
The ultimate pension entitlement cannot be precisely determined in advance. It depends on the development of the member’s compensation, the number of years of service on the Board of Management
and the return on the assets of the Rheinische Pensionskasse VVaG. We currently estimate the achievable total pension entitlement at approximately 45% of a member's annual fixed compensation immediately prior to retirement, with roughly 38% financed by the company and 7% by the member of the
Board of Management.
Certain assets are administered by Bayer Pension Trust e.V. under a contractual trust arrangement (cta),
providing substantial additional security for pension obligations resulting from direct commitments for
the members of the Board of Management in Germany.
Benefits upon termination of service on the Board of Management
Post-contractual non-compete agreements
Post-contractual non-compete agreements exist with the members of the Board of Management, providing for compensatory payments to be made by the company for the two-year duration of these agreements. For the members newly appointed to the Board of Management on or after January 1, 2010, the
compensatory payment is 100% of the average fixed compensation for the twelve months preceding
their departure. The post-contractual non-compete agreement with Dr. Marijn Dekkers was rescinded
without compensation when his service contract was extended in June 2014 in line with previous practice in a similar case.
Change of control
Agreements exist with the members of the Board of Management providing for severance payments to
be made in certain circumstances in the event of a change in control. The amount of any possible severance payments in the case of early termination of service on the Board of Management as a result of a
change in control is limited to the value of three years’ compensation in line with the recommendation
in Section 4.2.3 of the German Corporate Governance Code. Such payments do not exceed the compensation payable for the remaining term of the service contract.

Unfitness for work
In the event of temporary unfitness for work, members of the Board of Management continue to receive
the contractually agreed compensation. Bayer AG may early terminate the service contract if the member has been continuously unfit for work for at least 18 months and is likely to be permanently incapable of fully performing his duties (permanent incapacity to work). A disability pension is paid in the
event of contract termination before the age of 60 due to permanent incapacity to work. For the members appointed to the Board of Management prior to 2013, the disability pension, like the retirement
pension, amounts to at least 15% of the final fixed compensation and can increase with continuing
service on the Board of Management up to a maximum of 60%. For members of the Board of Management appointed in 2013 or thereafter, the amount of the disability pension under the service contract
corresponds to the entitlement accrued on the date of contract termination, taking into account a fictitious period of service between that date and the member’s 55th birthday where applicable.
COMPENSATION OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT IN 2014
The aggregate compensation for the members of the Board of Management in 2014 totaled €15,648
thousand (2013: €13,563 thousand), comprising €4,561 thousand (2013: €3,956 thousand) in nonperformance-related components and €11,087 thousand (2013: €9,607 thousand) in performancerelated components. The pension service cost amounted to €1,385 thousand (2013: €1,271 thousand).
The following changes in the membership of the Board of Management or the terms of office of the
members occurred in 2014:
The Chairman of the Board of Management, Dr. Marijn Dekkers, extended his contract by two years
until December 31, 2016, upon the expiration of his initial five-year term of office.
Effective February 1, 2014, Kemal Malik was appointed to the Board of Management of Bayer AG. Effective April 30, 2014, he succeeded Prof. Wolfgang Plischke, who retired as of midnight on April 29, 2014.
By resolution of the Supervisory Board, Werner Baumann, previously Chief Financial Officer (cfo), was
appointed Chief Strategy and Portfolio Officer (cspo) effective October 1, 2014. Werner Baumann's
current contract runs until December 31, 2017.
Johannes Dietsch, previously Senior Bayer Representative and cfo for Greater China, based in Shanghai, was appointed to the Board of Management of Bayer AG effective September 1, 2014. He assumed
the office of Chief Financial Officer effective October 1, 2014.

Long-term variable cash compensation based on virtual Bayer shares
The conversion of 50% of the sti for 2014 into virtual Bayer shares was based on an average price of
€115.66 (2013: €96.96).
The long-term variable cash compensation based on virtual Bayer shares that is included in the
aggregate compensation according to the German Commercial Code was valued at €5,058 thousand
(2013: €3,976 thousand). The aggregate compensation according to the ifrs also includes a change of
€1,559 thousand (2013: €5,030 thousand) in the value of existing entitlements.
Provisions of €17,775 thousand (2013: €18,310 thousand) existed as of December 31, 2014, for the
future cash disbursements to currently serving members of the Board of Management based on the
virtual Bayer shares granted in the respective year. This amount also contains the dividend attributable
to the respective prior year.
Long-term stock-based cash compensation (Aspire)
The long-term stock-based cash compensation under the Aspire program is included in the aggregate
compensation according to the German Commercial Code at its fair value of €978 thousand (2013:
€919 thousand) at the respective grant date.
According to the ifrs, the aggregate compensation includes the fair value of the partial entitlement
earned in the respective year. Grants of stock-based compensation with a four-year performance period
are therefore expensed at their respective fair values over four years starting with the grant year. The
aggregate compensation according to the ifrs also includes the change in the value of existing entitlements under ongoing Aspire tranches granted in prior years.

The prior-year figures have been restated due to an amendment contained in the June 24, 2014 version of the German Corporate Governance Code.
The short-term variable cash compensation is now allocated to the year in which it is granted rather than the year of disbursement.
1 The payment to Michael König from the 2010 Aspire tranche related to a vesting period that began before he joined the Board of Management.
The tranche was not yet fully vested at the date on which he joined the Board of Management.

18.4.3 Compensation of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board is compensated according to the relevant provisions of the Articles of Incorporation.
The members of the Supervisory Board receive fixed annual compensation of €120,000 plus reimbursement of their expenses.
In accordance with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, additional compensation is paid to the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Supervisory Board and for chairing and
membership of committees. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board receives fixed annual compensation of €360,000, the Vice Chairman €240,000. These amounts also cover membership and chairmanship of committees. The other members receive additional compensation for committee membership.
The chairman of the Audit Committee receives an additional €120,000, the other members of the Audit
Committee €60,000 each. The chairmen of the remaining committees receive €60,000 each, the other
members of those committees €30,000 each. No additional compensation is paid for membership of the
Nominations Committee. A Supervisory Board member who is a member of more than two committees
receives compensation only for the two committees with the highest compensation. If changes are made
to the Supervisory Board and / or its committees during the year, members receive compensation on a
pro-rated basis. The members of the Supervisory Board also receive an attendance fee of €1,000 each
time they personally attend a meeting of the Supervisory Board or a committee. The attendance fee is
limited to €1,000 per day.

The members of the Supervisory Board have given a voluntary pledge that they will each purchase
Bayer shares for 25% of their fixed compensation, including any compensation for committee membership (before taxes), and hold these shares for as long as they remain members of the Supervisory Board.
This does not apply to members who transfer at least 85% of their fixed compensation to the Hans
Böckler Foundation in accordance with the rules of the German Trade Union Confederation or whose
service or employment contract with a company requires them to transfer such compensation to that
company. If less than 85% of the fixed compensation is transferred, the voluntary pledge applies to the
portion not transferred. By voluntarily pledging to invest in and hold Bayer shares, the Supervisory
Board members reinforce their interest in the long-term, sustainable success of the company.

Prof. Wiestler’s office as Chairman of the Management Board of the German Cancer Research Center precludes his acceptance of compensation
for membership of the Supervisory Board.

In addition to their compensation as members of the Supervisory Board, those employee representatives
who are employees of Bayer Group companies receive compensation unrelated to their service on the
Supervisory Board. The total amount of such compensation in 2014 was €737 thousand (2013:
€727 thousand).
No compensation was paid or benefits granted to members of the Supervisory Board for personally
performed services such as consultancy or agency services. The company has purchased insurance for
the members of the Supervisory Board to cover their personal liability arising from their service on the
Supervisory Board.

18.4.4 Further Information
ADVANCES OR LOANS TO MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT
OR SUPERVISORY BOARD
There were no advances or loans to members of the Board of Management or the Supervisory Board
outstanding as of December 31, 2014, nor at any time during 2014 or 2013.
PENSION PAYMENTS TO FORMER MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT OR THEIR
SURVIVING DEPENDENTS
We currently pay retired members of the Board of Management a monthly pension equal to a maximum
of 80% of the fixed compensation received immediately prior to retirement. The pensions paid to former members of the Board of Management or their surviving dependents are reassessed annually and
adjusted, taking into account the development of consumer prices. The pensions paid to former members of the Board of Management or their surviving dependents in 2014 totaled €13,457 thousand
(2013: €12,871 thousand). These benefits are in addition to any amounts they receive under previous
employee pension arrangements. The present value of the defined benefit pension obligation for former
members of the Board of Management and their surviving dependents according to the ifrs amounted
to €187,759 thousand (2013: €150,148 thousand), while the settlement value of the pension obligation
according to the German Commercial Code amounted to €146,341 thousand (2013: €136,307 thousand).

as of February 2015

The global economy will probably grow more quickly in 2015 than in the previous year, supported as
before by a generally expansionary monetary policy. Economic stimulus will also come from the sharp
decline in oil prices, which will provide consumer relief and stimulate consumption. On the other hand,
growth continues to be hampered in many countries by the high level of private and public indebtedness.
We expect the economic recovery in the European Union to continue – driven by low inflation and the
depreciation of the euro, and above all by the upswing in the United Kingdom. However, no significant
growth stimulus is expected from the German economy. Economic development in the countries of
southern Europe continues to be held back by high unemployment.
The United States economy is predicted to grow considerably faster than in 2014. There, the main driver of development will probably be private consumption, especially in light of the rapid increase in
employment.
The rate of expansion in the emerging countries is again likely to show a slight year-on-year decline. In
China, particularly, we foresee slower growth in view of industrial overcapacities. Russia is expected to
see a significant decline in economic activity due to an outflow of capital, economic sanctions and lower
oil export revenues.

estimate, except pharmaceuticals. Source for pharmaceuticals market: IMS Health, IMS Market Prognosis. Copyright 2015.
All rights reserved; currency-adjusted; 2014 data provisional
As of February 2015

HEALTHCARE
The pharmaceuticals market is likely to grow rather more slowly in 2015 than in the previous year,
especially because of the slightly lower growth rate predicted for this market in the United States.
Following double-digit growth in the u.s. last year due to new product introductions and health system
reforms, this market will probably expand at a somewhat slower rate in 2015, partly as a result of patent
expirations and launches of new generic products. We expect a further increase in the demand for
medicines in the emerging economies.
Growth in the consumer care market in 2015 is likely to be level with the previous year. We expect to
see slight shrinkage in the medical care market, with the diabetes care market weakening and the
market for contrast agents and medical equipment (Radiology business unit) matching the previous
year. The animal health market is anticipated to grow at about the same rate as in 2014.
CROPSCIENCE
Following the persistent dynamic growth in the global seed and crop protection market last year, we
anticipate a volatile market environment in 2015. Global inventories of most agricultural commodities are
predicted to increase in 2015, while prices will likely be buoyed by the steady rise in demand for food
and feed products. In 2015 we expect a slower rate of overall growth in the low single digits.
Latin America should continue to experience the strongest growth, though probably with a lower
growth rate than in the prior year. This region’s seed and crop protection market is mainly driven by
the steady expansion of soybean farming. In Asia / Pacific, too, we expect agricultural production to
continue to expand, though with markedly lower growth rates than in Latin America. Development in
this region will mainly depend on cereals and rice along with specialty crops such as fruit and vegetables. We expect markets in the industrialized regions of the northern hemisphere to show weaker
growth momentum than in 2014.

20. Future Perspectives

MATERIALSCIENCE
We expect the business climate for our principal customer industries to continue improving during
2015. The positive economic development in North America is again fueling hopes of an increase in
demand. On the other hand, the economic recovery in Europe will probably occur at a slower pace, with
lower rates of growth in our principal customer industries. We expect comparatively high growth rates
in Asia.
We expect growth in the automotive industry to be higher in 2015 than in the previous year. A persistently low oil price could contribute to positive development. Asia and North America will likely remain
the principal growth drivers, whereas the automotive sector faces challenges in some South American
and Eastern European countries.
The global construction industry will probably grow at the prior-year rate in 2015. We anticipate a
continued recovery in Europe. The prospects for North America and Asia are positive, and the investment climate in these regions should be stable. However, the economic development in Russia and
Brazil could have adverse effects.
We expect the global electrical / electronics industry to continue growing strongly in 2015. Demand is
likely to be driven by Asia, especially China and India. We predict positive development in North America, while growth in Europe is likely to remain slow.
We anticipate steady growth in the global furniture industry in 2015. In North America we expect to
see a robust increase in demand from which furniture manufacturers in Asia should also benefit. We
also anticipate gratifying business development in the domestic Asian market. We predict a continuing
recovery in the European furniture industry.

20.2 Forecast for Key Data
The following forecast is based on the business development described in this report, taking into account the potential risks and opportunities and assuming the inclusion of the MaterialScience business
for the full year.
BAYER GROUP
Our forecast for fiscal 2015 is based on the exchange rates as of December 31, 2014, including a rate of
us$1.21 to the euro. A 1% appreciation (depreciation) of the euro against all other currencies would
decrease (increase) sales on an annual basis by some €300 million and ebitda before special items by
about €70 million.
We are planning sales in the region of €46 billion for 2015. This corresponds to a currency- and portfolio-adjusted increase in the low single digits. We expect currency effects to boost sales by approximately 3% compared with the prior year. We plan to raise ebitda before special items by a low- to mid-teens
percentage, allowing for expected positive currency effects of about 2%. We aim to increase core earnings per share (calculated as explained in Chapter 16.3 “Core Earnings Per Share”) by a low-teens percentage, allowing for expected positive currency effects of around 3%.

acquired consumer care businesses and the planned stock market listing of MaterialScience accounting
for most of this amount.

» TABLE OF CONTENTS COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT
Bayer Annual Report 2014
Combined Management Report
20. Future Perspectives

We intend to increase our research and development spending by about 10% in 2015 to more than €4.0
billion. We have budgeted capital expenditures of about €2.3 billion for property, plant and equipment
and €0.3 billion for intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization are estimated at about €3.0 billion,
including €1.6 billion in amortization of intangible assets.
We predict the financial result to come in at around minus €1.0 billion. The effective tax rate is likely to
be around 25%. We expect net financial debt to be below €18 billion at the end of 2015.
HEALTHCARE
At HealthCare we expect sales to post a mid-single-digit percentage increase on a currency- and portfolio-adjusted basis to approximately €23 billion. We predict positive currency effects of about 3% compared with 2014. We plan to raise ebitda before special items by a mid-teens percentage.
In the Pharmaceuticals segment, we expect sales to move ahead by a mid- to high-single-digit percentage on a currency- and portfolio-adjusted basis to approximately €13 billion. Here we anticipate positive
currency effects of about 2% compared with 2014. We intend to raise sales of our recently launched
products in 2015 toward €4 billion. We plan to raise ebitda before special items by a low-teens percentage, allowing for an additional €300 million of investment in research and development. We therefore
expect to slightly improve the ebitda margin before special items.
In the Consumer Health segment, we expect sales to increase toward €10 billion, including those of the
acquired consumer care businesses. We plan to grow sales by a mid-single-digit percentage on a currency- and portfolio-adjusted basis. Here we anticipate positive currency effects of around 3% compared with 2014. We expect to raise ebitda before special items by a mid-to-high-twenties percentage,
with the acquired consumer care businesses contributing to the increase.
CROPSCIENCE
At CropScience we expect to continue growing faster than the market and to raise sales by a low- to
mid-single-digit percentage on a currency- and portfolio-adjusted basis to approximately €10 billion. We
anticipate positive currency effects of about 4% compared with 2014. We plan to improve ebitda before
special items by a low- to mid-single-digit percentage.
MATERIALSCIENCE
At MaterialScience we are planning further volume growth in 2015 accompanied by declining selling
prices, leading to lower sales. However, we expect to see a significant increase in ebitda before special
items. We aim to return to earning the full cost of capital in 2015.
RECONCILIATION
In 2015 we expect sales on a currency- and portfolio-adjusted basis to be level with the previous year.
We are planning ebitda before special items of approximately minus €0.3 billion.
BAYER AG
As the holding company for the Bayer Group, Bayer AG derives most of its income from its subsidiaries.
The earnings of the major subsidiaries in Germany are transferred directly to Bayer AG under profit and
loss transfer agreements. The earnings of Bayer AG are therefore expected to reflect the positive business development anticipated in the Bayer Group. A concerted dividend policy within the Group ensures
the availability of sufficient distributable income. We expect an increase in net interest expense due to
the higher level of net debt. Based on these factors, we expect Bayer AG to report a distributable profit
that will again enable our stockholders to adequately participate in the Bayer Group’s earnings.

The entrepreneurial decisions we make daily in the course of business processes are based on balancing opportunities and risks. We therefore regard risk management as an integral part of our business
management system rather than the task of a specific organizational unit. Our risk management begins
with our strategy and planning processes, from which relevant external and internal opportunities and
risks of an economic, ecological or social nature are derived. Opportunities and risks are identified by
observing and analyzing trends along with macroeconomic, industry-specific, regional and local developments. The identified opportunities and risks are subsequently evaluated and incorporated into the
subgroup-specific strategic and operational frameworks. We attempt to avoid or mitigate risks by taking
appropriate countermeasures, or to transfer them to third parties (such as insurers) to the extent possible and economically acceptable. We consciously accept and bear manageable and controllable risks
that are in reasonable proportion to the anticipated opportunities. We regard them as a general risk of
doing business. Opportunities and risks are continuously monitored using indicators so that, for example, changes in the economic or legal environment can be identified at an early stage and suitable countermeasures can be initiated if necessary.

20. Future Perspectives

To enable the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board to monitor material business risks as
legally required, the following systems are in place: an internal control system ensuring proper and
effective financial reporting pursuant to Section 289 Paragraph 5 and Section 315 Paragraph 2 No. 5 of
the German Commercial Code; a compliance management system; and a risk early warning system
pursuant to Section 91 Paragraph 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act.
The various management systems are based on different risk types, risk levels and timelines. Different
processes, methods and it systems are therefore applied to identify, evaluate, manage, and monitor
risks. The principles underlying the various systems are documented in Group directives that are integrated into our central document control process (Margo) and are accessible to all employees via the
Bayer intranet. In the subgroups, service companies, subsidiaries, and in the central functions of the
Bayer Group, responsible persons and coordinators for the respective systems are named at the management level. The overall responsibility for the effectiveness and appropriateness of the systems lies
with the Chief Financial Officer.
The different systems are described below.
INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM FOR (GROUP) ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING
(report pursuant to Sections 289 Paragraph 5 and 315 Paragraph 2 No. 5 of the German Commercial
Code)
Bayer has an internal control system (ics) in place for the (Group) accounting and financial reporting
process. This process comprises defined structures and workflows implemented throughout the organization. The purpose of our ics is to ensure proper and effective accounting and financial reporting in
accordance with Section 289 Paragraph 5 and Section 315 Paragraph 2 No. 5 of the German Commercial Code.
The ics is designed to guarantee timely, uniform and accurate accounting for all business processes and
transactions based on applicable statutory regulations, accounting and financial reporting standards and
the internal Group directives that are binding upon all consolidated companies.
The ics is based on the coso i (Committee of the Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) and cobit (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology) frameworks and addresses
misreporting risks in the consolidated financial statements. Risks are identified and evaluated, and steps
are taken to counter them. Mandatory ics standards such as system-based and manual reconciliation
processes and functional separation have been derived from these frameworks and promulgated
throughout the Group by the Group Accounting and Controlling unit of Bayer AG.
The management of each Group company holds responsibility for implementing the ics standards at the
local level. Using the Group’s own shared service centers, the Group companies prepare their financial
statements locally and transmit them with the aid of a data model that is standardized throughout the
Group and based on the Group accounting directive. This ensures the regulatory compliance of the
consolidated financial statements.
The effectiveness of the ics processes for accounting and financial reporting is evaluated based on a
cascaded self-assessment system that starts with the persons directly involved in the processes, then
involves the principal responsible managers and ends with the Group Management Board. The system
also makes use of internal and external audits. An it application in use throughout the Group ensures
uniform and audit-proof documentation and transparent presentation of all ics-relevant business processes, focusing especially on the relevant risks, controls and effectiveness evaluations.
The Group Management Board has confirmed the effective functioning of the internal control system for
accounting and financial reporting and the relevant criteria for the 2014 fiscal year. However, it should
be noted that an internal control system, irrespective of its design, cannot provide absolute assurance
that material misstatements in the accounting will be avoided or identified.

COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Our compliance management system is aimed at ensuring lawful, responsible and sustainable conduct
by our employees. It is designed to identify potential violations in advance and systematically prevent
their occurrence. The compliance management system thus contributes significantly to the integration
of compliance into our operating units and their processes.
In light of the Bayer Group’s diversified structure and international focus, we are active in different
industry sectors, markets and geographical regions worldwide, each of which has its own local legislation and industry codes. Compliance risks are identified by performing a trend analysis based on cases
reported from around the world. In 2014 we began implementing an integrated compliance management system worldwide. The compliance management system enhances the systematic and preventive
identification and assessment of risks. Risk identification is carried out both bottom-up via the country
organizations and top-down via the global functions, taking global, local and business-specific aspects
into account. In addition, compliance program audits are performed by the Corporate Audit department.
These audits proactively evaluate the implementation of the Corporate Compliance Policy in the country
organizations. All the results are discussed by the local business units, the local compliance officers and
representatives of the headquarters functions at a round table and are entered into a risk database.
RISK EARLY WARNING SYSTEM PURSUANT TO SECTION 91 PARAGRAPH 2 OF THE
GERMAN STOCK CORPORATION ACT
A process known as BayRisk has been established to enable the early identification of any adverse developments that are material and / or could endanger the company’s continued existence, thus satisfying
the legal requirements regarding an early warning system for corporate risks pursuant to Section 91
Paragraph 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act. A central unit within the Corporate Center establishes the framework and standards for the design of the Group’s risk early warning system.
The BayRisk process is organized decentrally, with each subgroup, service company and central function being responsible for identifying, evaluating, managing and reporting risks at an early stage. It not
only covers risks that could immediately impact our financial targets, but also those that could affect the
achievement of qualitative objectives such as our good reputation. The Life Science units provide the
information required for the BayRisk process from their own enterprise risk management systems. Risk
officers are appointed to evaluate, manage and monitor the identified risks according to both financial
and non-financial criteria.
Risks are evaluated using estimates of the likelihood of occurrence, the potential impact and their relevance for our external stakeholders. The following matrix illustrates the financial criteria for rating a
risk as high, medium or low.

All material risks and the respective countermeasures are documented in a Group-wide database. The
risk portfolio is reviewed three times a year. Significant changes must be promptly entered in the database and reported immediately to the Group Management Board. Details of the risk portfolio are documented in a management information system accessible to the members of the Group Leadership Circle.
A report on the risk portfolio is submitted to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board once a year.
PROCESS-INDEPENDENT MONITORING
The effectiveness of our management systems is audited and evaluated at regular intervals by Corporate
Audit, which performs an independent and objective audit function focused on verifying compliance
with laws and directives. Corporate Audit also supports the company in achieving its goals by systematically evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of governance, risk management and control processes
and helping to improve them. The selection of audit targets follows a risk-based approach. Corporate
Audit performs its tasks according to internationally recognized standards and performs reliable audit
services. This is confirmed by a quality assessment undertaken in 2012 by the American Institute of
Internal Auditors (iaa). A report on the internal control system and its effectiveness is presented annually to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.
Risks in the areas of occupational health and safety, plant safety, environmental protection and product
quality are assessed through specific hseq (health, safety, environment and quality) audits.
In addition, the external auditor, as part of its audit of the annual financial statements, assesses the
basic suitability of the early warning system for identifying at an early stage any risks that could endanger the company’s continued existence. The auditor regularly reports to the Group Management Board
and the Supervisory Board on the identification of any weaknesses in the internal control system.
Audit outcomes are taken into account in the continuous enhancement of our management processes.

20.3.2 Opportunities and Risks
As a global enterprise with a diversified portfolio, the Bayer Group is constantly exposed to a wide
range of internal or external developments or events that could significantly impact the achievement of
our financial and non-financial objectives.
This chapter outlines both opportunities and risks. Only those risks that are classified in our risk matrix
as “medium” or “high” are included. The risks are more highly aggregated here than in our internal
documentation. The sequence in which the risks are listed does not imply any order of significance. The
opportunities and risks described apply to all subgroups unless otherwise indicated.
BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
Ethical conduct is a matter of essential importance for society. Many stakeholders evaluate companies
according to whether they conduct themselves not just “legally,” – but also “legitimately.” The Bayer
Group is dedicated to sustainable development in all areas of its commercial activity. Any violations of
this voluntary commitment can result in adverse media reporting and thus lead to a negative public
perception of the Bayer Group. We counter this risk through responsible corporate management that is
geared toward generating not only economic but also ecological and societal benefit.

20. Future Perspectives

In the Emerging Markets – particularly Asia and Latin America – we see growth opportunities, such as
those arising out of increasing affluence and the associated increase in demand for pharmaceutical
products. Bayer is therefore systematically expanding its business in these regions in particular.
At the same time, however, the risk exists that our growth could be impeded by increasing global cost
pressure on health systems. Pharmaceutical products are subject to regulatory price controls and regulations in many markets, and government reimbursement systems often favor less expensive generic
medicines over branded products. In addition, in some markets, major suppliers in the health care sector can exert substantial pressure on prices. Price controls and pricing pressure reduce earnings from
our pharmaceutical products and may occasionally make the market launch of a new product unprofitable. According to our assessment the current extent of regulatory controls and market pressures on
pricing will persist or increase. Changes with respect to price development and governmental price
controls in our key markets are continuously monitored. Depending on the intensity of such price controls and the pressure on prices, it could be necessary to adjust our business model.
In some countries the marketing rights for certain pharmaceutical products are held by third parties. An
inadequate performance by collaboration partners could adversely affect the development of our sales
and costs. Therefore, we have established an Alliance Management unit to monitor the most important
collaborations and provide relevant support to the operational functions.
Further opportunities and risks may also arise if actual market developments vary from those we predict
in Chapter 20.1 “Economic Outlook.” Where macroeconomic developments deviate from forecasts, this
may either positively or negatively impact our sales and earnings expectations.
For MaterialScience, an economic downturn, changes in competitors’ behavior or the market entry of
new competitors can lead to a more intense competitive situation characterized by overcapacities and
increased pressure on prices.
Continuous analysis of the economic environment and of economic forecasts enables us to pursue the
identified opportunities and to mitigate risks by adjusting our business strategy.
INNOVATION
We analyze global trends and develop innovative solutions to address them, thereby mastering the
challenges and taking advantage of the opportunities they provide.
Increase in life expectancy
Certain diseases, such as cancer or chronic cardiovascular disorders, are on the rise as a consequence
of higher life expectancy. HealthCare is responding to the increased demand for innovative health care
products to treat age-related diseases by focusing its r&d activities on the respective therapeutic areas
such as oncology and cardiology.
Shortage of arable land and increasing demand for food
The growing world population poses one of the principal challenges to the sustainable supply of food,
particularly in view of the reduction in arable land caused by increasing urbanization and extreme
weather events associated with climate change. Increasing affluence in the emerging countries is boosting the demand for animal-based food products. We expect there to be an increasing need for highvalue seed and crop protection products to allow sufficient food and animal feed to be produced to
satisfy rising demand despite limited acreages. For example, CropScience is developing processes to
better protect crops against climate and environmental stresses.

Bayer Annual Report 2014
Combined Management Report
20. Future Perspectives

Conserving natural resources and protecting the climate
The finite nature of certain natural resources and efforts to protect the climate are boosting the demand
for innovative products and technologies that reduce resource consumption and lead to lower emissions. This trend is being reinforced by increasingly stringent regulatory requirements and growing
consumer awareness for the need to use resources sustainably. MaterialScience is therefore developing
new materials that help to raise energy efficiency and reduce emissions. For example, polyurethane
from MaterialScience is used in the construction industry for thermal insulation, giving a positive energy balance, while the subgroup’s polycarbonate is used in the automotive industry to reduce vehicle
weight.
To strengthen our innovation capability, we place special importance on networking and cooperation
both within and outside of our company. One example is interdisciplinary research at the interface
between human, animal and plant health, which is being driven forward by our Life Sciences Fund. This
enables us to achieve research synergies and investigate new mechanisms of action that in the long
term may provide new impetus to product development. Our strategy also encompasses research projects with outside partners from science and industry that give us access to complementary technologies
and external innovation potential.
For further information, see Chapter 5 “Research, Development, Innovation” and Chapter 3 “Strategies
of the Subgroups.”
Despite all our efforts, we cannot assure that all of the products we are currently developing or will
develop in the future will achieve planned approval / registration or commercial success. For example, a
drug candidate may fail to meet trial endpoints. The Bayer Group pursues a holistic portfolio management strategy in order to estimate the probability of success and prioritize its development projects.
Furthermore, the expectations of the public and the regulatory authorities with regard to the safety and
efficacy of chemical and pharmaceutical products are constantly rising. Against this background, we
continue to anticipate increasing regulatory requirements for clinical or (eco)toxicological studies, for
example. This increases product development costs and the time it takes to obtain registration or marketing approval. Special projects are set up to coordinate and ensure the successful implementation of
new regulations.
Where it appears strategically advantageous, we supplement our organic growth by acquiring companies or parts of companies. Failure to successfully integrate a newly acquired business or unexpectedly
high integration costs could jeopardize the achievement of qualitative or quantitative targets and adversely impact earnings. Teams of experts therefore manage both the due diligence process and the
integration itself. Due diligence includes, for example, reviewing risk-relevant factors such as compliance with applicable environmental regulations and occupational health and safety standards at production sites.
PATENT PROTECTION
Patents protect our intellectual property. When our products are successfully commercialized, profits
can be invested in continued research and development. Due to the long period of time between the
patent application and the market launch of a product, Bayer generally only has a few years in which to
earn an adequate return on its investment in research and development. This makes effective and reliable patent protection all the more important.

» TABLE OF CONTENTS COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT
Bayer Annual Report 2014
Combined Management Report
20. Future Perspectives

A large proportion of our products, especially in our Life Science businesses, is covered by patents.
Generic manufacturers, in particular, attempt to contest patents prior to their expiration. Sometimes a
generic version of a product may even be launched “at risk” prior to the issuance of a final patent decision. We are currently involved in legal proceedings to enforce patent protection for our products. Details of risks arising from these proceedings are given in Note [32] to the consolidated financial statements. When a patent defense is unsuccessful, or if one of our patents expires, our prices are likely to
come under pressure because of increased competition from generic products entering the market.
Legal action by third parties for alleged infringement of patent or proprietary rights by Bayer may impede or even halt the development or manufacturing of certain products or require us to pay monetary
damages or royalties to third parties. Our patents department regularly reviews the patent situation in
collaboration with the respective operating units and monitors for potential patent infringements so that
legal action can be taken if necessary.
PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP
Bayer assesses the potential health and environmental risks of a product along the entire value chain –
from research and development, production, commercialization and use by the customer to disposal.
Despite extensive studies prior to approval or registration, it is possible that products could be partially
or completely withdrawn from the market due to the occurrence of unexpected side effects or other
factors. Such a withdrawal may be voluntary or result from legal or regulatory measures. Furthermore,
the occurrence of traces of unwanted genetically modified organisms in agricultural products and / or
food cannot be entirely excluded. Potential payments of damages in connection with the above risks
may have a substantial negative impact on our earnings.
Our Life Science businesses counter these risks through a holistic organizational structure and process
organization in the areas of pharmaceutical and crop protection product safety and testing. In addition,
a comprehensive product stewardship program is in place at CropScience. For further information, see
Chapter 10 “Product Stewardship.”
Another risk we face is that of illegal trading of counterfeit medicines and crop protection products by
criminal third parties. In most cases, the composition and / or the quality of counterfeit products do not
correspond to those of the original products. In addition, the fact that no local regulatory authority is
involved in assuring the quality of the manufacturing or distribution process precludes any official
product recall. Products originating from illegal third-party manufacturing not only endanger patients,
users, animals and the environment, but also jeopardize the good reputation of our company and products and undermine our competitive position.
Bayer actively cooperates with authorities’ efforts to combat product counterfeiting by adopting preventive measures and prosecuting offenders.
PROCUREMENT AND PRODUCTION
Our Supplier Code of Conduct sets forth our sustainability principles and explains what we expect from
our partners along the value chain. The Code requires that our suppliers observe environmental regulations as well as occupational health and safety rules, respect human rights and therefore not employ
child labor in any form. Violations of the Code may harm our company’s reputation. Through supplier
assessments and audits, we verify whether our partners along the supply chain actually implement and
adhere to our Code of Conduct (see Chapter 8 “Procurement and Production”).
The Bayer Group requires significant quantities of energy and petrochemical feedstocks for its production processes. Procurement prices for energy and raw materials may fluctuate significantly. Experience
has shown that higher production costs cannot always be passed on to our customers through price
adjustments. This applies especially to MaterialScience.

219

220

» TABLE OF CONTENTS COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT
Bayer Annual Report 2014
Combined Management Report
20. Future Perspectives

We place great importance not only on product safety but also on protecting our employees and the
environment. Risks associated with the manufacturing, filling, storage or shipping of products are mitigated through an integrated quality, health, environmental protection and safety management. The
materialization of such risks may result in personal injury, property and environmental damage, loss of
production, business interruptions and / or liability for compensation payments.
Operations at our sites may be disrupted by natural disasters, fires or explosions, sabotage or supply
shortages for our principal raw materials or intermediates. This applies particularly to the production of
active ingredients and to the biotechnological products of HealthCare in view of the highly complex
manufacturing processes involved. If we are unable to meet demand, sales may undergo a structural
decline, particularly in our Pharmaceuticals business. We counter this risk by distributing production
for certain products among multiple sites or by building up safety stocks. Furthermore, an emergency
response system has been implemented for all our production sites as a mandatory component of our
hseq management. It is aimed at protecting employees, neighbors, the environment and production
facilities from the risks described. The Group Regulation “Safety and Crisis Management” forms the
basis for this.
Increased ecological awareness creates opportunities for MaterialScience in two ways. On the one hand,
the development of innovative materials for our customers (see Chapter 5 “Research, Development,
Innovation”) opens up market potential. On the other hand, if we succeed in increasing the energy
efficiency of our own production processes, we can mitigate environmental impacts and achieve cost
savings at the same time. By developing new production technologies and applying internationally
recognized energy management systems, we aim to help meet increasing environmental requirements,
further reduce emissions and waste, and increase energy efficiency. In this way we not only contribute
to sustainable climate protection and the conservation of natural resources, but also achieve cost and
competitive advantages.
EMPLOYEES
Skilled and dedicated employees are essential for the company’s success. There is keen competition
among companies for highly qualified personnel, particularly in countries with full employment and in
the emerging countries of Asia and Latin America. If we are unable to recruit a sufficient number of
employees in these countries and retain them within Bayer, this could have significant adverse consequences for the company’s future development.
We are planning appropriate employee recruitment and development measures based on the analysis of
future requirements. We aim to convince our target groups of the advantages of working for Bayer
through comprehensive human resources marketing, including employer branding campaigns. Competitive compensation containing performance-related components as well as an extensive range of training and development opportunities are among the essential elements of our human resources policies,
which are based on the principles enshrined in our Human Rights Position, our corporate values and
our Corporate Compliance Policy. In addition, our focus on diversity enables us to tap the full potential
of the employment market.
For more information, see Chapter 7 “Employees.”
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
Business and production processes and the internal and external communications of the Bayer Group
are increasingly dependent on global it systems.
A significant technical disruption or failure of it systems could severely impair our business and production processes. Technical precautions such as data recovery and continuity plans are defined and
continuously evolved in close cooperation with our internal it organization.

» TABLE OF CONTENTS COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT
Bayer Annual Report 2014

20. Future Perspectives

The confidentiality of internal and external data is of fundamental importance to us. A loss of data confidentiality, integrity or authenticity could lead to manipulation and / or the uncontrolled outflow of data
and expertise. We have measures in place to counter this risk, including an authorization system.
Furthermore, a Group-wide committee has been established to determine the fundamental strategy,
architecture and safety measures for the Bayer Group. These measures are designed to provide optimum protection based on state-of-the-art technology.
LAW AND COMPLIANCE
The Bayer Group is exposed to numerous risks from legal disputes or proceedings to which we are
currently a party or which could arise in the future, particularly in the areas of product liability, competition and antitrust law, patent law, tax law and environmental protection.
Investigations of possible legal or regulatory violations, such as potential infringements of antitrust law
or certain marketing and / or distribution methods, may result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties – including substantial monetary fines – and / or other adverse financial consequences, harm
Bayer’s reputation and ultimately hamper our commercial success.
Bayer has established a global compliance management system to ensure the sustainable observance of
laws and regulations (see Chapter 18.3 “Compliance”).
Legal proceedings currently considered to involve material risks are described in Note [32] to the consolidated financial statements.
FINANCIAL OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS
The Bayer Group has financial opportunities at its disposal in the form of the market prices it can command for its products, and is exposed to financial risks in the form of liquidity, credit and market price
risks, as well as risks resulting from pension obligations.
The following paragraphs provide details of these and other financial opportunities and risks and how
they are managed.
The management of financial opportunities and risks takes place using established, documented processes. One component is financial planning, which serves as the basis for determining the liquidity risk
and the future foreign currency and interest-rate risks and covers all Group companies that are relevant
from a cash-flow perspective. Financial planning comprises a planning horizon of 12 months and is
regularly updated.
Further information is provided in Chapter 16.7 “Financial Management of the Group.”

See Chapter 16.7

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risks result from the possible inability of the Bayer Group to meet current or future payment
obligations due to a lack of cash or cash equivalents. The liquidity risk is determined and managed by
the central finance department as part of our same-day and medium-term liquidity planning.
Payment obligations from financial instruments are explained according to their maturity in Note [30.2]
to the consolidated financial statements.

Bayer Annual Report 2014
Combined Management Report
20. Future Perspectives

The Group holds sufficient liquidity to ensure the fulfillment of all planned payment obligations at maturity. In addition, a reserve is maintained for unbudgeted shortfalls in cash receipts or unexpected
disbursements. The amount of this liquidity reserve is regularly reviewed and adjusted as necessary
according to circumstances.
Liquid assets are held mainly in the form of overnight and term deposits. Credit facilities also exist with
banks. These include, in particular, a €3.5 billion syndicated credit facility, which is undrawn.
Credit risks
Credit risks arise from the possibility that the value of receivables or other financial assets of the Bayer
Group may be impaired because counterparties cannot meet their payment or other performance obligations. The Bayer Group does not conclude master netting arrangements with its customers for nonderivative financial instruments. Here, the total value of the financial assets represents the maximum
credit risk exposure. In the case of derivatives, positive and negative market values may be netted under
certain conditions.
To manage credit risks from trade receivables, the respective invoicing companies appoint credit managers who regularly analyze customers’ creditworthiness. Some of these receivables are collateralized,
and the collateral is used according to local conditions. It includes credit insurance, advance payments,
letters of credit and guarantees. Reservation of title is generally agreed with our customers. Credit limits
are set for all customers. All credit limits for debtors where total exposure is €10 million or more are
evaluated by local credit management and submitted to the Group’s Central Financial Risk Committee.
Credit risks from financial transactions are managed centrally in the finance department. To minimize
risks, financial transactions are only conducted within predefined exposure limits and with banks and
other partners that preferably have investment-grade ratings. All risk limits are based on methodical
models. Adherence to the risk limits is continuously monitored.

Opportunities and risks resulting from market price changes
Opportunities and risks resulting from changes in market currency and interest rates are managed
by the central finance department. Risks are eliminated or mitigated through the use of derivative financial instruments. Further details on derivatives are given in Note [30.3] to the consolidated financial
statements.
The type and level of currency and interest-rate risks are explained in the following paragraphs using
sensitivity analyses based on hypothetical changes in risk variables (such as interest curves) to determine the potential effects of market price fluctuations on equity and earnings. The assumptions used in
the sensitivity analyses reflect our view of the changes in currency exchange and interest rates that are
reasonably possible over a one-year period. These assumptions are regularly reviewed.
Foreign currencies
Foreign currency opportunities and risks for the Bayer Group result from changes in exchange rates and
the related changes in the value of financial instruments (including receivables and payables) and of
anticipated payment receipts and disbursements in the functional currency.
Receivables and payables in liquid currencies from operating activities and financial items are generally
fully exchange-hedged through forward exchange contracts and cross-currency interest-rate swaps.

» TABLE OF CONTENTS COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT
Bayer Annual Report 2014
Combined Management Report
20. Future Perspectives

Anticipated exposure from planned payment receipts and disbursement in the future is hedged according to the rules agreed between the Group Management Board, the finance department and the operating units. Hedging takes place through forward exchange contracts and currency options.
Sensitivities were determined based on a hypothetical adverse scenario in which the euro depreciates
by 10% against all other currencies compared with the year-end exchange rates. Under this scenario,
the estimated hypothetical loss of cash flows from derivative and non-derivative financial instruments
would have diminished earnings and equity (other comprehensive income) as of December 31, 2014 by
€295 million (December 31, 2013: €250 million). Of this amount, €136 million is related to the u.s. dollar, €41 million to the Japanese yen and €32 million to the Canadian dollar. Currency effects on anticipated exposure are not taken into account.
Derivatives used to hedge anticipated currency exposure that are designated for hedge accounting
would have diminished other comprehensive income by €315 million.
Interest rates
Interest-rate opportunities and risks result for the Bayer Group through changes in capital market interest rates, which in turn could lead to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate financial instruments and
changes in interest payments in the case of floating-rate instruments.
Interest-rate opportunities and risks are managed over a target duration established by management for
Bayer Group debt. This target duration is subject to regular review. Interest-rate swaps are concluded to
achieve the target structure for Group debt.
A sensitivity analysis based on our net floating-rate receivables and payables position at year end 2014,
taking into account the interest rates relevant for our receivables and payables in all principal currencies, produced the following result: a hypothetical increase of 100 basis points, or 1 percentage point, in
these interest rates (assuming constant currency exchange rates) as of January 1, 2014 would have
raised our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 by €53 million (December 31, 2013:
€33 million).
Risk to pension obligations from capital market developments
The Bayer Group has obligations to current and former employees related to pensions and other postemployment benefits. Changes in relevant measurement parameters such as interest rates, mortality
and salary increase rates may raise the present value of our pension obligations. This may lead to increased costs for pension plans or diminish equity due to actuarial losses being recognized as other
comprehensive income in the statement of comprehensive income. A large proportion of our pension
and other post-employment benefit obligations is covered by plan assets including fixed-income securities, shares, real estate and other investments. Declining or even negative returns on these investments
may adversely affect the future fair value of plan assets. Both these effects may negatively impact the
development of equity and / or the company’s earnings and / or may necessitate additional payments by
the company. Further details are given in Note [25] to the consolidated financial statements.
We address the risk of market-related fluctuations in the fair value of our plan assets through balanced
strategic investment, and we constantly monitor investment risks in regard to our global pension obligations.
OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS
The risks reported above do not endanger the company’s continued existence. Nor could we identify
any risk interdependencies that could combine to endanger the company’s continued existence.
Risks rated as “medium” or “high” did not change significantly compared with the previous year.
Based on our product portfolio, our know-how and our innovation capability, we are convinced that we
can take advantage of the opportunities resulting from our entrepreneurial activity and successfully
master the challenges resulting from the risks stated above.

The appointment and dismissal of members of the Board of Management are subject to the provisions of
Sections 84 and 85 of the German Stock Corporation Act, Section 31 of the German Codetermination Act
and Section 6 of the company’s Articles of Incorporation. Pursuant to Section 84, Paragraph 1 of the
German Stock Corporation Act, the members of the Board of Management are appointed and dismissed
by the Supervisory Board. Since Bayer AG falls within the scope of the German Codetermination Act, the
appointment or dismissal of members of the Board of Management requires a majority of two thirds of
the votes of the members of the Supervisory Board on the first ballot pursuant to Section 31 Paragraph 2
of that act. If no such majority is achieved, the appointment is resolved pursuant to Section 31 Paragraph
3 of the Codetermination Act on a second ballot by a simple majority of the votes of the members of the
Supervisory Board. If the required majority still is not achieved, a third ballot is held. Here again, a simple
majority of the votes of the members suffices, but in this ballot the Chairman of the Supervisory Board
has two votes pursuant to Section 31 Paragraph 4 of the Codetermination Act. Under Section 6 Paragraph
1 of the Articles of Incorporation of Bayer AG, the number of members of the Board of Management is
determined by the Supervisory Board but must be at least two. The Supervisory Board may appoint one
member of the Board of Management to be its Chairman pursuant to Section 84 Paragraph 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act and Section 6 Paragraph 1 of the Articles of Incorporation.
Any amendments to the Articles of Incorporation are made pursuant to Section 179 of the German Stock
Corporation Act and Sections 10 and 17 of the Articles of Incorporation. Under Section 179 Paragraph 1
of the German Stock Corporation Act, amendments to the Articles of Incorporation require a resolution
of the Stockholders’ Meeting. Pursuant to Section 179 Paragraph 2 of the German Stock Corporation
Act, this resolution must be passed by a majority of three quarters of the voting capital represented at
the meeting, unless the Articles of Incorporation provide for a different majority. However, where an
amendment relates to a change in the object of the company, the Articles of Incorporation may only
specify a larger majority. Section 17 Paragraph 2 of the Articles of Incorporation of Bayer AG utilizes the
scope for deviation pursuant to Section 179 Paragraph 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act and provides that resolutions may be passed by a simple majority of the votes cast or, where a capital majority
is required, by a simple majority of the capital represented. Pursuant to Section 10 Paragraph 6 of the
Articles of Incorporation, the Supervisory Board may resolve on amendments to the Articles of Incorporation that relate solely to their wording.
Provisions of the Articles of Incorporation concerning Authorized Capital i and Authorized Capital ii are
entered in the commercial register of Bayer AG. With the approval of the Supervisory Board and until
April 28, 2019, the Board of Management may use the Authorized Capital i to increase the capital stock
by up to a total of €530 million. New shares may be issued against cash contributions and / or contributions in kind, but capital increases against contributions in kind may not exceed a total of €423 million.
If the Authorized Capital i is used to issue shares in return for cash contributions, stockholders must
normally be granted subscription rights. The Board of Management may only exclude stockholders’
subscription rights to a volume of shares issued out of the Authorized Capital i that did not represent
more than 20% of the existing capital stock at the time the respective resolution was adopted by the
Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on April 29, 2014. Absent a further resolution on the exclusion of stockholders’ subscription rights, the Board of Management also may only exclude stockholders’ subscrip-

tion rights to a volume of shares issued under other authorizations regarding capital measures (Authorized Capital ii, bonds with warrants or convertible bonds, purchase and disposal of own shares) that did
not represent more than 20% of the existing capital stock at the time the respective resolution was
adopted by the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on April 29, 2014.
With the approval of the Supervisory Board and until April 28, 2019, the Board of Management is authorized to increase the capital by up to €212 million in one or more installments by issuing shares out
of the Authorized Capital ii against cash contributions. The stockholders must normally be granted
subscription rights. However, the Board of Management is authorized, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to exclude subscription rights for stockholders provided the volume of shares issued out of
the Authorized Capital ii against cash contributions does not exceed 10% of the capital stock existing at
the time this authorization is registered or the time the new shares are issued and the issue price of the
new shares is not significantly below the market price of the already listed shares.
Conditional capital of €212 million exists in connection with an authorization – valid through April 28,
2019 – to issue bonds with warrants or convertible bonds, profit-sharing rights or profit participation
bonds (collectively referred to as “bonds”) with a total face value of €6 billion. The Board of Management may, with the consent of the Supervisory Board and under certain conditions, exclude the bond
subscription rights that would otherwise be granted to stockholders. One of the conditions is that the
total volume of shares required to service the bonds exceed neither 10% of the capital stock that existed at the time the respective resolution was adopted by the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on April 29,
2014 nor 10% of the capital stock existing at the time this authorization is exercised. Any other shares
issued without granting subscription rights to the stockholders in direct or analogous application of
Section 186 Paragraph 3 Sentence 4 of the German Stock Corporation Act shall be credited against this
10% limit. Further, by resolution of the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on April 29, 2014, the Board of
Management is authorized to purchase and dispose of own shares representing up to 10% of the capital
stock existing at the time the resolution was adopted. The authorization to purchase own shares also
includes the purchase of own shares using put or call options (derivatives) up to a volume of 5% of the
capital stock existing at the time the resolution was adopted or at the time the authorization is exercised. This authorization also expires on April 28, 2019.
A material agreement that is subject to the condition precedent of a change of control pertains to the
undrawn €3.5 billion syndicated credit facility arranged by Bayer AG and its u.s. subsidiary Bayer
Corporation. This facility is available until December 2019 and can be extended by a further one-year
period. The participating banks are entitled to terminate the credit facility in the event of a change of
control at Bayer and demand repayment of any loans that may have been granted under this facility up
to that time. A similar clause is contained in the agreement on a us$2 billion syndicated credit facility
granted to Bayer subsidiary Bayer World Investments b.v., Netherlands, in 2014 and guaranteed by
Bayer AG. The facility matures in May 2018.
The terms of the €4.1 billion (as of December 31, 2014) in notes issued by Bayer in the years 2006 to
2014 under its multi-currency European Medium Term Notes program also contain a change-of-control
clause. Holders of these notes have the right to demand the redemption of their notes by Bayer AG in
the event of a change of control if Bayer AG’s credit rating is downgraded within 120 days after such
change of control becomes effective. The terms of the us$7 billion bond in 144a / Reg S format issued in
October 2014 also contain a clause to this effect.
Agreements exist for the members of the Board of Management in compliance with Section 4.2.3 of
the German Corporate Governance Code to cover the eventuality of a takeover offer being made for
Bayer AG. Under these agreements, payments promised in the event of early termination of the service
contract of a Board of Management member due to a change of control are limited to the value of three
years’ compensation and may not compensate more than the remaining term of the contract.

Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

2. General information
The consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group as of December 31, 2014, were prepared by Bayer
Aktiengesellschaft (Bayer AG) according to the International Financial Reporting Standards (ifrs) issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (iasb), London, and the interpretations of the ifrs Interpretations
Committee (ifrs ic), both as endorsed by the European Union and in effect at the end of the reporting period. The
applicable further requirements of Section 315a of the German Commercial Code were also taken into account.
Bayer AG is a global enterprise based in Germany. Its registered office is at Kaiser-Wilhelm-Allee 1, 51368
Leverkusen. Its material business activities in the fields of health care, agriculture and high-tech polymer materials
take place in HealthCare, CropScience and MaterialScience. The activities of the various segments are outlined in
note [5].
A declaration concerning the German Corporate Governance Code has been issued pursuant to Section 161 of the
German Stock Corporation Act and made available to stockholders.
The Board of Management of Bayer AG prepared the consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group on
February 13, 2015. They were discussed by the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of Bayer AG at its meeting on February 24, 2015, and approved by the Supervisory Board at its plenary meeting on February 25, 2015.
In the income statement and statement of comprehensive income, statement of financial position, statement of cash
flows and statement of changes in equity, certain items are combined for the sake of clarity. These are explained
in the Notes. The income statement is prepared using the cost-of-sales method. Assets and liabilities are classified
by maturity. They are regarded as current if they mature within one year or within the normal business cycle of
the company or the Group, or are held for sale. The normal business cycle is defined for this purpose as beginning
with the procurement of the resources necessary for the production process and ending with the receipt of cash or
cash equivalents as consideration for the sale of the goods or services produced in that process. Inventories and
trade accounts receivable and payable are always presented as current items. Deferred tax assets and liabilities and
pension provisions are always presented as noncurrent items.
The consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group are drawn up in euros. Amounts are stated in millions of
euros (€ million) except where otherwise indicated.
The financial statements of the individual consolidated companies are prepared as of the closing date of the Group
financial statements.

3. Effects of new financial reporting standards
FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS APPLIED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 2014
The first-time application of the following amended financial reporting standards had no impact, or no material
impact, on the presentation of the Group financial position or results of operations, or on earnings per share.
In December 2011, the iasb issued amendments to ias 32 (Financial Instruments: Presentation) entitled “Offsetting
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” The amendments clarify the meaning of “right of set-off in all circumstances” and “simultaneous settlement.”
In October 2012, the iasb issued amendments to ifrs 10 (Consolidated Financial Statements), ifrs 12 (Disclosure
of Interests in Other Entities) and ias 27 (Separate Financial Statements) entitled “Investment Entities.” The
amendments exempt investment entities from the requirement to consolidate certain subsidiaries according to
ifrs 10. Instead, they must recognize them at fair value through profit or loss. ifrs 12 introduces additional
disclosure requirements for investment entities.

» TABLE OF CONTENTS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Bayer Annual Report 2014
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

In May 2013, the ifrs ic issued the interpretation ifric 21 (Levies). The interpretation covers the accounting for
government-imposed levies with the exception of income taxes covered by ias 12 (Income Taxes). It also provides
guidance on when to recognize a liability for a levy. In terms of the ifrs, the interpretation is effective for annual
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014. For companies in the European Union, application of the interpretation is mandatory for annual periods beginning on or after June 17, 2014. The interpretation was early applied as
of January 1, 2014.
In November 2013, the iasb published narrow-scope amendments to ias 19 (Employee Benefits) under the title
“Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions.” These amendments address the accounting for contributions
from employees or third parties to defined benefit pension plans according to whether the contributions are linked
to service. Under certain conditions, such contributions may be accounted for as a reduction in current service cost
in the period in which the related service was rendered. The amendments are to be applied for annual periods
beginning on or after July 1, 2014. Earlier application is permitted. The amendments were early applied.
PUBLISHED FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN APPLIED
The iasb and the ifrs Interpretations Committee have issued the following standards, amendments to standards,
and interpretations whose application was not yet mandatory for the 2014 fiscal year and is conditional upon their
endorsement by the European Union.
In November 2009, the iasb issued ifrs 9 (Financial Instruments), containing rules for the classification and measurement of financial assets. In October 2010, it issued new requirements for the classification and measurement of
financial liabilities, incorporating them into ifrs 9. The new standard defines two instead of four measurement
categories for financial assets, with classification to be based partly on the company’s business model and partly on
the characteristics of the contractual cash flows from the respective financial asset. In the case of equity investments that are not held for trading, an entity may irrevocably opt at initial recognition to recognize future changes
in their fair value outside profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income. In November 2013, the iasb
issued further amendments under the title “Hedge Accounting and amendments to ifrs 9, ifrs 7 and ias 39.” The
focus of the amendments is on a thorough revision of hedge accounting rules with the aim of more appropriately
reflecting risk management activities in the financial statements. This involves additional disclosures in the notes.
In July 2014, the iasb published the new rules for the disclosure of financial instrument impairments. This new
impairment model is based on the principle of accounting for expected losses. ifrs 9 is to be applied for annual
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The standard has not yet been endorsed by the European Union.
The Bayer Group is currently evaluating the impact the standard will have on the presentation of its financial position and results of operations.
In December 2013, the iasb published the fifth and sixth sets of “Annual Improvements to ifrss.” The amendments
address details of the recognition, measurement and disclosure of business transactions and serve to standardize
terminology. They consist mainly of editorial changes to existing standards. They are to be applied for annual
periods beginning on or after July 1, 2014. Early application is permitted. The Bayer Group is currently evaluating
the impact the changes will have on the presentation of its financial position and results of operations.
In January 2014, the iasb issued ifrs 14 (Regulatory Deferral Accounts). This standard addresses the accounting
for regulatory deferral account balances by first-time adopters of the ifrs and therefore does not apply to entities
that already prepare their financial statements according to the ifrs. ifrs 14 is to be applied for annual periods
beginning on or after January 1, 2016. The standard has not yet been endorsed by the European Union. ifrs 14 will
have no impact on the presentation of the Group’s financial position or results of operations.
In May 2014, the iasb published amendments to ias 16 (Property, Plant and Equipment) and ias 38 (Intangible
Assets) entitled "Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation." These amendments clarify
that revenue-based depreciation of property, plant and equipment or amortization of intangible assets is inappropriate. The amendments are to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016. Earlier application is permitted. First-time application must take place prospectively. The amendments have not yet been endorsed by the European Union. The Bayer Group is currently evaluating the impact the changes will have on the
presentation of its financial position and results of operations.

Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

In May 2014, the iasb published amendments to ifrs 11 (Joint Arrangements) entitled “Accounting for Acquisitions
of Interests in Joint Operations.” The amendments clarify the accounting for the acquisition of an interest in a joint
operation in which the activity constitutes a business. They are to be applied prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016. Earlier application is permitted. The amendments have not yet been endorsed
by the European Union. The Bayer Group is currently evaluating the impact the changes will have on the presentation of its financial position and results of operations.
In May 2014, the iasb issued ifrs 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers). ifrs 15 is the new standard for
revenue recognition. It clarifies that the expected consideration for goods or services must be recognized as revenue when the goods are transferred or the services are rendered to the customer. This principle is applied in five
steps. In step 1, the contract with the customer is identified. In step 2, the distinct performance obligations in the
contract are identified. In step 3, the transaction price is determined. In step 4, this transaction price is allocated to
the distinct performance obligations. Finally, in step 5, revenue is recognized when the identified distinct performance obligations are satisfied, either over time or at a point in time. ifrs 15 replaces ias 11 (Construction Contracts), ias 18 (Revenue), ifric 13 (Customer Loyalty Programmes), ifric 15 (Agreements for the Construction of
Real Estate), ifric 18 (Transfers of Assets from Customers) and sic-31 (Revenue-Barter Transactions Involving
Advertising Services). The new standard is to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
Earlier application is permitted. First-time application must take place retrospectively (modified). The standard has
not yet been endorsed by the European Union. The Bayer Group is currently evaluating the impact the standard
will have on the presentation of its financial position and results of operations.
In June 2014, the iasb issued amendments to ias 16 (Property, Plant and Equipment) and ias 41 (Agriculture) entitled “Agriculture: Bearer Plants.” The amendments clarify that plants used solely to grow agricultural produce are
to be accounted for according to ias 16 (Property, Plant and Equipment). The amendments are to be applied for
annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016. Earlier application is permitted. The amendments have not
yet been endorsed by the European Union. The changes are not expected to have a material impact on the presentation of the Group’s financial position or results of operations.
In September 2014, the iasb published the seventh set of “Annual Improvements to ifrss.” The amendments address details of the recognition, measurement and disclosure of business transactions and serve to standardize
terminology. They consist mainly of editorial changes to existing standards. They are applicable for annual periods
beginning on or after July 1, 2016. Earlier application is permitted. The amendments have not yet been endorsed
by the European Union. The changes are not expected to have a material impact on the presentation of the Group’s
financial position or results of operations.
In September 2014, the iasb published amendments to ifrs 10 (Consolidated Financial Statements) and ias 28
(Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures) entitled “Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its
Associate or Joint Venture.” The amendments clarify that in a transaction involving an associate or joint venture the
extent of gain or loss recognition depends on whether the assets sold or contributed constitute a business. The
amendments are to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016. Earlier application is permitted. The amendments have not yet been endorsed by the European Union. The Bayer Group is currently evaluating the impact the changes will have on the presentation of its financial position and results of operations.
In December 2014, further amendments were issued to ifrs 10 (Consolidated Financial Statements), ifrs 12
(Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities) and ias 28 (Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures) under the title
“Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception.” The amendments largely clarify which subsidiaries an
investment entity must consolidate and which must be recognized at fair value through profit or loss. The amendments are to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016. Earlier application is permitted.
The amendments have not yet been endorsed by the European Union. The changes are not expected to have a
material impact on the presentation of the Group’s financial position or results of operations.

CHANGES IN THE REPORTING OF FUNCTIONAL COSTS AND SPECIAL ITEMS
To enhance the comparability and transparency of functional cost reporting, the organizational view was replaced
in 2014 by a more function-based approach. This has the effect of reducing general administration expenses
while increasing selling expenses and the cost of goods sold. In addition, certain special items are reflected in the
respective functional costs rather than in other operating income or expenses so that their relationship to the
functional costs is immediately apparent.
The prior-year figures are restated accordingly:

4. Basic principles, methods and critical accounting estimates
The financial statements of the consolidated companies are prepared according to uniform accounting policies and
measurement principles.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group are based on the principle of the historical cost of acquisition,
construction or production, with the exception of the items reflected at fair value, such as financial assets held for
trading or available for sale, and derivatives.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the management has to make certain assumptions and estimates that may substantially impact the presentation of the Group’s financial position and / or results of operations.
Such estimates, assumptions or the exercise of discretion mainly relate to the useful life of noncurrent assets, the
discounted cash flows used for impairment testing and purchase price allocations, and the recognition of provisions, including those for litigation-related expenses, pensions and other benefits, taxes, environmental compliance
and remediation costs, sales allowances, product liability and guarantees. Essential estimates and assumptions that
may affect reporting in the various item categories of the financial statements are described in the following sections of this note. Estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that are considered reasonable under given circumstances. They are continually reviewed but may vary from the actual values.
Changes in accounting policies or measurement principles in light of new or revised standards are applied retrospectively, except as otherwise provided in the respective standard. The income statement for the previous year
and the opening statement of financial position for that year are adjusted as if the new accounting policies and / or
measurement principles had always been applied.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates.
Subsidiaries are companies over which Bayer AG is currently able to exercise power by virtue of existing rights.
Power means the ability to direct the activities that significantly influence a company’s profitability. Control is
therefore only deemed to exist if Bayer AG is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with a
company and has the ability to use its power over that company to affect the amount of that company’s returns.
The ability to control another company generally derives from Bayer AG’s direct or indirect ownership of a majority
of the voting rights. In the case of structured entities, however, control is based on contractual agreements. Inclusion of an entity’s accounts in the consolidated financial statements begins when the Bayer Group is able to exercise control over the entity and ceases when it is no longer able to do so.
Sales revenues, income and expenses, and gains and losses arising from transactions among the consolidated
companies, along with receivables and liabilities existing between them, are eliminated. Deferred income tax
effects are reflected in consolidation.
Capital consolidation is performed by offsetting the carrying amounts of subsidiaries against their underlying equity. When a majority interest in a company is acquired, its pro-rated equity at the acquisition date is measured using
the acquisition method. Identifiable assets and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) are recognized at their
fair values along with attributable deferred tax assets and liabilities. Any remaining difference to the purchase price
is recognized as goodwill. The purchase prices of acquired companies domiciled outside the eurozone are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the respective dates of acquisition.
The purchase of shares from other owners is presented as an equity transaction. The difference between the equity
acquired from other owners and the purchase price is therefore directly offset against equity.
Joint operations and joint ventures are based on joint arrangements. A joint arrangement is deemed to exist if the
Bayer Group through a contractual agreement jointly controls activities managed with a third party. Joint control is
only deemed to exist if decisions regarding the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties
sharing control.
A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights
to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. The Bayer Group recognizes the share
of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses relating to its interest in a joint operation in accordance with its rights
and obligations.
A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to
the net assets of the arrangement. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
Associates over which Bayer AG exerts significant influence, generally through an ownership interest between
20% and 50%, also are accounted for using the equity method.
The carrying amount of a company accounted for using the equity method is adjusted annually by the change in
its equity corresponding to Bayer’s percentage interest in the company. Differences arising upon first-time inclusion using the equity method are accounted for according to full-consolidation principles. Bayer’s share of changes
in these companies’ equities recognized in profit or loss – including impairment losses recognized on goodwill –
are reflected in equity-method income / loss. Intercompany profits and losses for these companies were not material
in either 2014 or 2013.

Companies that do not have a material impact on the Group’s financial position or results of operations, either
individually or in aggregate, are accounted for at cost of acquisition less any impairment losses.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The financial statements of the individual companies for inclusion in the consolidated financial statements are
prepared in their respective functional currencies. A company’s functional currency is that of the economic environment in which it primarily generates and expends cash. The majority of consolidated companies carry out their
activities autonomously from a financial, economic and organizational point of view, and their functional currencies
are therefore the respective local currencies.
In the separate financial statements of the individual consolidated companies, receivables and liabilities in currencies other than the respective functional currency are translated at closing rates. Related exchange differences are
recognized in profit or loss as exchange gains or losses under other financial income and expenses.
In the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of companies outside the eurozone at the start
and end of the year are translated into euros at closing rates. All changes occurring during the year and all income
and expense items and cash flows are translated into euros at average monthly rates. Equity components are translated at the historical exchange rates prevailing at the respective dates of their first-time recognition in Group
equity.
The exchange differences arising between the resulting amounts and those obtained by translating at closing rates
are recognized outside profit or loss as “Exchange differences on translation of operations outside the eurozone”
(in other comprehensive income) or “Exchange differences” (in the tables in the notes). When a company is deconsolidated, such exchange differences are reclassified from equity to profit or loss.
The exchange rates for major currencies against the euro varied as follows:

Subsidiaries whose functional currencies have experienced a cumulative inflation rate of more than 100% over the
past three years apply the rules of ias 29 (Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies). Gains and losses
incurred upon adjusting the carrying amounts of non-monetary assets and liabilities for inflation are recognized in
other operating income and expenses.
In 2014, as in the previous year, the rules of ias 29 were relevant for Bayer s.a., Venezuela. The exchange rate used
for translation in 2013 was the year-end rate calculated on the basis of the official exchange rate for the Venezuelan bolivar (vef) against the u.s. dollar (cadivi rate of vef 6.3 to the usd), converted at the respective usd / eur rate.
Several widely differing official exchange rates against the u.s. dollar have been published for 2014. As of 2014,
Bayer s.a., Venezuela, is included in the consolidated financial statements at the official exchange rate potentially
applicable to future capital transfers if permission for conversion into usd is granted (sicad 1).

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

Since Venezuelan exchange controls prevent direct currency conversion and it is not possible to accurately estimate foreign exchange allocations, the Bayer Group is exposed to a potential devaluation loss that may adversely
impact earnings.
As of December 31, 2014, Bayer s.a., Venezuela, had trade accounts equivalent to €150 million payable to other
Group companies in usd. The €59 million in exchange losses incurred in 2014 mainly resulted from the remeasurement of intra-Group liabilities due to the devaluation of the vef against the usd.
NET SALES AND OTHER OPERATING INCOME
All revenues derived from the selling of products or rendering of services or from licensing agreements are recognized as sales. Other operational revenues are recognized as other operating income. Sales are recognized in profit
or loss when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the customer, the
company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor
effective control over the goods sold, the amount of revenue and costs incurred or to be incurred can be measured
reliably, and it is sufficiently probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the
company.
Sales are stated net of sales taxes, other taxes and sales deductions at the fair value of the consideration received
or to be received. Sales deductions are estimated amounts for rebates, cash discounts and product returns. They
are deducted at the time the sales are recognized, and appropriate provisions are recorded. Sales deductions are
estimated primarily on the basis of historical experience, specific contractual terms and future expectations of sales
development. It is unlikely that factors other than these could materially affect sales deductions in the Bayer Group.
Adjustments to provisions made in prior periods for rebates, cash discounts or product returns were of secondary
importance for income before income taxes in the years under report.
Provisions for rebates in 2014 amounted to 3.4% of total net sales (2013: 2.8%). In addition to rebates, Group
companies offer cash discounts for prompt payment in some countries. Provisions for cash discounts as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 were less than 0.1% of total net sales for the respective year.
Sales are reduced by the amount of the provisions for expected returns of defective goods or of saleable products
that may be returned under contractual arrangements. The net sales are reduced on the date of sale or on the date
when the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated. Provisions for product returns in 2014 amounted
to 0.5% of total net sales (2013: 0.3%). If future product returns cannot be reasonably estimated and are significant to a sales transaction, the revenues and the related cost of sales are deferred until a reasonable estimate can
be made or the right to return the goods has expired.
Some of the Bayer Group’s revenues are generated on the basis of licensing agreements under which third parties
have been granted rights to products and technologies. Payments received, or expected to be received, that relate
to the sale or outlicensing of technologies or technological expertise are recognized in profit or loss as of the effective date of the respective agreement if all rights relating to the technologies and all obligations resulting from
them have been relinquished under the contract terms. However, if rights to the technologies continue to exist or
obligations resulting from them have yet to be fulfilled, the payments received are deferred accordingly. Upfront
payments and similar non-refundable payments received under these agreements are recorded as other liabilities
and recognized in profit or loss over the estimated performance period stipulated in the agreement.
License or research and development collaboration agreements may be multiple-deliverable arrangements with
varying consideration terms, such as upfront payments and milestone or similar payments. Such agreements therefore have to be assessed to determine whether the revenues allocated to individual deliverables must be recognized
at different points in time and therefore form separate units of accounting.

» TABLE OF CONTENTS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Bayer Annual Report 2014
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

To qualify as a separate unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, a deliverable must have value to the
licensee on a stand-alone basis. If this is not the case, the agreement as a whole or a combination of individual
deliverables that has value on a stand-alone basis forms a unit of accounting.
If necessary goods have yet to be delivered or necessary services provided for a unit of accounting and such
delivery or provision is probable, non-refundable (royalty) payments already received are recognized through profit
or loss over the periods in which these goods are delivered or these services are provided.
Other operating income may also arise from the exchange of intangible assets. The amount recognized is generally
based on the fair value of the assets given up, calculated using the discounted cash flow method. If the assets given
up are internally generated, the gain from the exchange generally equals their fair value.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES
For accounting purposes, research expenses are defined as costs incurred for current or planned investigations
undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding. Development
expenses are defined as costs incurred for the application of research findings or specialist knowledge to plans or
designs for the production, provision or development of new or substantially improved products, services or processes, respectively, prior to the commencement of commercial production or use.
Research and development expenses are incurred in the Bayer Group for in-house research and development
activities as well as numerous research and development collaborations and alliances with third parties.
Research and development expenses mainly comprise the costs for active ingredient discovery, clinical studies,
research and development activities in the areas of application technology and engineering, field trials, regulatory
approvals and approval extensions.
Research costs cannot be capitalized. The conditions for capitalization of development costs are closely defined: an
intangible asset must be recognized if, and only if, there is reasonable certainty of receiving future cash flows that
will cover an asset’s carrying amount. Since our own development projects are often subject to regulatory approval
procedures and other uncertainties, the conditions for the capitalization of costs incurred before receipt of approvals are not normally satisfied.
In the case of research and development collaborations, a distinction is generally made between payments on contract signature, upfront payments, milestone payments and cost reimbursements for work performed. If an intangible
asset (such as the right to the use of an active ingredient) is acquired in connection with any of these payment obligations, the respective payment is capitalized even if it is uncertain whether further development work will ultimately
lead to the production of a saleable product. Reimbursements of the cost of research or development work are recognized in profit or loss.
INCOME TAXES
Income taxes comprise the taxes levied on taxable income in the individual countries along with changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are recognized in profit or loss. The income taxes recognized are reflected at
the amounts likely to be payable under the statutory regulations in force, or already enacted in relation to future
periods, at the end of the reporting period.
In compliance with ias 12 (Income Taxes), deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position prepared according to ifrs and their
tax bases. Deferred taxes are also recognized for consolidation measures and for tax loss carryforwards and tax
credits that are likely to be usable.

Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

Deferred tax assets relating to deductible temporary differences, tax credits or tax loss carryforwards are recognized where it is sufficiently probable that taxable income will be available in the future to enable them to be used.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized on temporary differences taxable in the future. Deferred taxes are calculated
at the rates which – on the basis of the statutory regulations in force, or already enacted in relation to future periods, as of the closing date – are expected to apply in the individual countries at the time of realization. Deferred tax
assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and
Bayer has a legal right to settle on a net basis. Material effects of changes in tax rates or tax law on deferred tax
assets and liabilities are generally accounted for in the period in which the changes are enacted. Such effects are
recognized in profit or loss except where they relate to deferred taxes that were recognized outside profit or loss,
in which case they are recognized in other comprehensive income.
Deferred and current taxes are recognized in profit or loss unless they relate to items recognized outside profit or
loss in other comprehensive income, in which case they, too, are recognized in other comprehensive income.
The probability that deferred tax assets resulting from temporary differences or loss carryforwards can be used in
the future is the subject of forecasts by the individual consolidated companies regarding their future earnings
situation and other parameters.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized on planned dividend payments by subsidiaries. Where no dividend payment
is planned for the foreseeable future, no deferred tax liability is recognized on the difference between the proportionate net assets according to ifrs and the tax base of the investment in the subsidiary.
GOODWILL
In a business combination, goodwill is capitalized at the acquisition date. It is measured at its cost of acquisition,
which is the excess of the acquisition price for shares in a company over the acquired net assets. The net assets are
the balance of the fair values of the acquired identifiable assets and the assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Goodwill is not amortized, but tested annually for impairment. Details of the annual impairment tests are given
under “Procedure used in global impairment testing and its impact.” Once an impairment loss has been recognized
on goodwill, it is not reversed in subsequent periods.
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
An “other intangible asset” is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance, other than goodwill
(such as a patent, a trademark or a marketing right). It is capitalized if the future economic benefits attributable to
the asset will probably flow to the company and the cost of acquisition or generation of the asset can be reliably
measured.
Other intangible assets are recognized at the cost of acquisition or generation. Those with a determinable useful
life are amortized accordingly on a straight-line basis over a period of up to 30 years, except where their actual
depletion demands a different amortization pattern. Determination of the expected useful lives of such assets and
the amortization patterns is based on estimates of the period for which they will generate cash flows. An impairment test is performed if there is an indication of possible impairment.
Other intangible assets with an indefinite life (such as the Bayer Cross trademark) and intangible assets not yet
available for use (such as research and development projects) are not amortized, but tested annually for impairment.
Any impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. If the reasons for a previously recognized impairment loss
no longer apply, the impairment loss is reversed provided that the reversal does not cause the carrying amount to
exceed the (amortized) cost of acquisition or generation.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment is carried at the cost of acquisition or construction and depreciated over its estimated useful life. An impairment loss is recognized in addition if an asset’s recoverable amount falls below its carrying
amount.
The cost of acquisition comprises the acquisition price plus ancillary and subsequent acquisition costs, less any
reduction received on the acquisition price. The cost of self-constructed property, plant and equipment comprises
the direct cost of materials, direct manufacturing expenses, and appropriate allocations of material and manufacturing overheads. Where an obligation exists to dismantle or remove an asset or restore a site to its former condition at the end of its useful life, the present value of the related future payments is capitalized along with the cost of
acquisition or construction upon completion and a corresponding liability is recognized.
If the construction phase of property, plant or equipment extends over a substantial period of time, the interest
incurred on borrowed capital up to the date of completion is capitalized as part of the cost of acquisition or construction in accordance with ias 23 (Borrowing Costs).
Costs for regular, comprehensive maintenance work (such as the major overhaul of a technical facility) are capitalized as a separate component if they satisfy the recognition criteria.
Property, plant and equipment is depreciated by the straight-line method over an asset’s useful life, except where
depreciation based on actual depletion is more appropriate.
The following depreciation periods are applied throughout the Group:

Useful Life of Property, Plant and Equipment

[Table 4.10]

Buildings

20 to 50 years

Outdoor infrastructure

10 to 20 years

Storage tanks and pipelines

10 to 20 years

Plant installations

6 to 20 years

Machinery and equipment

6 to 12 years

Furniture and fixtures

4 to 10 years

Vehicles

4 to 8 years

Computer equipment

3 to 5 years

Laboratory and research facilities

3 to 5 years

Significant asset components with different useful lives are accounted for and depreciated separately.
If there are indications that an individual item of property, plant and equipment may be impaired, the recoverable
amount is compared to the carrying amount. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. If the reasons for a previously recognized impairment loss no longer
apply, the impairment loss is reversed provided that the reversal does not cause the carrying amount to exceed the
cost of acquisition or construction less depreciation.
When assets are sold, closed down or scrapped, the difference between the net proceeds and the net carrying
amount of the assets is recognized as a gain or loss in other operating income or expenses, respectively.
Real estate held for investment comprises land and buildings not being used for operational or administrative purposes. It is measured using the cost model. The fair value of the investment property reported in the Notes is determined using the discounted cash flow method, comparisons with the current market values of similar properties,
or reports from external experts.

FINANCIAL ASSETS
Financial assets comprise loans and receivables, acquired equity and debt instruments, cash and cash equivalents,
and derivatives with positive fair values.
They are recognized and measured in accordance with ias 39 (Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement). Accordingly, financial assets are recognized in the consolidated financial statements if the Bayer Group has
a contractual right to receive cash or other financial assets from another entity. Regular-way purchases and sales of
financial assets are generally posted on the settlement date. Financial assets are initially recognized at fair value
plus transaction costs. The transaction costs incurred for the purchase of financial assets held at fair value through
profit or loss are expensed immediately. Interest-free or low-interest receivables are initially reflected at the present
value of the expected future cash flows. Upon first-time recognition, each financial asset is assigned to one of the
categories prescribed in ias 39. Subsequent measurement takes place according to the measurement rules for the
respective category. The measurement rules for each category are set forth below:
Financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss comprise those financial assets that are held for trading. Such
financial assets were mainly acquired for purposes of liquidity management with the intention of reselling them
within a short time. Receivables from forward commodity contracts and receivables from other derivatives that are
included in other financial assets are also allocated to this category, except where hedge accounting is used.
Changes in the fair value of financial assets in this category are recognized in profit or loss when the increase or
decrease in fair value occurs.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted
in an active market. They are accounted for at amortized cost using the effective interest method. This category
comprises trade accounts receivable, the loans and receivables included in other financial assets, the additional
financial receivables reflected in other receivables, and cash and cash equivalents. Interest income from items
assigned to this category is determined using the effective interest method.
Held-to-maturity financial assets are non-derivative financial assets, with fixed or determinable payments, that the
Bayer Group is willing and able to hold until maturity. They are accounted for at amortized cost using the effective
interest method. Held-to-maturity financial investments are recognized in other financial assets.
Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are not assigned to any of the above
categories. They mainly include equity instruments, such as shares, and debt instruments not to be held to maturity
that are included in other financial assets. After their first-time recognition, available-for-sale financial assets are
measured at fair value and any unrealized gains or losses are recognized outside profit or loss in equity. These are
only reclassified to profit or loss if the assets are sold or if there are objective indications of impairment, in which
case the accumulated loss is recognized in profit or loss. An objective indication of impairment is a significant or
prolonged decrease in the fair value of an equity instrument to below its acquisition cost. Previously recognized
impairment losses are reversed if the reasons for them no longer apply. Impairment loss reversals for equity instruments are recognized outside profit or loss, while those for debt instruments are recognized in profit or loss.
Where possible, a fair value for equity and debt securities is derived from market data. Financial assets for which
no market price is available and whose fair value cannot be reasonably estimated are recognized at cost less any
impairment losses.

» TABLE OF CONTENTS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Bayer Annual Report 2014
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

If there are substantial and objective indications of a decline in the value of loans and receivables, held-to-maturity
financial assets or available-for-sale financial assets, an impairment test is performed. Indications of possible impairment include a high probability of insolvency, a significant deterioration in credit standing, a material breach of
contract, operating losses reported by a company over several years, a reduction in market value, the financial
restructuring of the debtor, or the disappearance of an active market for the asset.
In the case of loans and receivables, and held-to-maturity financial assets, an impairment test is performed in
which the carrying amount is compared to the present value of the expected future cash flows, discounted at the
original effective interest rate. If the carrying amount exceeds the present value, an impairment loss is recognized
for the difference between the two amounts. If the reasons for previously recognized impairment losses no longer
apply, the impairment losses are reversed provided that this does not cause the carrying amounts to exceed the
amortized cost of acquisition.
Financial assets are derecognized when contractual rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets expire or
the financial assets are transferred together with all material risks and benefits.
INVENTORIES
In accordance with ias 2 (Inventories), inventories encompass assets consumed in production or in the rendering
of services (raw materials and supplies), assets in the production process for sale (work in process), goods held for
sale in the ordinary course of business (finished goods and goods purchased for resale), and advance payments on
inventories. Inventories are recognized at their cost of acquisition or production – calculated by the weightedaverage method – or at their net realizable value, whichever is lower. The net realizable value is the estimated
selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated cost to complete and selling expenses.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash, checks received, and balances with banks and companies. Cash equivalents are highly liquid short-term financial investments that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value,
are easily convertible into a known amount of cash and have a maturity of three months or less from the date of
acquisition or investment.
ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
Assets held for sale comprise noncurrent assets or disposal groups (together with any liabilities), the carrying
amounts of which will be realized principally through a highly probable sale transaction within the next twelve
months or an already contractually agreed sale transaction, and not through continued use. At the time of their
classification as “held for sale,” such assets are collectively measured at the lower of the carrying amount and fair
value less costs of disposal, and depreciation or amortization ceases.
PROVISIONS FOR PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
Within the Bayer Group, post-employment benefits are provided under defined contribution and / or defined benefit
plans. In the case of defined contribution plans, the company pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. Once the contributions have been paid, the
company has no further payment obligations. The regular contributions constitute expenses for the year in which
they are due and as such are included in the functional cost items, and thus in ebit. All other post-employment
benefit systems are defined benefit plans, which may be either unfunded, i.e. financed by provisions, or funded, i.e.
financed through pension funds.

247

248

» TABLE OF CONTENTS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Bayer Annual Report 2014
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

The present value of provisions for defined benefit plans and the resulting expense are calculated in accordance
with ias 19 (Employee Benefits) by the projected unit credit method. The future benefit obligations are valued by
actuarial methods and spread over the entire employment period on the basis of specific assumptions regarding
beneficiary structure and the economic environment. These relate mainly to the discount rate, future salary and
pension increases, variations in health care costs, and mortality rates.
The discount rates used are calculated from the yields of high-quality corporate bond portfolios in specific currencies with cash flows approximately equivalent to the expected disbursements from the pension plans. The uniform
discount rate derived from this interest-rate structure is thus based on the yields, at the closing date, of a portfolio
of “aa” rated corporate bonds whose weighted residual maturities approximately correspond to the duration necessary to cover the entire benefit obligation.
The fair value of plan assets is deducted from the present value of the defined benefit obligation for pensions and
other post-employment benefits to determine the net defined benefit liability. The obligations and plan assets are
valued at regular intervals of not more than three years. Comprehensive actuarial valuations for all major plans are
performed annually as of December 31. Plan assets in excess of the benefit obligation are reflected in other receivables, subject to the asset ceiling specified in ias 19 (Employee Benefits).
The balance of all income and expenses relating to defined benefit plans, except the net interest on the net liability,
is recognized in ebit. The net interest is reflected in the financial result under other financial income and expenses.
The effects of remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability are reflected in the statement of comprehensive
income as other comprehensive income. They consist of actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets and
changes in the effects of the asset ceiling, less the respective amounts included in net interest. Deferred taxes
relating to the effects of remeasurements are also recognized in other comprehensive income.
OTHER PROVISIONS
Other provisions are recognized for present legal and constructive obligations arising from past events that will
probably give rise to a future outflow of resources, provided that a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of
the obligations.
Other provisions are measured in accordance with ias 37 (Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets)
or, where applicable, ias 19 (Employee Benefits). Where the cash outflow to settle an obligation is expected to
occur after one year, the provision is recognized at the present value of the expected cash outflow. Claims for reimbursements from third parties are separately reflected in other receivables if their realization is virtually certain.
If the projected obligation declines as a result of a change in the estimate, the provision is reversed by the corresponding amount and the resulting income recognized in the operating expense item(s) in which the original
charge was recognized.
To enhance the information content of the estimates, certain provisions that could have a material effect on the
financial position or results of operations of the Group are selected and tested for their sensitivity to changes in the
underlying parameters. To reflect uncertainty about the likelihood of the assumed events actually occurring, the
impact of a five-percentage-point change in the probability of occurrence is examined in each case. This analysis
has not shown other provisions to be materially sensitive.

» TABLE OF CONTENTS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Bayer Annual Report 2014
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations and the amount and timing of
future taxable income. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and
complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions
made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate adjustments to tax income and expense in future
periods. The Group establishes provisions for taxes, based on reasonable estimates, for liabilities to the tax authorities of the respective countries that are uncertain as to their amount and the probability of their occurrence.
The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as experience with previous tax audits and differing legal interpretations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority.
Provisions for environmental protection are recorded if future cash outflows are likely to be necessary to ensure
compliance with environmental regulations or to carry out remediation work, such costs can be reliably estimated
and no future benefits are expected from such measures.
Estimating the future costs of environmental protection and remediation involves many uncertainties, particularly
with regard to the status of laws, regulations and the information available about conditions in the various countries and at the individual sites. Significant factors in estimating the costs include previous experiences in similar
cases, the conclusions in expert opinions obtained regarding the Group’s environmental programs, current costs
and new developments affecting costs, management’s interpretation of current environmental laws and regulations,
the number and financial position of third parties that may become obligated to participate in any remediation
costs on the basis of joint liability, and the remediation methods likely to be deployed. Changes in these assumptions could impact future reported results.
Taking into consideration experience gained to date regarding environmental matters of a similar nature, provisions are believed to be adequate based upon currently available information. Given the difficulties inherent in
estimating liabilities in the businesses in which the Group operates, especially those for which the risk of environmental damage is greater in relative terms (CropScience and MaterialScience), it remains possible that material
additional costs will be incurred beyond the amounts accrued. It may transpire during remediation work that additional expenditures are necessary over an extended period and that these exceed existing provisions and cannot be
reasonably estimated.
Provisions for restructuring only cover expenses that arise directly from restructuring measures, are necessary for
restructuring and are not related to future business operations. Such expenses include severance payments to
employees and compensation payments in respect of rented property that can no longer be used.
Restructuring measures may include the sale or termination of business units, site closures, relocations of business
activities or fundamental reorganizations of business units.
The respective provisions are established when a detailed restructuring plan has been drawn up, resolved upon by
the responsible decision-making level of management and communicated to the employees and / or their representatives. Provisions for restructuring are established at the present value of future disbursements.
Trade-related provisions are recorded mainly for the granting of rebates or discounts, product returns, or obligations in respect of goods or services already received but not yet invoiced.
As a global company with a diverse business portfolio, the Bayer Group is exposed to numerous legal risks for
which provisions for litigations must be established under certain conditions – particularly in the areas of product
liability, competition and antitrust law, patent disputes, tax law and environmental protection.

Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

Litigation and other judicial proceedings often raise complex issues and are subject to many uncertainties and
complexities including, but not limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case, the jurisdiction in
which each suit is brought and differences in applicable law. The outcomes of currently pending and future proceedings generally cannot be predicted. It is particularly difficult to assess the likely outcomes of class actions for
damages in the United States, which may give rise to significant financial risks for the Bayer Group. As a result of a
judgment in court proceedings, regulatory decisions or the conclusion of a settlement, the Bayer Group may incur
charges for which no accounting measures have yet been taken for lack of reasonable estimability or which exceed
presently established provisions and the insurance coverage.
The Bayer Group considers the need for accounting measures in respect of pending or future litigations, and the
extent of any such measures, on the basis of the information available to its legal department and in close consultation with legal counsel acting for the Bayer Group.
Where it is more likely than not that such a litigation will result in an outflow of resources that is already reasonably
estimable, a provision for litigation is recorded in the amount of the present value of the expected cash outflows.
Such provisions cover the estimated payments to the plaintiffs, court and procedural costs, attorney costs and the
cost of potential settlements.
It is frequently impossible to reliably determine the existence of a present obligation or reasonably estimate the
probability that a potential outflow of resources will result from a pending or future litigation. The status of the
material “legal risks” is described in note [32]. Due to the special nature of these litigations, provisions generally
are not established until initial settlements allow an estimate of potential amounts or judgments have been issued.
Provisions for legal defense costs are established if it is probable that material costs will have to be incurred for
external legal counsel to defend the company’s legal position.
Internal and external legal counsel evaluate the current status of the Bayer Group’s material legal risks at the end
of each reporting period. The need to establish or adjust a provision and the amount of the provision or adjustment
are determined on this basis. Adjusting events are reflected up to the date of preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The measurement of provisions in the case of class actions or mass compensation claims is mainly
based on any settlements reached during the past year and on pending or anticipated future claims.
Personnel-related provisions are mainly those recorded for annual bonus payments, variable one-time payments,
individual performance awards, long-service awards, severance payments in connection with early retirement
arrangements, surpluses on long-term accounts and other personnel costs. Obligations under stock-based compensation programs that provide for awards payable in cash are also included here.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
Financial liabilities comprise primary financial liabilities and negative fair values of derivatives.
Primary financial liabilities are initially recognized in the consolidated financial statements at fair value if the Bayer
Group has a contractual obligation to transfer cash or other financial assets to another party. In subsequent periods, such liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
Financial liabilities are derecognized when the contractual obligation is discharged or canceled, or has expired.
OTHER RECEIVABLES AND LIABILITIES
Accrued items and other non-financial assets and liabilities are carried at amortized cost. They are amortized to
income by the straight-line method or according to performance of the underlying transaction.
Grants and subsidies from third parties that serve to promote investment are reflected in the statement of financial
position under other liabilities and amortized to income over the useful lives of the respective investments.

DERIVATIVES
The Bayer Group uses derivatives – such as forward exchange contracts and interest-rate swaps – to mitigate the
risk of changes in exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Derivatives are recognized at the trade
date.
Contracts concluded in order to receive or deliver non-financial goods for the company’s own purposes are not
accounted for as derivatives but treated as pending transactions. Where embedded derivatives are identified that
are required to be separated from the pending transactions, they are accounted for separately. To take advantage of
market opportunities or cover possible peak demand, a non-material volume of transactions may be entered into
for which the possibility of immediate resale cannot be excluded. Such transactions are allocated to separate portfolios upon acquisition and accounted for as derivatives according to ias 39.
Derivatives are carried at fair value. Positive fair values at the end of the reporting period are reflected in financial
assets, negative fair values in financial liabilities. Changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized
directly in profit or loss except where hedge accounting is used. Changes in the fair values of forward exchange
contracts and currency options serving as hedges of items in the statement of financial position are reflected in
other financial income and expenses as exchange gains or losses, while changes in the values of interest-rate
swaps and interest-rate options are recognized in interest income or expense. Changes in the fair values of commodity futures and options, and of forward exchange contracts used to hedge forecasted transactions in foreign
currencies, are recognized in other operating income or expenses.
Changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as fair-value hedges and the adjustments in the carrying
amounts of the underlying transactions are recognized in profit or loss.
Changes in the fair values of the effective portion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are initially recognized outside profit or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income. They are reclassified to profit or loss
when the underlying transaction is realized. If such a derivative is sold or ceases to qualify for hedge accounting,
the change in its value continues to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted
transaction is realized. If the forecasted transaction is no longer probable, the amount previously recognized in
accumulated other comprehensive income has to be reclassified to profit or loss. The ineffective portion of gains or
losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recognized either in other operating income or expenses or
in the financial result, depending on the type of underlying transaction.
The income and expense reflected in the financial result pertaining to the derivatives and the underlying transactions are shown separately. Income and expense are not offset.
LEASING
A lease is an agreement whereby the lessor assigns to the lessee the right to use an asset for an agreed period of
time in return for a payment or series of payments. Leases are classified as either finance or operating leases.
Leasing transactions that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset
to the lessee are treated as finance leases. All other leasing agreements are classified as operating leases. Whether
an agreement constitutes a lease or contains a lease is determined upon inception of the lease.
Where the Bayer Group is the lessee in a finance lease, the leased asset is capitalized at the lower of the fair value
of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments at the beginning of the lease term and simultaneously recognized under financial liabilities. The minimum lease payments are divided into the principal portion
of the remaining obligation and the financing costs, which are determined using the effective-interest method. The
leased asset is depreciated by the straight-line method over the shorter of its estimated useful life or the lease term.

Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

Where the Bayer Group is the lessee in an operating lease, the lease payments are expensed. Where it is the lessor,
the lease payments received are recognized in profit or loss. The leased asset continues to be recognized under
property, plant and equipment in the Bayer Group’s statement of financial position.
ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING
Acquired businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method, which requires that the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed be recorded at their respective fair values on the date Bayer obtains control. Ancillary acquisition costs are recognized as expenses in the periods in which they occur.
The application of the acquisition method requires certain estimates and assumptions to be made, especially concerning the fair values of the acquired intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and the liabilities assumed
at the acquisition date, and the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets, property, plant and equipment.
Measurement is based to a large extent on anticipated cash flows. If actual cash flows vary from those used in
calculating fair values, this may materially affect the Group’s future results of operations. In particular, the estimation of discounted cash flows from intangible assets under development, patented and non-patented technologies
and brands is based on assumptions concerning, for example:
•
•
•
•
•

the outcomes of research and development activities regarding compound efficacy, results of clinical trials, etc.,
the probability of obtaining regulatory approvals in individual countries,
long-term sales trends,
possible selling price erosion due to generic competition in the market following patent expirations,
the behavior of competitors (launch of competing products, marketing initiatives, etc.).

For significant acquisitions, the purchase price allocation is carried out with assistance from independent thirdparty valuation specialists. The valuations are based on the information available at the acquisition date.
In step acquisitions, the fair values of the acquired entity’s assets and liabilities are measured in accordance with
ifrs 3 (Business Combinations) at the date on which control is obtained. Any resulting adjustments to the fair value
of the existing interest are recognized in profit or loss. The carrying amount of the assets and liabilities already
recognized in the statement of financial position is then adjusted accordingly.
PROCEDURE USED IN GLOBAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING AND ITS IMPACT
Impairment tests are performed not only on individual items of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment,
but also at the level of cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units. A cash-generating unit is the
smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows
from other assets or groups of assets. The Bayer Group regards its strategic business entities or groups of strategic
business entities, as well as certain product families, as cash-generating units and subjects them to global impairment testing. The strategic business entities constitute the second financial reporting level below the segments.
Cash-generating units and unit groups are globally tested if there is an indication of possible impairment. Those to
which goodwill is allocated are tested at least annually.
Impairment testing involves comparing the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit, unit group or item of
intangible assets, property, plant or equipment to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less
costs of disposal or value in use. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss
must be recognized for the difference. If a strategic business entity or entity group is found to be impaired, an
impairment loss is first recognized on any goodwill allocated to it. Any remaining part of the impairment loss is
then allocated among the other assets of the strategic business entity or entity group in proportion to their carrying amounts. The resulting expense is reflected in the functional item of the income statement in which the depreciation or amortization of the respective assets is recognized. The same applies to income from impairment
loss reversals.

» TABLE OF CONTENTS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Bayer Annual Report 2014
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

The recoverable amount is generally determined on the basis of the fair value less costs of disposal, taking into
account the present value of the future net cash flows as market prices for the individual units are not normally
available. These are forecasted on the basis of the Bayer Group’s current planning, the planning horizon normally
being three to five years. Forecasting involves making assumptions, especially regarding future selling prices, sales
volumes and costs. Where the recoverable amount is the fair value less costs of disposal, the cash-generating unit
or unit group is measured from the viewpoint of an independent market participant. Where the recoverable amount
is the value in use, the cash-generating unit, unit group or individual asset is measured as currently used. In either
case, net cash flows beyond the planning period are determined on the basis of long-term business expectations
using the respective individual growth rates derived from market information. The measurement of fair value less
costs of disposal is based on unobservable inputs (Level 3).
The net cash inflows are discounted at a rate equivalent to the weighted average cost of equity and debt capital. To
allow for the different risk and return profiles of the Bayer Group’s principal businesses, the after-tax cost of capital
is calculated separately for each subgroup and a subgroup-specific capital structure is defined by benchmarking
against comparable companies in the same industry sector. The cost of equity corresponds to the return expected
by stockholders, while the cost of debt is based on the conditions on which comparable companies can obtain longterm financing. Both components are derived from capital market information.
The growth rates applied for impairment testing in 2014 and 2013 and the capital cost factors used to discount the
expected cash flows are shown in the following table:

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

No impairment losses were recognized on goodwill on the basis of the global annual impairment testing of the
cash-generating units and unit groups in 2014 or 2013. Impairment losses of €6 million were recognized on goodwill in 2014 due to divestitures (2013: €0 million). Taking into account impairment loss reversals of €2 million
(2013: €13 million), net impairment losses on goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment
amounted to €223 million (2013: €285 million). Details are provided in notes [17] and [18].
Although the estimates of the useful lives of certain assets, assumptions concerning the macroeconomic environment and developments in the industries in which the Bayer Group operates, and estimates of the discounted future cash flows are believed to be appropriate, changes in assumptions or circumstances could require changes in
the analysis. This could lead to additional impairment losses in the future or – except in the case of goodwill – to
reversals of previously recognized impairment losses if developments are contrary to expectations.
The sensitivity analysis for cash-generating units and unit groups to which goodwill is allocated was based on a
10% reduction in future cash flows, a 10% increase in the weighted average cost of capital or a one-percentagepoint reduction in the long-term growth rate. Bayer concluded that no impairment loss would need to be recognized on goodwill in any cash-generating unit or unit group under these conditions.

5. Segment reporting
At Bayer the Board of Management, as the chief operating decision maker, allocates resources to the operating
segments and assesses their performance. The reportable segments and regions are identified, and the disclosures
selected, in line with the internal financial reporting system (management approach) and based on the Group
accounting policies outlined in note [4].
As of December 31, 2014, the Bayer Group comprised three subgroups, with operations subdivided into strategic
business entities known as divisions (HealthCare), business groups (CropScience) or business units (MaterialScience). Their activities are aggregated into four reportable segments according to economic characteristics,
products, production processes, customer relationships, methods of distribution and regulatory environment.

polyurethanes, polycarbonates, coating and adhesive raw materials and specialty chemicals;
production and marketing of selected inorganic basic chemicals

Business activities that cannot be allocated to any other segment are reported under “All other segments.” These
include primarily the services provided by the service areas: Business Services, Technology Services and Currenta.
Holding companies’ activities, the elimination of intersegment sales, and higher or lower expenses for Group-wide
long-term stock-based compensation arising from fluctuations in the performance of Bayer stock are presented in
our segment reporting as “Corporate Center and Consolidation.”
The reconciliation in the table “Key Data by Region” eliminates interregional items and transactions and reflects
income, expenses, assets and liabilities not allocable to geographical areas, particularly those relating to the Corporate Center.
The segment data are calculated as follows:
• The intersegment sales reflect intra-Group transactions effected at transfer prices fixed on an arm’s-length
basis.
• Although ebit before special items and ebitda before special items are not defined in the International Financial
Reporting Standards, they represent key performance indicators for the Bayer Group. The special items comprise effects that are non-recurring or do not regularly recur or attain similar magnitudes. ebitda is the ebit as
reported in the income statement plus amortization and impairment losses on intangible assets and depreciation
and impairment losses on property, plant and equipment, minus impairment loss reversals.
• The gross cash flow comprises income after taxes, plus income taxes, plus financial result, minus income taxes
paid or accrued, plus depreciation, amortization and impairment losses, minus impairment loss reversals,
plus / minus changes in pension provisions, minus gains / plus losses on retirements of noncurrent assets, minus
gains from the remeasurement of already held assets in step acquisitions. The change in pension provisions includes the elimination of non-cash components of ebit. It also contains benefit payments during the year.
• The net cash flow is the cash flow from operating activities as defined in ias 7 (Statement of Cash Flows).
• The capital invested and the segment assets include all assets serving the respective segment that are required
to yield a return on their cost of acquisition. Segment assets include, in addition, assets held for sale where the
return is covered by the sale proceeds. Similarly, the segment liabilities include the liabilities directly related to
assets held for sale. Also included in the capital invested and in segment assets are material participating interests of direct relevance to business operations. Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are included
in the capital invested at cost of acquisition, generation or construction throughout their useful lives. Interestfree liabilities are deducted from the capital invested, which is stated as of December 31.

• The cfroi – a measure of the return on the capital employed – is the difference between the gross cash flow and
the cost of reproducing depletable assets, divided by the average capital invested for the year.
• The equity items reflect the earnings and carrying amounts of companies accounted for using the equity method.
• Since the financial management of Group companies is carried out centrally by Bayer AG, financial liabilities are
not directly allocated among the segments. Consequently, the liabilities shown for the individual segments do
not include financial liabilities. These are included in the reconciliation.
• The number of employees on either permanent or fixed-term contracts is stated in full-time equivalents (fte),
with part-time employees included on a pro-rated basis in line with their contractual working hours. The figures
do not include apprentices.
RECONCILIATIONS
The reconciliations of ebitda before special items, ebit before special items and ebit to Group income before income taxes and of the assets and liabilities of the segments to the assets and liabilities, respectively, of the Group

The increase in the number of consolidated companies in 2014 was primarily due to acquisitions. Derecognitions
were primarily due to mergers among Group companies.
The Bayer Group holds 100% of the voting rights in the fully consolidated subsidiary Bayer Pearl Polyurethane
Systems llc, United Arab Emirates, pursuant to a contractual agreement with the non-controlling stockholders.
Pure Salt Baytown llc, United States, is fully consolidated as a structured entity. The Bayer Group guarantees the
liabilities of Pure Salt Baytown llc to banks. These liabilities, which are reflected in full in the consolidated statement of financial position, amounted to €20 million as of December 31, 2014 (2013: €22 million).
The above table includes the joint operation Lyondell Bayer Manufacturing Maasvlakte vof, Netherlands, as of
December 31, 2014 (2013: two joint operations). Pursuant to ifrs 11, Bayer’s shares of these companies’ assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses are included in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Bayer’s
rights and obligations. The main purpose of Lyondell Bayer Manufacturing Maasvlakte vof is the joint production
of propylene oxide (po) for Bayer and its partner Lyondell.
Three (2013: two) associates and three (2013: three) joint ventures are accounted for in the consolidated financial
statements using the equity method. Details of these companies are given in note [19].
Nanjing Baijingyu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., China, was newly classified as an associate in view of Bayer’s representation on its executive committee and supervisory board. This enables Bayer to exert significant influence over
its financial and operating policy decisions despite owning only 15% of its voting rights and capital.
A total of 78 (2013: 79) subsidiaries, including one (2013: one) structured entity and 12 (2013: 14) associates or
joint ventures that in aggregate are immaterial to the Bayer Group’s financial position and results of operations are
not consolidated but recognized at cost. The immaterial subsidiaries accounted for less than 0.2% of Group sales,
less than 0.3% of equity and less than 0.2% of total assets.
Details of subsidiary and affiliated companies pursuant to Section 313 of the German Commercial Code can be
accessed at www.annualreport2014.bayer.com/en/companylist.pdfx
The following domestic subsidiaries availed themselves in 2014 of certain exemptions granted under Section 264

6.2 Business combinations and other acquisitions
ACQUISITIONS IN 2014
Acquisitions are accounted for by the acquisition method, the results of the acquired businesses therefore being
included in the consolidated financial statements as of the respective acquisition dates. The purchase prices of
acquired companies domiciled outside the eurozone were translated at the exchange rates in effect at the respective acquisition dates.
The total purchase price of the acquisitions made in 2014 was €13,741 million (2013: €1,441 million). The purchase
prices of the acquired companies or businesses were settled mainly in cash. Total goodwill of €5,990 million
(2013: €801 million) arose on these acquisitions. It related principally to the following transactions:
On March 6, 2014, CropScience completed the acquisition of all the shares of Biagro Group, a producer and distributor of biological seed treatment solutions headquartered in General Las Heras in the province of Buenos Aires,
Argentina. The company operates production facilities in Argentina and Brazil. Its portfolio of established brands
includes seed-applied inoculants, plant-growth-promoting microorganisms and other products for integrated pest
management based on bacterial and fungal strains. The acquisition will help CropScience to build on the success of
its soybean seed business in Latin America. The acquisition remains subject to the approval of the Argentinian
antitrust authorities. A one-time payment and purchase price adjustment totaling €10 million were agreed upon
along with potential milestone payments reflected at €6 million in the purchase price allocation. The milestone
payments are mainly dependent on the achievement of certain sales targets and product approvals. The purchase
price mainly pertained to the technology platform and goodwill. Sales of €6 million were recorded since the acquisition date.
In March 2014, Pharmaceuticals successfully completed the takeover offer for the shares of Algeta asa, Oslo,
Norway, and acquired 100% of the outstanding shares. Bayer issued a takeover offer for all the shares of Algeta at
a price of nok362 per share in cash on January 20, 2014. On expiration of the offer deadline, Bayer had received
acceptances from Algeta shareholders representing about 98% of the share capital. On March 14, 2014, a compulsory acquisition process was carried out to obtain the remaining 2% of the shares, also at a price of nok362 per
share.
Algeta develops novel cancer therapies based on its world-leading, patented technologies. The company
develops alpha-pharmaceuticals designed to target cancers using the unique properties of alpha particle radiation.
HealthCare and Algeta have collaborated since 2009 to develop and commercialize radium-223 dichloride, which
was approved in the United States in May 2013 under the tradename Xofigo™. The acquisition strengthens the
oncology business of Pharmaceuticals. The purchase price was €1,974 million, including €35 million for the settlement of the pre-existing relationship between Algeta and Bayer. The latter amount represents the value of the
advantage enjoyed by the acquirer from the contractual relationship that existed prior to the acquisition compared
to current market conditions for similar collaborations. The settlement amount is reflected in other operating income and at the same time increases the consideration transferred.
The purchase price mainly pertained to an intangible asset for the product-specific radium-223 technology along
with goodwill. The goodwill is mainly attributable to synergies in administration processes and infrastructure,
including cost savings in the selling, research and development, and general administration functions.

On September 30, 2014, CropScience completed the acquisition of the seeds business of Granar s.a., headquartered in Encarnación, Paraguay. Granar specializes in the breeding, production and marketing of improved seed,
especially soybean seed, that is adapted to the growing conditions in subtropical regions. It has a strong presence
in Paraguay and Uruguay and an increasing presence in Brazil. Granar will continue to sell the seed for its own
account for the 2014 / 15 sowing season. Bayer will take over marketing in 2015. Part of the agreed one-time payment of €15 million to acquire the business has been retained for disbursement over the next six years and is reflected at €2 million in the purchase price allocation.
On October 1, 2014, HealthCare completed the acquisition of the consumer care business of u.s. company Merck &
Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, New Jersey. The acquired business is primarily comprised of products in the cold,
allergy, sinus & flu, dermatology (including sun care), foot health and gastrointestinal categories. The most important brands are Claritin™ (allergy), Coppertone™ (sun care), MiraLAX™ (gastrointestinal) and Afrin™ (cold), and
– in North America and Latin America – Dr. Scholl’s™ (foot health). These products complement Bayer’s existing
range of non-prescription medicines.
The acquisition significantly enhances Bayer’s over-the-counter (otc) business across multiple therapeutic categories and geographies. It gives Consumer Health the global number two position in a widely diversified sector and
strong global positions in the five most important otc segments: dermatology, gastrointestinal, sinus & flu (cold,
allergy, sinus, flu), dietary supplements and pain therapy.
In those countries where the consumer care business was acquired via an asset deal, Merck & Co., Inc. will continue the sales activities in its own name for a transitional period until the marketing authorizations are transferred to
Bayer or Bayer can take over the business as distributor. During this period, the economic rewards and risks will
already accrue to Bayer, and Bayer will receive the operating profit on the business from Merck. The transitional
period has already ended for the majority of countries.
Where the business was acquired via a share deal, Bayer purchased 100% of the respective company’s shares.
Bayer paid a provisional purchase price of €11,177 million, less specific amounts that are being retained pending
the receipt of antitrust approvals in the Republic of Korea and the transfer of further assets. The provisional purchase price allocation mainly comprises goodwill of €5,137 million and acquired brands valued at €5,362 million.
Goodwill is largely based on cost synergies, especially in marketing and manufacturing, as well as on sales synergies resulting from the increased distribution capability and use of the global infrastructure. As expected, a
goodwill amount of €3,761 million is tax-deductible. The acquired business recorded sales of €289 million in the
Consumer Health segment and €7 million in the Pharmaceuticals segment since the acquisition date.
Upon closure of this acquisition, the strategic pharmaceutical collaboration agreed between Bayer and Merck & Co.,
Inc. in the field of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) modulation also came into effect. Bayer’s aim in entering into the
global co-development and co-commercialization agreement, which has already received antitrust clearance, is to
strengthen its development potential in the cardiovascular therapeutic area. In this connection, Merck & Co., Inc. is
to make payments to Bayer of up to us$2.1 billion, comprising an up-front payment of us$1.0 billion (€793 million)
and sales milestone payments of up to us$1.1 billion related to future joint activities with certain compounds including Adempas™ (riociguat) to treat pulmonary hypertension. The one-time payment of €793 million is to be recognized in sales and earnings over a period of 13.5 years. It includes an amount of €15 million recognized for the
fourth quarter of 2014.

On November 1, 2014, Consumer Health acquired all the shares of Dihon Pharmaceutical Group Co. Ltd., Kunming,
Yunnan, China. Dihon is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the manufacture and marketing of over-thecounter (otc) and herbal traditional Chinese medicine products. A provisional purchase price of €401 million was
paid, based on a purchase price adjustment mechanism. The purchase price pertained mainly to acquired trademarks and goodwill. Sales of €3 million were recorded since the acquisition date.
On December 1, 2014, CropScience completed the acquisition of land management assets in the United States,
Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand from E. I. DuPont de Nemours and Company, United States. The acquisition provides CropScience with access to the growing forestry and range & pasture business segments in
North America. Bayer paid a provisional purchase price of €120 million. A potential milestone payment for a successful registration was agreed upon in addition. This payment was included at €18 million in the purchase price
allocation. The purchase price pertained mainly to intangible assets for product-related technologies and goodwill.
The purchase price allocations for Biagro Group, the consumer care business of Merck & Co., Inc., Dihon Pharmaceutical Group Co. Ltd. and the land management assets of E. I. DuPont de Nemours and Company currently remain incomplete pending compilation and review of the relevant financial information. It is therefore possible that
changes will be made in the allocation of the purchase prices to the individual assets and liabilities.
The acquired businesses named above contributed €305 million to Bayer Group sales in 2014. Of this amount,
€296 million pertained to the consumer care business acquired from Merck & Co., Inc. and €3 million to Dihon.
Their combined ebit for 2014 amounted to minus €132 million, with the consumer care business acquired from
Merck & Co., Inc. accounting for minus €57 million, Algeta for minus €52 million and Dihon for minus €22 million.
Their total income after taxes since the respective dates of their first-time consolidation was minus €194 million,
of which the consumer care business acquired from Merck & Co., Inc. accounted for minus €108 million, Algeta
for minus €64 million and Dihon for minus €20 million. This includes the financing costs incurred since the respective acquisition dates.
If the above acquisitions had already been made as of January 1, 2014, the Bayer Group would have had total
sales of €43,639 million in 2014, with €1,525 million pertaining to the consumer care business acquired from
Merck & Co., Inc. and €112 million to Dihon. Group income after taxes would have amounted to €3,292 million,
with the consumer care business acquired from Merck & Co., Inc. accounting for minus €214 million, Algeta for
minus €86 million and Dihon for minus €46 million. This takes into account the effects of the hypothetical financing costs for the full year. The acquisition of the above-named businesses as of January 1, 2014, would have
diminished earnings per share by €0.18.
The effects of these and other, smaller transactions made in 2014 – and of purchase price adjustments made in
2014 relating to previous years’ / quarters’ transactions – on the Group’s assets and liabilities as of the respective
acquisition or adjustment dates are shown in the table. Net of acquired cash and cash equivalents, the transactions
resulted in the following cash outflow:

ACQUISITIONS IN 2013
In 2013, the following acquisitions were accounted for in accordance with ifrs 3:
On January 2, 2013, Consumer Health wholly acquired the u.s. company Teva Animal Health Inc., St. Joseph,
Missouri. The acquisition broadens Consumer Health’s range of anti-infective solutions for livestock and expands
the existing product offering to include reproductive hormones. The transaction also adds dermatological products
for companion animals, pet wellness products and nutraceuticals to the company’s portfolio. The parties agreed
on a one-time payment of €38 million plus potential milestone payments, for which an amount of €45 million was
included in the purchase price allocation. The milestone payments are mainly dependent on the achievement of
various sales targets. The purchase price pertained mainly to product trademarks.
On January 18, 2013, CropScience acquired all the shares of PROPHYTA Biologischer Pflanzenschutz GmbH, a
leading supplier of biological crop protection products headquartered in Malchow in the German state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. In addition to research and development facilities, the acquisition also includes stateof-the-art production and formulation facilities in the city of Wismar. A purchase price of €25 million was agreed,
pertaining mainly to technologies, research and development projects and goodwill. In addition, two related
distribution rights were acquired for €5 million.

On March 15, 2013, CropScience wholly acquired soybean seed producer Wehrtec Tecnologia Agricola Ltda. and
the soybean business of Agricola Wehrmann Ltda. Both companies are headquartered in Cristalina in the Brazilian
state of Goiás. This transaction strengthens the soybean research and development activities of CropScience and
contributes to the development of varieties tailored to the requirements of Brazilian soybean growers. A purchase
price of €34 million was agreed along with potential milestone payments of up to €11 million. The purchase price
pertained mainly to marketable crop plants, breeding material and goodwill.
In June 2013, Pharmaceuticals successfully completed the tender offer for the shares of Conceptus, Inc., currently
headquartered in Milpitas, California, United States, and acquired 100% of the outstanding shares. Conceptus, Inc.
has developed Essure™, the only non-surgical permanent birth control method, which it markets in the u.s. and
other countries. This acquisition enables Bayer to offer an even broader range of short-term, long-term and permanent contraceptive choices for women. A purchase price of €780 million was paid, pertaining mainly to technology
and trademark rights. The goodwill remaining after the purchase price allocation is attributable to various factors,
including significant cost savings in the marketing and sales functions along with general administration and infrastructure synergies.
In April 2013, the District Court of Berlin reached a decision in the court proceeding initiated by former minority
stockholders of Bayer Pharma AG (formerly Bayer Schering Pharma AG) to review the adequacy of compensation
payments made by Bayer in connection with the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement of 2006. The
court decided that the compensation by Bayer at the time should be increased by about 40%. Bayer disagrees with
this decision and has appealed. The potential supplementary payment represents a subsequent purchase price
adjustment according to the March 31, 2004 version of ifrs 3 applicable at the acquisition date. Additional goodwill of €261 million, excluding interest, has been capitalized for this proceeding and for the parallel proceeding
relating to the squeeze-out of the former minority stockholders.
On July 1, 2013, Consumer Health acquired all the shares of Steigerwald Arzneimittelwerk GmbH, Darmstadt,
Germany. Steigerwald holds a strong position in the German phytopharmaceuticals market, which is focused on
pharmacy-only herbal medicines. Its product portfolio includes Iberogast™ for the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders and Laif™ for the treatment of mild to moderate depression. A purchase price of €218 million
was agreed, pertaining mainly to product trademarks, technologies and goodwill.
On December 2, 2013, CropScience acquired fn Semillas s.a. and its parent company Holding Manager s.a., both
headquartered in Buenos Aires, Argentina. fn Semillas specializes in the breeding, production and marketing of
improved soybean seeds in Argentina. A purchase price of €25 million was agreed, pertaining mainly to commercial cultivars, germplasm and goodwill.

6.3 Divestitures
DIVESTITURES IN 2014

detailed below.
On August 29, 2014, Consumer Health completed the sale of the Interventional device business to Boston Scientific
Corporation, Natick, Massachusetts, United States. The sale comprised the AngioJet™ thrombectomy system
and the Jetstream™ atherectomy system, as well as the Fetch™2 aspiration catheter used in cardiology, radiology
and peripheral vascular procedures. The total transaction price, including fees for transitional services to Boston
Scientific and before working capital adjustments, was €315 million. Disregarding the transitional services, a
special gain of €80 million and deferred income of €2 million were recognized.

Interest and similar expenses included interest expense of €55 million (2013: €43 million) relating to non-financial
liabilities. Interest and similar income included interest income of €48 million (2013: €26 million) from nonfinancial assets.
At the end of April 2013, the District Court of Berlin reached a decision in the court proceeding initiated by
former minority stockholders of Bayer Pharma AG (formerly Bayer Schering Pharma AG) to review the adequacy of
compensation payments made by Bayer in connection with the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement
of 2006. The court decided that the compensation paid by Bayer at the time should be increased by about 40%.
Bayer disagrees with this decision and has appealed. Interest expense of €10 million was recognized in 2014
(2013: €63 million) in connection with a potential additional payment.
The change in the liability for redeemable non-controlling interests is reflected in interest income or expense.
In 2014 a €46 million decrease (2013: €31 million increase) in this liability was recognized as interest income
(2013: interest expense).

The interest portion of noncurrent provisions comprised €275 million (2013: €302 million) in interest expense for
pension and other post-employment benefit provisions plus €47 million (2013: minus €5 million) in effects of interest expense and interest-rate fluctuations for other provisions and corresponding overfunding. The interest expense for pension and other post-employment benefit provisions included €828 million (2013: €763 million) for the
unwinding of discount on the present value of the defined benefit obligation and €553 million (2013: €461 million)
in interest income from plan assets.
The higher exchange loss was partly due to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar.

Deferred taxes on remeasurements, recognized outside profit or loss, of the net liability for defined benefit pension
and other post-employment benefits increased equity by €1,621 million (2013: diminished equity by €604 million).
Deferred taxes on changes, recognized outside profit or loss, in fair values of available-for-sale financial assets and
derivatives designated as cash flow hedges increased equity by €55 million (2013: diminished equity by €2 million).
These effects on equity are reported in the statement of comprehensive income.
The use of tax loss carryforwards reduced the income taxes paid or accrued in 2014 by €24 million (2013:
€62 million). The use of tax credits reduced income taxes paid or accrued by €10 million (2013: €18 million).
Of the total tax loss carryforwards of €4,535 million in 2014 (2013: 3,071 million), an amount of €1,737 million
(2013: €2,127 million) is expected to be usable within a reasonable period. The increase in loss carryforwards
was mainly due to losses that newly arose in 2014 and tax reassessments for prior years. Deferred tax assets of
€446 million (2013: €313 million) were recognized for the amount of loss carryforwards expected to be usable.
The deferred tax assets included an amount of €39 million (2013: €98 million) that resulted from purchase price
allocations and was recognized outside profit or loss.
The use of €2,798 million (2013: €944 million) of tax loss carryforwards was subject to legal or economic restrictions. Consequently, no deferred tax assets were recognized for this amount. If these tax loss carryforwards
had been fully usable, deferred tax assets of €138 million (2013: €117 million) would have been recognized.
Tax credits of €144 million were recognized in 2014 (2013: €126 million) as deferred tax assets, including
€0 million (2013: €2 million) outside profit or loss. The use of €45 million (2013: €29 million) of tax credits was
subject to legal or economic restrictions. Consequently, no deferred tax assets were recognized for this amount.

In 2014, subsidiaries that reported losses for 2014 or 2013 recognized net deferred tax assets totaling
€1,296 million (2013: €757 million) from temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards. These assets were
considered to be unimpaired because the companies concerned were expected to generate taxable income in the
future.
Deferred tax liabilities of €6 million were recognized in 2014 (2013: €10 million) for planned dividend payments by
subsidiaries. Deferred tax liabilities of €48 million were recognized in 2014 (2013: €0 million) for the planned sale
of shares in subsidiaries upon the separation of the MaterialScience business. Deferred tax liabilities were not
recognized for temporary differences on €8,648 million (2013: €10,583 million) of retained earnings of subsidiaries
because the Bayer Group is able to control the timing of the difference reversal and the temporary differences will
not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The reported tax expense of €1,082 million for 2014 (2013: €1,021 million) differed by €58 million (2013: €32 million) from the expected tax expense of €1,140 million (2013: €1,053 million) that would have resulted from applying an expected weighted average tax rate to the pre-tax income of the Group. This average rate, derived from the
expected tax rates of the individual Group companies, was 25.2% in 2014 (2013: 25.0%). The effective tax rate
was 23.9% (2013: 24.3%).

The capitalized patents and technologies include an amount pertaining to the active ingredient alemtuzumab
(product name: Lemtrada) for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Bayer gave back the worldwide distribution rights
for alemtuzumab to Genzyme Corp., United States, in 2009 and in return received global co-promotion rights and
an entitlement to royalties and revenue-based milestone payments. Genzyme Corp. received marketing approval for
alemtuzumab in Europe in 2013 and in the United States in 2014. Bayer has decided not to exercise its copromotion rights.

Impairment losses of €127 million, net of a €2 million impairment loss reversal, were recognized on intangible
assets. In the Pharmaceuticals reporting segment, a €29 million impairment loss was recognized on marketing and
distribution rights in a segment of cardiovascular risk management due to a heightened competitive environment.
In the Consumer Health reporting segment, a €22 million impairment loss was recognized on trademarks at Animal
Health in light of strong generic competition.
Impairment losses were recognized on further intangible assets in the Consumer Health segment (€40 million), the
CropScience segment (€24 million), the MaterialScience segment (€5 million), the Pharmaceuticals segment
(€4 million) and Other Segments (€3 million).

In the case of research and development projects, the point in time from which a capitalized asset can be expected
to generate an economic benefit for the company cannot be determined. Such assets are therefore classified as
having an indefinite useful life. Development projects were capitalized at a total amount of €729 million as of the
end of 2014 (2013: €644 million).
Another intangible asset classified as having an indefinite useful life is the Bayer Cross, which was reacquired for
the North America region in 1994, having been awarded to the United States and Canada under the reparations
agreements at the end of the First World War. The period for which the Bayer Group will derive an economic benefit from this name cannot be determined as Bayer intends to make continuous use of it. The Bayer Cross is capitalized at €107 million.

In 2014, rental payments of €219 million (2013: €215 million) were made for assets leased under operating leases
as defined in ias 17 (Leases).
Lease payments of €2 million are expected to be received in 2015 from operating leases – as defined in ias 17
(Leases) – pertaining to property, plant and equipment. Lease payments totaling €7 million are expected to be
received in 2016–2019 and lease payments totaling €2 million after 2019.
INVESTMENT PROPERTY
The fair values of investment property are mainly determined using the income approach based on internal valuations for buildings and developed sites, and using the market comparison approach for undeveloped sites.
The total carrying amount of investment property as of December 31, 2014, was €175 million (December 31, 2013:
€173 million). The fair value of this property was €501 million (2013: €540 million). The rental income from investment property was €14 million (2013: €20 million), and the operating expenses directly allocable to this property
amounted to €9 million (2013: €12 million). A further amount of €2 million (2013: €4 million) in operating expenses
was directly allocable to investment property from which no rental income was derived.

In 2000 Bayer acquired the polyols business and parts of the propylene oxide (po) production operations of
Lyondell Chemicals with the objective of ensuring access to patented technologies and safeguarding the long-term
supply of po, a starting product for polyurethane. As part of this strategy, a company was established to produce
po (po jv, lp, United States, in which Bayer holds a 39.4% interest). Bayer benefits from fixed long-term supply
quotas / volumes of po from this company’s production. The two following tables contain summarized data from the
income statements and statements of financial position of the associate po jv, lp, United States, which is accounted
for using the equity method, and show the respective amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements
of the Bayer Group.

capital (Genussrechtskapital) with a nominal volume of €150 million (2013: €150 million), also provided to BayerPensionskasse.
The debt instruments reported as available-for-sale financial assets comprised German treasury bills in the amount
of €125 million (2013: €125 million). These treasury bills, which were lent to a bank, continue to be recognized
as available-for-sale financial assets because the related risks and rewards remain with Bayer. Upon maturity or
redemption of the treasury bills, Bayer is obligated to replace them with German government securities until 2016.

The equity instruments reported as available-for-sale financial assets included €29 million (2013: €22 million) in
instruments whose fair value could not be determined from a stock exchange or other market price or by discounting reliably determinable future cash flows. These equity instruments were recognized at cost.
In 2014, impairment loss reversals totaling €2 million (2013: impairment losses totaling €2 million) on available-forsale financial assets were recognized in profit or loss.
Unimpaired other financial assets of €8 million (2013: €8 million) were past due on the closing date.
Further information on the accounting for receivables from derivatives is given in note [30].
Receivables under lease agreements relate to finance leases where Bayer is the lessor and the economic owner
of the leased assets is the lessee. These receivables comprised expected lease payments of €46 million (2013:
€48 million), including €37 million (2013: €40 million) in interest. Of the expected lease payments, €1 million
(2013: €1 million) is due within one year, €2 million (2013: €4 million) within the following four years and
€43 million (2013: €43 million) in subsequent years.

special observation in view of the government debt crisis. Although there were no material defaults on such receivables in 2014 or 2013, it is possible that future developments in these countries could result in payment delays
and / or defaults. This could necessitate the recognition of impairment losses due to new occurrences. Trade accounts receivable from government health service institutions in the above countries at the end of 2014 totaled
€183 million (2013: €231 million).
An excess-of-loss policy exists for the HealthCare subgroup as part of a global credit insurance program. More than
80% of the receivables of the HealthCare subgroup are insured up to a maximum total annual compensation payment of €100 million (2013: €100 million).
A further €459 million (2013: €438 million) of receivables was secured by advance payments, letters of credit or
guarantees or by liens on land, buildings or harvest yields.

23. Other receivables
Other receivables, after impairment losses of €3 million (2013: €4 million), were comprised as follows:

The reimbursement claims of €127 million (2013: €321 million) consisted mainly of receivables from insurance
companies in connection with product liability claims.
The miscellaneous receivables include a €57 million receivable from Merck & Co., Inc., United States, arising from
the business that Merck & Co., Inc. continues to operate pending its final transfer to Bayer. The operating profit
earned during this transition period is transferred to Bayer.
Of the €678 million (2013: €526 million) in financial receivables included in other receivables, €675 million (2013:
€524 million) was unimpaired. Of this amount, €313 million (2013: €204 million) was past due or due immediately
on the closing date. The gross carrying amount of individually impaired other receivables was €6 million (2013:
€6 million). The impairment losses recognized on these assets totaled €3 million (2013: €4 million), resulting in a
net carrying amount of €3 million (2013: €2 million).

24. Equity
The foremost objectives of our financial management are to help bring about a sustained increase in the value of
the Bayer Group for the benefit of all stakeholders, and to ensure the Group’s creditworthiness and liquidity. The
pursuit of these goals means reducing our cost of capital, optimizing our capital structure, improving our financing
cash flow and effectively managing risk.
The rating agencies commissioned by Bayer assess the creditworthiness of the Bayer Group as follows:

Rating

[Table 4.55]

Long-term rating

Outlook

Short-term rating

Standard & Poor’s

A-

stable

A-2

Moody’s

A3

stable

P-2

These investment-grade ratings reflect the company’s good creditworthiness and ensure access to a broad investor
base for financing purposes. Bayer’s capital management strategy is based on the debt ratios published by the
rating agencies, which – by somewhat differing methods – look at the cash flow for a given period in relation to
debt. The financial strategy of the Bayer Group focuses on an “a” category rating and on preserving our financial
flexibility. Apart from utilizing cash inflows from our operating business to reduce net financial debt, we are implementing our financial strategy by way of vehicles such as the subordinated hybrid bonds issued in July 2005 and
July 2014, the authorized and conditional capital amounts created by resolutions of the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting, and a potential share buyback program. Bayer’s Articles of Incorporation do not stipulate capital ratios.
The changes in the various components of equity during 2013 and 2014 are shown in the consolidated statements
of changes in equity.
CAPITAL STOCK
The capital stock of Bayer AG on December 31, 2014 amounted to €2,117 million (2013: €2,117 million), divided
into 826,947,808 (2013: 826,947,808) registered shares, and was fully paid in. Each share confers one voting right.
AUTHORIZED CAPITAL
The Authorized Capital i amounting to €530 million was canceled because it would have expired on April 29, 2015,
prior to the planned date of the 2015 Annual Stockholders’ Meeting.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

A new Authorized Capital i in the same amount was approved by the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on April 29,
2014. It expires on April 28, 2019. It can be used to increase the capital stock by issuing new no-par registered
shares against cash contributions and / or contributions in kind, but capital increases against contributions in kind
may not exceed a total of €423 million (Authorized Capital i). Stockholders must normally be granted subscription
rights. However, the Board of Management is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude
stockholders’ subscription rights where the subscription ratio gives rise to fractions in the case of capital increases
against cash and / or contributions in kind, and also to the extent necessary to grant the holders of bonds with
warrants or conversion rights or obligations issued by the Company or its group companies a right to subscribe for
new shares to the extent to which they would be entitled after exercise of their warrants or conversion rights, or
performance of their exercise or conversion obligations. The Board of Management is also authorized, with the
consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude stockholders’ subscription rights if the shares are issued in connection with the admission of shares to a foreign stock exchange and the total interest in the capital stock attributable
to the new shares for which subscription rights are excluded does not exceed 10% of the existing capital stock on
the date of entry of the authorization in the commercial register or, in the event that this amount is lower, 10% of
the existing capital stock on the date of issuance of the new shares. The Board of Management is further authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude stockholders’ subscription rights if the capital is increased against contributions in kind to issue shares either for the purpose of acquiring companies, parts of companies, interests in companies, or other assets, or for the purpose of implementing a scrip dividend, where stockholders are given the option of contributing their dividend entitlements to the Company (either in whole or in part)
as a contribution in kind against the issuance of new shares out of the Authorized Capital i. The amount of capital
stock represented by shares issued against cash contributions and / or contributions in kind without granting subscription rights to the stockholders must not exceed a total of 20% of the capital stock that existed on the date the
authorized capital was approved by the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting.
The Authorized Capital ii amounting to €212 million was canceled because it would have expired on April 29, 2015,
prior to the planned date of the 2015 Annual Stockholders’ Meeting.
A new Authorized Capital ii in the same amount was approved by the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on April 29,
2014. It expires on April 28, 2019. The Board of Management is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory
Board, to increase the capital stock by up to a total of €212 million by issuing new no-par registered shares against
cash contributions (Authorized Capital ii). Stockholders must normally be granted subscription rights. However,
the Board of Management is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude stockholders’ subscription rights where the subscription ratio gives rise to fractions and also if the shares are issued against cash
contributions and the total interest in the capital stock attributable to the new shares for which subscription rights
are excluded does not exceed 10% of the existing capital stock on the date of entry of the authorization in the
commercial register or, in the event that this amount is lower, 10% of the existing capital stock on the date of
issuance of the new shares, and the issue price of the new shares is not significantly below the market price of the
already listed shares of the company of the same class at the time when the issue price is finalized by the Board of
Management within the meaning of Section 203, Paragraphs 1 and 2 in conjunction with Section 186 Paragraph 3
sentence 4 of the German Stock Corporation Act. Any own shares that are sold on or after April 29, 2014, while
excluding stockholders’ subscription rights pursuant to Section 71 Paragraph 1 No. 8 Sentence 5 in conjunction
with Section 186 Paragraph 3 Sentence 4 of the German Stock Corporation Act count toward the above 10% limit.
Shares that have been or may be issued to service bonds with warrants or conversion rights or obligations, where
such bonds are issued on or after April 29, 2014, while excluding stockholders' subscription rights in analogous
application of Section 186 Paragraph 3 Sentence 4 of the German Stock Corporation Act also count toward this
limit.
Neither of these authorized capital amounts has been utilized so far.

CONDITIONAL CAPITAL
The Conditional Capital 2010 created by the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on April 30, 2010, was canceled because it would have expired prior to the planned date of the 2015 Annual Stockholders’ Meeting.
The Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on April 29, 2014 approved the creation of Conditional Capital 2014, again
authorizing a conditional increase of up to €212 million in the capital stock through the issuance of up to
82,694,750 new no-par registered shares. The conditional capital increase serves to grant registered no-par value
shares to the holders of bonds with warrants or convertible bonds, profit participation certificates, or income bonds
(or combinations of these instruments) (collectively referred to as “debt instruments”), each with options or conversion rights or obligations, that may be issued up to April 28, 2019, on the basis of the authorization resolved by
the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on April 29, 2014, by Bayer AG or a group company of Bayer AG within the
meaning of Section 18 of the German Stock Corporation Act in which Bayer AG has a direct or indirect interest in
at least 90% of the votes and capital. Such new shares are to be issued at the option premium or conversion price
to be determined in accordance with the authorizing resolution referred to above. The authorization to issue such
instruments is limited to a total nominal amount of €6 billion. In principle, stockholders have a statutory right to be
granted subscription rights to such instruments. However, the Board of Management is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude stockholders’ subscription rights where the subscription ratio gives rise
to fractions and also to the extent necessary to grant the holders of bonds with warrants or conversion rights or
obligations a right to subscribe for new shares to the extent to which they would be entitled after exercise of their
warrants or conversion rights, or performance of their exercise or conversion obligations. Furthermore, the Board
of Management is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to fully exclude stockholders’ subscription rights to debt instruments with options or conversion rights or obligations issued against cash contributions if
the Board of Management, after due consideration, is of the opinion that the issue price of the debt instruments is
not significantly below their hypothetical fair value determined in accordance with accepted methods, and in particular, valuation techniques. This authorization to exclude subscription rights applies to bonds with warrants or
conversion rights or exercise or conversion obligations for shares with a proportionate interest in the capital stock
not exceeding 10% of the total capital stock either at the date when the resolution is adopted or, in the event that
this amount is lower, at the date on which this authorization is exercised. New shares that are issued on or after
April 29, 2014, while excluding stockholders’ subscription rights in accordance with Sections 203 Paragraph 1 and
2 in conjunction with Section 186 Paragraph 3 Sentence 4 of the German Stock Corporation Act as well as own
shares that are sold on or after April 29, 2014, while excluding stockholders’ subscription rights pursuant to Section 71 Paragraph 1 Number 8 Sentence 5 in conjunction with Section 186 Paragraph 3 Sentence 4 of the German
Stock Corporation Act also count toward this 10% limit.
Absent a further resolution of the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on the exclusion of stockholders’ subscription
rights, the Board of Management will only use the existing authorizations to increase the capital stock out of the
Authorized Capital or the Conditional Capital – while excluding stockholders’ subscription rights – up to a total
amount of 20% of the capital stock that existed when the respective resolutions were adopted by the Annual
Stockholders’ Meeting on April 29, 2014. All issuances or sales of shares or of bonds with warrants or conversion
rights or obligations that are effected while excluding stockholders’ subscription rights also count toward this 20%
limit.
ACCUMULATED COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
Accumulated comprehensive income comprises retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income.
The retained earnings include prior years’ undistributed income of consolidated companies and all remeasurements of the net liability for defined benefit pension and other post-employment benefit plans that are recognized
outside profit or loss. The accumulated other comprehensive income comprises exchange differences, the changes
in fair values of cash flow hedges and available-for-sale financial assets, and the revaluation surplus. The latter
results from the acquisition in 2005 of the remaining 50% interest in an otc joint venture with Roche in the United
States that was established in 1996 and the acquisition in 2008 of the remaining 50% interest in Bayer MaterialScience Oldenburg GmbH & co. KG, Oldenburg, Germany. In 2014, an amount of €5 million (2013: €5 million)
corresponding to the annual amortization / depreciation of the respective assets was transferred from the revaluation surplus to retained earnings. The exchange differences included an amount of minus €28 million (2013: €12
million) attributable to associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method.

DIVIDEND
Under the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the dividend payment is determined by the distributable profit
reported in the annual financial statements of Bayer AG, which are prepared according to the German Commercial
Code. Retained earnings were diminished by payment of the dividend of €2.10 per share for 2013. The proposed
dividend for the 2014 fiscal year is €2.25 per share, which would result in a total dividend payment of €1,861 million. Payment of the proposed dividend is contingent upon approval by the stockholders at the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting and therefore is not recognized as a liability in the consolidated financial statements.
NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST
The changes in the non-controlling interest in Group equity during 2013 and 2014 are shown in the following table:

The pension obligations pertained mainly to Germany (73%; 2013: 72%), the United States (14%; 2013: 14%)
and the United Kingdom (6%; 2013: 7%). In Germany, current employees accounted for about 45% (2013: 39%),
retirees or their surviving dependents for about 47% (2013: 54%) and former employees with vested pension
rights for about 8% (2013: 7%) of entitlements under defined benefit plans. In the United States, current employees accounted for about 26% (2013: 28%), retirees or their surviving dependents for about 61% (2013: 60%) and
former employees with vested pension rights for about 13% (2013: 12%) of entitlements under defined benefit
plans.
In Brazil, employees were given the option of switching from a defined benefit plan to a defined contribution plan.
This offer was accepted by around 34% of the employees. This resulted in a plan settlement loss of €21 million and
a plan curtailment gain of €11 million. The defined benefit obligation was reduced by a total of €55 million and plan
assets by €65 million.
The actual return on the assets of defined benefit plans for pensions or other post-employment benefits amounted
to €1,691 million (2013: €414 million) and €51 million (2013: €66 million), respectively.
The following table shows the defined benefit obligations for pensions and other post-employment benefits along

PENSION AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
Group companies provide retirement benefits for most of their employees, either directly or by contributing to
privately or publicly administered funds. The way these benefits are provided varies according to the legal, fiscal
and economic conditions of each country, the benefits generally being based on employee compensation and years
of service. The obligations relate both to existing retirees’ pensions and to pension entitlements of future retirees.
The Bayer Group has set up funded pension plans for its employees in various countries. The most appropriate
investment strategy is determined for each defined benefit pension plan based on the risk structure of the obligations (especially demographics, the current funded status, the structure of the expected future cash flows, interest
sensitivity, biometric risks etc.), the regulatory environment and the existing level of risk tolerance or risk capacity.
A strategic target investment portfolio is then developed in line with the plan’s risk structure, taking capital market
factors into consideration. Further determinants are risk diversification, portfolio efficiency and the need for both a
country-specific and a global risk / return profile centered on ensuring the payment of all future benefits. As the
capital investment strategy for each pension plan is developed individually in light of the plan-specific conditions
listed above, the investment strategies for different pension plans may vary considerably. For example, the proportion of plan assets invested in equities is greater with the non-German pension plans than with the plans domiciled
in Germany. The investment strategies are generally aligned less toward maximizing absolute returns and more
toward the reasonable assurance of financing pension commitments over the long term. For plan assets, stress
scenarios are simulated and other risk analyses (such as value at risk) undertaken with the aid of risk management
systems.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

Bayer-Pensionskasse VVaG (Bayer-Pensionskasse), Leverkusen, Germany, is by far the most significant of the pension plans. It was closed to new members effective January 1, 2005. This legally independent fund is regarded as a
life insurance company and is therefore subject to the German Insurance Supervision Act. The benefit obligations
covered by Bayer-Pensionskasse comprise retirement, surviving dependents’ and disability pensions. It constitutes
a multi-employer plan, to which the active members and their employers contribute. The company contribution is a
certain percentage of the employee contribution. This percentage is the same for all participating employers, including those outside the Bayer Group, and is set by agreement between the plan’s executive committee and supervisory board, acting on a proposal from the responsible actuary. It takes into account the differences between
the actuarial estimates and the actual values for the factors used to determine liabilities and contributions. Bayer
may also adjust the company contribution in agreement with the plan’s executive committee and supervisory
board, acting on a proposal from the responsible actuary. The plan’s liability is governed by Section 1, Paragraph 1,
Sentence 3 of the German Law on the Improvement of Occupational Pensions. This means that if the pension plan
exercises its right under the articles of association to reduce benefits, each participating employer has to make up
the resulting difference. Bayer is not liable for the obligations of participating employers outside the Bayer Group,
even if they cease to participate in the plan.
Pension entitlements for people who joined Bayer in Germany on or after January 1, 2005 are granted via
Rheinische Pensionskasse VVaG, Leverkusen. Future pension payments from this plan are based on contributions
and the return on plan assets; a guaranteed interest rate applies.
Another important pension provision vehicle is Bayer Pension Trust e.V. (bpt). This covers further retirement provision arrangements of the Bayer Group, deferred compensation, pension obligations previously administered by
Schering Altersversorgung Treuhand e.V., and components of other direct commitments.
The defined benefit pension plans in the United States have been frozen for some years, and no significant new
entitlements can be earned under these plans. The assets of all the u.s. pension plans are held by a master trust for
reasons of efficiency. The applicable regulatory framework is based on the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act (erisa), which includes a statutory 80% minimum funding requirement to avoid benefit restrictions. The actuarial risks, such as investment risk, interest-rate risk and longevity risk, remain with the company.
The defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom are closed to new members. Plan assets in the u.k. are
administered by independent trustees, who are legally obligated to act solely in the interests of the beneficiaries.
A technical assessment is performed every three years in line with u.k. regulations. This serves as the basis for
developing a plan to cover any potential financing requirements. Here, too, the actuarial risks remain with the
company.
The other post-employment benefit obligations outside Germany mainly related to retirees’ health care benefit
payments in the United States.

The fair value of plan assets in Germany included real estate leased by Group companies, recognized at a fair value
of €65 million (2013: €67 million), and Bayer AG shares and bonds held through investment funds, recognized at
their fair value of €58 million (2013: €49 million) and €6 million (2013: €0 million), respectively. The other plan
assets comprise mortgage loans granted, other receivables and qualified insurance policies.
RISKS
The risks from defined benefit plans arise partly from the defined benefit obligations and partly from the investment in plan assets. The risks lie in the possibility that higher direct pension payments will have to be made to the
beneficiaries and/or that additional contributions will have to be made to plan assets in order to meet current and
future pension obligations.
Demographic / biometric risks
Since a large proportion of the defined benefit obligations comprises lifelong pensions or surviving dependents’
pensions, longer claim periods or earlier claims may result in higher benefit obligations, higher benefit expense
and / or higher pension payments than previously anticipated.

» TABLE OF CONTENTS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Bayer Annual Report 2014
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

Investment risks
If the actual return on plan assets were below the return anticipated on the basis of the discount rate, the net defined benefit liability would increase, assuming there were no changes in other parameters. This could happen as a
result of a drop in share prices, increases in market rates of interest, default of individual debtors or the purchase
of low-risk but low-interest bonds, for example.
Interest-rate risk
A decline in capital market interest rates, especially for high-quality corporate bonds, would increase the defined
benefit obligation. This effect would be at least partially offset by the ensuing increase in the market values of the
debt instruments held.
MEASUREMENT PARAMETERS AND THEIR SENSITIVITIES
The following weighted parameters were used to measure the pension obligations as of December 31 and the
expense for pensions and other post-employment benefits in the respective year:

The parameter sensitivities were computed by expert actuaries based on a detailed evaluation similar to that performed to obtain the data presented in Table 4.59. Altering individual parameters by 0.5 percentage points (mortality by 10 percent per beneficiary) while leaving the other parameters unchanged would have impacted pension and
other post-employment benefit obligations as of year end 2014 as follows:

Provisions are also set up for the obligations, mainly of u.s. subsidiaries, to provide post-employment benefits in
the form of health care cost payments to retirees. The valuation of health care costs was based on the assumption
that they will increase at a rate of 7.0% (assumption in 2013: 7.5%), which should gradually decline to 5.0%
(2013: 5.0%) by 2018. The following table shows the impact on other post-employment benefit obligations and

The provisions were partly offset by claims for refunds in the amount of €124 million (2013: €318 million), which
were recognized as receivables. These claims related principally to product liability and environmental protection
measures.

26.1 Taxes
Provisions for taxes comprised provisions for income taxes amounting to €805 million (2013: €1,079 million) and
provisions for other types of taxes amounting to €65 million (2013: €69 million).
Further income tax commitments according to ias 12 (Income Taxes) existed at year end in the amount of
€63 million (2013: €101 million), recognized in the statement of financial position as income tax liabilities.

26.2 Environmental protection
Provisions for environmental protection mainly related to the rehabilitation of contaminated land, recultivation of
landfills, and redevelopment and water protection measures.

26.3 Restructuring
Provisions for restructuring included €126 million (2013: €189 million) for severance payments and €47 million
(2013: €53 million) for other restructuring expenses, which mainly comprised other costs related to the closure of
production facilities.
A major focus in HealthCare was on continuing the restructuring begun in the Medical Care Division (Consumer
Health reporting segment) in 2013, utilizing the provisions established for this purpose. Provisions were also established for the integration of newly acquired businesses. Provisions for the above and other restructuring measures
at HealthCare as of December 31, 2014, amounted to €71 million. Of this amount, severance payments accounted
for €62 million and other restructuring expenses for €9 million.
In CropScience, the restructuring initiated in the United States in 2011, involving the closure of several carbamate
production facilities and a formulation plant, continued in 2014, utilizing the provisions established for this purpose. Provisions for the above and other restructuring measures at CropScience as of December 31, 2014, amounted to €70 million, comprising €35 million for severance payments and €35 million for other restructuring expenses.

» TABLE OF CONTENTS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Bayer Annual Report 2014
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

Provisions for restructuring measures in MaterialScience pertained largely to the global consolidation of production facilities in the Polycarbonates unit, including the closure of the site in Darmstadt, Germany. Provisions for
restructuring at MaterialScience as of December 31, 2014, amounted to €18 million, comprising €17 million for
severance payments and €1 million for other restructuring expenses.
In addition, restructuring measures focusing on the introduction of country platforms, along with further efficiency
improvements, were carried out throughout the Group so as to more effectively pool central functions. The restructuring provisions associated with these measures as of December 31, 2014, amounted to €14 million, comprising
€12 million for severance payments and €2 million for other restructuring expenses.

26.4 Trade-related commitments
Provisions for trade-related commitments comprised provisions for rebates, discounts and other price adjustments,
product returns, outstanding invoices, pending losses and onerous contracts.

26.5 Litigations
The legal risks currently considered to be material, and their development, are described in note [32].

26.6 Personnel commitments
Provisions for personnel commitments mainly include those for variable one-time payments under short-term incentive programs, credit balances on long-term accounts, service awards, early retirements, pre-retirement parttime working arrangements and other personnel costs. Also reflected here are the obligations under the stockbased compensation programs. Provisions for severance payments resulting from restructuring are reflected in
provisions for restructuring.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS
The Bayer Group offers stock-based compensation programs collectively to different groups of employees. As required by ifrs 2 (Share-based Payment) for compensation systems involving cash settlement, awards to be made
under the stock-based programs are covered by provisions in the amount of the fair value of the obligations existing as of the date of the financial statements vis-à-vis the respective employee group. All resulting valuation adjustments are recognized in profit or loss.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT AND OTHER
SENIOR EXECUTIVES (ASPIRE I)
Since 2005, members of the Board of Management and other senior executives have been entitled to participate in
Aspire i on the condition that they purchase a certain number of Bayer shares – determined for each individual
according to specific guidelines – and retain them for the full term of the program. A percentage of the executive’s
annual base salary – based on his / her position – is defined as a target for variable payments (Aspire target opportunity). Depending on the performance of Bayer stock, both in absolute terms and relative to the euro stoxx 50
benchmark index during a four-year performance period, participants are granted an award of up to 300% of their
individual Aspire target opportunity. The four-year tranche issued in 2010 expired at the end of 2013, and payment
of the maximum resulting amount (300%) was made at the beginning of 2014.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR MIDDLE MANAGEMENT (ASPIRE II)
Also since 2005, other senior managers and middle managers have been offered Aspire ii, which is similar to
Aspire I but does not require a personal investment in Bayer shares. This program was extended to further managerial employees in 2012. The amount of the award is based entirely on the absolute performance of Bayer stock
over a four-year period. The maximum award is 250% of each manager’s Aspire target opportunity. The four-year
tranche issued in 2010 expired at the end of 2013, and payment of the maximum resulting amount (250%) was
made at the beginning of 2014.
BAYSHARE 2014
All management levels and non-managerial employees are offered an annual stock participation program known as
BayShare, under which Bayer subsidizes their personal investments in the company’s stock. The discount under
this program is set separately each year. In 2014 it was 20% (2013: 20%) of the subscription amount. Employees
stated a fixed amount that they wished to invest in shares. The maximum subscription amount in Germany was set
at €2,500 (2013: €2,500) or €5,000 (2013: €5,000), depending on the employee’s position. The shares thus acquired
must be retained until December 31 of the year following the year of purchase, irrespective of continued employment with the Bayer Group.
In 2014, employees purchased a total of about 225,000 shares (2013: 242,600 shares) under the BayShare program.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS 2004
The stock-based compensation programs offered to the different employee groups in 2004 had similar basic structures. Changes in the obligations under these programs are reflected in the financial statements at fair value
through profit or loss. Entitlements to awards under these programs are conditioned on retention of the Bayer
shares for a certain time period. The tranches issued in 2004 expired in 2014.
STOCK INCENTIVE PROGRAM
A Stock Incentive Program was offered to middle management until 2004. Participants receive a cash payment
equivalent to a defined number of Bayer shares on certain dates during the ten-year duration of the program. For
every ten shares held in a special account (personal investment), they receive two shares after two years, and a
further four shares after six and ten years, respectively. To qualify for these payments, they must still hold the personal investment on the incentive payment dates and the percentage rise in the price of Bayer stock by the payment date must be above the performance of the euro stoxx 50 since the start of the program. Participants may
sell their shares during the term of the program. However, the shares sold do not qualify for incentive payments on
subsequent distribution dates. The number of shares that each employee could transfer to the program was equivalent to half of his or her performance-related bonus for the preceding fiscal year.
STOCK PARTICIPATION PROGRAM
The structure of this program, which was offered to the other employee groups until 2004, is similar to the Stock
Incentive Program. However, the incentive payments are based exclusively on the period for which employees hold
their personal investment in Bayer shares. Incentive payments are half those allocated under the Stock Incentive
Program. For every ten shares held, participants receive the equivalent of one share after two years and the equivalent of a further two shares after six and ten years, respectively.

26.7 Miscellaneous
Miscellaneous provisions included those for other liabilities, contingent liabilities from business combinations,
asset retirement obligations (other than those included in provisions for environmental protection) and guarantees.

Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

In January 2014, Bayer AG issued three tranches of emtn bonds with a total nominal volume of €2 billion. One of
these tranches had a nominal volume of €500 million, and the other two had a nominal volume of €750 million
each. In March 2014, Bayer Nordic se issued an emtn bond with a nominal volume of €500 million. In November
2014, Bayer Capital Corporation b.v. issued an emtn bond with a nominal volume of €500 million. In September
2014, it redeemed at maturity the emtn bond with a nominal volume of €1.3 billion issued in March 2009.
In April 2013, Bayer Nordic se issued an emtn bond with a nominal volume of €200 million. In May 2013, Bayer AG
redeemed at maturity the emtn bond with a nominal volume of €1,000 million issued in May 2006. In May 2013,
Bayer Holding Ltd. issued an emtn bond with a nominal volume of jpy 10 billion. In July 2013, Bayer Holding Ltd.
redeemed at maturity the emtn bond with a nominal volume of jpy 10 billion issued in June 2008.
OTHER BONDS
In October 2014, Bayer u.s. Finance llc issued six tranches of bonds in 144a / Reg S format with a total volume of
us$7,000 million. The six tranches had nominal volumes of us$500 million, us$400 million, us$850 million,
us$2,000 million, us$1,500 million and us$1,750 million.
SUBORDINATED BONDS
In July 2014, Bayer AG issued two subordinated hybrid bonds with a total nominal volume of €3,250 million. The
first tranche of €1,750 million has a maturity of 61 years and a coupon of 3.0 percent. Bayer has an early redemption option at par for the first time in 2020. The second tranche of €1,500 million has a maturity of 60 years and a
coupon of 3.75 percent. On this tranche, Bayer has an early redemption option at par for the first time in 2024.
From 2020 and 2024 respectively the coupons will be reset every five years based on the five-year swap rate.
Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s treat 50% of these bonds as equity. They therefore have a more limited effect on
the Group’s rating-relevant debt indicators than conventional borrowings.
In July 2005, Bayer AG issued a 100-year subordinated hybrid bond with a nominal volume of €1,300 million. This
issue matures in 2105 and has a fixed coupon of 5.0% in the first 10 years. Thereafter, interest is calculated quarterly at a floating rate. After the first 10 years, Bayer AG has a quarterly option to redeem the bond at face value. In
note [30.2] the 100-year hybrid bond is reflected at the earliest possible repayment date in 2015. It is treated as
75% equity by Moody’s and as 50% equity by Standard & Poor’s.
Bayer AG guarantees all the bonds issued by subsidiaries.
LEASING LIABILITIES
Lease payments totaling €603 million (2013: €538 million), including €162 million (2013: €156 million) in interest,

30. Financial instruments
The system used by the Bayer Group to manage credit risks, liquidity risks and the various types of market risks
(interest-rate, currency and other price risks), together with its objectives, methods and procedures, is outlined in
the Risk Report, which forms part of the Combined Management Report.

30.1 Financial instruments by category
The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and liabilities by category of
financial instrument and a reconciliation to the corresponding line item in the statements of financial position.
Since the line items “Other receivables,” “Trade accounts payable” and “Other liabilities” contain both financial
instruments and non-financial assets or liabilities (such as other tax receivables or advance payments for services
to be received in the future), the reconciliation is shown in the column headed “Non-financial assets / liabilities.”

Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

The loans and receivables reflected in other financial assets and the liabilities measured at amortized cost also
include receivables and liabilities under finance leases in which Bayer is the lessor or lessee and which are therefore measured in accordance with ias 17.
Because of the short maturities of most trade accounts receivable and payable, other receivables and liabilities, and
cash and cash equivalents, their carrying amounts at the closing date did not significantly differ from the fair values.
The fair value stated for noncurrent receivables, loans, held-to-maturity financial investments and non-derivative
financial liabilities is the present value of the respective future cash flows. This was determined by discounting the
cash flows at a closing-date interest rate that takes into account the term of the assets or liabilities and the creditworthiness of the counterparty. Where a market price was available, however, this was deemed to be the fair value.
The fair values of available-for-sale financial assets correspond to quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets (Level 1).
The fair values of derivatives for which no publicly quoted prices existed in active markets (Level 1) were determined using valuation techniques based on observable market data as of the end of the reporting period (Level 2).
In applying valuation techniques, credit value adjustments were determined to allow for the contracting party’s
credit risk.
The respective currency and commodity forward contracts were measured individually at their forward rates or
forward prices on the closing date. These depend on spot rates or prices including time spreads. The fair values of
interest-rate hedging instruments and cross-currency interest-rate swaps were determined by discounting future
cash flows over the remaining terms of the instruments at market rates of interest, taking into account any foreign
currency translation as of the closing date.
Fair values measured using unobservable inputs are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. This
applies in some cases to the fair values of embedded derivatives or to obligations for contingent consideration in
business combinations.
Embedded derivatives were separated from their respective host contracts. Such host contracts are generally sales
or purchase agreements relating to the operational business. The embedded derivatives cause the cash flows from
the contracts to vary with fluctuations in exchange rates, commodity prices or other prices, for example. The internal measurement of embedded derivatives is mainly performed using the discounted cash flow method, which is
based on unobservable inputs (Level 3). These included planned sales and purchase volumes, and prices derived
from market data. Regular monitoring is carried out based on these fair values as part of quarterly reporting.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

The interest expense of €563 million (2013: €559 million) from non-derivative financial liabilities also included the
income and expense from interest-rate swaps that qualified for hedge accounting. Interest income from financial
assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss amounted to €67 million (2013: €80 million). Interest income from interest-rate derivatives that qualified for hedge accounting was €122 million (2013: €151 million). The
changes in fair values of financial assets held for trading related mainly to forward commodity contracts and embedded derivatives.
The changes in the net amount of financial assets and liabilities recognized at fair value based on unobservable
inputs (Level 3) were as follows:

Derivatives that constitute financial assets and form part of a master netting arrangement but do not satisfy, or only
partially satisfy, the offsetting criteria and are only enforceable in the event of breach of contract by, or insolvency
of, one of the contracting parties amounted to €360 million (2013: €685 million); the related financial liabilities
(derivatives) were €242 million (2013: €140 million). Derivatives classified as financial liabilities and forming part of
a master netting arrangement amounted to €773 million (2013: €299 million); the related financial assets (derivatives) were €242 million (2013: €140 million).

30.2 Maturity analysis
The liquidity risks to which the Bayer Group was exposed from its financial instruments at the end of the reporting
period comprised obligations for future interest and repayment installments on financial liabilities and the liquidity
risk arising from derivatives, as shown in the table in note [30.3].
There was also a liquidity risk from an as yet unpaid €1,005 million (2013: €1,005 million) portion of the effective
initial fund of Bayer-Pensionskasse VVaG, which may result in further payments by Bayer AG in subsequent years.
This amount was reported under loan commitments.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

30.3 Information on derivatives
Asset and liability fair values and future cash flows are exposed to currency, interest-rate and commodity price
risks. Derivatives are used to reduce this risk. In some cases they are designated as hedging instruments in a
hedge accounting relationship.
CURRENCY RISKS
Foreign currency receivables and liabilities are hedged using foreign exchange derivatives without the existence of
a hedge accounting relationship. A bond of Bayer AG denominated in British pounds was swapped on the issuance
date into a fixed-rate euro bond by means of a cross-currency interest-rate swap, which was designated as a cash
flow hedge. Certain forward exchange contracts and cross-currency interest-rate swaps used to hedge intra-Group
loans are also designated as cash flow hedges.
Fluctuations in future cash flows resulting from forecasted foreign currency transactions and procurement activities
are avoided partly through derivatives contracts, most of which are designated as cash flow hedges.
INTEREST-RATE RISKS
The interest-rate risks from fixed-interest borrowings are managed in part using interest-rate swaps. The principal
borrowings concerned are the us$200 million bond issued in 1995, the €1.3 billion bond issued in 2005, and a
portion of the €750 million bond issued in 2014 and maturing in 2021. Hedge accounting is applied to the respective borrowings and hedging instruments (fair-value hedge).
Losses of €47 million (2013: €65 million) were recorded on fair-value hedging instruments in 2014. Gains of
€47 million (2013: €65 million) were recorded on the underlying hedged items.
COMMODITY PRICE RISKS
Hedging contracts are also used to partly reduce exposure to fluctuations in future cash outflows resulting from
price changes on procurement markets.
HEDGING OF OBLIGATIONS UNDER STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS
A portion of the obligations to make variable payments to employees under stock-based compensation programs
(Aspire) is hedged against fluctuations in the share price using derivatives contracts that are designated as cash
flow hedges.
FURTHER INFORMATION ON CASH FLOW HEDGES
Accumulated other comprehensive income from cash flow hedges in 2014 decreased by €102 million (2013: increased by €157 million) due to changes in the fair values of derivatives net of tax. Gains of €46 million (2013:
€156 million) from fair-value changes – originally recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income – of
derivatives designated as cash flow hedges were reclassified to profit or loss. The respective pro-rated deferred tax
expense of €13 million (2013: €46 million) was likewise reclassified to profit or loss.
No material ineffective portions of hedges required recognition in profit or loss in 2014 or 2013.
The income and expense from cash flow hedges recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income mainly
comprised gains of €115 million (2013: €186 million) and losses of €156 million (2013: €15 million) from the hedging of forecasted transactions in foreign currencies. Of these gains and losses, gains of €81 million (2013:
€135 million) and losses of €152 million (2013: €15 million) will be reclassifiable to profit or loss within one year
and gains of €34 million (2013: €51 million) and losses of €4 million (2013: €0 million) in subsequent years.

The guarantees mainly comprise a declaration issued by Bayer AG to the trustees of the u.k. pension plans guaranteeing the pension obligations of Bayer Public Limited Company and Bayer CropScience Limited. Under the declaration, Bayer AG – in addition to the two companies – undertakes to make further payments into the plans upon
receipt of a payment request from the trustees. The net liability with respect to these defined benefit plans as of
December 31, 2014, amounted to €144 million (2013: €100 million).
The potential payment claims related to the partial exemption from the surcharge levied under the German Renewable Energy Act that were included in other contingent liabilities in 2013 no longer exist following the conclusion
of the e.u. state-aid proceedings in 2014 (2013: €172 million).

Financial commitments resulting from orders already placed under purchase agreements related to planned or
ongoing capital expenditure projects totaled €476 million (2013: €365 million).
The unpaid capital provided to Bayer-Pensionskasse VVaG for its effective initial fund amounted to €1,005 million
(2013: €1,005 million).
The Bayer Group has entered into cooperation agreements with third parties under which it has agreed to fund
various research and development projects or has assumed other payment obligations based on the achievement of
certain milestones or other specific conditions. If all of these payments have to be made, their maturity distribution
as of December 31, 2014 was expected to be as set forth in the following table. The amounts shown represent the
maximum payments to be made, and it is unlikely that they will all fall due. Since the achievement of the conditions
for payment is highly uncertain, both the amounts and the dates of the actual payments may vary considerably
from those stated in the table.

In addition to the above commitments, there were also revenue-based milestone payment commitments totaling
€2,169 million (2013: €2,191 million), of which €2,157 million (2013: €2,090 million) were not expected to fall due
until 2020 (2013: 2019) or later. These commitments are also highly uncertain.
Should the achievement of the milestones or specific conditions become sufficiently probable, a provision or
other liability is recognized in the statement of financial position, and this may also lead to the recognition of an
intangible asset in the same amount. The above table includes neither current revenue-based royalty payments
nor future payments that are probable and therefore already reflected in the statement of financial position.

32. Legal risks
As a global company with a diverse business portfolio, the Bayer Group is exposed to numerous legal risks, particularly in the areas of product liability, competition and antitrust law, patent disputes, tax assessments and environmental matters. The outcome of any current or future proceedings cannot normally be predicted. It is therefore
possible that legal or regulatory judgments or future settlements could give rise to expenses that are not covered,
or not fully covered, by insurers’ compensation payments and could significantly affect our revenues and earnings.
Legal proceedings currently considered to involve material risks are outlined below. The legal proceedings referred
to do not represent an exhaustive list.

HealthCare:
PRODUCT-RELATED LITIGATION
Yasmin™ / yaz™: As of January 31, 2015, the number of claimants in the pending lawsuits and claims in the
United States totaled about 5,000 (excluding claims already settled). Claimants allege that they have suffered personal injuries, some of them fatal, from the use of Bayer’s drospirenone-containing oral contraceptive products
such as Yasmin™ and / or yaz™ or from the use of Ocella™ and / or Gianvi™, generic versions of Yasmin™ and yaz™,
respectively, marketed by Barr Laboratories, Inc. in the United States. Claimants seek compensatory and punitive
damages, claiming, in particular, that Bayer knew, or should have known, of the alleged risks and should be held
liable for having failed to disclose them or adequately warn users. All cases pending in u.s. federal courts have
been consolidated in a multidistrict litigation proceeding for common pre-trial management.
A few State Attorney Generals in the u.s. are investigating the alleged off-label promotion of Yasmin™ and yaz™ as
well as the alleged failure to warn about an alleged increased risk of developing blood clots in violation of consumer protection statutes. One Attorney General has filed an action against Bayer.
As of January 31, 2015, 13 class actions had been served upon Bayer in Canada and two in Israel.
As of January 31, 2015, Bayer had reached agreements, without admission of liability, to settle approximately 9,500
claims in the u.s. for venous clot injuries (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) for a total amount of
about us$1.9 billion. Bayer will continue to consider the option of settling such claims after a case-specific analysis
of medical records. At present, about 2,000 such claims are under review.
Bayer has also settled, without admission of liability, approximately 7,200 claims for gallbladder injuries in the u.s.
for a total amount of about us$21.5 million. As of January 31, 2015, only a few claims for such injuries remained
pending.
Additional lawsuits are anticipated. Bayer believes that it has meritorious defenses and will continue to defend
itself vigorously against all claims that are not considered for settlement. Bayer has taken appropriate accounting
measures for anticipated defense costs and for agreed and anticipated future settlements based on the information
currently available and based on the number of pending and estimated future claims alleging venous clot injuries.
Mirena™: As of January 31, 2015, lawsuits of approximately 3,000 users of Mirena™, a levonorgestrel-releasing
intrauterine system providing long-term contraception, had been served upon Bayer in the u.s. Most of the cases
pending in u.s. federal courts have been consolidated in a multidistrict litigation proceeding for common pre-trial
management. Additional lawsuits are anticipated. Plaintiffs allege personal injuries resulting from the use of Mirena™, including perforation of the uterus, ectopic pregnancy, or idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and seek compensatory and punitive damages. Plaintiffs claim, inter alia, that Mirena™ is defective and that Bayer knew or
should have known of the risks associated with it and failed to adequately warn its users. As of January 31, 2015,
four class actions relating to Mirena™ had been served upon Bayer in Canada. Bayer believes it has meritorious
defenses and intends to defend itself vigorously. Based on the information currently available, Bayer has taken
appropriate accounting measures for anticipated defense costs.

» TABLE OF CONTENTS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Bayer Annual Report 2014
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

Xarelto™: As of January 31, 2015, lawsuits of approximately 200 recipients of Xarelto™, an oral anticoagulant for
the treatment and prevention of blood clots, had been served upon Bayer in the u.s. Plaintiffs allege personal injuries from the use of Xarelto™, including cerebral, gastrointestinal or other bleeding and death, and seek compensatory and punitive damages. They claim, amongst other things, that Xarelto™ is defective and that Bayer knew or
should have known of the risks associated with the use of Xarelto™ and failed to adequately warn its users. Additional lawsuits are anticipated. Cases pending in u.s. federal courts have been consolidated in a multidistrict litigation for common pre-trial management. As of February 8, 2015, one class action relating to Xarelto™ was filed in
Canada. Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself vigorously. Based on the information currently available, Bayer has taken appropriate accounting measures for anticipated defense costs.
In connection with the above proceedings concerning Yasmin™ / yaz™, Mirena™ and Xarelto™, Bayer is insured
against product liability risks to the extent customary in the industry. However, the accounting measures taken with
regard to the Yasmin ™ / yaz™ claims exceed the available insurance coverage.
COMPETITION LAW PROCEEDINGS
Phillips’ Colon Health / Department of Justice: In September 2014, the United States Department of Justice,
representing the United States Federal Trade Commission, filed a motion in New Jersey federal court alleging that
Bayer is making unsubstantiated claims about Phillips’ Colon Health, a probiotic product, and thereby violating a
2007 consent decree requiring it to have competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate claims made
about its dietary supplements. The suit seeks relief in the form of monetary damages and an order mandating
Bayer to cease from making unsubstantiated claims. In December 2014, the parties attended a court-ordered mediation, which did not resolve the matter. Discovery continues. Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself vigorously.
PATENT DISPUTES
Beyaz™ / Safyral™: In 2013, Bayer received two notices from Watson Laboratories, Inc. that Watson has filed
Abbreviated New Drug Applications with a Paragraph iv certification (“anda iv”) seeking approval of generic versions of both Beyaz™ and Safyral™, Bayer’s oral contraceptives containing folate, in the United States. In response,
Bayer filed two suits against Watson in u.s. federal court for infringement of the same patent. The lawsuits were
consolidated.
Betaferon™ / Betaseron™: In 2010, Bayer filed a complaint against Biogen Idec ma Inc. in u.s. federal court seeking a declaration by the court that a patent issued to Biogen in 2009 is invalid and not infringed by Bayer’s production and distribution of Betaseron™, Bayer’s drug product for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Biogen is alleging
patent infringement by Bayer through Bayer’s production and distribution of Betaseron™ and Extavia™ and has
sued Bayer accordingly. Bayer manufactures Betaseron™ and distributes the product in the United States. Extavia™
is also a drug product for the treatment of multiple sclerosis; it is manufactured by Bayer, but distributed in the
United States by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, another defendant in the lawsuit.
Finacea™: In 2013, Bayer filed a patent infringement suit in a u.s. federal court against Glenmark Generics Ltd.
Earlier that year, Bayer had received a notice from Glenmark that Glenmark had filed an anda iv seeking approval
of a generic version of Bayer’s Finacea™ topical gel in the United States.

Damoctocog alfa pegol (bay 94-9027, long-acting rFVIII): In 2013, Bayer filed a lawsuit against Nektar Therapeutics in the district court of Munich, Germany. In this proceeding, Bayer claims rights to certain European patent
applications based on a past collaboration between Bayer and Nektar in the field of hemophilia. The European
patent applications with the title “Polymer-factor viii moiety conjugates” are part of a patent family registered in
the name of Nektar comprising further patent applications and patents in other countries including the United
States. However, Bayer believes that the patent family does not include any valid patent claim relevant for Bayer’s
drug candidate bay 94-9027 for the treatment of hemophilia a.
Nexavar™: In January 2015, Bayer filed a patent infringement suit in a u.s. federal court against Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Mylan Inc. (together “Mylan”). In December 2014, Bayer had received notice of an anda iv pursuant to which Mylan seeks approval of a generic version of the cancer drug Nexavar™ in the United States.
Staxyn™: In 2012, Bayer filed a patent infringement suit in a u.s. federal court against Watson Laboratories, Inc. In
2013, Bayer filed a similar suit against Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. and Par Pharmaceutical Companies, Inc. (together
“Par Pharmaceutical”). Earlier in 2012, Bayer had received notice of an anda iv pursuant to which Watson seeks
approval to market a generic version of Bayer’s erectile dysfunction treatment Staxyn™ prior to patent expiration in
the United States. Earlier in 2013, Bayer had received a similar notice from Par Pharmaceutical. In 2014, Par
Pharmaceutical amended its anda iv to no longer seek market approval prior to patent expiration whereupon the
suit against Par Pharmaceutical was dismissed without prejudice. Staxyn™ is an orodispersible (orally disintegrating) formulation of Levitra™. Both drug products contain the same active ingredient, which is protected in the u.s.
by two patents expiring in 2018.
Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses in the above patent disputes and intends to defend itself vigorously.
FURTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Trasylol™ / Avelox™: A qui tam complaint relating to marketing practices for Trasylol™ (aprotinin) and Avelox™
(moxifloxacin) filed by a former Bayer employee is pending in the United States District Court in New Jersey. The
u.s. government has declined to intervene at the present time.
Bayer Pharma AG former shareholder litigation: In 2008, the squeeze-out of the former minority shareholders of
Bayer Pharma AG (formerly named Bayer Schering Pharma AG), Berlin, Germany, became effective. As usual in
such cases, several shareholders have initiated special court proceedings to review the adequacy of the compensation payments made by Bayer for the transfer of the shares in the squeeze-out. In another court proceeding initiated by former minority shareholders of Bayer Pharma AG (formerly Bayer Schering Pharma AG) to review the adequacy of compensation payments made by Bayer in connection with the 2006 domination and profit and loss transfer agreement, the District Court (Landgericht) of Berlin decided in 2013 that the compensation paid by Bayer at
the time should be increased by about 40%. Bayer disagrees with this decision and has appealed. Appropriate
accounting measures have been taken for this proceeding as well as for the parallel proceeding relating to the
squeeze-out of the former minority shareholders.
Newark Bay Environmental Matters: In the United States, Bayer is one of numerous parties involved in a series of
claims brought by federal and state environmental protection agencies. The claims arise from operations by entities
which historically were conducted near Newark Bay or surrounding bodies of water, or which allegedly discharged
hazardous waste into these waterways or onto nearby land. Bayer and the other potentially responsible parties are
being asked to remediate and contribute to the payment of past and future remediation or restoration costs and
damages.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

In the Lower Passaic River matter, a group of more than sixty companies including Bayer is investigating contaminated sediments in the riverbed under the supervision of the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(epa) and other governmental authorities. Future remediation will involve some form of dredging, the nature and
scope of which are not yet defined, and potentially other tasks. The cost of the investigation and the remediation
work may be substantial if the final remedy involves extensive dredging and disposal of impacted sediments.
In the Newark Bay matter, an unaffiliated party is currently conducting an investigation of sediments in Newark
Bay under epa supervision. The investigation is in a preliminary stage. Bayer has contributed to certain investigation costs in the past and may incur costs for future investigation and remediation activities in Newark Bay.
Bayer has also been notified by governmental authorities acting as natural resource trustees that it may have
liability for natural resource damages arising from the contamination of the Lower Passaic River, Newark Bay and
surrounding water bodies. Bayer is currently unable to determine the extent of its liability.

CropScience:
Asbestos: A further risk may arise from asbestos litigation in the United States. In many cases, the plaintiffs
allege that Bayer and co-defendants employed third parties on their sites in past decades without providing them
with sufficient warnings or protection against the known dangers of asbestos. Additionally, a Bayer affiliate in the
United States is the legal successor to companies that sold asbestos products until 1976. Union Carbide has agreed
to indemnify Bayer for this liability. Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself vigorously.

MaterialScience:
Partial exemption from the surcharge under the Renewable Energy Act: Under the German Renewable Energy
Act (Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz) of 2012 (“eeg 2012”), all consumers of electricity normally have to pay a surcharge which is used to promote the development of renewable energies in Germany (“eeg surcharge”). Some
energy-intensive companies are partially exempted from this surcharge. In 2013, the European Commission had
launched a formal investigation into such partial exemptions. The investigation was closed in November 2014,
and the European Commission approved in principle this German state aid regulation on renewable energies (eeg
2012). Remaining claims for further payments against which Bayer has appealed are in the low one digit million
euro range. Bayer believes the risks remaining in this matter are no longer material.
TAX PROCEEDINGS
Stamp taxes in Greece: In February 2014, a Greek administrative court of first instance dismissed Bayer’s appeal
against the assessment of stamp taxes and contingent penalties in the total amount of approximately €23 million
on certain intra-Group loans to a Greek subsidiary. Bayer is convinced that the decision is wrong and has appealed.
In a second court proceeding of first instance before the same court, Bayer has appealed against the assessment
of stamp taxes and contingent penalties in a total amount of approximately €90 million. In addition, at the end of
2014 Bayer received new assessments of stamp tax and contingent penalties in a total amount of approximately
€16 million which were appealed on administrative level. Bayer believes it has meritorious arguments to support its
legal position and intends to defend itself vigorously.

Notes to the Statements of Cash Flows
The statement of cash flows shows how cash inflows and outflows during the fiscal year affected the cash and cash
equivalents of the Bayer Group. Cash flows are classified by operating, investing and financing activities in accordance with ias 7 (Statement of Cash Flows). Effects of changes in the scope of consolidation are stated separately.
Of the cash and cash equivalents, an amount of €72 million (2013: €119 million) had limited availability due to
foreign exchange restrictions. Past experience has shown such restrictions to be of short duration. The above
amount included €64 million (2013: €96 million) of exchange-restricted cash in Venezuela. The conversion of cash
from Venezuelan bolivars (vef) into u.s. dollars is subject to a government approval process. In the event of a devaluation of the bolivar, the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents will therefore be reduced accordingly.
The cash flows reported by consolidated companies outside the eurozone are translated at average monthly exchange rates, with the exception of cash and cash equivalents, which are translated at closing rates. The “Change
in cash and cash equivalents due to exchange rate movements” is reported in a separate line item.

33. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities
The gross cash flow for 2014 of €6,820 million (2013: €5,832 million) is the cash surplus from operating activities
before any changes in working capital. The cash flows by segment are shown in note [1].
The net cash of €5,810 million (2013: €5,171 million) provided by operating activities (net cash flow) also takes into
account the changes in working capital and other non-cash transactions.
An income-tax-related net cash outflow of €1,835 million (2013: €1,281 million) is included in the net cash flow for
2014. The changes in income tax liabilities, income tax provisions and claims for reimbursement of income taxes
are shown in the line item “Changes in other working capital, other non-cash items.”
The transfers of bonds with a total value of €250 million to pension funds in the prior year were non-cash transactions and therefore did not result in an operating cash outflow.
In 2013, the net cash flow included €200 million in receipts from sales of securities held for trading, which must be
reflected under operating activities according to ias 7.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group

34. Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities
Net cash outflow for investing activities in 2014 amounted to €15,539 million (2013: €2,581 million).
Additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets in 2014 resulted in a cash outflow of
€2,371 million (2013: €2,157 million). Cash inflows from sales of property, plant and equipment and other assets
amounted to €143 million (2013: €153 million).
Cash outflows of €13,545 million (2013: €1,082 million) pertained to acquisitions, primarily those of the consumer
care business of Merck & Co., Inc., United States, and Algeta asa, Norway. The prior-year figure mainly comprised
the acquisitions of Conceptus, Inc., United States; Teva Animal Health Inc., United States; the soybean seed
producer Wehrtec Tecnologia Agricola Ltda., Brazil; the soybean business of Agricola Wehrmann Ltda., Brazil; the
soybean seed producer fn Semillas s.a., Argentina; PROPHYTA Biologischer Pflanzenschutz GmbH, Germany;
and Steigerwald Arzneimittelwerk GmbH, Germany. Further details of acquisitions and divestitures are given in
notes [6.2] and [6.3], respectively.
The net cash outflow for noncurrent and current financial assets amounted to €177 million (2013: inflow of
€301 million).
The transfers of bonds with a total value of €250 million to pension funds in the prior year were non-cash
transactions and therefore did not result in an investing cash inflow.

35. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities
In 2014 there was a net cash inflow of €9,736 million (2013: outflow of €2,535 million) for financing activities.
Net borrowings amounted to €11,838 million (2013: net loan repayments of €619 million).
Cash outflows for dividend payments amounted to €1,739 million (2013: €1,574 million). Net interest payments –
including payments for and receipts from interest-rate swaps – rose to €362 million (2013: €338 million).

Report
To Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, Leverkusen
REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Bayer Aktiengesellschaft and
its subsidiaries, which comprise the consolidated income statement and statement of comprehensive
income, the consolidated statement of financial position, the consolidated statement of cash flows, the
consolidated statement of changes in equity and the notes to the consolidated financial statements for
the business year from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014.
Board of Management’s Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Board of Management of Bayer Aktiengesellschaft is responsible for the preparation of these
consolidated financial statements. This responsibility includes that these consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by
the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § (Article) 315a Abs.
(paragraph) 1 HGB (“Handelsgesetzbuch”: German Commercial Code) and that these consolidated
­financial statements give a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the group in accordance with these requirements. The Board of Management is also responsible for the internal controls as the Board of Management determines are necessary to enable the
preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with § 317 HGB and German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute
of Public Auditors in Germany) (IDW) and additionally observed the International Standards on Auditing (ISA). Accordingly, we are required to comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free
from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing audit procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The selection of audit procedures depends on the auditor’s professional judgment. This includes the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the
consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In assessing those risks, the auditor
considers the internal control system relevant to the entity’s preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view. The aim of this is to plan and perform audit procedures that are
­appropriate in the given circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness
of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Board of
­Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion.

sources of documentation as well as prospective statements and statements from external experts set
out in the Content. We also have been engaged to make recommendations for the further development
of sustainability management and sustainability reporting based on the results of our assurance
engagement.
We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements

assurance.
In a limited assurance engagement the evidence-gathering procedures are more limited than for a
reasonable assurance engagement and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable
assurance engagement. The procedures selected depend on the practitioner’s judgement.
• Inquiries of personnel responsible for the preparation of the online annexes regarding the process
to prepare the reporting of sustainability information and the underlying internal control system;
• Inspection of documents regarding the sustainability strategy as well as understanding the sustainability management structure, the stakeholder dialogue and the development process of Company’s
sustainability program;
• Recording of the systems and processes for collection, analysis, validation and aggregation of
sustainability data and their documentation on a sample basis;
• Performance of site visits as part of the inspection of processes for collecting, analyzing and
aggregating selected data at:
– Bayer CropScience Monheim (Germany),
– Bayer CropScience Vapi (India),
– Bayer HealthCare Bitterfeld (Germany),
– Bayer HealthCare Shiga (Japan),
– Bayer MaterialScience Tarragona (Spain),
– Bayer MaterialScience Uerdingen (Germany),
– Currenta Uerdingen (Germany),
– Bayer Business Services Leverkusen (Germany);
• Analytical procedures on sustainability data included in the Online Version;
• Gaining further evidence for selected data of the online annexes through inspection of internal
documents, contracts and invoices/reports from external service providers.

Bayer Annual Report 2014
Independent Assurance Report

CONCLUSION
Based on our limited assurance engagement, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe
that the information marked with the label “limited assurance” in the Content has not been prepared,
in all material respects, in accordance with the above mentioned criteria of the Sustainability Reporting
Guidelines Vol. 3.1 (pp. 7 to 17) of the GRI.
EMPHASIS OF MATTER – RECOMMENDATIONS
Without qualifying our conclusion presented above, we make the following recommendations for the
further development of the Company’s sustainability management and sustainability reporting:
• Further development of the sustainability approach of Bayer AG in consideration of the planned and
entire focus on the Life Science businesses;
• Further formalization of the internal controls system for sustainability information and transformation
into standardized processes in the course of the further development of Integrated Reporting;
• Further alignment of future reporting with the updated materiality analysis, especially considering
the requirements of the new G4 Guidelines of GRI.
