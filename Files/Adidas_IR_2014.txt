CEO STATEMENT

10

After all, being true sports people we are always up for the next
challenge. And hence we will not give up our ambitions to ‘make
a difference’ in the future. Our overall goal is to make the best
products for our athletes so that they can make a difference in
their sports. We make a difference in many different aspects of
sport, and do so in the area of sustainability, too.
More precisely, we make a difference

Dear all,
It is my privilege to address you with this letter in the opening
section of our sustainability report.
This year, we celebrate 15 years of social and environmental
reporting.
We look back on a 15-year-long membership in the Fair Labor
Association.
And we are proud about being included in the sustainability
index family, Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, for 15 years now.
So 15 is the magic number and I am proud that we have led our
industry in so many ways in sustainability over all these years.
At the 2015 World Economic Forum in Davos, it was unveiled
that we are in fact the most sustainable company in Europe
and in our industry. This was researched by Corporate Knights,
a Toronto-based media and investment advisory company.
We have now even moved up five notches from our position last
year and ended up on the podium as number three globally. This
is a great testament to our work.
But let me assure you that we will not rest on our laurels for
a single second. Not in 2015 and not for the next 15 years.

• For our people: In 2014, we significantly revised our Code
of Conduct, the foundation of the adidas Group Fair Play
Framework, for our employees. We further extended our
innovative SMS worker hotline system, now reaching more
than 160,000 workers in our global supply chain. And together
with these actions we strengthened our complaint systems
for stakeholders to keep our unconditional commitment in
protecting Human Rights in our global business operations.
• W ith our products: In 2014, we sourced more than 30% of all
our cotton as Better Cotton, exceeding our originally planned
25% target. This marks the highest volume in sustainable
cotton used in the company’s history.
• For our planet: In 2014, we introduced and showcased the
‘green’ retail concept for the first time worldwide in the
HomeCourt store in Nuremberg.
• W ith our partnerships: In 2014, while continuing many of our
long-term relationships with governments, NGOs and the civil
society, we also entered an exciting new partnership with
bluesign technologies to advance our chemical management
programme.
You will find more details about these initiatives in this report.
People, product, planet, partnership – please remember these
four ‘P’s as you go through our report. They build the framework
for our sustainability efforts to tackle issues that are most
material for our business operations.
• People: We positively influence the lives of our employees and
factory workers as well as those people living in the
communities in which we have a business presence.
• Product: We find better ways to create our products, mainly
through innovation, increased use of more sustainable
materials and efficiencies.
• Planet: We reduce the environmental footprint of both our own
operations and our suppliers’ factories.
• Partnership: We engage with critical stakeholders and
collaborate with partners to improve our industry.
Are we perfect? No, far from.

PEOPLE, PRODUCT,
PLANET, PARTNERSHIP –
Please remember these four ‘P’s as you
go through our report. They build the
framework for our sustainability efforts
to tackle issues that are most material
for our business operations.

We face constantly new, industry-wide challenges due to changes
in society, key sourcing and sales markets or new technologies
and manufacturing trends. But we tackle these challenges and
try to improve. And while we will always acknowledge appropriate
criticism, we value positive external recognition for our work.
To me, both are equally important to remain on the right path.
So now enjoy reading our report and do not hesitate to give us
your feedback via sustainability@adidas-Group.com.
Yours sincerely,
Herbert Hainer
Chief Executive Officer,
adidas Group

OUR APPROACH

Frank Henke, VP Global Social and Environmental Affairs (SEA), gives insights into the sustainability programme of the adidas Group,
talks about successes, future challenges and how it feels to look back on 15 years of sustainability reporting.
LOOKING BACK
This report marks a significant milestone in the history of
sustainability at the adidas Group: you are celebrating 15
years of sustainability reporting. Looking back to the very first
report, how would you describe the development of reporting
at the adidas Group?
It was in a spirit of transparency and responsiveness towards its
stakeholders that the company published its first sustainability
report. Back then, there was not much guidance out there. In
fact, it was just the opposite of today, considering the availability
of multiple reporting frameworks and an ever-growing number
of companies now issuing sustainability reports. Still today, the
adidas Group is the only company in the sporting goods industry
that has published an annual sustainability report since 2000.

ADIDAS GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING
How would you describe the DNA of the adidas Group’s
sustainability reporting? What sets it apart from others?
We definitely benefit from lessons learned throughout our long
history of reporting. Our reporting is heavily influenced by our
stakeholders’ feedback, for example, the level of transparency
about our supply chain programmes and how we measure
progress. Most importantly, however, our reporting DNA reveals
itself in how we constantly strive to communicate the Group’s
programmatic work in the most authentic and pragmatic way, so
that it provides maximum value for all those who may have an
interest in the adidas Group.
In a nutshell, our reporting focuses on what is most material for
us and for our stakeholders. It provides news about
developments or changes in our programmes in a storytelling
format, combined with facts and figures about the four pillars of
our programme. We also disclose information about how we put
our sustainability strategy into practice through pragmatic
guidelines, operating procedures and corporate policies. Some
of the elements in our reporting have also been adopted as
industry guidelines for best practice as provided by the GRI
sector supplement for footwear. However, at this point it is
important to mention that while we recognise and use
international benchmarks for sustainability reporting to guide
our sustainability communication we are not limiting ourselves
to adhering to certain frameworks. That way, we believe we can
talk most appropriately about those issues that enable the
adidas Group to make a difference.

MAKE A DIFFERENCE / Sustainability Progress Report 2014

SUSTAINABILITY COMMUNICATION NO LONGER EQUALS
AN ANNUAL REPORT ONLY
Sustainability reporting can be very challenging in today’s
communication landscape, with new communication channels
emerging, and more and more information being requested
by various stakeholder groups, at an ever-increasing pace.
How do you ensure that you’re fully equipped to respond to
these challenges?
Indeed, we need to respond to diverse stakeholder requests on
a regular basis. While some of them expect us to be focused on
their specific areas of concern, others wish to obtain a broad
overview of our work. In addition to that, the rapid growth in the
digital domain and the rise in new communication channels have
led us to adapt our sustainability communication. While we will
remain committed to publishing a sustainability report, we also
know that updating our stakeholders once a year is not enough.
As a consequence, we publish information throughout the year
on additional channels such as our corporate website, which
offers a comprehensive news archive with press releases and
also archives data from previous years that allows readers to
track our sustainability record and history. To complement our
reporting, we offer personal insights from our colleagues on our
corporate blog where they share their experiences and lessons
learned from their sustainability work at the adidas Group.

TODAY’S SUSTAINABILITY AGENDA

ONGOING EXTERNAL RECOGNITION

Let’s talk about the adidas Group’s sustainability
programme itself. What does sustainability today mean
to the adidas Group?
We are currently experiencing changes in the overall industry
and society as well. Challenges such as political instability,
unrest in certain regions, developments in global labour
markets, emerging new technologies, ongoing globalisation
processes, need for increased speed and flexibility, changing
stakeholder interests and demands for greater transparency all
shape today’s sustainability agenda. Global institutions such as
the UN and the OECD have developed more comprehensive
guidelines that help businesses to respond to these challenges,
to manage their operations responsibly and to avoid adverse
effects. Our own ‘respect – protect – promote’ framework for
managing human rights issues, for example, was inspired by the
UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

The year 2015 started off with great news: the adidas Group
made it to the podium of the most sustainable corporations in
the world, as announced by Corporate Knights. How did the
adidas Group manage to earn that recognition?
This is definitely the result of many years of hard work and
shows the considerable progress the adidas Group has made
more recently. Ranking third in the Global 100 Index makes us
extremely proud and clearly underlines our leadership position
in sustainability. It is important to note, though, that we have
received positive external recognition for our sustainability
programme for many years already. Ethical investment agencies
such as the ‘Dow Jones Sustainability Index’, the Financial Times
Index ‘FTSE4Good’ and ETHIBEL regularly rate the adidas Group
among the leaders in social and environmental responsibility.

In response to these changed circumstances, our sustainability
strategy has to be permanently under review and evolve to
tackle the key social and environmental impacts of our
operations on the ground. And here we benefit enormously from
our global sustainability team, now almost 70 people worldwide.
These highly experienced experts located in key countries
understand all of these current issues and drive effective
initiatives on a regional and local level. And they can act where
these issues arise: on site.

LOOKING AHEAD

Another characteristic of our sustainability strategy is our well
established stakeholder networks in each of the countries we
source from. These networks involve a variety of civil society
groups, labour, human rights and environmental NGOs, as well
as trade unions. We are in regular dialogue with these groups.
Normally, our focus is on specific supply chain issues, be they
worker rights or environmental concerns.
With some NGOs we have joint project work. For example, for
several years now we have engaged closely with local trade
unions on a Freedom of Association Protocol, to support
representational rights and improve industrial relations in our
supplier factories in Indonesia. Similarly, we have worked with
a women’s NGO in Bangladesh for the past decade; they provide
independent and insightful feedback on worker rights in the
handful of suppliers we have in Dhaka. And in China, we have
engaged with NGOs to run training programmes on workermanagement communication as well as manning worker
hotlines.

Just recently, the adidas Group announced its new Strategic
Business Plan 2020, called ‘creating the new’. What role does
sustainability play in the business strategy of the adidas
Group?
The adidas Group has made significant progress in embedding
social and environmental topics into mainstream business
processes and day-to-day operations. Take, for example, our
close collaboration with Global Sourcing in our factory
assessments and onboarding processes and with our licensees
in responsibly managing their supply chains. The company’s
cooperation with the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) as well as
initiatives such as DryDye or our progress in chemical
management are also good examples of how our product,
development and sourcing teams jointly create product-oriented
sustainable solutions. And last but not least, our Green
Company Initiative drives environmental improvements at own
sites cross-functionally.
As you see, sustainability thinking at the adidas Group is not
treated in isolation but is part of the everyday practice of
multiple corporate functions – integrated into the business
model of the adidas Group. Needless to say, there is room for
further strengthening and integrating of sustainability
performance measures into our overall performance
management – a fact that again proves that working towards
sustainability is a marathon, and not a sprint.

SUSTAINABILITY THINKING AT THE
ADIDAS GROUP IS NOT TREATED IN ISOLATION
BUT IS PART OF THE EVERYDAY PRACTICE OF
MULTIPLE CORPORATE FUNCTIONS.

OUR APPROACH
PEOPLE

How does the future of sustainability at the adidas Group look?
What goals have you set yourselves for the next year?
Our 2020 targets will focus around the further evolution of our
core social and environmental programmes driving selfgovernance in our supply chain. This places a higher
responsibility on our suppliers to manage their downstream
supply chains and move towards public reporting. In addition,
we will strive to accelerate strategic initiatives in the following
areas: promoting worker empowerment building on our previous
track record, moving our chemical management to the next
level, applying human rights due diligence in all business
operations as well as minimising the adidas Group’s water
footprint. In this context, we are extremely excited to announce
a partnership with ‘Parley for the Oceans’, an organisation
dedicated to raising awareness about the beauty and fragility of
the oceans and collaborating on projects that can end the
destruction of these ecosystems. Together, the adidas Group and
‘Parley for the Oceans’ will implement a long-term partnership
programme that builds on three pillars: 1) Communication and
education, 2) Research and innovation, 3) Direct actions against
ocean plastic pollution.

10

2010-2015. Our ability to transition into the next strategic period
requires a careful review of past achievements that can serve as
the basis for the next planning cycle. It is also critical to align
internally with all parties involved as well as to take our external
stakeholders’ feedback into account. As this takes time, I hope
you enjoy reading our report while we keep working on getting
the next cycle done. And don’t forget to visit our website or blog
for upcoming announcements.

THE COLLABORATION WITH ‘PARLEY FOR
THE OCEAN’ WILL ACCELERATE THE CREATION
OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND INTEGRATION
OF MATERIALS MADE OF OCEAN PLASTIC
WASTE INTO THE PRODUCT OFFER OF THE
ADIDAS BRAND AS OF 2016.

BEFORE YOU READ THE REPORT
You mentioned new 2020 targets – when will you publish them?
You might wonder why you don’t find any new milestones for
2016 – on the path to 2020 targets – in this report. Let me briefly
explain the reason to you. Currently, we are focusing entirely on
completing the planning and execution cycle for the period of

THE FOUR ‘P’s IN ACTION IN INDONESIA
Last year, we introduced you to the four pillars of our sustainability strategy: people, product, planet, and partnership. To make
these four ‘P’s more tangible, we have developed a case study about our work in Indonesia showing them in action.

25
YEARS WE HAVE BEEN SOURCING IN INDONESIA.

PEOPLE: MAKING FREEDOM
OF ASSOCIATION A REALITY
Our Workplace Standards clearly state that suppliers must
respect the right of factory workers to join and organise
associations of their own choosing. But even when unions are
free to form, challenges remain in ensuring an open and
constructive dialogue between factory management and trade
union officials.

PRODUCT: PREDATOR
ALWAYS SOURCED IN
INDONESIA
Our strong working relationships with leading footwear
factories in Indonesia made it the perfect place to manufacture
the original Predator football boot. Twenty years on, this is still
the case – again a testament to our commitment to making a
long-term investment in our suppliers.
Indonesian suppliers possessed the skills and craftsmanship
necessary to produce all the various editions of this
revolutionary, high-performance football boot with its ‘lethal
zones’ technology on top of the boot, which aid control, touch,
passing and shooting.
By using innovative Hybridtouch synthetic leather and low-waste
heat injection molding, the Predator also delivers on our
environmental ambitions.

That is why we led a group of suppliers and brands in Indonesia
and worked closely with the labour movement there to develop a
basic framework for the exercise of trade union rights in the
workplace. Signed in 2011, the Freedom of Association Protocol
supports the rights of workers producing for global brands in
Indonesia to join unions and bargain collectively for better
working conditions.
To date all but one supplier – who has only recently started
working with us – have signed up to the protocol. It has helped to
reduce misunderstandings between factory managers and trade
union officials and has set an important benchmark for our
suppliers.

OUR APPROACH
PEOPLE

PLANET: ENERGY
MANAGEMENT TRAINING
FOR OUR SUPPLIERS
Most of our environmental impacts as a company result from the
manufacturing process. We therefore partner with our suppliers
to improve the environmental performance of their factories.
For example, when we set ambitious 2015 energy reduction
targets, we also rolled out an energy efficiency programme to
help our suppliers achieve them.

10

PARTNERSHIP: WE DON’T
BUY, WE SOURCE
We believe that building long-term partnerships with our key
suppliers brings far greater benefits for both sides than
maximising short-term profits. A testament to this approach
is the fact that in 2014 we celebrated 25 years of sourcing
in Indonesia.

Launched in August 2011, the project aimed to build our suppliers’
capacity to monitor and analyse their energy use, to select the
most effective cost-saving measures, and to review the impact of
their actions.
While 16 suppliers participated in the programme, key findings
and best practice was shared across our supply chain and the
industry in general within Indonesia. This helped all suppliers
make even more progress, thus further strengthening our
partnership with them.
The programme ended in 2013 and was a big success. All the
suppliers now have their own energy teams, and one supplier has
already achieved ISO 50001 certification for energy management
systems while others are working towards it. Most importantly,
these efforts are making a difference: from the first year of the
programme, total energy consumption across participating
suppliers’ factories began to fall.

WE ARE VERY PROUD OF OUR HISTORY OF
SOURCING IN INDONESIA, A COUNTRY WHERE WE
HAVE BUILT LONG-STANDING PARTNERSHIPS
WITH OUR SUPPLIERS. WE HAVE ALSO DRIVEN
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE INDUSTRY, THANKS
TO INITIATIVES SUCH AS THE FREEDOM OF
ASSOCIATION PROTOCOL AND INNOVATIVE
WORKER GRIEVANCE SYSTEMS.
John McNamara, Senior VP Sourcing at the adidas Group

MAKE A DIFFERENCE / Sustainability Progress Report 2014

Testament to our long-term commitment with key suppliers: Celebrating more
than 25 years of sourcing in Indonesia.

Over time, we have built two-way relationships with suppliers
that go well beyond a simple order/purchase transaction. These
trusting relationships have enabled us to work together to
innovate with new materials and processes and to address
productivity, efficiency and quality. We also place our own
personnel in the strategic factories, where they work closely with
local personnel on developing the next innovation, with the
consequence that our suppliers are becoming more competitive.
The partnership approach extends to social and environmental
issues, too. Not only do we visit numerous factories each year to
check they are complying with our Workplace Standards, but we
also advise and train them in how to make improvements where
necessary. That way, we can help our suppliers to truly integrate
our standards into their business and take responsibility for
meeting them.

SMS WORKER HOTLINE
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT FROM 2012-2015

Two years after launching, our SMS worker hotline project
continues to expand its reach, offering more factory workers
the opportunity to ask questions, make suggestions or express
their concerns by text. Run by an independent service provider,
this personal, anonymous service effectively bridges the
communication gap between management and workers. And
by monitoring the messages received, the adidas Group can
listen directly to factory workers’ concerns and act upon them.

160,000
NUMBER OF WORKERS NOW COVERED
BY THE SMS WORKER HOTLINE.

FACTORIES OFFERING THE
SMS WORKER HOTLINE
WORKERS WITH ACCESS TO
THE SMS WORKER HOTLINE

In 2014, we extended this innovative programme to a further nine
factories in Indonesia, bringing the total to 14. We also added 10
supplier factories in Vietnam. As in Indonesia, the vast majority of
Vietnamese people have mobile phones, ensuring nearly every
factory worker can use the new system. At the end of 2014, more
than 160,000 workers were covered by the SMS hotline service.

WORKERS KNOW THAT MANAGEMENT IS LISTENING TO
THEIR CONCERNS. MANAGEMENT CAN SEND WORKERS
GROUP TEXTS WITH POLICY UPDATES OR SAFETY MESSAGES.

The success of the service lies in its ease of use. Workers find it
straightforward to send a message, and because it encourages
prompt responses from management, workers know that their
concerns are being heard. Being run by an independent service
provider ensures worker confidentiality. As part of the project,
workers’ mobile numbers are anonymously gathered so
management can send group texts with policy updates or safety
messages. All in all it brings the two groups closer together,
which we know improves greater compliance with our
Workplace Standards.
In 2015, we plan to roll out the SMS hotline service to 20 supplier
factories in Cambodia and will also add four more supplier
factories in Indonesia and a further eight in Vietnam. As it enters
its third year, our worker hotline service is growing fast.

SAFEGUARDING WORKER
RIGHTS IN SOUTHERN CHINA
The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights calls
on companies to identify their potential and actual impacts on
human rights and to take action, even when the primary duty to
protect human rights rests with governments. Indeed for the
past 15 years this is what adidas Group has done, and continues
to do. Whenever we address human rights concerns we follow
a very clear ‘respect-protect-promote’ framework.

The Yue Yuen complex is made up of seven huge factories that
manufacture athletic shoes for many international brands. The
adidas Group sources footwear from one of these factories,
which employs about 15% of Yue Yuen’s 40,000 employees.

40,000

Two advocates from Shenzhen Chunfeng Labour Disputes
Services Centre, who had been advising the workers during the
strike, were arrested and detained by the police. On the day the
strike ended one of the advocates was released, the other
however remained in detention although the authorities had not
disclosed the grounds for his arrest. We petitioned the local
mayor, calling for the advocate to be released. Our action was
timed with an online campaign run by civil society. Three weeks
later the individual was set free, without charge.

THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WORK AT THE
YUE YUEN INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX IN
DONGGUAN, CHINA

Over the years there have been times when this has seen us
become involved in defending the actions of human rights
advocates. The most recent case was in 2014 when we helped to
secure the release of two labour activists who had supported
workers during China’s largest-ever strike at the Yue Yuen
industrial complex in Dongguan. Workers at Yue Yuen had gone
on strike calling for full payment of their social insurance and
housing fund contributions.

Throughout the strike, our SEA team engaged directly with both
workers and management. We called for the riot police to be
stood down to avoid inflaming the situation. And our senior
management also engaged daily with civil society groups in
Southern China.

This is an example of how we partner with civil society groups to
press governments to do more to fulfil their duty to protect
human rights – and shows our respect-protect-promote approach
in action.

THROUGHOUT THE STRIKE, OUR SEA
TEAM ENGAGED DIRECTLY WITH BOTH WORKERS
AND MANAGEMENT.

WE RESPECT RIGHTS, ENSURING THAT OUR OWN
ACTIVITIES DO NO HARM. WE SEEK TO DIRECTLY
PROTECT WORKER RIGHTS, AND MONITOR AND
REMEDIATE ISSUES THAT WE FIND, AND WHERE
WE SEE OPPORTUNITIES TO DO SO, WE ALSO
PROMOTE SPECIFIC RIGHTS, ENCOURAGING OUR
SUPPLIERS TO ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR
OWN OBLIGATIONS AS BUSINESS ENTERPRISES

DEVELOPING FAIR WAGES
FOR OUR SUPPLY CHAIN
Our position on fair wages is based on the comprehensive
engagements we have held with stakeholders including
suppliers, workers, unions, investors and governments. The
concept of fair wages is much broader than living wages: it
addresses not only the amount paid in relation to living costs,
but also to the price of the product workers are making and the
employer’s profits. Fair wages are negotiated openly,
communicated clearly and paid promptly.

WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE LIVING WAGE
CONCEPT BY LEVERAGING OUR LONG-TERM
RESEARCH INTO FAIR WAGES AND BY APPLYING
THE RESPECT-PROTECT-PROMOTE FRAMEWORK
TO SUPPLY CHAIN WORKERS’ COMPENSATION.

Respect
Do not infringe on the rights of workers, their employers
and governments to set fair wages. Our business decisions
and actions must not act as an impediment to workers
receiving a fair wage.

RESPECT

PROTECT

PROMOTE

Gregg Nebel, VP Social & Environmental Affairs,
the Americas, at the adidas Group

Our approach to fair wages is built on the three pillars of all our
human rights work: our ‘respect-protect-promote’ framework.
Within each pillar we have a programme of work activities which
supports fair wages and wage progression when workers achieve
proficiency, performance and competencies in their jobs.
We continue to explore this complex area and look forward to
working with more partners such as the Fair Labor Association to
promote fair wages across our industry’s supply chain.

Protect
Conduct due diligence and
act when business partners
are not compliant with
the law or our Workplace
Standards. We monitor our
suppliers to make sure
wages are paid in full and
on time.

Promote
Facilitate ways and actions
that influence wage
progression and fair wages.
We encourage our suppliers
to set wages with the direct
input of workers ideally
through negotiation or
collective bargaining.

PROTECTING VULNERABLE GROUPS
IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN
At the same time, we work closely with the International Labour
Organization (ILO), as well as non-government organisations
(NGOs), to safeguard the rights of migrant workers in our supply
chain. This has included supplier training and the strict
enforcement of our Workplace Standards to eliminate the
exploitative actions of middle-men and unscrupulous
employment agencies, as well as ensuring freedom of
movement, equal treatment and proper employment contracts
for migrant workers.

Together with local organisations we train our female workforce on topics such as
reproductive health and family planning.

Companies play a key role in respecting and promoting human
rights. Although everyone’s human rights and fundamental
freedoms must be respected and upheld, migrant workers,
women and children represent the most vulnerable groups
involved in the global apparel and footwear manufacturing
industries. Therefore, we have put in place a number of
measures to protect them.

MIGRANT WORKERS, WOMEN AND CHILDREN
REPRESENT THE MOST VULNERABLE GROUPS
INVOLVED IN THE GLOBAL APPAREL AND
FOOTWEAR MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES.

We consider it a high priority to protect and promote the rights
of female factory workers, who make up about 80% of the people
employed by our manufacturing partners. As many of these
women are of reproductive age, we have entered into
partnerships with local organisations to develop guidance for
suppliers on how to manage the reproductive health of female
workers. One example is our long-term collaboration with Marie
Stopes International (MSI) in Vietnam, and our shared two-year
project to train our suppliers on various rights of workers,
including the non-discrimination of women.

MAKE A DIFFERENCE / Sustainability Progress Report 2014

Our approach to protecting the rights of children centres on a
concern for the child and their interests, while recognising the
importance of income to support households and schooling. We
have a comprehensive approach to dealing with cases that arise,
which requires the supplier to pay an ongoing wage to the family
while the child returns to school. In the Sialkot region of
Pakistan, the global centre of the football stitching industry, we
have worked for many years with the NGO Sudhaar, sponsoring
programmes to improve access to schooling for children from
the rural areas where home-stitching was once prevalent. Since
2002, adidas Group support has benefited more than 28,000
children in the Sialkot District.

80%

THE PERCENTAGE OF WORKERS IN OUR
SUPPLY CHAIN WHO ARE WOMEN.

We are also aware of, and concerned by, the fact that the
sourcing of cotton in certain parts of the world can include child
labour. Therefore, we joined an alliance of international
investors, brands and non-governmental organisations to fight
against government-backed child labour in Uzbekistan during
the cotton-picking season.
To support all of these vulnerable groups, in 2014, we revised
our thirdparty complaints mechanism which allows anyone with
an issue that infringes on their rights to bring it to our attention,
anywhere in the world. We commit to be fair and transparent in
the handling and reporting of all such issues.

A NEW WAY OF LEARNING

In 2014, we launched a brand new approach to learning and
development for our employees. Called The New Way of
Learning, it is a philosophy that recognises the fact that
more than 80% of learning happens informally. People learn
from their colleagues, and through self-directed study as well
as from a range of online sources, choosing what is right for
them at a particular time. This philosophy was brought to life
in July 2014 with the launch of our corporate university, the
Learning Campus.

2,000

THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES VISITING THE
LEARNING CAMPUS ONLINE EACH MONTH.

The adidas Group Learning Campus embodies the five
underlying principles of The New Way of Learning, which are:
1. Working is learning and learning is working.
2. Shift to an open and collaborative, connected ‘social’
learning environment.
3. Leadership means sharing, teaching and learning.

The Learning Campus challenges all of us to share knowledge,
to teach others and to learn from experts all over the world.
There are three key elements to the Learning Campus:
• a virtual Learning Campus Online where employees register
for classroom training and access learning kits
• physical spaces that combine working and learning, such as
the Shed at our corporate headquarters in Herzogenaurach
• The Future Workplace, a personal workplace for each
employee, where learning is fully embedded into daily work.
Learning kits are a core feature of the Learning Campus.
Covering topics like Communication Skills, Finding Satisfaction
in the Workplace and Personal Organisation, each learning kit
includes thought-provoking videos, online articles, podcasts and
eLearning modules. Users can access individual study guides
called ‘workouts’, or browse content according to their interests.
Each kit offers a discussion forum to encourage collaboration
between employees.
In addition, employees can attend presentations by both external
thought leaders and internal experts. We kicked off this Speaker
Series in Herzogenaurach in 2014 and its success has led to
similar events in other locations.
Since the launch in July, unique visitors to The Learning Campus
Online have grown to about 2,000 a month. We expect this traffic
to increase in 2015 as we provide more local activities
connecting online content to in-person activities and learning
opportunities. The future of learning has begun.

FAIR PLAY – THE ADIDAS
GROUP WAY

TAKING AN INCLUSIVE
APPROACH TO DIVERSITY

Integrity is one of the core values of the adidas Group. We
expect our employees to act with fairness and responsibility
and to comply with relevant laws and regulations while
carrying out their tasks. Our Fair Play Code of Conduct
provides guidance on how our employees should put these
principles into action. We review it periodically to check
whether revisions are needed because of changes in the
law or regulations, or changes in our business. In 2014, we
significantly revised and relaunched our new Fair Play Code
of Conduct in 10 languages.

Diversity is part of the adidas Group DNA. Our more than 50,000
employees work in more than 160 countries around the world
– at the German headquarters alone we have almost 80 different
nationalities working together – and 50% of our employees
are men and 50% women. So it is natural for us to embrace
the diversity of our global workforce and actively foster an
atmosphere of respect and acceptance for all of our employees
– regardless of nationality, gender or sexual orientation.

WHILE THE GROUP’S REPUTATION HAS BEEN
HARD WON, IT CAN EASILY BE LOST. IT IS OUR
RESPONSIBILITY TO LIVE UP TO THE SPIRIT OF
THE CODE OF CONDUCT AND TO MAKE DECISIONS
ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR GROUP’S
VALUES.
Herbert Hainer, Chief Executive Officer at the adidas Group

We supported the relaunch with a mandatory Fair Play
Compliance Training Plan to ensure that all employees
understand and adhere to the Group’s compliance and ethics
requirements. The training plan applies to all employees and
relevant third parties, wherever they are located. It is accessible
on the e-platform of our Learning Campus. Employees can also
stay on top of developments in our ethics and compliance work
through our new Fair Play app.
Herbert Hainer, Chief Executive Officer says, “While the Group’s
reputation has been hard won, it can easily be lost. It is our
responsibility to live up to the spirit of the Code of Conduct and
to make decisions only in accordance with our Group’s values.”

We made a lot of progress in all aspects of diversity in 2014. We
celebrated our fifth Diversity Day at locations around the world
(Herzogenaurach, Amsterdam, Canton and Portland). This event
also marked the first anniversary of our lesbian, gay, bisexual
and transsexual (LGBT) employee network.
Since its launch, the network has participated in Pride marches
in Frankfurt and Portland, and attended and presented at career
fairs and LGBT conferences. To mark the occasion of the fifth
Diversity Day, the company announced that our CFO and Labour
Director Robin Stalker was becoming patron of the LGBT
network, indicating very clearly the senior level support the
company has for the group and its aims.
This was echoed throughout the Diversity Day with many staff
members stopping by the LGBT booth to voice their support and
express the view that equality matters to everyone, not only the
LGBT community.

EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT DIFFERENT LIFESTYLES,
CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS AND WAYS OF
THINKING ALL FOSTER AN ENVIRONMENT THAT
SPARKS CREATIVITY, INNOVATION AND HIGH
PERFORMANCE – JUST THE THINGS WE WANT
TO SEE HERE AT THE ADIDAS GROUP.
Robin Stalker, CFO and Labour Director, at the adidas Group
(also patron of the LGBT Network)

Read our Code of Conduct on our Website

One of the areas where these issues play out is gender equality
and we attended a special recruitment event targeting women.
We also appointed our first-ever female C-suite executive when
Karen Parkin took the role of Chief HR Officer in November. And
last year two women joined the supervisory board resulting now
in 33% of the adidas Group’s supervisory board members being
female.
Our efforts so far have not gone unnoticed and we were named
top of the list of US apparel retailers in the Human Rights
Campaign’s Buying for Workplace Equality Guide 2015. There is
always more we can do, but earning accolades such as this is
a cause for celebration and helps to galvanise support for the
work that lies ahead. Onwards!

SUPPORTING REFUGEES IN
SYRIA AND NORTHERN IRAQ

The adidas Fund’s community involvement programme gives
employees the chance to grow and develop outside the
workplace. While bringing to life our mission of making the
world a better place through sport, volunteers also acquire
valuable skills and experience that not only enhance their
value to the company but enrich their lives as well.
Working with more than 25 organisations across six continents,
the adidas Fund connects children with coaches and
programmes that use sport to teach teamwork and respect,
with the ultimate goal of breaking down barriers and achieving
positive social change.
In 2014, Herzogenaurach-based employees spent more than
19,000 volunteer hours, while more than one-third of all
HQ-based employees has taken part in adidas Fund activities
over the past three years. Volunteers find the opportunity to
participate but also to lead projects with disadvantaged people
to be an empowering and enriching experience. In 2014, 85% of
volunteers reported that participating in the programme had a
positive impact on their life.

IF YOU CAN GIVE SOMETHING BACK TO THE
WORLD, THE IMPACT IT HAS ON YOU IS MUCH
MORE MEANINGFUL THAN JUST TAKING TIME
FOR YOURSELF.
Stefanie Dangel, adidas Fund volunteer and team leader

While helping others, volunteers with the adidas Fund get a new
perspective on friendship, family, and even life – and the power
of sport. The volunteering experience strengthens team spirit,
enhances soft skills such as teamwork, leadership, decisionmaking and communication, and increases commitment and
motivation. And when employees bring these enhanced skills
back into the workplace, it really is a win-win for all involved.

VOLUNTEERS WITH THE ADIDAS FUND GET
A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON FRIENDSHIP,
FAMILY AND EVEN LIFE.

Emergency relief to those most in need: in 2014, we targeted major volumes of
our product donations to support Syrian refugee camps.

The adidas Group is helping to support refugees in Syria and
northern Iraq by providing much-needed clothes and footwear
through our long-term partnership with charity Wings of Help
(Luftfahrt ohne Grenzen).
Based in Frankfurt, Wings of Help provides emergency relief in
crisis situations around the world. Since 2006, we have
supported their efforts with more than 100,000 items donated.
Wings of Help has been delivering aid to Syrian refugees since
the summer of 2012. Sadly, the humanitarian crisis continues to
escalate, with more than a million refugees now living in camps
on the Turkish-Syrian border.
In August 2014, there was an urgent appeal to help the more
than 300,000 refugees who were under siege in Erbil in northern
Iraq. We responded by donating thousands of items of footwear
and apparel, as well as making a cash donation to help fund the
Wings of Help relief convoy.
The transport made the 4,000 km journey safely, reaching its
destination in mid-September. But as winter drew in, the
situation worsened. Cities in northern Iraq, such as Zakho and
Dohuk, were hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees.
Wings of Help organised another relief convoy to the region in
December, to deliver food and winter clothing to people
sheltering in damaged houses or even living in the open. On this
occasion, the adidas Group donated a further 30,000 items of
apparel and footwear.
We are proud to play a small part in the work Wings of Help does
to bring emergency relief to those most in need around the
world.

Cotton, hence using more sustainable cotton than ever before.

ALONG WITH OTHER BRANDS WE ARE FUNDING
TRAINING FOR COTTON FARMERS TO HELP
THEM TO ADOPT MORE SUSTAINABLE

This success is mainly due to the hard work we have done to
connect the complex cotton supply chain, including cotton farms
and ginners. The close relationship with our suppliers allows us
to agree on targets together and we are now able to regularly
track how much Better Cotton is used for adidas Group products.

RECYCLED POLYESTER:
OPTIMISING IMAGING
AN ANTHEM FOR OUR TIMES TECHNOLOGY
Using more sustainable materials such as recycled polyester
is one way we seek to improve our environmental footprint
while still making high performance products for the athlete.
While virgin polyester is made from petroleum, recycled
polyester is made from recycled waste, such as plastic bottles
and used clothing, which is processed and spun into fibres.
In 2014, our Anthem jacket collection was made with recycled
polyester. Versatile and well suited as warm-up jackets for a
range of sports, Anthem jackets are used by athletes in
American football, football (Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and the
German national team warm up in Anthem jackets for example),
handball, rugby, running and training.
Using recycled polyester has many benefits over virgin
polyester. It helps us reduce our dependency on petroleum,
allows us to discharge less waste and keeps polyester from
ending up in landfills and incinerators, where it can result in
toxic emissions. We are currently looking at alternative sources
of recycled polyester and continuing to explore how we can use
it across more of our product categories.

Building on the savings generated by using virtual images at
the selling-in stage, we are now realising further savings and
efficiencies by integrating the use of computer-generated 3D
images throughout the product creation process.

WE ARE RECEIVING VERY POSITIVE FEEDBACK
FROM OUR SALES COLLEAGUES ON THE
INNOVATION AND EFFICIENCY OF THE VIRTUAL
SELL-IN APPROACH. THIS IS VERY REWARDING
AS WE DO NOT ONLY POSITIVELY IMPACT HOW
WE SELL-IN PRODUCTS, BUT ALSO LOWER OUR
ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT BY CREATING
LESS PHYSICAL SAMPLES AND REDUCING
GLOBAL TRANSPORT.
Udo Breithaupt, Director Global Brand Projects and
Virtualisation Programme Lead at the adidas Group

Thanks to the virtual technology, between 2011 and 2014 we
produced almost two million fewer physical samples. We made
reductions across all ranges, producing 1,300,000 fewer apparel
samples and 600,000 fewer samples of footwear and hardware.
We are also now using more virtual images – and fewer
photographs of actual products – on our eCommerce website.
At the end of 2014, we had approximately 800 virtual images on
the website and we plan to further increase this number in the
coming year. By doing so, we are limiting the need for product
photo shoots.
At the same time, we are integrating 3D imaging technology
throughout our product creation process. Some early design
decisions can now be made without building a physical prototype
first – another efficient use of time and resources. This also
shortens the time needed for the design development phase, as
feedback loops are quicker.
Producing virtual prototypes and samples has wider
environmental benefits. As well as saving on the resources that
would be used, we also avoid the carbon emissions that would
result from transporting them around the world.
The growing use of 3D imaging technology is a great example of
where we can improve the efficiency of our business processes
while at the same time delivering environmental benefits.

APPLYING A LOW-WASTE APPROACH
TO A HIGH-VOLUME SHOE
2014 was another great year for the adidas Group’s low-waste
initiative, which aims to maximise performance while
minimising waste. For instance, we applied what we learned
making the niche Element Voyager low-waste shoe to the new
Duramo 6.

4m

PAIRS OF DURAMO 6 SHOES ORDERED IN 2014.

THE DIRECTION OF THIS MODEL WAS CLEAR
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING: TO CREATE A SHOE
THAT MINIMISES COMPLEXITY, ENERGY
CONSUMPTION AND MATERIAL USAGE WHILE
STILL PROVIDING ATHLETES WITH A HIGHLY
FUNCTIONAL RUNNING SHOE AT A GREAT PRICE.
AND WE MANAGED IT – THIS IS THE BEST
DURAMO EVER.
Rebecca Steigleder, Product Manager Global Brands
Running at the adidas Group

The Duramo is a high-volume product. Without compromising
the Duramo’s performance, we reassessed every detail of its
construction and design through the lens of our low-waste
approach.
Wherever possible, we streamlined and simplified. High
pattern-efficiency, combined printing processes and fewer parts
and colours all reduce waste. The main upper part of the shoe is
built from only four pieces and designed to be fully computerstitched, while sole-glueing is automated, requiring less glue
and making manufacturing quicker.
We made the Duramo 6 as light as possible, for example
replacing the traditional sock liner with a special strobel board
(a comfortable, pliable layer of material). We also incorporated
environmentally preferred materials where possible. Less
waste, fewer parts, more sustainable materials – a winning
combination. And with more than four million pairs ordered
worldwide in 2014, it seems our customers agree.

WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE DURAMO’S
PERFORMANCE, WE REASSESSED EVERY DETAIL
OF ITS CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN.

NO WATER, LESS ENERGY,
FEWER CHEMICALS
We are always searching for innovative materials and
environmentally friendly ways of manufacturing them. Since
launching adidas DryDye in 2012, we have been steadily
integrating this revolutionary, water-free dyeing process into
our products – saving water, chemicals and energy. To date we
have made more than four million yards of DryDye fabric,
saving 100 million litres of water in the process.

100m

THE LITRES OF WATER ADIDAS GROUP HAS
SAVED THROUGH USING ADIDAS DRYDYE.

Water scarcity is a growing environmental concern worldwide.
The traditional textile industry usually consumes large
quantities of water, so dry-dyeing has the potential to make a
significant impact. While it takes 25 litres of water to dye a
t-shirt the conventional way, dry-dyeing uses no water at all.
Instead the dye is injected into the fabric using compressed
carbon dioxide (CO 2). After the dyeing process is complete, the
CO 2 is gasified for reuse in the next cycle. Overall, 50% fewer
dyeing chemicals are used and 50% less energy.

TAKING CHEMICAL MANAGEMENT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL
We have been a leader in chemical management for nearly two
decades, and have a rigorous programme in place to manage
the chemicals we use to make our products. Even so, we
continuously strive to push improvements through our entire
supply chain – without compromising on the performance of
our products – to achieve our goal of zero discharge of
hazardous chemicals by 2020.

AS PART OF PHASING OUT PFCs, WE ARE
CONDUCTING RESEARCH INTO ALTERNATIVES,
AND PILOTING POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS WITH
MULTIPLE SUPPLIERS.

In 2014, we entered into a strategic partnership with bluesign
technologies, the world’s leading provider of assessment tools
for positive chemistry in the textile industry, to further drive
sustainable solutions in our global supply chain.
Phasing out perfluorinated compounds (PFC)
During the year we also achieved an important milestone on
our journey to being 99% PFC-free in our products by the
end of 2017. PFCs are chemical substances found in many
manufactured products. Our industry primarily uses PFCs to
make sportswear water and dirt repellent.

90

%

THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR PRODUCTS
THAT ARE PFC-FREE.

As part of phasing out PFCs, we are conducting research into
alternatives, and piloting potential solutions with multiple
suppliers. The tests focus on water-repellency performance,
but also include all quality testing as per our industry-leading
standards. Any potential solution will be screened by bluesign
technologies.
Disclosing impacts and actions
Through our chemical management programme, we are
committed to disclosing the results of our environmental actions
and impacts. This includes the active promotion of reputable
public platforms such as the Institute of Public and
Environmental Affairs (IPE) China Water Pollution Map and
China Air Pollution Map.
By the end of 2014 we disclosed 99% of our China-based ‘wet
processes’ on the IPE platform. We are committed to achieving
the disclosure of 50% of all ‘wet processes’ across our global
supply chain by the end of 2015, and of at least 80% by no later
than 1 July 2016, via the IPE Detox platform.

WITH OUR ADVANCED CHEMICAL MANAGEMENT
PROGRAMME, WE DRIVE INNOVATION TOWARDS
MORE SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY AND ENSURE
TRANSPARENCY IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN.
Philipp Meister, Director Social and Environmental
Affairs at the adidas Group

Taken together, our partnership with bluesign, our phase-out
of long-chain C8 PFCs and research into alternatives as well
as greater disclosure, all add up to significant progress on
managing chemicals in 2014.

RESPONSIBLE RETAIL

At the adidas Group, we are always looking for ways to reduce
the environmental footprint of our operations. In 2014, we
expanded our efforts into the retail sector when we introduced
‘green retail’ at our new HomeCourt store in Nuremberg.

WITH HOMECOURT PRESENTING ADIDAS RETAIL
IN AN ENTIRELY NEW DIMENSION, WE ARE ALSO
EXCITED TO BE BRINGING SUSTAINABILITY
THINKING INTO OUR STORES.
The Central Distribution Centre in Rieste, Germany, is our thirteenth site
worldwide now certified with ISO 14001.

In 2014 we furthered our Green Company Initiative by
extending our ISO certified environmental management
system (EMS) to our new central distribution centre in Rieste,
Germany. Rieste is our 13th site worldwide to achieve
certification. Our other certified facilities are located in
Europe, Canada and the US.
Launched in 2008, Green Company aims to improve the
environmental performance of our administration offices,
manufacturing sites and distribution centres. Key to its success
is our shared EMS, which has been certified to the international
standard ISO 14001.
We are proud to have all our brands working with the same
environmental management system. This is best practice in the
industry – and has proved highly effective. It also helped us to
more than double the amount of certified sites compared to our
initial plans.
External auditors visit our ISO 14001 certified sites annually to
check that the EMS is fulfilling all requirements. During their
visits, the auditors review how well management and employees
are incorporating environmental topics into their working lives.
Through the EMS we also systematically track and manage
progress against the environmental targets we have set.
Currently, we are reviewing the potential of extending the
system over the next few years to South America and Asia.

Michael Stainer, SVP Concepts-to-Consumer
at the adidas Group

HomeCourt is the new global adidas store concept. Launched in
February 2014 in Beijing, Nuremberg is our 20th HomeCourt
store – and the first based in Germany. It is also the first adidas
store worldwide to pilot our green retail approach.
An intelligent control unit, or ‘retail box’, runs all of the store’s
operating systems. By optimising the heating, ventilation,
lighting, shading and door control settings, it can produce
energy savings of up to 50%. LED lighting and other energyefficient devices also help to reduce the carbon emissions from
the store’s energy use.
Further environmental efficiencies are achieved through
sensor-controlled water taps and low-flush toilets, and waste is
separated to allow for maximum recycling.
After the pilot has run for six months, we will analyse the results
to assess the business case for bringing green retail into more
of our stores.

We realise that employee engagement and support is critical to
the success of our Green Company ambitions. This is why we
have set up a number of Green Teams around the world to
support green projects and come up with ways to further reduce
our environmental footprint. As of 2014, our Green Teams can
also share best practice through the new Green Team
workspace on our global intranet, which complements the
existing library.

TAKING STEPS TO RECYCLE SHOES

new products.

THE NUMBER OF ADIDAS STORES IN
BRAZIL OFFERING THE SUSTAINABLE
FOOTPRINT TAKE-BACK SCHEME.

We have already begun building the first steps in the chain
towards closed-loop product by recycling excess pre-market
product, handling large volumes of goods for further distribution
or recycling that failed to meet our quality standards which we
redirect from our distribution centres in Germany. We are now
extending this to post-consumer in-store product take-back.
As we pilot these consumer-facing take-back programmes,
our goal is to bring this approach to markets where established
recycling collection facilities do not exist.
In 2012, adidas Brazil launched Sustainable Footprint, a voluntary
‘take-back and recycle’ programme – the first of its kind in
Brazil. As there were no outlets to recycle local footwear, the
programme aimed to turn footwear waste into a resource to
generate energy for local industry. Consumers who leave old
sports shoes of any brand in designated containers in adidas
stores receive a discount on the purchase of a new pair of adidas
shoes. Donated shoes are processed, before being utilised in the
cement industry to produce local energy.

Donated items collected during seasonal take-back activities are distributed
to individuals or organisations that support microenterprises in developing
countries.

In 2014, adidas America, adidas Originals Iberia and Reebok all
piloted seasonal product take-back campaigns in partnership
with not-for-profit organisations. Customer feedback was
positive, with people reporting that it felt good to donate
their products and treat them as a resource instead of waste.
The donated items were either distributed to individuals or
organisations that support microenterprises in developing
countries, or recycled.
In 2015, we will continue to explore potential partnerships that
bring us closer to closed-loop systems.

Website

Sustainable Footprint is now offered at more than 60 adidas
stores in Brazil. In the coming year, the programme will expand
to include apparel, in partnership with a company that offers the
infrastructure to recycle and reuse textiles and shoes.

SAVING WATER THROUGH
GREY WATER RECYCLING
By recycling used water – known as ‘grey water’ – where it
can, textile manufacturer Far Eastern New Century (FENC)
has reduced the total amount of water it uses to dye fabric.
The company has saved 70 million litres of water this year
– a 12% reduction in water use compared with 2013.
Water resources are limited and should be used responsibly.
FENC, a textile manufacturer based in Taiwan that supplies
fabric to the adidas Group, is doing just that. Through recycling
some of the grey water that has already been used in its dyeing
machines, FENC is reducing the overall amount of water it uses
in its daily operations, thus lessening its impact on the
environment.

Applause for long-term thinking: Installing solar panels at their production site
has helped our supplier Jumbo to avoid more than 250 tonnes of CO2 emissions.

We encourage our suppliers to take responsibility for their
environmental impacts, just as we do. So we were delighted to
see one of our footwear suppliers in Verona, Italy install solar
panels at their production site.
Calzaturificio Jumbo is one of our long-term, strategic suppliers
who we have partnered with since 1983. They are our exclusive
manufacturer of the ‘adilette’ – since 1994, they have produced
more than 20 million pairs of the iconic flip flops with the chunky
moulded sole.
Jumbo was keen to reduce its reliance on power generated
from burning fossil fuels. After research into possible solutions,
they opted to install solar panels on the roofs of their buildings.
In addition to energy savings, solar panels are quiet, low
maintenance and don’t affect the appearance of the site.

At the end of the first screening, the waste water is classified as
either high pollution or low pollution, and stored in separate
pools. The high pollution water undergoes biological and
chemical treatment and filtration, before being transported to a
waste water centre. Here it is further processed to extract any
harmful substances so the water can then be safely released
into the wider environment.
The low pollution water undergoes similar treatment and
filtration. But instead of being disposed of, it is reintroduced into
the production process, to be used for tank cleaning and dark
colour reduction cleaning.
Based on the amount of water used in 2013, Far Eastern New
Century aims to use 15% less water by 2015, and to achieve an
18% reduction by 2016.

In 2014, Jumbo has produced 268,618 kWh of electricity – 90% of
which is used in production. This resulted in 252 tonnes of CO2
emissions avoided, equivalent to the emissions from someone
flying economy class from London to Sydney, Australia and back
again 76 times.
While there were costs involved in installing the system, our
long-term partnership with Jumbo gave them the confidence to
invest, although it will be 12 years before they expect to see a
return on that investment. We applaud their long-term thinking
and commitment to reducing their environmental footprint.

A PARTNERSHIP WITH
GOOD CHEMISTRY
In our quest to become a more sustainable business, we
believe working in collaboration with others to improve the
whole industry to be the most effective way.
Chemical management is one area where collective efforts are
needed. As such, our strategic partnership with bluesign
technologies – announced in June 2014 – represents significant
progress towards transforming the ways chemicals are used in
manufacturing apparel, and reflects our ongoing commitment to
drive sustainable solutions in our supply chain.
bluesign technologies are the acknowledged experts in textile
industry chemical use and the world’s leading provider of
assessment tools for positive chemistry in the textile industry.
The bluesign system, focused on screening and managing
chemical input at the supplier level, yields multiple benefits
including more responsible use of resources, effective
management of restricted substances and the elimination
of hazardous chemicals in the supply chain.
This partnership enables the adidas Group to expand its
chemicals knowledge by accessing world-class chemical
industry expertise. It enhances our existing strong programme
for managing the chemicals in our products by allowing our
suppliers across the world to access the bluefinder – a tool that
contains information on sustainable textile chemistry for all
processes. This in turn will ensure the manufacture of materials
that are more sustainable, and provide assurance for us that our
suppliers are using the best input – bluesign approved –
chemicals.

FOR YEARS, THE ADIDAS GROUP HAS BEEN
RUNNING LEADERSHIP PROGRAMMES IN
THE AREA OF CHEMICAL MANAGEMENT.
THE PARTNERSHIP WITH BLUESIGN
TECHNOLOGIES WILL BRING OUR PROGRAMME
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
Frank Henke, VP Global Social & Environmental Affairs
at the adidas Group

The exciting aspect of the partnership with bluesign
technologies is that it is about real-world, practical guidance on
improvements to the way products are made. Adjustments will
need to be made to production processes – and suppliers need
support in making the necessary modifications – so change will
not happen overnight. But, over time, the vision is for the adidas
Group to have a robust, scientific, facts-based input chemicals
system – one which can become a role model for the apparel
industry.

COALITION WORKING DRIVES
CONSISTENCY AND CHANGE
Since 2010 the adidas Group has been actively involved in the
Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC), a trade organisation
working to reduce the environmental and social impacts of
apparel and footwear products. Through our engagement
we have contributed to the development of the Higg 2.0 Index,
a suite of assessment tools that standardises the measurement
of environmental and social impacts of apparel and footwear
products across the product life cycle and throughout the value
chain. Companies use the index to conduct self-assessments in
three areas – Brand, Product and Facilities – with environmental
and social modules for measuring compliance in each area.
Driven by our ambition to achieve convergence and consistency
of monitoring tools we integrated the Higg 2.0 Index
Environmental Facility Module into our environmental supply
chain work, replacing our current environmental audit tool.
Between February and April 2014 we rolled out the module to
our strategic suppliers.
In 2014, we focused our efforts on the Environmental Facility
Module because of its potential to drive significant change in our
supply chain where most of our environmental impacts occur. At
the same time, we also used the Brand Module to assess our
own performance.

We have contributed to the development of the Higg 2.0 Index, a tool that
standardises the measurement of environmental and social impacts of apparel
and footwear products throughout the value chain.

Feedback so far has been very positive, and will inform the next
phase of the roll out in 2015.
We believe that the process will result in suppliers taking more
responsibility for the issues identified during the assessment.
As more companies adopt the module, it should reduce “audit
fatigue” in shared supplier factories, freeing capacity for them
to implement more sustainable processes that reduce their
impact on the environment.

As we began working with the Environmental Facility Module, we
realised this was the first time many of our suppliers had
conducted a self-assessment on environmental issues. We
therefore collaborated with four other SAC member brands to
produce a ‘How to Higg Manual’ which provided specific
guidance on using the tool and clear explanations of each
question. After translating the manual into several languages,
we made it available for all SAC members to use in the spirit of
true collaboration.

DRIVEN BY OUR AMBITION TO ACHIEVE
CONVERGENCE AND CONSISTENCY OF
MONITORING TOOLS WE INTEGRATED THE HIGG
2.0 INDEX ENVIRONMENTAL FACILITY MODULE
INTO OUR SUPPLY CHAIN WORK. THIS DRIVES
GREATER HARMONISATION AND EFFECTIVELY
TACKLES AUDIT FATIGUE.
Lyn Ip, Senior Director, Environment, Health & Safety for
Global Supply Chains at the adidas Group

In addition to the manual, we prepared supplier-specific training
materials, and held training sessions to ensure suppliers were
well equipped to complete the self assessment.

FIFTEEN YEARS OF
PARTNERSHIP WITH
THE FLA

GREATER DISCLOSURE
IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN

The adidas Group has a long history of collaboration with
partners and engagement with critical stakeholders. One
example is our partnership with the Fair Labor Association
(FLA). It has endured for 15 years and continues to be an
effective means to move our industry to the next level of
promoting and enforcing fair, healthy and safe workplaces.

For many years the adidas Group has applied leadership
disclosure practices in its supply chain. Now we have extended
this approach through our engagement with the Beijing-based
non-governmental organisation, the Institute of Public and
Environmental Affairs (IPE), which is helping us improve the
monitoring of environmental performance within our supply
chain in China.

The FLA is a non-profit organisation made up of socially
responsible corporations, non-governmental organisations and
universities dedicated to protecting workers’ rights around the
world. It requires affiliated companies to meet internationally
recognised labour standards regardless of where their products
are made. The FLA also conducts independent assessments of
each participating company and publishes the results annually
which makes it a strong champion of processes to secure and
protect worker rights.
Since joining the FLA in 1999, more than 300 independent
assessments have been conducted at our suppliers’ factories.
In 2005, the FLA ‘accredited’ our monitoring programme for
the first time, and re-accredited it in 2008. To receive this
accreditation we had to demonstrate substantial compliance
with the FLA’s labour standards throughout our supply chain.
Their decision was based on independent factory monitoring
and verification reports of supplier factories, as well as a full
audit of the monitoring protocols, training programmes and
auditing systems we have established and maintained.

OVER THE COURSE OF ITS 15-YEAR AFFILIATION
WITH THE FLA, THE ADIDAS GROUP HAS
DEMONSTRATED HOW TO BE A RESPONSIBLE
PARTNER IN A MULTI-STAKEHOLDER INITIATIVE,
FROM THE HIGH-LEVEL COMMITMENT OF ITS
SENIOR MANAGEMENT TO ADVANCING THE
FLA’S GOALS, TO ITS DILIGENT FOLLOWTHROUGH ON REMEDIATION WHEN FACTORYLEVEL VIOLATIONS ARE FOUND. WE LOOK
FORWARD TO THE ADIDAS GROUP’S CONTINUED
COMMITMENT AND ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT IN
PURSUIT OF OUR SHARED GOALS OF IMPROVING
WORKING CONDITIONS AND PROTECTING
WORKERS’ RIGHTS.
Claudia Coenjaerts
President/CEO of the Fair Labor Association

IPE seeks to increase environmental disclosure and
transparency and promote public participation in environmental
governance, through tools such as maps showing water and
air pollution levels across China. As a strong advocate of IPE’s
aims, we see a clear benefit in collaborating closely with the
organisation to help drive improvements across the industry.
To this end, we have developed a Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) governing the various aspects of our engagement and
that of our suppliers with IPE, outlining specific roles and
responsibilities of the engagement and making it accessible
to all relevant business units within the adidas Group. We
review and update this document regularly to reflect changes
to IPE’s disclosure programme, and have appointed an internal
IPE Review Coordinator whose remit includes managing and
communicating updates to the SOP.
In addition, we have implemented a more regulated and
proactive engagement cycle with IPE, based on quarterly
meetings. This ensures that we are communicating regularly
about how we are working with our suppliers to make sure that
they are completing the disclosure process correctly and in a
timely manner, and that IPE, in turn, are keeping us informed of
any updates to their database. We are also engaging with IPE on
other issues, including the disclosure of data on their Pollutant
Release and Transfer Register and Detox platforms, which
follows our SOP on Public Information Disclosure.
After the IPE’s recent Corporate Information Transparency Index
(CITI) report, we held a meeting to understand the assessment
process and where we could improve. While they explained their
approach, we also took the opportunity to share with them our
position on several related issues, including our approach to
engaging with our material suppliers.
These open and honest discussions demonstrate that investing
in the partnership and establishing these clear protocols has
built a level of trust that is increasing transparency and will
ultimately improve performance of our suppliers and the wider
industry.
Read more about our disclosure on IPE platforms as part of our
chemical management programme in this report on page 31

In 2015, we look forward to helping strengthen the FLA by
improving the representation of its stakeholder groups and to
working together to develop thought leadership in this area.

THE BANGLADESH ACCORD ON FIRE
AND BUILDING SAFETY: ONE YEAR ON
The 2013 Rana Plaza building collapse is transforming the
garment industry in Bangladesh. In the wake of the incident,
trade unions, NGOs, the International Labour Organization
and international buyers worked together to create the
Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety. This is an
independent, legally binding agreement between brands and
trade unions to work towards a safe and healthy garment
industry. The adidas Group signed the Accord in 2013.

OUR PRIMARY SUPPLIER FACTORIES HAVE
UPGRADED THEIR FIRE AND BUILDING SAFETY
STANDARDS, AND INCREASED THE ATTENTION
GIVEN TO SAFE EVACUATION AND GOOD
HOUSEKEEPING.

At no time did the adidas Group or its licensees have business
relationships with any suppliers operating at the Rana Plaza. In
fact we only have a few primary supplier factories in
Bangladesh, accounting for less than 0.05% of our global
production, so it is not a strategic sourcing country for us.
Nonetheless we saw value in joining the Accord – although we
had already completed independent building safety assessments
at each of our suppliers – because it complements our own
comprehensive monitoring activities on fire safety.
By September 2014, all adidas Group supplier factories
disclosed to the Accord had been assessed for electrical, fire
and building safety. The Accord regularly publishes the results
of the factory safety assessments and the remedial actions
taken on their website to increase transparency and
understanding of safety conditions across the industry.
Steps factories had to take to meet the new safety code include
investing in integrated fire alarm systems, fire doors and
sprinkler systems, and carrying out some remedial building
work. Our primary supplier factories have upgraded their fire
and building safety standards, and increased the attention given
to safe evacuation and good housekeeping.
At the same time, we are currently setting up and training Health
and Safety (HSE) Committees to help build capacity within
factories, and one of our suppliers has already hired a
professional fire safety engineer to lead their HSE Committee.
We believe that empowering workers in this way will result in
greater vigilance and understanding of safety risks. The HSE
committee can then act as a channel to remedy issues.

CLOSING THE GAPS TO IMPROVE
LICENSEE PERFORMANCE
A key challenge the adidas Group faces in ensuring that our
suppliers comply with our Workplace Standards is distance.
This distance can be physical but it can also be a characteristic
of our working relationships, for example when either a core
or specialist product is made under licence. In these cases it is
the licensee that has the business relationship with the
suppliers, not the adidas Group.
Our solution to this challenge is to get everyone focused on
driving greater compliance with our Workplace Standards. We
do this by creating strategic compliance plans (SCPs) for our
licensees, which include a ‘report card’ so they are clear on
which areas need improvement. There is also a version of the
SCP for the business unit that contracted the licensee.
Factory audits or direct complaints from workers through
the SMS worker hotline system can alert us to gaps in the
implementation of our standards. In 2014, for example, we
received a complaint from a factory worker in Pakistan alleging
physical harassment. We met with the complainant and
established that this was not an isolated incident. Our licensee
visited the factory and it became clear that there were some
sizeable gaps in understanding the requirements of our
Workplace Standards. So we worked together with the licensee
to identify an appropriate training programme to improve
factory management’s appreciation of what was expected and to
ensure workers were better placed to raise grievances when
they occurred.
At our annual social compliance meeting with the licensee, we
included specific actions in their strategic compliance plan,
requiring them to look at the root causes of the problem. This
approach aims to ensure that not only is the particular instance
addressed, but that the issue is fixed for the long term.

REPORT CARDS HAVE PROVEN TO BE EFFECTIVE
IN SHORTENING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN OUR
LICENSEES AND OUR BUSINESS ENTITIES.
ULTIMATELY, REPORT CARDS CONTRIBUTE TO
GREATER COMPLIANCE WITH OUR WORKPLACE
STANDARDS.
Chris Buckley, Programme Operations Manager, Social and
Environmental Affairs at the adidas Group

When we sat down with the business unit to review their SCP, we
updated it to focus on how effectively they monitor what the
licensee is doing. Our aim is to see our business units make
compliance with Workplace Standards requirements core
business practice.
Setting strategic compliance plans with the licensee and the
business unit embeds both the management of compliance issues
and the oversight for ensuring they are addressed. By shortening
the distance between all the parties, we are encouraging more
integrated working and a greater degree of self-governance,
which we believe is the best way to achieve sustainable and
ongoing compliance with our Workplace Standards.

REEBOK IS GETTING
KIDS DOING SPORT
To inspire even more involvement, the Reebok Foundation
awarded $1,000 to multiple schools in order to help implement
the BOKS programme.

THERE IS COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS
THE POSITIVE IMPACT EXERCISE CAN HAVE ON
ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND CLASSROOM
BEHAVIOUR.

Through BOKS, thousands of children are provided with opportunities to
participate in physical activity and become part of a greater community.

Sport can change lives beyond the well-known benefits of
improved health and physical fitness. There is compelling
evidence that shows the positive impact exercise can have on
academic achievement and classroom behaviour. Getting kids
to be more active is a global health priority, and Reebok is
taking a leadership role.
BOKS is a free before-school physical activity programme
launched in 2009 that is championed by Reebok and the Reebok
Foundation. Over the past five years, BOKS has grown into a
community-driven worldwide movement; by the end of 2014,
there were BOKS programmes established in more than 1,200
schools in six countries (the US, Japan, South Korea, Canada,
Panama, and India).

EXERCISE IS MEDICINE AND WE OWE IT TO OUR
KIDS TO GIVE THEM A DAILY DOSE.
Kathleen Tullie, BOKS founder

In 2014, Reebok Canada teamed up with the Public Health
Agency of Canada and the Canadian Football League (CFL)
to expand and enhance physical activity in Canadian schools
through the BOKS programme. At present only 5% of Canadian
children between the ages of five and 17 are getting the
recommended 60 minutes of physical activity a day. The goal is
to change this by enlisting more than 450 schools in Canada in
the BOKS programme by 2019.

1,240

NUMBER OF SCHOOLS WITH BOKS
PROGRAMMES BY THE END OF 2014.

In another positive development, the BOKS team has recently
partnered with the American Council on Exercise (ACE) to create
the BOKS Kids Fitness Certificate. Trainers who qualify for the
certificate receive nationally recognised credentials, proving
their knowledge and ability to successfully implement and run
the BOKS programme.

GETTING THE MEASURE OF
OUR SOCIAL PROJECTS
We believe that sports can be an effective way to bring about
social change – a position that has been confirmed by a recent
evaluation of one of our community projects we support in
Brazil. The independent report on our Ginga Social programme
showed that sports-based projects can help young people in
many areas of their lives.

6,970

PEOPLE IN 2014 (FAMILY MEMBERS AND OTHER
COMMUNITY INHABITANTS) PARTICIPATED IN SPORT
ACTIVITIES OFFERED BY GINGA SOCIAL.

In 2011 adidas Brazil teamed up with local NGO Gol de Letra to
create Ginga Social, a sports-based after-school programme for
children and their families. Now active in five cities, Ginga Social
is attended by 1,800 children who participated in the activities on
offer.

SPORT IS IN THE DNA OF OUR COMPANY AND WE
STRONGLY BELIEVE IN ITS POWER TO PROMOTE
SOCIAL CHANGE. THAT VISION LED TO THE
CREATION OF GINGA SOCIAL, WHICH BECAME A
REALITY THROUGH OUR COOPERATION WITH
FUNDAÇÃO GOL DE LETRA.
Gudrun Messias, Sustainability Manager Brazil
at the adidas Group

We commissioned a formal external evaluation of the project in
2014. Covering the five cities where Ginga Social is active, the
evaluation took a qualitative and participative approach, using
workshops and interviews to capture various points of view. This
is the first such evaluation of one of our community projects, and
it successfully helped us reflect on the clarity of the goals,
progress achieved and levels of satisfaction. We will use it as a
model for future evaluations.

MAKE A DIFFERENCE / Sustainability Progress Report 2014

Three years after the start of Ginga Social, an external evaluation of the
project shows that it is having a positive impact on all those participating in the
programme.

Results showed that Ginga Social is having a positive impact on
all those participating in the programme. Students valued the
opportunity to learn different sports and have fun in a positive
environment. They also discovered that respecting and
cooperating with others are crucial elements of sports practice.
Parents recognised that their children are receiving more than
sports training, and credited Ginga Social with improvements in
their behaviour, self-esteem and performance at school. Local
organisations and teams have gained knowledge and skills to
offer more effective sports practices that address young
people’s wider social development.
The main challenges the evaluation identified were around the
need for better training and development of youth monitors, and
how to expand and stabilise attendance. But the overall positive
assessment of Ginga Social led to the programme expanding
into another socially vulnerable community in the suburbs of
Brasilia, the capital of Brazil, in September 2014.
Measuring the impact of social programmes helps make
projects more effective and the results show we can be justly
proud of the difference our support is making to the lives of
these young people.

SUPPLY CHAIN
1. NUMBER OF SUPPLIER FACTORIES

At the end of 2014, we worked with 1,133 independent factories (excluding own factories and factories of our licensees) which
manufacture adidas Group products in 61 countries. 64% of the factories are located in the Asia Pacific region, 23% in the
Americas and 13% in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA).
In the course of any calendar year there can be notable changes in the number of supplier factories we work with, as suppliers are
added or removed. This is because business entities are created, bought or sold by the adidas Group, or intermediaries – such as
agents – are hired or their services are terminated. The data we are reporting here is a snapshot in time, capturing the situation at
the end of 12 months of these movements. Data is presented on a year-on-year basis, as at 31 December.

2. FACTORIES BY COUNTRY

In 2014, a total of 1,133 factories made goods for the adidas Group worldwide, a decrease of 7% compared with 2013, but slightly
more than the total number of manufacturing facilities reported at the end of 2012. The decline is due in part to the decision to
exclude from our list suppliers that are making retail fixtures and support materials.
2014 saw a reduction in the number of suppliers in China and and an exit from Laos. Supplier numbers in Japan also declined
as a result of local sourcing integrations, which are driving greater consolidation. Due to improved disclosure of subcontractor
factories, the number of factories in South Korea expanded further and more factories were added to the supply chain in
Bangladesh where a moratorium on new production was lifted. Although there were factories added to the supply chain in Turkey,
overall supplier numbers in EMEA continued to decline. The number of factories in the Americas increased slightly due to the
onboarding of new US embellishers and Tier 1 suppliers for the Five Ten brand.

3. ADIDAS GROUP LICENSEES

At the end of 2014, the adidas Group worked with 67 licensees whose suppliers manufactured products in 448 factories across
49 countries.
As shown in the table below, there was a significant increase in adidas Group’s external licensing footprint compared to the previous
year. The total number of licensees grew by 18% and their supplier factories by 12%, with the majority of licensees in the hardware
and apparel categories.

5. NUMBER OF TRAINING SESSIONS DIVIDED BY REGION AND TYPE

Overall, the number of training sessions conducted in 2014 declined slightly compared to the previous year, although more
than 2,300 people still attended training sessions. Training offered in each region covered basic, as well as long-term,
strategic topics.
There were two reasons for the drop in the total number of training sessions. Firstly, fewer individual but more group training
sessions (i.e. for more than one supplier) were undertaken, which offers both higher efficiencies and opportunities for crosslearning and best practice sharing among suppliers. Secondly, since sustainability training is based on needs assessments, the
number of fundemental training events in Asia declined and more sustainability training sessions were provided instead.

6. NUMBER OF AUDITS DIVIDED BY REGION AND TYPE

In 2014, the SEA team conducted 1,193 social compliance and environmental audits, using in-house technical staff as well as
external thirdparty monitors, commissioned by adidas Group business entities and licensees.
The total number of initial assessments – the first approval stage for new entry factories – decreased by 18% compared to 2013.
Performance audits for our established suppliers showed a decline of 10%, reflecting the decline in the number of suppliers as well
as extended auditing timelines as more strategic partners move to self-governance. The total number of environmental audits fell
slightly by 4% compared to the previous year. Specific chemical management audits form part of the environmental audits and have
been undertaken as well.
In addition to these audits, compliance staff conducted multiple supplier site visits to discuss specific remedial issues, to follow up
project work or to conduct training sessions.
There were a total of 305 initial assessments (including initial assessment follow-ups), 74% of which were undertaken in Asia with
China accounting for 44% of all assessments conducted. Four initial assessments were conducted for suppliers’ manufacturing
facilities that are under construction in Myanmar, part of a two-year onboarding process for this newly emerging sourcing country.
Brazil received the next largest number of initial assessments, representing 10% of the total carried out. These assessments
represented a programmatic benchmarking of the active Tier 1 (and Tier 2) factories in the Brazilian supply chain in 2014, with initial
assessments replacing usual perfomance audits.
Overall, 46% of all candidate factories were either rejected outright, or were rejected for failure to remediate threshold issues in a
timely manner. For further information, please see data on termination and rejection (Section 12).
A total of 47 % (2013: 51%) of all active suppliers were audited in 2014. High-risk countries in Asia5, the major sourcing region of the
adidas Group, received extensive monitoring in 2014 with an audit coverage that was close to 63%. It is important to mention that our
compliance data base also includes suppliers located in ‘low-risk’ countries as well suppliers designated as ‘low priority’, mainly
referring to subcontractors making non-core components for a finished product. While we include these types of suppliers into our
database to achieve greater visibility of our supply chain, they are currently excluded from our monitoring activities. Consequently,
audit coverage would be higher if only high-risk countries were taken into consideration.
Our monitoring programme is characterised by a risk management approach, which means that we do not envisage 100% audit
coverage in every country where our factories are located. Although there has been a decline in audit coverage in some countries,
the intensity of engagement with factories has increased, particularly in respect of those suppliers with problematic or open
threshold issues, or those in need of support to improve their management systems.

7.	NUMBER OF AUDITS CONDUCTED IN LICENSEE FACTORIES

The number of factories manufacturing goods for licensees has increased steadily, as shown in Section 3 in step with an
expansion in in number of licensees. As a consequence, the number of audits has increased as well.
Please note that below table includes factories that are shared by the adidas Group and licensees and can list audits that are
undertaken in adidas Group factories as well.

8.	NON-COMPLIANCES IDENTIFIED AT SUPPLIER FACTORIES

Our suppliers are evaluated against a number of critical compliance issues. Although zero tolerance issues – such as forced
labour practices – immediately disqualify a factory from further consideration, threshold issues trigger rejection at new
factories, but can be addressed in a specified timeframe at existing factories. The charts in this section illustrate the noncompliances identified during initial assessments and initial assessment follow-up visits to proposed new factories in 2014.

The first chart presents the labour-related non-compliances identified in supplier factories. A supplier must resolve
identified issues before it can be accepted into the adidas Group supply chain. Almost two-thirds of the labour-related
findings fall into the top three broad categories: ‘Wages’, ‘Benefits’ and ‘Working Hours/Overtime’. ‘Wages’ covers – among
other things – policies and practices in the factory for the timely and full payment of wages, overtime payments and
deductions. ‘Benefits’ relates mainly to policies and practices for benefits, social and medical insurances, leave and public
holidays. ‘Working hours/Overtime’ covers management systems for working hours, policies and practices, excessive
working hours, regular and overtime working hours as well as rest days.
Besides identifying non-compliances with our Workplace Standards at factories, the adidas Group compliance team
particularly focuses on the existence and implementation of management systems on the supplier’s side. The team identifies
any gaps in policies and procedures related to specific areas such as forced labour, child labour, freedom of association or
discrimination. As a result, the percentages shown indicate the systemic shortcomings of newly proposed suppliers, rather
than the confirmed presence of specific non-compliances, such as child labour etc. (see also footnote on page 56).
Compared to 2013, there were fewer findings related to working hours/overtime and more findings related to disciplinary
practices.

3	
Child and Juvenile Labour covers management systems, policies and practices to prevent the employment of child labour and the necessary protections for juvenile workers,
if they are of a legal age to work. The 3% shown here mainly points to the lack of effective management systems to prevent child labour or effectively manage juvenile labour.
4 Environment covers waste collection and waste treatment, waste water treatment, emission control.
5 For example, forced/compulsory labour and privacy issues.

The second chart shows the health and safety non-compliances identified in supplier factories. Fire and electrical safety are
critical areas for any potential new supplier and together accounted for 20% of the non-compliances identified in 2014 – 6% below
that recorded for 2013. The way chemicals were stored and used, including the presence of banned chemicals, accounted for 16%
of non-conformances reported. A further 16% of the findings related to management systems, policies and procedures, and
specifically a lack of conformance with our Workplace Standards and expectation for effective health and safety systems, including
the recruitment and retention of qualified safety staff.

9.	KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATOR (KPI) ASSESSMENT, C-RATING AND E-RATING

We audit our suppliers against our Workplace Standards and rate them according to their performance. We have an innovative
way to rate suppliers on their ability to deliver fair, healthy and environmentally sound workplace conditions. Social compliance
ratings show that in 2014, 64% of our direct suppliers were assessed as ‘good’ (3C) or better, and environmental compliance
ratings present a total of 73% of factories rated ‘good’ (3E) or better.

C-KPI Social Compliance Rating

The following table shows the average assessment score by unit of measure for active suppliers. Each unit of measure is scored out
of 100%. We use a parallel system to measure environmental performance, which is described later.
Compared to 2013, the average score of all C-KPI units of measure increased in 2014 as the table below shows.
Generally, newly assessed factories start with a relatively low KPI score, and build and improve their management systems and
compliance performance over a period of years. Despite this, we noticed improvements for all units of measure and the cumulative
score, in line with the fall in percentage of 1C and 2C – and increase in percentage of 3C and 4C – factory clusters.

1	T he calculation method was changed in 2012 to better reflect actual supplier performance. Numbers are calculated using the latest KPI assessment rating of each active supplier.

The following bar graph shows comparable data for the past three years using this rating classification.
In 2014, the number of 1C category suppliers, which represent the lowest performing factories with serious issues and very weak
commitment to compliance, decreased to 2% of the KPI-assessed factories. Such factories are given a one-year grace period to
move up a grade or have their services terminated. During 2014, there was a focused effort to support improvement in 2C factories,
which led to an almost 10% reduction of suppliers in this category compared to 2013.
There has been a corresponding increase in the number of suppliers achieving our minimum expected rating of 3C, with almost half
of all our factories being viewed as good performers. For our main production facilities the number of suppliers achieving 3C was
even higher: 64% of our direct suppliers had ratings of 3C or better, which represents a significant increase of 10%. This means that
we have already achieved our 2015 mid-term goal of 60% of our direct suppliers achieving 3C or better. It is worth noting that the
relative number of factories subject to C-KPI ratings has remained relatively stable at around 45% throughout the past three years.
A parallel environmental KPI tool has been developed for a much smaller pool of selected Tier 1 manufacturing operations and
Tier 2 material suppliers, as described on page 59.

E-KPI and Environmental Compliance Rating

We adopt a risk-based approach to identify those suppliers that need to be enrolled into the adidas Group’s environmental
programme. Instead of covering 100% of the supply chain, we focus our efforts on those suppliers with potentially high
environmental risks and those that represent a significant production volume for the Group.
To evaluate these suppliers’ environmental performance, we have developed the E-KPI rating, which uses the same approach
and methodology as the C-KPI rating for labour compliance. The following table presents the E-KPI performance results from
2012–2014.

Suppliers covered by our environmental compliance programme have shown a steady improvement across most subsections of the
environmental key performance indicators from 2012 to 2014. In addition, the cumulative E-KPI score increased by almost 3%
compared to 2013, reflecting the effort that has been put into working alongside all suppliers under coverage to drive continuous
improvement in their environmental performance.
While there was a slight reduction in the total number of factories audited, overall there has been an upward trend in the E-KPI
scores, with previously low-scoring factories (1E and 2E) moving up to higher E-ratings, and an increase in the number of factories
achieving a 4E score. As a result, a total of 73% of factories were assessed as ‘good’ (3E) or better.

10. INDEPENDENT FLA AUDITS

In 2014, the FLA conducted 16 factory assessments or remediation verification exercises using the methodology from the SCI.
In 2015, the FLA will focus on creating a safe space for thought leadership; putting the Compensation Code Element into practice;
improving the representation of its stakeholder groups; fully implementing the FLA’s Core Programme; and strengthening the
organisational foundation. Additionally, the FLA will explore opportunities for convergence with other multi-stakeholder initiatives
and the work being done to confront the most challenging issues in respect of worker rights.
Since joining the FLA in 1999, more than 300 independent external audits and verification visits have been conducted at adidas Group
suppliers. The number of conventional independent monitoring visits conducted by FLA accredited monitors has gone down over the
years. This is because of a shift from conventional monitoring activities to engaging in value-added FLA projects that focus on
reducing and eliminating chronic non-compliance issues or improving monitoring methodologies.

ENFORCEMENT
11. WARNING LETTERS

Warning letters are an essential part of our enforcement efforts and are triggered when we find ongoing serious non-compliance
issues that need to be addressed by our suppliers. In 2014, we issued a total of 65 warning letters across 13 countries.
The largest number of warning letters continue to be issued in Asia, where more than 60% of all supplier factories are located.
Compared to the previous year, the overall number of first warning letters decreased by more than 10%.The total number of second
warnings decreased substantially in 2014, with only three letters being issued. Suppliers who receive second warning letters are
only one step away from being notified of possible termination of the manufacturing agreement and receive focused monitoring by
the SEA team. The number of third warning letters issued to business partners (which result in factory terminations) grew five-fold
compared to 2013, and consisted mainly of final warnings given to the 1C factories after the designated period, indicating that they
either needed to improve or that the business relationship would be terminated.
It is difficult to generalise about the grounds for a warning letter, as it may be issued for a single unresolved non-conformance, or
for multiple breaches of our Standards. The range of issues that resulted in warning letters in 2014 included poor management
commitment; excessive working hours; non-payment of wages and benefits; poor electrical, fire or chemical safety; poor
communication and transparency problems.

12. TERMINATIONS AND REJECTIONS

We work closely with our suppliers to help them improve their performance. However, where we face situations of severe or
repeated non-compliance, we can and do terminate business relationships with suppliers. In 2014, we terminated agreements
with 13 suppliers for compliance reasons.
We also work closely with the Global Sourcing Organisation and other business entities to pre-screen potential new suppliers. If our
initial assessments uncover threshold or zero tolerance issues, suppliers are rejected.
In 2014, initial assessments were conducted in 226 factories. During 2014, 104 factories were either rejected directly after an initial
assessment due to the identification of zero tolerance issues, or were rejected with a ‘second visit’, due to the identification of one
or more threshold issues, which means that they were rejected but given the chance to remediate non-compliance issues within a
specific timeframe. Overall, the ‘first time rejection rate’ of 46% of all new factories visited was a little higher than the previous year,
although the total number of initial assessments conducted were fewer.
In addition to the ‘first time rejection rate’, we also capture the ‘final rejection rate’. This covers factories directly rejected after
the first visit that have no chance of a second visit, as well as factories rejected after being visited a second time. At the end of
2014 we had a ‘final rejection rate’ of 10%, again slightly higher than in previous years. This shows the importance and impact of
pre-approval screening, and the effort taken by the suppliers to resolve issues and come into conformance with our Workplace
Standards. The remediation of factory issues is beneficial for workers; it raises the bar in terms of better and more timely pay,
improved benefits, reduced hours and the legal protection of formal employment contracts, as well as significant improvements
in basic health and safety within the workplace.
Suppliers who have threshold issues (that is, serious but ‘correctable’ non-compliances) are normally given three months to
remediate those issues before being re-audited for final SEA acceptance. As in previous years, China dominated the number of
new supplier initial assessments, and corresponding rejection rates were high.

13.	CERTIFICATIONS OBTAINED BY ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR SUPPLIER SITES PRODUCING FOR THE INTERNATIONAL
MARKET

In 2014, we worked with 31 athletic footwear suppliers who are certified in accordance with the international environmental
management standard ISO 14001 and/or the workplace health and safety management standard OHSAS 18001. These suppliers
produced around 96% of the adidas Group’s global athletic footwear sourcing volume.
We have limited control over the direct environmental impacts of the manufacturing process and how our suppliers act. The best
way to influence the environmental impacts of our suppliers’ factories is to encourage the introduction of environmental
management systems, and we have made implementing such a system mandatory for all our core suppliers. Achieving certification
to a management system requires factory managers to plan, manage and review their own environmental performance.

In 2014, we again tracked the environmental impact of transporting our goods. Compared to previous years, the modal split
remained quite stable and, overall, the vast majority of our shipments takes place via sea freight. We continue our work to
further reduce the percentage of air freight.

15. REDUCING VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOC)

Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), which are typically found in solvents used in our manufacturing process, can – in a high
concentration – cause breathing difficulties and other health problems for production workers. For this reason, for more than a
decade we have been requesting that our footwear suppliers significantly reduce the use of VOCs in their manufacturing.
By applying innovative and environmentally sound bonding and priming technologies and following the adidas Group guidelines on
the use of chemicals, our athletic footwear suppliers have been able to reduce the use of VOCs from well above 100 grams per pair
to below 20 grams.
2014 has seen our biggest success so far: we achieved an all-time low of 17.5 grams of VOCs per pair. That performance improved in
every single country compared to 2013, reflects hard work and true commitment across our entire manufacturing base.

16. GREEN COMPANY DATA

Since its launch in 2008, the Green Company initiative has undertaken projects to reduce the environmental impact of adidas
Group’s corporate sites. In 2009, we defined ambitious targets for our administration offices, our own manufacturing sites and
our distribution centres, to be achieved by 2015. A selected number of sites, representing around 70-75% of our operations
worldwide, report their progress towards these targets each year. To see a list of of all these sites, please see our Green
Company Performance Analysis 2014 available on our Website.
The Green Company Performance Analysis for 2014, which covers 49 sites, shows that we have already achieved our 2015 targets
for reducing water consumption by 20% per employee, and household waste by 25% per employee. In addition we achieved a
substantial reduction in paper use of 32.3% per person, but need to further intensify our efforts to reach the 2015 target of 50%.
We have also achieved significant energy savings in our distribution centres and our own operations, but weaker performance at our
administration offices has resulted in a total reduction of 12.5% per square metre across all facility types. We therefore need to
continue to drive energy efficiency at our facilities to reach the 20% target. Through energy saving projects and carbon offsetting
certificates, we reduced our net carbon emissions by 27.2% per square metre and are on track to meet the 2015 target of a 30%
saving. However, sufficient access to renewable energies at competitive prices is necessary to further reduce our carbon emissions
but this remains challenging for some of our markets.
We will continue to conduct energy audits at selected sites throughout 2015 to identify additional energy and carbon emissions
reduction opportunities. The greenENERGY Fund, our sustainability venture capital fund for energy efficiency and renewable energy
projects, will remain an important tool to drive energy efficiency and carbon reduction projects and to share best practice between
sites. In 2014 we further expanded the coverage of our ISO 14001 certified EMS. The new central distribution centre in Rieste,
Germany was successfully certified, meaning that 13 sites have now implemented our EMS. Furthermore, in December 2014 we
introduced ‘green retail’ at our new HomeCourt store in Nuremberg, Germany, and extended the Green Company programme to our
retail business. Green Company has proven to be an important initiative of adidas Group’s overall sustainability strategy. We intend
to build on this success and define targets and focus areas for 2020.

Environmental Management Systems

The Green Company initiative, with its ambitious targets for 2015, has been the driver for implementing successful tools that help us
to continuously reduce the environmental impact of our corporate sites. One of them is our shared EMS that is certified according to
the international ISO 14001 standard. In 2014 we extended the EMS to our new central distribution centre in Rieste, Germany. Rieste
is our 13th site worldwide to achieve certification. Our other certified facilities are located in Europe, Canada and the US.
We are proud to have all our brands using the same EMS. This is best practice in the industry and has proved highly effective, as well
as helping us to exceed our initial objective of certifying the five brand headquarters. Central management of the EMS is also
certified, and is located in the adidas Group headquarters in Herzogenaurach, Germany. A list of all certified sites is given in the
table below.

In 2014, the global employee base of the adidas Group has increased further. On 31 December 2014, the Group had 53,731
employees, which represents an increase of 8% versus 49,808 in the previous year. This development is primarily related to the
expansion of the Group’s own-retail store base, particularly in emerging markets globally.
On a full-time equivalent basis, our Group had 45,917 employees on 31 December 2014 (2013: 42,758). Due to the high share of
employees working on a part-time basis in the Retail segment, this figure is lower than the figure reported on a headcount basis.
At the end of 2014, 21% of our Group’s staff were employed in Western Europe (2013: 23%), 33% in European Emerging Markets
(2013: 33%), 24% in North America (2013: 25%), 8% in Greater China (2013: 3%), 6% in Other Asian Markets (2013: 9%) and 8% in
Latin America (2013: 7%).

COMMUNITY AFFAIRS
19. COMMUNITY AFFAIRS STATISTICS
In 2014, we saw an increase in donation requests compared to the previous two years. Donation requests varied significantly
in nature and purpose. All requests were carefully reviewed against the adidas Group Corporate Giving Guidelines to ensure
that we supported those requests that aligned with our policies, guidelines and budget framework.
Compared to 2013, the number of supported projects remained constant, whereas the amount of product donations
decreased slightly. In 2014, we targeted major volumes of our product donations to support people in severe need such as the
refugee camps at the Turkish-Syrian border. Compared to the previous year, we have noted an increase in volunteer hours of
29%, as result of an increasing employee involvement.
With our data tracking system we aim to fully cover activities from all subsidiaries worldwide. We are constantly reviewing
our approach and the system to improve data quality.
