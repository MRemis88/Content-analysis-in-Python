Our activities as a global construction group have an

this impact in order to maximize the benefits for society
and the environment while keeping the negative effects
to a minimum. HOCHTIEF’s goal is to help ensure safety and quality of life for this and future generations and
to preserve our natural habitat. Our sustainability performance and transparent reporting were recognized

Focus Area Sustainable
Products and Services
Reading Station in Reading, UK
Better connections to the capital
Economy: HOCHTIEF Solutions was part of a joint venture that rebuilt and expanded the main station in the
British town of Reading, completing the work in 2014
right on schedule despite the challenge of ongoing rail
services. Five additional platforms, two new station
entrances to the north and south, and new transfer
decks between them were part of the contract in
which HOCHTIEF’s share was around EUR 47 million.
Ecology: The goal was to apply sustainable construction
principles and the highest safety standards to create
infrastructure that doubles the number of commuters
who can take the train.
Community: Reading is a commuter town outside the
capital. Eight hundred trains pass through the new
station every day. With this project, HOCHTIEF helped
meet Reading residents’ growing mobility needs.

Economy: Thiess operates the open pit Duralie mine, situated some 190 kilometers north of Sydney. It
yields around two million metric tons of coal each year, and will be run by our Australian subsidiary until
June 2016.
Ecology: When it comes to sustainability, there are three key issues for the Duralie management team:
protecting surface waters, avoiding dust, and preventing noise. What’s more, parts of the mine have
already been renaturized with trees and bushes.
Community: The nearest neighbors live only a kilometer from the mine. For the people who work and
make their homes in the area, rigorous emission protections are vital. As a result of the rehabilitation, the
earliest spoil tips are now scarcely distinguishable from surrounding land that stayed in its natural state.

State Highway 16 causeway upgrade
in New Zealand
The fast lane to total mobility

Group Management Report

Economy: Leighton is widening a highway near Auckland by 2017. The causeway upgrade is a 4.5 kilometer-long project between the Great North Road Interchange and the Te Atatu Interchange, and is a key
component in completing the Western Ring Route road
of national significance project. The existing six-lane
causeway will be widened to provide additional lanes
in both directions.
Ecology: The causeway will be raised to prevent flooding
during extreme tidal conditions, and stormwater will
be treated to a higher standard before it is discharged
into the Waitemata Harbour. The causeway runs besides the Motu Manawa – Pollen Island Marine Reserve.
Design data has been gathered during the causeway
trial to ensure that the Causeway Upgrade will have as
little impact on the Marine Reserve as possible.
Community: The causeway will improve traffic flow and
travel times, including quicker bus trips and improved
pedestrian and cyclist access across the motorway.

Fan Pier buildings A and B in Boston
Contemporary workplaces in a prime location

Group Management Report

Economy: Turner Construction has erected a building complex in Boston: Fan Pier buildings A and B were
completed in 2013. The 18-story towers are now the
headquarters of a pharmaceuticals company.
Ecology: Over 50% recycled steel was used in construction, and building B has a green roof. The complex affords easy access to public transportation as
well as charging stations for electric cars, so getting
to and from the site does not mean leaving a large carbon footprint. The shell construction has received LEED
Gold certification, and the interior will also seek LEED
rating.
Community: The twin towers are located in the readily
accessible heart of Boston, right on the waterfront.
Floor-to-ceiling windows admit plenty of daylight and
ensure a pleasant working atmosphere.

Financial Review

Operational Statement of Earnings

HOCHTIEF took further action to focus on its core
business in the year under review. Alongside the sale of
activities in the HOCHTIEF Europe division—including
the divestment of formart and a number of peripheral
activities—that action was largely concentrated on the
Leighton business portfolio, with the divestments of
John Holland and of the service business under Leighton
subsidiaries Thiess and Leighton Contractors.
These transactions had a substantial impact on the presentation of earnings and on the earnings figures for the
HOCHTIEF Group. In accordance with IFRS, HOCHTIEF
presents profit after taxes for the 2013 and 2014 fiscal
years separately for continuing operations and discontinued operations. Total profit after taxes generated by
the HOCHTIEF Group is the sum of these two earnings
figures.
Earnings from continuing operations were mainly
impacted in 2014 by the recognition of accounting provisions for credit risk in relation to project receivables at

HOCHTIEF Group sales came to EUR 22.1 billion in
2014. This represented a decrease of EUR 0.4 billion
(2.0%) compared with the prior year (EUR 22.5 billion).
The main factor here was negative exchange rate effects—primarily against the Australian dollar—which reduced sales by a total of EUR 597 million. Adjusted for
exchange rate effects, sales were 1% higher than the
prior-year comparative figure.

total of EUR 142 million to EUR 164 million. By contrast,
deferred taxes for 2014 comprised tax income of EUR
209 million, compared with a tax expense of EUR 137
million in the prior year. A major reason for the tax income
in the year under review was the recognition of deferred
taxes on the risk provisioning at Leighton and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities when the grounds requiring their recognition ceased to exist.

here were the reversal of deferred tax liabilities due to
the grounds requiring their recognition ceasing to exist,
together with the deconsolidation of formart.
Current liabilities showed only a small net change,
increasing by EUR 85 million from EUR 8.0 billion as of
December 31, 2013 to EUR 8.1 billion. The main influencing factor in current financial liabilities comprised
reclassifications of repayment obligations on bonds and
bank loans from non-current liabilities as their remaining term decreased below one year. This resulted in an
increase of EUR 256 million to EUR 982 million. Trade
payables went down by EUR 335 million to EUR 5.5 billion, mainly resulting from the sale of John Holland and
the service business at Leighton. However, this led to a
substantial decrease, which was partly offset by contrary exchange rate effects against the Australian and
the U.S. dollar. Other current liabilities were EUR 400

first time to present a combined Group report. In this, we
have amalgamated the content of our Annual Report and
Sustainability Report in order to document HOCHTIEF’s
environmental, economic, and social performance in
2014. This creates even greater transparency in our reporting and provides a 360-degree view of HOCHTIEF.
By way of guidance for 2015, HOCHTIEF expects an
operational consolidated net profit in the range of EUR
220 million to EUR 260 million.

Earnings
HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft’s sales of EUR 50 million
(2013: EUR 37 million) relate to remuneration for administration and other services, and notably rental and lease
revenue. Other operating income, at EUR 54 million
(2013: EUR 64 million), mainly relates to corporate headquarters charges and reversals of provisions. The yearon-year decline is due to low income from reversals of
provisions. At EUR 94 million, other operating expenses
remained well below the prior-year figure (EUR 185 million). The figures for both fiscal years include effects in
connection with strategic adjustments of business activities. However, the substantially higher prior-year figure
was boosted in particular by the sale of the airport
business. The main factors here were the loss on the
disposal of HOCHTIEF AirPort GmbH and the transaction costs incurred in the sale. The net income from
­fi nancial assets is primarily determined by income from

awards under Australian law for their services on the
Leighton Board. Leighton incurred an expense for this
purpose of EUR 3 thousand for Mr. Fernández Verdes
and EUR 12 thousand for Mr. Sassenfeld.
For his services in Australia as Chairman of Leighton
Holdings Limited, Mr. Fernández Verdes received an
expense allowance of EUR 251 thousand* for 2014. Mr.
Fernández Verdes was additionally granted a one-time
bonus in the form of a long-term incentive plan (stock
appreciation rights) for the company’s restructuring and
strategic realignment. If and only if the share price increases, Mr. Fernández Verdes will receive a payment
that is capped at a share price of AUD 50 per Leighton
share. The stock appreciation rights can be exercised
for three years after a waiting period of two years. No
more than 40% of the stock appreciation rights can be
exercised per year. Their value at the time they were
granted was EUR 3.2 million*. If Leighton’s share price
does not rise above AUD 17.71 during the exercise period, the plan loses its value. If the share price increases by 182%, a maximum of EUR 5.3 million* will become
due per year of the five-year term. This presupposes a
EUR 7,426 million* increase in the value of the company.
Further compensation for the holding of office on the
boards of other companies in which HOCHTIEF has a
direct or indirect interest are either not paid out to the
Executive Board members or are set off against their

Another example of sustainable procurement at Thiess
is the switch from conventional to LED lighting on lighting masts at all Thiess construction sites across Australia. This saved some 500 metric tons of greenhouse
emissions in 2014. Also, under contracts for the procurement of machinery and equipment at Thiess, 98% of
returned tires must be recycled by an accredited opera­
tor. Compliance has been verified in an audit. Not least for
these initiatives, the Supply Chain & Logistics Association of Australia (SCLAA) nominated Thiess as finalist for

Economy: Turner and Flatiron have completed—on time
and on budget, much to the client’s satisfaction—the
Green Build, a terminal expansion at San Diego International Airport. The project has already received a series
of awards—including LEED Platinum certification.
Ecology: Its sustainable features include a solar power
system that meets 12.5% of the building’s total energy
requirements. Natural light replaces artificial sources
wherever possible. The building was constructed largely
from recycled materials.
Community: At peak times, over 1,000 workers including
many employees of local female-owned and minorityowned businesses were busy at the construction site.
The airport expansion will continue to bolster the labor
market in the future as well, with passenger numbers
expected to almost double by 2030.

The GHG Protocol Corporate
Standard categorizes companies’ direct, indirect and extended emissions into three
“scopes”:
Scope 1 includes all direct
sources of emissions that are
owned or controlled by the
company (such as carbon
emissions from HOCHTIEF
­vehicles).
Scope 2 includes all indirect
emissions from the company’s
consumption of energy (electricity, district heating).
Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions that arise in the
company’s value chain and thus
similarly fall within its scope of
responsibility (such as carbon
emissions from use of materials
by HOCHTIEF subcontractors).

OUR
CARE
Economy: New healthcare properties are being built across the globe. Many of them are the work of
HOCHTIEF—including this one in Perth, Australia. John Holland, a subsidiary of our Australian Group
company Leighton, is constructing a state-of-the-art, 298-bed children’s hospital slated for completion
in 2015.
Ecology: The hospital has an Ecologically Sustainable Design strategy, with features including an active
facade that reacts to temperature changes.
Community: The new Perth Children’s Hospital replaces the city’s old facility and will offer 20% more beds
as well as a far greater number of operating theaters. The result: a significant improvement in the medical
infrastructure in Australia’s fourth largest metropolis, and tertiary level paediatric health services.

Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 25

Notes to the consolidated financial
statements
Accounting policies
General information
The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) as adopted by the EU and with supplementary provisions of German commercial law applicable under Section
315a (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). The same accounting policies applied in the prior year.
Alongside the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the
Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Consolidated Financial Statements also include a Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. Segment reporting is provided in these Notes.
For purposes of clarity, a number of items are combined in the Balance Sheet and in the Statement of Earnings.
These items are broken down into their constituents and commented on elsewhere in these Notes. The Statement
of Earnings is presented using the nature of expense method of analysis.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in euros.
As an independent listed group, HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen, Germany, publishes its own consolidated
financial statements, which are also included in the consolidated financial statements of ACS Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A., Madrid, Spain (ACS).
The Consolidated Financial Statements relate to the 2014 fiscal year, comprising the reporting period from January 1
to December 31, 2014.
The Executive Board of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft released the financial statements for publication on February 24, 2015. They will be approved at the Supervisory Board meeting on February 25, 2015.
Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and all significant domestic and foreign
subsidiaries in which it directly or indirectly holds the majority of voting rights. This generally goes hand in hand
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

with a majority shareholding. Three companies are consolidated by virtue of contractual arrangements. Significant
associates and jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method. Companies in which HOCHTIEF
Aktiengesellschaft holds a majority of voting rights but over which it exercises joint control by contractual arrangement with other owners are likewise accounted for using the equity method unless classified as joint operations.
Holdings in subsidiaries or associated companies or jointly controlled entities deemed to be of minor overall significance from a Group perspective are not consolidated and are accounted for in accordance with IAS 39.
The list of subsidiaries, associates, and other equity interests held by the HOCHTIEF Group (pursuant to Section 313 (2) 1-4 of the German Commercial Code) is published in the electronic Bundesanzeiger (Federal Official
Gazette). The main consolidated subsidiaries, equity-method investments, and joint operations are listed on pages
254–255.
A number of the subsidiaries included in the Consolidated Financial Statements make partial use of the exempting
provisions in either Section 264 (3) or Section 264b of the German Commercial Code. A list of the companies that
make use of these exemptions is included on page 253.

Group Report 2014

The Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2014 include HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and a total
of 58 German, 412 foreign consolidated companies and, as in the prior year, five special-purpose funds. The number
of consolidated companies showed a decrease of 13 over the previous year. Two German and 45 foreign companies
were consolidated for the first time in 2014. The additions are mainly in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division (30), the
HOCHTIEF Europe division (8), and the HOCHTIEF Americas division (7). The majority are project companies. Eighteen
domestic and 42 foreign companies have been removed from the consolidated group. Most of the companies removed from the consolidated group were in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division (37) and the HOCHTIEF Europe
division (21). Those in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division mainly relate to the disposal of John Holland Group as
well as the Thiess and Leighton Contractors service business. Those in the HOCHTIEF Europe division primarily
relate to the sale of shares in residential developer formart. An entity is generally added to or removed from the
consolidated group at the time the equity stake in the entity is acquired or disposed of.
Sixty-one affiliated companies of minor overall significance to the Group’s financial position and results of operations were not consolidated in the year under review. Their combined sales represented less than 1% of consolidated sales.
Nineteen domestic and 174 foreign associates were accounted for using the equity method. This number showed
a decrease of 93, with 29 companies added and 122 removed. The additions are mainly in the HOCHTIEF Asia
Pacific division (19) and the HOCHTIEF Americas division (7). The companies removed from the consolidated group
were mostly accounted for by the reclassification of 74 equity-method jointly controlled entities as joint operations
in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division. Due to their minor overall significance, a further 21 companies were not
accounted for using the equity method.
Fifty-six joint operations in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements
on a proportionate basis. Following the reclassification of 74 equity-method jointly controlled entities, 27 entities
were added and 45 removed in the reporting year.
A total of EUR 98,732 thousand was expended in 2013 under asset deals and for purchases of companies con­
solidated for the first time; for EUR 19,797 thousand, the expenditure was made in cash.

A total of EUR 187,396 thousand in goodwill was recognized on acquisitions in 2014.
Consolidation policies
The financial statements of domestic and international companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements
are prepared in accordance with uniform Group accounting principles. All business combinations (acquisitions) are
accounted for using the acquisition method. Business combinations are measured at the acquisition date by allocating the consideration given to the acquired subsidiary’s net assets measured at fair value. Transaction costs
arising in connection with such acquisitions are recognized directly as expense. All assets, liabilities, and contingent
liabilities of an acquired subsidiary that satisfy the recognition criteria are measured at full fair value regardless of
any minority interest. Intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill if they are separable from the
accounting entity or arise from contractual or other legal rights. Any goodwill then left is recognized as an asset.
Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested instead for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 on an annual basis and
whenever there are indications that it may be impaired. Negative goodwill arising on initial measurement is recognized immediately in income. On divestment, a pro rata share of the divesting division’s goodwill is taken into
­account when measuring disposal proceeds.
Goodwill increased by EUR 53,473 thousand in the year under review, from EUR 613,204 thousand to EUR
666,677 thousand.
Income, expenses, receivables, and liabilities between consolidated companies are eliminated. Unrealized intercompany profits and losses are eliminated unless they are of minor significance. Any impairment losses recognized for
consolidated companies in their separate financial statements are reversed.
The same policies apply for equity-method investments. These include the Group’s associates and jointly controlled
entities. Any goodwill increases the carrying amount of an investment. Like other goodwill, goodwill on equity-method
investments is not amortized. Reductions in carrying amount due to impairment are reported in the share of profits
and losses of equity-method associates and jointly controlled entities. The financial statements of all equity-method

investments are prepared in accordance with uniform Group accounting and valuation principles.

The stake in aurelis Real Estate GmbH & Co, KG in the HOCHTIEF Europe division was sold in 2014. A breakeven
amount was recognized on deconsolidation. The sale proceeds were settled entirely in cash.
Discontinued operations
In accordance with its strategic alignment, HOCHTIEF Group company Leighton Holdings entered into binding
agreements for the sale of John Holland Group as well as Thiess Services and Leighton Contractors Services in
December 2014.
John Holland Group
On December 12, 2014, Leighton Holdings signed an agreement for the 100% sale of its subsidiary John Holland
Group, Melbourne, Australia (JHG) to CCCC International Holding Limited, Beijing, China. The EUR 491,665 thousand proceeds on the sale, combined with amounts recognized on remeasurement (EUR 726 thousand), significantly exceeds the carrying amount of EUR 204,749 thousand, resulting in a disposal gain of EUR 287,642 thousand. In the period January 1, 2014 to December 12, 2014, the discontinued operations accounted for sales of
EUR 2,168,544 thousand and profit after taxes—excluding the actual disposal gain—of EUR 24,798 thousand.
Thiess Services and Leighton Contractors Services
On December 17, 2014, Leighton Holdings announced the signing of an agreement for the sale of 50% of its activities in Thiess Services, Brisbane, Australia, and Leighton Contractors Services, Sydney, Australia, (Services) with
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

the establishment of a joint venture with subsidiaries of Apollo Global Management, LLC. The purchase price receivable amounts to EUR 430,120 thousand. Taking into account the remeasurement of the remaining shares at
fair value (EUR 154,373 thousand) and amounts recognized on remeasurement (EUR 5,072 thousand) as well as
a carrying amount of EUR 216,218 thousand, the outcome was a gain of EUR 373,347 thousand. From January 1,
2014 to December 17, 2014, the discontinued Services operations accounted for sales of EUR 1,520,223 thousand
and profit after taxes of EUR 104,223 thousand excluding the disposal gain.

In their separate financial statements, Group companies disclose transactions denominated in foreign currency using
the average exchange rate on the day of recording the transaction. Exchange gains or losses up to the reporting
date on the measurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets or liabilities are included in other operating income or other operating expenses at the average exchange rate on the reporting date. Currency translation
differences relating to a net investment in a foreign company are accounted for in accumulated other comprehensive income until the company is sold. This includes foreign currency receivables from fully consolidated Group com-

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

panies for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future and which therefore resemble equity.
Financial statements of foreign companies are translated by applying the functional currency approach. As all companies outside the euro area operate autonomously in their own national currencies, their balance sheet items are
translated into euros using the average exchange rate prevailing on the reporting date in accordance with official
requirements. The same method is used to translate the shareholders’ equity of equity-method foreign associates
following equity-method adjustment. Differences from the previous year’s translated amount are recognized in other
comprehensive income and are reversed to income or expense on sale of the equity interest. Goodwill of commercially independent foreign Group entities is translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the reporting date. Income
and expense items are translated into euros using the annual average exchange rate.
Accounting policies
Intangible assets are reported at amortized cost. All intangible assets have a finite useful life with the exception
of company names recognized as assets on initial consolidation and excepting goodwill. Intangible assets include
concessions and other licenses with useful lives of up to 30 years. These are amortized according to the pattern of
consumption of economic benefits. They also include future earnings from additions to the order backlog arising
from business acquisitions; these are amortized over the period in which the corresponding work is billed. Intangible
assets further encompass software for commercial and engineering applications, which is amortized on a straightline basis over three to five years, and entitlements to various financing arrangements with banks amortized over
terms of up to 98 months in accordance with the term of the arrangement. Estimated useful lives and amortization
methods are reviewed annually.
Company names and goodwill are not amortized. They are tested instead for impairment in accordance with IAS
36 on an annual basis and whenever there are indications that they may be impaired. The company names recognized as intangible assets in the HOCHTIEF Americas and HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific divisions are recognized with an
indefinite useful life as they do not have a product life cycle and are not subject to technical, technological, or commercial depletion or any other restriction.
Capitalized development costs in the HOCHTIEF Group are reported in intangible assets as licenses and amortized on a straight-line basis over three to five years.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at depreciated cost. Only amounts directly attributable to an item of
property, plant or equipment are included in its cost. Borrowing costs are included in cost in the case of qualifying
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

assets. Property, plant and equipment is normally depreciated on a straight-line basis except in the contract mining business, where depreciation is mostly recognized on an activity basis.
Items of property, plant, machinery and equipment typically encountered in the HOCHTIEF Group are depreciated
on a straight-line basis over the following uniform useful lives:
No. of years
Buildings and investment properties
Technical equipment and machinery; ­transportation equipment
Other equipment and office equipment

20–50
3–10
3–8

Estimated useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed annually.

Group Report 2014

179

Items of property, plant and equipment on finance leases are recognized at fair value or the present value of the
minimum lease payments, whichever is lower, and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated
useful life or over a shorter contract term if applicable.
Investment properties are stated at amortized cost. Transaction costs are included on initial measurement. The
fair values of investment properties are disclosed in the Notes. They are assessed using internationally accepted
valuation methods, such as taking comparable properties as a guide to current market prices or by applying the
discounted cash flow method. Like property, plant and equipment, investment properties are normally depreciated
using the straight-line method.
Impairment losses are recognized for intangible assets (including goodwill), property, plant and equipment, or
investment properties if their recoverable amount falls below their carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an
asset or cash-generating unit is normally defined as net selling price or value in use, whichever is higher. Impairment testing may require assets and in some cases liabilities to be grouped into cash-generating units. For goodwill, impairment testing is performed on cash-generating units corresponding to the HOCHTIEF divisions that
feature in segmental reporting. For any asset that is part of an independent cash-generating unit, impairment is
determined with reference to the recoverable amount of the unit. If the recoverable amount of a cash-generating
unit falls below its carrying amount, the resulting impairment loss is allocated first to any goodwill belonging to the
unit and then to the unit’s other assets, normally pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset. Except in the case of goodwill, impairment charges are reversed (up to a maximum of amortized cost) when the impairment ceases to exist.
A joint arrangement is an arrangement of which two or more parties have joint control. The parties to a joint
arrangement classify it as a joint operation or a joint venture depending on their respective rights and obligations.
In a joint operation, the parties have direct rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the
arrangement. Each party recognizes assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, together with its share of such
items held or incurred jointly, relative to the HOCHTIEF Group’s rights and obligations. In a joint venture, where the
parties have rights to the net assets of the arrangement, the parties each account for their interests in the joint
venture using the equity method.
Equity-method investments are stated at cost, comprising the acquired equity interest in an associate or jointly
controlled entity plus any goodwill. The carrying amount is increased or decreased annually to recognize the Group’s
share of after-tax profits or losses, any dividends, and other changes in equity. The full carrying amount is tested
for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 whenever there are indications that it may be impaired. If the recoverable
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

amount of an equity-method investment is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the
difference. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss.
All other financial assets, comprising interests in non-consolidated subsidiaries, other participating interests, and
non-current securities, are classed as held for sale and are measured at fair value where a fair value can be reliably
estimated. In the case of publicly listed financial assets, fair value is determined as the market price. If there is no
active market, fair value is calculated using the most recent market transactions or a valuation method such as the
discounted cash flow method. In cases where fair value cannot be measured reliably, financial assets are reported at
cost (less any impairments). Initial measurement is performed as of the settlement date. Unrealized gains or losses
are accounted for, after adjusting for deferred taxation, in other comprehensive income and are reversed to income
or expense on disposal of the asset. If there is objective evidence of impairment, the carrying amount of an asset is
reduced and the impairment loss recognized as an expense. Such evidence includes a significant or prolonged
decline in fair value below cost.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Receivables and other assets are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method (accounting for factors such as premiums and discounts). An impairment loss is recognized if there is any objective material
evidence that a financial asset may be impaired. Such evidence for impairment includes, for example, downgrading of a debtor’s credit rating and related interruptions in payment or potential insolvency. Impairment losses are
recognized according to actual credit risk. “Receivables” comprise financial receivables, trade receivables, and
other receivables. Sales are shown net of VAT and other taxes and expected reductions such as trade discounts
and rebates. Sales of goods are recognized when:
• The significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer
• The HOCHTIEF Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with
ownership nor effective control over the goods sold
• The amount of revenue and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured
reliably
• It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the HOCHTIEF Group.
Revenue from transactions involving the rendering of services is recognized by reference to the stage of completion. Revenue under construction contracts is recognized as described below.
Long-term loans are stated at amortized cost. Loans yielding interest at normal market rates are reported at face
value, and non-interest-bearing and low-interest-bearing loans are discounted to present value. Discounting is always
done using a risk-adjusted discount rate.
Construction contracts are reported using the percentage of completion (POC) method*. Cumulative work done
to date, including the Group’s share of net profit, is reported under sales on a pro rata basis according to the per-

centage completed. The percentage of completion is measured by reference to the stage of completion; that is, as
the ratio of performance delivered up to the end of the reporting period to total contract performance. Construction contracts are reported in trade receivables and trade payables, as “Gross amount due from/to customers for/
from contract work (POC).” If cumulative work done to date (contract costs plus contract net profit) of contracts in
progress exceeds progress payments received, the difference is recognized as an asset and included in amounts
due from customers for contract work. If the net amount after deduction of progress payments received is negative, the difference is recognized as a liability and included in amounts due to customers from contract work. Anticipated losses on specific contracts are accounted for on the basis of the identifiable risks. Construction contracts
handled by construction joint ventures are also accounted for using the POC method. Trade receivables from construction joint ventures include pro rata entitlements to contract net profit. Anticipated losses are immediately recognized in full in contract net profit. Contract income on construction contracts undertaken by the Group indepenConsolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

dently or in construction joint ventures is recognized in accordance with IAS 11 as the income stipulated in the
contract plus any claims and variation orders. Construction contract receivables are realized as part of the HOCHTIEF
Group’s operating cycle. In accordance with IAS 1, they are therefore included in current assets even though they
are not expected to be realized within twelve months of the balance sheet date.
The POC method is used primarily in the mainstream construction business, construction management, and
contract mining.

Deferred taxes arising from temporary differences between the IFRS accounts and the tax base of individual
Group companies or as a result of consolidation are recognized as separate assets and liabilities. Deferred tax
assets are also recognized for tax refund entitlements resulting from the anticipated use of existing tax loss carryforwards in subsequent fiscal years provided it is sufficiently certain that they will be realized. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are offset within each company or group. Deferred taxes are measured on the basis of tax rates applying or expected to apply in each country when they are realized. For domestic operations, as in the prior year, a
tax rate of 31.5% is assumed taking account of corporate income tax plus the German “solidarity surcharge” and
the average rate of municipal trade tax faced by Group companies. For all other purposes, deferred taxes are
measured on the basis of the tax regulations in force or enacted at the reporting date.
Inventories are initially stated at cost of purchase or production. Production cost includes costs directly related to
the units of production plus an appropriate allocation of materials and production overhead, including productionrelated depreciation charges. Borrowing costs for inventories that are qualifying assets are capitalized as part of
cost. Most materials and supplies are measured on a FIFO or moving-average basis. Inventories are written down
to net realizable value if their recoverable amount is less than their carrying amount at the reporting date. If the recoverable amount of inventories subsequently increases, the resulting gain must be recognized. This is done by
reducing materials expense.
All marketable securities are classed as held for sale and measured at fair value. They mainly comprise securities held in special-purpose and general investment funds as well as fixed-income securities with a residual term of
more than three months at the time of acquisition and where there is no intention to hold the securities to maturity.
Initial measurement is performed as of the settlement date and includes any transaction costs directly attributable
to the acquisition of the securities. Unrealized gains or losses are reported in other comprehensive income and are
reversed to income or expense on disposal. If there is objective evidence of impairment, the carrying amount of an
asset is reduced and the impairment loss recognized as an expense. Such evidence includes a significant or prolonged decline in fair value below cost.
Cash and cash equivalents consist of petty cash, cash balances at banks, and marketable securities with maturities of no more than three months at the time of acquisition that are subject to insignificant risk of changes in
value.
Discontinued operations along with non-current assets held for sale and associated liabilities are meas­
ured in accordance with IFRS 5 and presented separately in the current section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
To be classed as assets held for sale, assets must be available for immediate sale and their sale must be highly
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

probable. Assets held for sale can be individual non-current assets, groups of assets held for sale (disposal groups),
or discontinued operations. A component of an entity is a discontinued operation if it represents a separate major
line of business or geographical area of operations and is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a major
line of business or geographical area of operations, or if it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
Liabilities disposed of with assets in a single transaction are part of a disposal group or discontinued operation.
Non-current assets held for sale cease to be depreciated or amortized, and are measured at their carrying amount
or at fair value less costs to sell, whichever is lower. Gains or losses arising on the measurement of individual assets
held for sale or of disposal groups are reported in the Statement of Earnings under results from continuing operations until their ultimate disposal. Conversely, gains or losses arising on the measurement of discontinued operations
at fair value less costs to sell, profits or losses of discontinued operations, and gains or losses on their disposal are
presented separately in the Statement of Earnings under results from discontinued operations. Cash flows from
discontinued operations are presented in the Notes. In all other respects, the information in the Notes relates to continuing operations unless direct reference is made to discontinued operations. Prior-year information has been
restated accordingly.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Share-based payment transactions are measured in accordance with IFRS 2, Stock option plans are accounted
for Group-wide as cash-settled share-based payment transactions. Provisions for obligations under the Long-term
Incentive Plans, the Top Executive Retention Plans, and the Retention Stock Award Plans are recognized in the
amount of the expected expense that is or was spread over the stipulated waiting period. The fair value of stock
options is measured using generally accepted financial models, the value of the plans being determined with the
Black/Scholes option pricing model. The specific problem of valuing the plans in question is solved using binomial
tree methods. The computations are performed by an outside appraiser.
Provisions for pensions and similar obligations are recognized for current and future benefit payments to
active and former employees and their surviving dependants. The obligations primarily relate to pension benefits,
partly for basic pensions and partly for optional supplementary pensions. The individual benefit obligations vary
from one country to another and are determined for the most part by length of service and pay scales. The Turner
Group’s obligations to meet healthcare costs for retired staff are likewise included in pension provisions due to their
pension-like nature.
Provisions for pensions and similar obligations are computed by the projected unit credit method. This determines
the present value of future entitlements, taking into account current and future benefits already known at the reporting date plus anticipated future increases in salaries and pensions and, for the Turner Group, in healthcare costs.
The computation is based on actuarial appraisals using biometric accounting principles. Plan assets as defined in
IAS 19 are shown separately as deductions from pension obligations. Plan assets comprise assets transferred to
pension funds to meet pension obligations, shares in investment funds purchased under deferred compensation
arrangements, and qualifying insurance policies in the form of pension liability insurance. If the fair value of plan
assets is greater than the present value of employee benefits, the difference is reported—subject to the limit in IAS
19—under other non-current assets.
Remeasurements of defined benefit plans are recognized directly in other comprehensive income in the period
during which they arise. The current service cost is reported under personnel costs. The net interest component,
comprising the interest element of the increase in pension obligations less expected returns on plan assets (each

Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

calculated using the discount rate for the pension obligations), is reported in net investment and interest income.

Group Report 2014

Tax provisions comprise current tax obligations. Income tax provisions are offset against tax refund entitlements
if they relate to the same tax jurisdiction and are congruent in nature and reporting period.
Other provisions account for all identifiable obligations as of the reporting date that result from past business
transactions or events but are uncertain in their amount and/or settlement date. Provisions are stated at the estimated settlement amount, i.e. after making allowance for price and cost increases, and are not offset against any
rights to reimbursement. For obligations with a settlement probability exceeding 50%, the provision amount is calculated on the basis of the most likely settlement outcome. A provision can only be recognized on the basis of a
legal or constructive obligation toward third parties. Long-term provisions are stated at the present value of the
estimated settlement amount as of the reporting date and are reported under non-current liabilities.
Liabilities are reported at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method (accounting for factors such as
premiums and discounts). Finance lease liabilities are initially recognized at fair value at the inception of the
lease or the present value of the minimum lease payments, whichever is lower.
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value regardless of their purpose and reported under other
receivables and other assets or other liabilities. Initial measurement is as of the settlement date. All derivative financial instruments are measured on the basis of current market rates as of the balance sheet date. The recognition
of changes in fair value depends on the purpose for which a derivative is held. Derivatives are only ever used in the
HOCHTIEF Group for hedging purposes. Hedges are structured for maximum effectiveness. A cash flow hedge is
a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows from a hedged item, as with the hedging of variable rate loans
to counter variations in payment amounts due to interest rate changes. Unrealized gains and losses are initially recognized in equity, taking account of deferred taxes. The portion of the changes in value initially recognized in equity is
reclassified to income or expense as soon as the hedged item is recognized in income or expense. If a hedged
planned transaction subsequently results in recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, gains or losses
recognized in equity in the meantime are reclassified to income or expense in the period when the financial asset
or financial liability affects income. If a hedged planned transaction subsequently results in recognition of a nonfinancial asset or liability, gains or losses recognized in equity in the meantime are taken out of equity and subtracted
from or added to the initial cost of the asset or liability. In the cases described, only the portion of changes in value
that are determined to be effective for hedging purposes are recognized in equity. The ineffective portion is recognized directly as income or expense. In the HOCHTIEF Group, only cash flow hedges are currently recognized.
Derivatives are also used for economic hedging purposes where no hedge accounting is applied. In such cases,
changes in fair value are recognized in income or expense.
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

Contingencies, commitments, and other obligations are possible or current obligations, based on past transactions, that are unlikely to lead to an outflow of resources. They are disclosed separately and are not included in
the Balance Sheet unless assumed in the course of a business combination. The amounts stated for contingent
liabilities reflect the extent of the liabilities as of the reporting date.

Group Report 2014

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Judgments made by management in applying the accounting policies primarily relate to the following
­issues:
• Leases must be assessed to determine whether the substantial risks and rewards of beneficial ownership transfer
to the lessee.
• Securities may be grouped in different categories.
• Assets earmarked for sale must be assessed to confirm that they are available for immediate sale and their sale
is highly probable. If the result of this assessment is positive, they and any liabilities to be disposed of in the same
transaction must be reported and accounted for as assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held
for sale.
• It is necessary to determine whether construction revenue is accounted for under IAS 11 or IAS 18.
The decision made by the HOCHTIEF Group for general application in each instance is set out under Accounting
Policies in these Notes.
Preparation of the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements requires Group management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and disclosures of
contingencies, commitments, and other obligations, The main estimates and assumptions relate to the following:
• Assessing projects on a percentage of completion basis, in particular with regard to accounting for change orders,
the timing of profit recognition, and the amount of profit recognized.
• Estimating the economic life of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and of investment properties.
• Accounting for provisions.
• Testing goodwill and other assets for impairment.
• Testing deferred tax assets for impairment.
All estimates and assumptions are based on current circumstances and appraisals. Forward-looking estimates
and assumptions made as of the balance sheet date with a view to future business performance take account of
circumstances prevailing on preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and future trends considered
realistic for the global and industry environment. Actual amounts can vary from the estimated amounts due to
changes in the operating environment that are at variance with the assumptions and lie beyond management control. If such changes occur, the assumptions and, if necessary, the carrying amounts of affected assets and liabili-

New accounting pronouncements
Adoption by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) of amendments to IFRS pronouncements and of
new IFRS pronouncements has resulted in changes to accounting policies in those instances where the pronouncements have been adopted by the EU and their application is mandatory for the reporting period January 1
to December 31, 2014.
Changes in IFRS affecting the HOCHTIEF Group are as follows:
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and IFRS 12 Disclosure of
Interests in Other Entities, in conjunction with Amendments to IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements
and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures as well as Amendments since made to IFRS
10, IFRS 11, and IFRS 12:
IFRS 10 replaces the previous control approach in IAS 27 and SIC-12 with a uniform approach applicable to all
business combinations. The rules for separate financial statements remain in IAS 27. The new control approach
has three elements:
• Power over the investee
• Variable returns
• Ability to use the power over the investee to affect the amount of the variable returns.
IFRS 11 replaces IAS 31 and abolishes proportionate consolidation. The core principle of IFRS 11 is the rule that a
party to a joint arrangement classifies the arrangement either as a joint operation or a joint venture by assessing
its rights and obligations arising from the arrangement. With a joint operation, each party accounts for the assets,
liabilities, revenues, and expenses relating to its interest in the joint operation, together with its share of such items
held or incurred jointly, in accordance with the applicable IFRSs. With a joint venture, each party accounts for its
investment in the joint venture using the equity method in accordance with the amended IAS 28.
IFRS 12 brings together the revised disclosures under IFRS 10, IFRS 11, IAS 27, and IAS 28 in a separate stand­
ard.
The amended standards all apply for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014. They were endorsed
by the EU in December 2012 and April 2013. First-time application of IFRS 11 resulted in reclassifications of equitymethod jointly controlled entities to joint operations, primarily concerning the following companies in the HOCHTIEF

Consolidated Financial Statements

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

Group Report 2014

189

The remaining IFRS pronouncements applicable in the fiscal year had no material impact on the HOCHTIEF Consolidated Financial Statements:
• Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, and IFRS
12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities: Investment Entities
• A mendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation: Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities
• Amendments to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement: Novation of Derivatives
and Continuation of Hedge Accounting
• IFRIC 21 Levies
Other new accounting pronouncements issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the
IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) take the form of standards and interpretations that affect the HOCHTIEF
Consolidated Financial Statements but do not have to be applied for the 2014 fiscal year and in some cases have
not yet been endorsed by the EU:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: After publishing the three phases of the new standard over the last few years, the
IASB published the final version of IFRS 9 in July 2014. The new standard notably introduces major changes relat­
ing to the classification and measurement of financial assets, with classification to be based on the type of business
model and on contractual cash flows. In the same connection, impairment assessment is extended from an incurred loss model to an expected loss model. A new hedge accounting model is also introduced that aims to bring
hedge accounting more closely into line with the risk management activities of the entity.
The complete overhaul of IAS 39 with the publication of IFRS 9 results in additional disclosures.
The standard is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Initial application is retrospective,
although transitional provisions apply. Earlier application is permitted. EU endorsement is still pending. On current
assessment, the new standard will result in a reclassification of financial assets in the HOCHTIEF Group. The new
rules on financial liabilities will probably have no material effect on the HOCHTIEF Group. Further implications of
IFRS 9 and its additional provisions cannot be assessed until final endorsement by the EU.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: The IASB issued this new standard in May 2014 with the
objective of bringing together in one standard the rules on revenue recognition previously contained in various different standards and interpretations. IFRS 15 applies across all sectors to revenue from all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of other IFRSs, such as leases, insurance contracts, and financial inConsolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

struments. Revenue recognition is carried out with regard to both timing and amount by applying the following five
steps:
(1)

Identify the contracts with a customer

(2)

Identify the performance obligations in the contract

(3)

Determine the transaction price

(4)

Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract

(5)

Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation

Alongside this five-step model, IFRS 15 includes an array of further provisions, such as on contract modifications
and additional notes disclosures. The revised IFRS 15 applies for annual periods beginning on or after January 1,
2017; earlier application is permitted. EU endorsement is still pending. With regard to the HOCHTIEF Consolidated
Financial Statements, it is assumed on current assessment that the new standard will lead to changes in revenue
recognition and additional notes disclosures. The effects of IFRS 15 cannot be finally assessed until final endorsement by the EU.

Group Report 2014

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and
Joint Ventures: In “Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture” published
in September 2014, the IASB clarifies that recognition of a gain or loss on the sale or contribution of assets depends
on whether the assets constitute a business as defined in IFRS 3. When a transaction involves a business, the investor recognizes a full gain or loss. When a transaction involves the sale of assets that do not constitute a business, a partial gain or loss is recognized. The amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 apply for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016; earlier application is permitted. EU endorsement is still pending. On current
assessment, the amendments will have no material impact on the HOCHTIEF Consolidated Financial Statements.
Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: In “Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations”
published in May 2014, the IASB clarifies that the acquisition of an initial or additional interest in a joint operation
when the operation constitutes a business as defined in IFRS 3 should be accounted for using the principles related to business combinations in IFRS 3 and other standards with the exception of those principles that conflict
with the guidance in IFRS 11. On the acquisition of additional interests in a joint operation, previously held interests
are not remeasured. The amendments to IFRS 11 do not apply if the parties sharing joint control are under the
common control of the same ultimate controlling party. The amendments apply for annual periods beginning on or
after January 1, 2016. Earlier application is permitted. EU endorsement is still pending. The amendments are not
expected to have a material impact on the HOCHTIEF Consolidated Financial Statements.
As part of its annual improvements process, the IASB published two omnibus standards in December 2013
(Annual Improvements Cycles 2010-2012 and 2011-2013) and another in September 2014 (Annual Improvements
Cycle 2012-2014). This involved small but necessary changes to various standards. The Annual Improvements Cycles
2010-2012 and 2011-2013 apply for annual periods beginning on or after July 1, 2014, the Annual Improvements
Cycle 2012-2014 for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016. The EU has so far endorsed the Annual
Improvements Cycles 2010-2012 and 2011-2013. On current assessment, the changes are not expected to have a
material impact on the presentation of the financial position and financial performance of the HOCHTIEF Group.
The remaining IFRS pronouncements issued by the IASB have no major relevance to the HOCHTIEF Group and
are therefore not expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements:
• IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts
• Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other
Entities and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: Investment Entities: Applying the
Consolidation Exception

Turner and its clients. The insurance expenses are counterbalanced by insurance revenue reported in sales.
Sundry other operating expenses mostly comprise order processing, costs of materials for administrative purposes,
costs of preparing the annual financial statements, losses incurred on disposal of property, plant and equipment,
and other expenses not reported elsewhere. Also included under this heading are sundry taxes amounting to EUR
24,712 thousand (2013: EUR 18,220 thousand).
Including personnel and material expenses, a total of EUR 3,167 thousand was spent on Group-wide research and
development projects by the central innovation management function in 2014 (2013: EUR 4,891 thousand).

Interest and similar income consists of interest on cash investments, interest-bearing securities, and other longterm loans, plus profit shares and dividends from current and non-current securities. Interest and similar expenses
represent all interest incurred. Net interest income—the balance of interest and similar income and expenses—is
negative, at minus EUR 221,372 thousand (2013: minus EUR 255,728 thousand).
Interest income of EUR 62,781 thousand was recorded in the 2014 fiscal year for financial instruments not carried
at fair value through profit or loss (2013: EUR 51,013 thousand). Interest expenses of EUR 284,606 thousand were
recorded for financial instruments not carried at fair value through profit or loss (2013: EUR 310,947 thousand).
Net interest expense/income from pension obligations—an amount of minus EUR 8,148 thousand (2013: minus
EUR 9,829 thousand)—consists of EUR 37,246 thousand (2013: EUR 37,674 thousand) in annual interest on the
net present value of long-term pension obligations rolled over into the new fiscal year, offset against EUR 29,098
thousand (2013: EUR 27,845 thousand) in interest income on plan assets.
Investment and interest income and expenses not included in interest and similar income and expenses or in the
interest component of increases in long-term provisions are reported as other investment income and expenses.
These mostly comprise income and expenses relating to sales of securities and to derivatives as well as expenses
relating to impairment losses on securities.

Group Report 2014

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Intangible assets include EUR 54,457 thousand (2013: EUR 50,017 thousand) for company names recognized on
initial consolidation, accounted for by EUR 38,272 thousand (2013: EUR 34,456 thousand) in the HOCHTIEF
Americas division and EUR 16,185 thousand (2013: EUR 15,561 thousand) in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division.
The changes compared with the prior year relate to currency adjustments. The company names are not subject to
systematic amortization, but are tested for impairment annually and if there is any indication of impairment. Impairment testing is performed in accordance with IAS 36 as described below for goodwill. As in the prior year, no impairment was identified in the year under review.
Goodwill recognized for consolidated companies on initial consolidation is allocated to cash-generating units at
segment level for the purposes of impairment testing as described in the following. The cash-generating units correspond to the divisions used in segment reporting.
Annual impairment testing of goodwill at segment (division) level is performed at HOCHTIEF in the fourth quarter of
each year. In impairment testing, the recoverable amount of a division is compared with its carrying amount.
The recoverable amount for the HOCHTIEF Americas and HOCHTIEF Europe cash-generating units is measured
separately for each unit as value in use. Value in use is the present value of future cash flows expected to arise from a
cash-generating unit. It is determined from an internal Group perspective using the discounted cash flow method.
This is carried out on the basis of cash flow budgets derived from the three-year budget for the detailed planning
horizon as approved by the Executive Board and current at the time of impairment testing. The forecasts incorporate past experience and expected future market developments Cash flows are assumed to remain constant in subsequent years. Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is used for cost of capital data. Value in use is first meas­
ured on an after-tax basis by discounting the cash flows with an after-tax WACC determined separately for each
cash-generating unit. The pretax discount rate is then found by iteration for the purposes of the Notes disclosures.
The discount rates used for cash-generating units in impairment testing are between 10.4 and 12.2% before tax
(2013: between 10.1 and 11.8%).
The recoverable amount for the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific cash-generating unit is measured as fair value based on
Leighton Holdings’ market capitalization.
As in the prior year, comparison of the divisions’ recoverable amounts with their carrying amounts has not revealed
any impairment of goodwill.

There is adequate assurance that the tax loss carryforwards will be realized. German tax loss carryforwards for
which no deferred tax assets have been recognized amount to EUR 696,944 thousand (2013: EUR 1,149,129 thousand) in respect of corporate income tax and EUR 914,280 thousand (2013: EUR 1,376,328 thousand) in respect
of German municipal trade tax. The change in the tax loss carryforward figures mainly relates to adjustments made
on the basis of completed tax audits and subsequent changes that followed as a result.
No deferred tax assets have been recognized in relation to interest expense carryforwards in the amount of EUR
Consolidated Financial Statements

321,106 thousand (2013: EUR 238,703 thousand).
Deferred tax assets are normally recognized for tax-deductible temporary differences if it is probable that taxable
profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilized.
Group companies that generated losses in the past fiscal year or previous years have EUR 68,124 thousand (2013:
EUR 19,181 thousand) in deferred tax assets resulting from temporary differences or tax loss carryforwards found
not to be impaired.
Deferred tax liabilities totaling a gross amount of EUR 574,836 thousand (2013: EUR 653,311 thousand) are entirely
due to taxable temporary differences, mostly from adjustments to ensure uniform Group-wide compliance with
IFRS valuation principles.

Group Report 2014

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Various fully consolidated companies in the HOCHTIEF Group have been granted service concession or similar
arrangements. These arrangements are mostly accounted for as financial assets and reported as part of the gross
amount due from customers for contract work (POC). The service concession arrangements, which are in the social
infrastructure/Europe segment, are agreements to build and modernize, operate, and maintain schools and other
public buildings. Construction work and improvements are on schedule. These activities broke even with sales of
EUR 14,604 thousand (2013: EUR 38,573 thousand). Accordingly, the HOCHTIEF Group companies concerned are
required to perform their obligations under the service concession arrangements and are granted the rights necessary to do so in each case. At the end of the period of a service concession arrangement, the infrastructure to
which the arrangement relates is returned to the public-sector client. The assets associated with a service concession arrangement generally remain public property for the entire duration of the arrangement. The sole termination
option provided for in the service concession arrangements relates to termination for cause. Some arrangements
have renewal options.
Trade receivables include EUR 532,773 thousand (2013: EUR 423,695 thousand) in contractual retention amounts.
Trade receivables do not include any properties under development that are subject to restrictions (2013: EUR
304,457 thousand).
Receivables from equity-accounted companies total EUR 2,698 thousand (2013: EUR 8,906 thousand).
22. Receivables from the sale of discontinued operations
The receivables in the amount of EUR 1,108,112 thousand are recognized in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division for
the sale of the John Holland Group and of 50% of the ownership interest in Thiess Services and Leighton Contractors
Services.
In accordance with its strategic alignment, HOCHTIEF Group company Leighton Holdings entered into binding
­agreements for the sale of these activities in December 2014.
The transaction generated a pre-tax gain on disposal of EUR 660,989 thousand.
23. Marketable securities
The marketable securities totaling EUR 741,535 thousand (2013: EUR 1,123,258 thousand) mainly consist of securities held in special-purpose and general investment funds and fixed-income securities with maturities at the time
Consolidated Financial Statements

of acquisition of more than three months where there is no intention to hold the securities to maturity.
All marketable securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value. The carrying amount
decreased due to fair value adjustments by EUR 7,944 thousand (2013: EUR 17,733 thousand).
Marketable securities are pledged in the amount of EUR 23,262 thousand (2013: EUR 19,936 thousand) as security
for employee benefit entitlements under semi-retirement programs. Marketable securities are subject to restrictions in
the amount of EUR 172,552 thousand (2013: EUR 223,602 thousand).
Outside of externally managed investments, direct investment activities are exclusively restricted to the purchase
of bonds from top-class issuers* with broad diversification to ensure that concentration risks relative to specific

24. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents total EUR 2,585,359 thousand (2013: EUR 2,190,132 thousand) and comprise petty cash,
cash at banks, and marketable securities with maturities at the time of acquisition of no more than three months.
Cash and cash equivalents are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash and cash equivalents to the
value of EUR 26,518 thousand are subject to restrictions (2013: EUR 65,553 thousand).
25. Shareholders’ equity
The Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity is shown on page 173.
Exercising the authorization given at the Annual General Meeting of May 7, 2013 to redeem shares of treasury stock
acquired in accordance with Section 71 (1) 8 of the German Stock Corporations Act (AktG), the Executive Board
passed a resolution on February 24, 2014 to redeem all 7,690,565 shares of treasury stock. The Supervisory Board

177,432,151.04. The capital reduction was effected by redemption of treasury stock acquired in accordance with
Section 71 (1) 8 Sentence 6 AktG by application of the simplified redemption procedure (Section 237 (3) 2 AktG).
As in the prior year, each share accounts for EUR 2.56 of capital stock.
As of December 31, 2014, HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft held a total of 843,189 shares of treasury stock as defined
in Section 160 (1) 2 of the German Stock Corporations Act (AktG). These shares were purchased from October 7,
2014 onward for the purposes provided for in the resolution of the Annual General Meeting of May 7, 2014 and for
all other purposes permitted under AktG, at a total price of EUR 48,303,535 (an average price of EUR 57.29 per
share). The holdings of treasury stock represent EUR 2,158,564 (1.22%) of the Company’s capital stock.
The capital reserve comprises premium on shares issued by HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft.
The Executive Board is unaware of any restrictions on voting rights or on transfers of securities.
There are no shares with special control rights. The Executive Board is not aware of any employee shares where
the control rights are not exercised directly by the employees.
Statutory rules on the appointment and replacement of Executive Board members are contained in Sections 84
and 85 and statutory rules on the amendment of the Articles of Association in Sections 179 and 133 of the German Stock Corporations Act (AktG). Under Section 7 (1) of the Company’s Articles of Association, the Executive
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

Board comprises at least two individuals. Section 23 (1) of the Articles of Association provides that resolutions of
the Annual General Meeting require a simple majority of votes cast unless there is a statutory requirement stipulating a different majority. In instances where the Act requires a majority of the capital stock represented at the time
of the resolution in addition to a majority of votes cast, Section 23 (3) of the Articles of Association provides that a
simple majority will suffice unless there is a mandatory requirement stipulating a different majority.
Pursuant to Section 4 (5) of the Articles of Association, the Executive Board is authorized, subject to Supervisory
Board approval, to increase the capital stock by issuing new no-par-value bearer shares for cash and/or non-cash
consideration in one or more issues up to a total of EUR 35,840 thousand by or before May 10, 2015 (Authorized

or at the time of exercising the authorization, whichever figure is smaller, with the quantity of shares able to be

By resolution of the Annual General Meeting of May 7, 2014, the Executive Board is authorized, subject to Supervisory Board approval, in the event of a sale of treasury shares effected by way of an offer to all shareholders, to issue
subscription rights to the shares to holders of warrant-linked and/or convertible bonds issued by the Company or
by any subordinate Group company. The Executive Board is also authorized, subject to Supervisory Board approval,
to sell treasury shares other than through the stock exchange and other than by way of an offer to all shareholders,

Company shares of the same class at the time of sale.
The HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft Executive Board is also authorized, subject to Supervisory Board approval and
the conditions set out in the following, to offer and transfer treasury shares to third parties other than through the
stock exchange and other than by way of an offer to all shareholders. Such transactions may take place in the course
of acquisitions of business enterprises in whole or part and in the course of mergers. They are also permitted for
the purpose of obtaining a listing for the Company’s shares on foreign stock exchanges where it is not yet listed.
The shares may also be offered for purchase by employees or former employees of the Company or its affiliates.
Holders of bonds which the Company or a Group company subordinate to it issues or has issued under the authorization granted at the Annual General Meeting of May 12, 2011 (agenda item 8) may also be issued with the shares
upon exercising the warrant and/or conversion rights and/or obligations attached to the bonds.
On condition that they be held for at least two years after transfer, the shares may also be transferred to (current or
past) members of the Executive Board of the Company and to (current or past) members of the executive boards

and general management of companies under its control within the meaning of Section 17 of the German Stock Corporations Act (AktG), and to current or past employees of the Company or of a company under its control within
the meaning of Section 17 AktG. Such transfers are only permitted for the purpose of settling the transferees’ variable compensation entitlements in place of cash settlement. Further conditions of transfer are detailed in the resolution. Where shares are issued to members of the Executive Board of the Company, the decision to issue the
shares is taken solely by the Supervisory Board.
Shareholders’ statutory subscription rights to such shares are barred pursuant to Sections 71 (1) 8 and 186 (3) and
(4) of the German Stock Corporations Act (AktG) to the extent that the shares are used in exercise of the authorizations set out above.

The Executive Board is also authorized, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to retire repurchased shares without a further resolution of the Annual General Meeting being required for the share retirement itself or its execution.
The conditions governing awards of subscription rights and the sale, transfer, and retirement of treasury stock are
set forth in detail in the Annual General Meeting resolution.
Exercising the authorization given at the Annual General Meeting of May 7, 2014, HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft
acquired 13,991 shares between May 12, 2014 and May 23, 2014 for a total price of EUR 924,205 (an average
price of EUR 66.06 per share). These shares represent EUR 35,817 (0.02%) of the Company’s capital stock.
In May 2014, 13,991 shares of treasury stock were transferred to members of the Executive Board of the Company
and to members of the Executive Board of HOCHTIEF Solutions AG at a price of EUR 66.35 per share on condition
that the shares be held for at least two years after transfer. The transfer settled the transferees’ variable compensation entitlements in place of cash settlement. These shares represent EUR 35,817 (0.02%) of the Company’s
capital stock.

26. Share-based payment
The following Group-wide share-based payment systems were in force for managerial staff of HOCHTIEF Aktien­
gesellschaft and its affiliates in 2014:
Retention Stock Awards 2008
In May 2008, the Supervisory Board adopted a resolution to launch, for members of the Executive Board, a Retention Stock Award plan (RSA 2008) consisting of three tranches and running for seven years, and granted a first
tranche of awards under the plan. The conditions for the first tranche of stock awards stipulated that for each stock
award exercised within a two-year exercise period following a three-year waiting period, entitled individuals received
at HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft’s discretion either a HOCHTIEF share or a compensatory cash amount equal to
the closing price of HOCHTIEF stock on the last stock market trading day before the exercise date. The gain on
each stock award was limited to EUR 160.
The second tranche was granted in March 2009. The conditions for the second tranche differed from the first
tranche solely in the time frame being one year later and with regard to the cap, which was set for the second
tranche at EUR 66.50 per stock award. The third tranche was granted in March 2010. The conditions for the third
tranche differed from the first tranche solely in the time frame being two years later and with regard to the cap,
which was set for the third tranche at EUR 133.12 per stock award.
The first tranche was exercised in full by the members of the Executive Board in 2011. The second and third
tranches were exercised in full or expired in 2014.
Top Executive Retention Plan 2008
The Executive Board also resolved in June 2008 to launch a Top Executive Retention Plan 2008 (TERP 2008) for
selected managerial employees.
This plan is likewise based on stock awards and consists of three tranches. The first tranche was granted in July
2008, the second in July 2009, and the third in July 2010.
The total term of the plan is ten years. The waiting period after the granting of each tranche is three years. The
­exercise period is between five and seven years, depending on the tranche.
The conditions stipulate that, after the waiting period, entitled individuals receive for each stock award either a
HOCHTIEF share or, at HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft’s discretion, a compensatory cash amount equal to the
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

closing price of HOCHTIEF stock on the last stock market trading day before the exercise date. The gain is capped
for each year of the exercise period. The cap rises annually up to a maximum gain at the end of the term. The
maximum gain is set to EUR 160 per stock award for the first tranche, EUR 81.65 for the second tranche, and EUR
166.27 for the third tranche.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Long-term Incentive Plan 2009
The Long-term Incentive Plan 2009 (LTIP 2009) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2009 and
is open to Executive Board members and upper managerial employees of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and its
affiliates. Alongside grants of stock appreciation rights (SARs), LTIP 2009 also provided for grants of stock awards.
The SARs could only be exercised if, for at least ten consecutive stock market trading days before the exercise
date, the ten-day average (arithmetic mean) stock market closing price of HOCHTIEF stock was higher relative to
the issue price compared with the ten-day average closing level of the MDAX index relative to the index base (relative performance threshold) and, additionally, return on net assets (RONA) in the then most recently approved set
of consolidated financial statements was at least 10% (absolute performance threshold). The relative performance
threshold was waived if the average stock market price of HOCHTIEF stock exceeded the issue price by at least
10% on ten consecutive stock market trading days after the end of the waiting period.
Provided that the targets were met, the SARs could be exercised at any time after a two-year waiting period except
during a short period before publication of any business results. When SARs were exercised, the issuing entity
paid out the difference between the then current stock price and the issue price. The difference was capped at
50% of the issue price.
The LTIP conditions for stock awards stipulated that for each stock award exercised within a two-year exercise
period following a three-year waiting period, entitled individuals received at HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft’s discretion either a HOCHTIEF share or a compensatory cash amount equal to the closing price of HOCHTIEF stock on
the last stock market trading day before the exercise date. The maximum gain was set to EUR 40.10 per stock award.
The plan was exercised in full.
Long-term Incentive Plan 2010
The Long-term Incentive Plan 2010 (LTIP 2010) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2010 and
is open to Executive Board members and upper managerial employees of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and its
affiliates. Except for the longer waiting period (four instead of two years) for the SARs, the conditions do not differ
in any material respect from those of LTIP 2009. The gain is limited to EUR 27.28 per SAR and EUR 81.83 per
stock award.
Long-term Incentive Plan 2011
The Long-term Incentive Plan 2011 (LTIP 2011) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2011 and is
open to Executive Board members and upper managerial employees of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and its affiliConsolidated Financial Statements

Long-term Incentive Plan 2012
The Long-term Incentive Plan 2012 (LTIP 2012) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2012 and is
open to Executive Board members and upper managerial employees of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and its
affiliates. The plan conditions differ from those of LTIP 2011 in two points:
1. Return on net assets (RONA) as per the most recently approved Consolidated Financial Statements must be at
least 15%.
2. The waiting time for stock awards was extended from three to four years and the total term of the plan accordingly
from five to six years.
The gain is limited to EUR 25.27 per SAR and EUR 75.81 per stock award.
Long-term Incentive Plan 2013
The Long-term Incentive Plan 2013 (LTIP 2013) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2013 and is
open to Executive Board members. The plan conditions differ from those of LTIP 2012 in only one point:
The number of SARs that can be exercised depends on attainment of the planned value range for adjusted free cash
flow. This value range is set in the business plan for each exercise year.
The gain is limited to EUR 24.61 per SAR and EUR 73.83 per stock award.
Long-term Incentive Plan 2014
The Long-term Incentive Plan 2014 (LTIP 2014) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2014 and is
open to Executive Board members. The plan conditions do not differ in any material respect from those of LTIP 2013.
The gain is limited to EUR 30.98 per SAR and EUR 92.93 per stock award.
Other information
Return on net assets (RONA)
Return on net assets (RONA) indicates how well HOCHTIEF’s assets are performing as an investment and thus
measures the profitability of the HOCHTIEF Group. RONA measures return as a percentage of net assets. For this
purpose, return is defined as operational earnings (EBITA, shown in the Operational Statement of Earnings) plus inConsolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

terest income from the Group’s financial assets. The net assets figure reflects the total capital commitment from
which returns are to be generated.
*restated

The HOCHTIEF Group generated a return on net assets (RONA) of 20.3% in 2014 (2013: 15.6%*). RONA thus
­increased/decreased by 4.7 percentage points compared with the prior year.

Group Report 2014

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

The conditions of all plans stipulate that on the exercise of SARs or stock awards—and the fulfillment of all other
requisite criteria—HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft normally has the option of delivering HOCHTIEF shares instead of
paying out the gain in cash. Where the entitled individuals are not employees of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, the
expense incurred on exercise of SARs or stock awards is met by the affiliated company concerned.
The quantities of SARs and stock awards granted, expired, and exercised under the plans are as follows:

ees. The main pension obligations in Germany consist of direct commitments under the current 2000+ pension
plan and deferred compensation plans. The 2000+ plan in force since January 1, 2000 consists of a basic pension
in the form of a modular defined contribution plan and a supplementary pension linked to company performance.
The size of the basic pension component depends on employee income and age (resulting in an annuity conversion
factor) and a general pension contribution reviewed by HOCHTIEF every three years. The size of the supplementary pension component depends on growth in IFRS-basis profit after taxes. The basic pension can be supplemented in this way by up to 20%. The pension amount at retirement is the sum total of the pension components
vested each year. In isolated instances, length-of-service and final salary pension arrangements are in existence
for executive staff, although except at Executive Board level such arrangements have no longer been offered since
1995. Benefits comprise an old-age pension, an invalidity pension, and a surviving dependants’ pension, and in
almost all cases are granted as a lifelong annuity.

Group Report 2014

Up to December 31, 2013, employees in Germany additionally had the option of deferred compensation in a company pension plan. The deferred compensation was invested in selected investment funds. The pension amount is
based on the present value of acquired fund units at retirement, subject to a minimum of the deferred compensation
amount plus an increment that is guaranteed by HOCHTIEF and ranges from 3.50% down to 1.75% p.a. There is a
choice at retirement between a lump sum payment and an annuity for five or six years.
Outside of Germany, there are defined benefit plans at Turner in the USA and HOCHTIEF UK in the United Kingdom.
The plan at Turner was frozen as of December 31, 2003, and no new entitlements can be earned under it. Benefits
comprise an old-age pension, an invalidity pension, and a surviving dependants’ pension. There is a choice at retirement between a lifelong annuity and a lump sum payment. Commitments at Turner also include post-employment
benefits in the form of medical care for pensioners. HOCHTIEF UK has a length-of-service, final salary pension plan.
For each year of service, 1/75th of the eligible final salary is granted as a monthly pension. Benefits comprise an
old-age pension, an invalidity pension, and a surviving dependants’ pension.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Plan assets
There are no statutory or regulatory minimum funding requirements for pension plans in Germany. Domestic pension
obligations are fully funded. The funded plans take the form of a contractual trust arrangement (CTA). The transferred assets are administered in trust by HOCHTIEF Pension Trust e. V. and serve exclusively to fund domestic pension obligations. The transferred cash is invested in the capital market in accordance with investment principles set
out in the trust agreement and the investment guidelines. The investment guidelines and decisions are based on
the findings of an asset liability matching (ALM) study compiled by outside specialists at regular intervals of three to
five years. This uses Monte Carlo simulation to model the development of the pension liabilities and other key economic factors over a very long forward horizon and in numerous combinations. Based on the ALM study, a range
of criteria are then applied to determine the optimum asset allocation in order to ensure that pension liabilities can
be met in the long term. To assure an optimum conservative risk structure, we have also established risk overlay
management using the services of a professional external overlay manager who is given a fixed annual risk budget
and works fully autonomously in a clearly structured risk overlay management process. HOCHTIEF aims to ensure
full funding of pension obligations and to fund new vested benefits on the basis of current service cost annually or
at least on a timely basis. The companies pay in additional amounts from time to time in the event of any shortfall.
Pension commitments in Germany in excess of the contribution assessment ceiling applied in the statutory pension
insurance scheme are additionally covered using pension liability insurance. Pension liabilities from deferred employee compensation are funded by the purchase of retail fund units. Funding of the obligations served by HOCHTIEF
Pension Trust e.V. as of December 31, 2014 is about 60% (2013: 71%); the figure for Germany as a whole is about
64% (2013: 75%). It should be noted in this connection that the size of pension obligations has increased significantly in recent years due to the low level of market interest rates and that the funding ratio will significantly increase
again when interest rates recover.
The frozen defined benefit obligations in the Turner Group are likewise managed in a pension fund. Plan assets are
administered in trust by BNY Mellon and serve exclusively to fund the plan. The trust’s independence is reviewed
annually and attested to by auditors. Investment decisions are not made by the trust but by a special committee. The
investment of plan assets is based on a regularly compiled ALM study. The investment objectives are to maximize
the funding ratio and reduce volatility in the funding ratio. With the pension obligations fully funded, high-risk investments in equities are to be reduced in favor of fixed-interest bonds. These ideally perform in line with plan liabilities,
thus ensuring full funding. There is no statutory minimum funding requirement, but low funding levels result in higher
contributions to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, and limits to lump-sum payments, hence maximum
funding is aimed for. The funding of obligations covered by plan assets at Turner as of December 31, 2014 is about
91% (2013: 96%); funding at Turner overall is about 75% (2013: 80%). Funding of plan assets at HOCHTIEF UK is
likewise on a trust basis. Statutory minimum funding requirements apply. If funding is insufficient to make up a
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

fund­ing shortfall, an additional restructuring plan is drawn up. Plan funding is reviewed at least once every three
years. Funding of pension obligations at HOCHTIEF UK is about 81% (2013: 86%).

Actuarial assumptions
The size of pension provisions is determined on an actuarial basis. This necessarily involves estimates. Specifically,
the actuarial assumptions used are as follows:

The discount factors are derived from the Mercer Pension Discount Yield Curve (MPDYC) model, taking into account
the company-specific duration of pension liabilities. Salary and pension increases ceased to be taken into account
in the USA (Turner Group) in 2004 due to the changeover in pension arrangements. Mortality assumptions are based
on published country-specific statistics and experience. Domestically, they are determined using the Prof. Dr. Klaus
Heubeck 2005 G tables. Turner uses the RP 2014 separate annuitant/non-annuitant no collar tables with generational improvement using scale MP-2014 as published by the Society of Actuaries (SOA); HOCHTIEF UK uses the

Pension expense under defined benefit plans is made up as follows:

Group Report 2014

221

In addition to the expenses recognized in profit or loss, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income includes EUR 157,772 thousand in actuarial losses recognized in 2014 before deferred taxes and after consolidation
changes and exchange rate adjustments (2013: EUR 62,585 thousand actuarial gains). Before deferred taxes, the
cumulative amount of actuarial losses is EUR 471,587 thousand (2013: EUR 313,815 thousand).
The Turner Group’s obligations to meet healthcare costs for retired staff are included in pension provisions due to
their pension-like nature. The defined benefit obligation as of December 31, 2014 came to EUR 48,827 thousand
(2013: EUR 38,909 thousand). Healthcare costs accounted for EUR 1,416 thousand (2013: EUR 1,838 thousand) of
the current service cost and EUR 2,004 thousand (2013: EUR 1,614 thousand) of the interest expense.
Sensitivity analysis
Pension obligations in the HOCHTIEF Group are subject to various risks. The main risks result from general changes
in interest and inflation rates; there is no unusual risk inherent in the pension obligations.
One major risk is interest rate risk. For defined benefit plans, (notional) contributions are translated into benefits
using a table of fixed interest rates, independent of the current market interest rate. HOCHTIEF thus bears the risk
of general capital market interest rate changes with regard to the determination of benefits. Pension obligations
have increased significantly in recent years due to the generally low level of capital market interest rates. The correspondingly large impact is due to the relatively long term of the obligations.
There is also inflation risk. By law, company pensions in Germany must be raised level with the inflation rate at
least every three years. German company pensions under the 2000+ plan rise at a fixed 1% p.a., hence there is
only minor inflation risk in the pension phase. Turner plans are free from inflation risk as the main defined benefit
plan was frozen and no more adjustments to the company pension are made.
In addition, there is longevity risk. The granting of lifelong pensions means that HOCHTIEF bears the risk of pen­
sioners living longer than actuarial calculations predict. This risk normally cancels out collectively across all pen­
sion plan members and only comes into play if general longevity is longer than expected.
The impact of the stated risks on the defined benefit obligations under a corresponding change in actuarial assumptions is shown in the sensitivity analysis that follows.

Defined contribution plans
Under defined contribution plans, the Company pays into a state or private pension fund voluntarily or in accord­
ance with statutory or contractual stipulations. It has no obligation to pay further contributions.
There are defined contribution plans at Turner, Flatiron, and E.E. Cruz in the USA as well as at Leighton in Australia.
Depending on length of service and salary level, Turner pays between 3% and 6% of an employee’s salary into an
external fund. In addition, Turner employees have an option to pay up to 25% of their salaries into an investment
fund as part of a 401 (k) plan. Turner matches the first 5% of the deferred compensation by up to 100% depending
on length of service. All employees can join the plan immediately, and are vested in the company’s contributions
after three years’ service. Tax relief is granted on payments into the fund; the investment risk is borne by employees.
The defined contribution plans at Flatiron and E.E. Cruz are likewise 401 (k) plans. All non-union employees are
entitled. Flatiron pays a contribution in the amount of 6.0% of the wage or salary, while E.E. Cruz doubles one-third
of employee contributions, in each case up to the statutory maximum. In Australia, since July 1, 2014 Leighton has
paid 9.50% (previously 9.25%) of the wage and salary total into the statutory pension (superannuation) scheme. The
contribution rate is expected to rise incrementally up to 12.0% by 2025. Employees have a choice of investment funds
and bear the investment risk. They are able to pay top-up contributions on a voluntary basis. Tax relief is granted
on top-up contributions.
EUR 182,071 thousand was paid into defined contribution plans in 2014 (2013: EUR 201,972 thousand*), mostly in

the Leighton Group (EUR 148,689 thousand; 2013: EUR 169,061 thousand*) and the Turner Group (EUR 30,731
thousand; 2013: EUR 29,572 thousand). An additional EUR 66,366 thousand was paid into state pension schemes
in 2014 (2013: EUR 86,617 thousand). Costs of defined contribution plans are reported as part of personnel expenses.

The increase in provisions for taxes to EUR 437,113 thousand (2013: EUR 54,126 thousand) was mainly a result of
the sale of John Holland and of the Services business at Leighton subsidiaries Thiess and Leighton Contractors.
The personnel-related provisions primarily consist of provisions for stock option schemes, long-service awards,
leave entitlements, termination benefits, and early retirement arrangements.
The size of provisions for insurance claims is computed annually by an actuary.
Items covered by sundry other provisions include contract administration, contract costs incurred subsequent to
invoicing, investment risk, preparation of annual financial statements, payments for damages, and other uncertain
liabilities.

and matures in November 2022. A U.S. dollar bond issued by Leighton Holdings in 2010 with a principal amount of
USD 350,000 thousand has a carrying amount of EUR 291,386 thousand (2013: EUR 251,689 thousand). The bond
is repayable in three installments in 2015, 2017, and 2020. The installments each carry a different rate of interest
ranging from 4.51 to 5.78%. The bonds or notes issued item for the prior year also included EUR 181,538 thousand
for a further bond issued by Leighton Holdings in 2009 that was repaid in full in the year under review. In 2008,
Leighton Holdings issued a U.S. dollar private placement with a principal amount of USD 280,000 thousand. The
two remaining tranches are repayable in 2015 and 2018. The installments each carry a different rate of interest
ranging from 7.19 to 7.66%. The carrying amount of the U.S. dollar private placement at December 31, 2014 is EUR
140,698 thousand (2013: EUR 121,760 thousand). Finally, bonds or notes issued contain EUR 34,736 thousand

Amounts due to banks include a EUR 50,000 thousand portion of a bilateral promissory note loan arranged on
December 13, 2012. The loan has an initial term of four years and has a fixed interest rate. A liability of EUR 44,500
thousand previously included in this item and resulting from a EUR 120,600 thousand promissory note loan issue
placed in the market on November 25, 2011 was repaid ahead of time as of May 26, 2014. A further EUR 240,000

Undiluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the consolidated net profit attributable to the Company’s
stock by the average number of shares in circulation. This indicator can become diluted as a result of potential
shares (mainly stock options and convertible bonds). HOCHTIEF’s share-based payment arrangements do not
have a dilutive effect on earnings. Consequently, diluted and undiluted earnings per share are identical.

34. Reporting on financial instruments
Financial instruments include financial assets and liabilities as well as contractual claims and obligations relating to
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

exchanges and transfers of financial assets. Financial instruments can be derivative or non-derivative.
Non-derivative financial assets mostly comprise cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, receivables, and
other financial assets. Marketable securities are carried at fair value. The fair values of available-for-sale financial
assets are established with reference to market prices or, in the absence of such prices, are determined using
accepted valuation methods.
Non-derivative financial liabilities are mostly current liabilities measured at amortized cost.
According to their fair value, derivative financial instruments are reported either in other receivables and other assets
or in other liabilities. Derivatives are used in the HOCHTIEF Group exclusively for hedging existing transactions and
in asset management.*

*See glossary on page 265.

Group Report 2014

227

Holdings of non-derivative and derivative financial instruments are carried on the Balance Sheet; the maximum risk
of loss or default is equal to total financial assets. Any such risk identified in respect of financial assets is accounted
for with an impairment loss.
Risk management
All financial activities in the HOCHTIEF Group are conducted on the basis of a Group-wide financial framework
directive. This is fleshed out by individual, function-specific operating directives on issues such as currency and
collateral management. These directives lay down principles for dealing with the various classes of financial risk.
Trading, control, and settlement activities are divided within Corporate Finance between front, middle, and back
offices. This ensures effective operational risk management in that monitoring and settlement of front office external trading activities are performed by a separate and independent back office. All external trading actions are also
subject to at least dual control. Internal authorizations to give instructions are strictly limited in number and monetary amount, and are reassessed at least once a year and adjusted as necessary.
Management of liquidity risk
HOCHTIEF uses predominantly centralized liquidity structures—in particular cash pooling—to pool liquidity at
Group level, among other things to avoid liquidity bottlenecks at the level of individual entities. The central liquidity
position is calculated at regular monthly intervals and budgeted in a bottom-up process over a rolling 18-month
period. Liquidity budgets are supplemented with monthly stress testing. Liquidity budgets are used by HOCHTIEF
in active management of the securities portfolio and loans portfolio.
Issuance of a third corporate bond with a principal amount of EUR 500,000 thousand and a five-year term to
maturity in May 2014 enabled the Group once again to spread borrowing over a larger range of national and international lenders and further extend the maturity profile of the debt portfolio.
The tables below show maximum payments. The tables show the worst-case scenario for HOCHTIEF, i.e. the
earliest possible contractual payment date in each case. Creditors’ rights of termination are taken into account.
Foreign currency items are translated using the closing rate as of the balance sheet date. Interest payments on
variable rate items are translated uniformly using the last interest rate fixed prior to the balance sheet date. Both
primary and derivative financial instruments (for example, forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps) are
taken into account. Credit facilities granted but not yet drawn in their full amount are also included, as are financial
guarantees given by the Group.

Undrawn revolving credit facilities

The revolving credit facilities include a credit facility tranche with a facility amount of EUR 500,000 thousand under
the syndicated guarantee and credit facility that was extended ahead of term in April 2014 to April 30, 2019. As in
the prior year, the credit facility was undrawn as of December 31, 2014. HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft also has
short-term, bilateral, revolving money market facilities with a total facility amount of EUR 259,349 thousand (2013:
EUR 336,636 thousand); as in the prior year, these are undrawn as of the balance sheet date. Some of the facilities
are subject to creditors’ rights of termination in connection with a financial covenant, which is continuously monitored as part of corporate planning. In light of the broad international syndication in each instance and the successful
extension of the credit and guarantee facilities in April 2014, there is no refinancing risk with regard to long-term
guarantee and credit facilities. As a further precautionary measure, there is appropriate scope for raising additional
capital under resolutions adopted at the 2011 Annual General Meeting.
HOCHTIEF also has sufficient revolving guarantee facilities, which play an important role for the Group. The guarantee facilities have a total size of EUR 12.90 billion (2013: EUR 11.86 billion) and are 66% drawn (2013: 67%).
Management of currency risk
HOCHTIEF is exposed to currency risk (in the form of transaction risk) from receivables, liabilities, cash and cash
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

equivalents, securities, and pending transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the Group
company concerned in each case. Currency derivatives, mainly forward exchange contracts, are used to hedge
against fluctuations in these payments or items caused by exchange rates. HOCHTIEF normally hedges all currency
risk.
Hedges for Group companies—with the exception of hedges in the Leighton Group—are mainly administered via
HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. Binding guidelines clarify their use and separate controls and responsibilities for all
Group companies. Currency derivatives are normally only used to hedge risk. Any form of speculation is ruled out
under a binding, Group-wide risk directive. The counterparties for derivatives entered into externally are banks with
a top credit rating.

The maximum residual term of currency derivatives in cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2014 is 13 months
(2013: 35 months). As of December 31, 2014, the maximum residual term of currency derivatives for which hedge
accounting is not applied is 25 months (2013: 11 months).
Where hedge accounting is used, unrealized gains and losses on hedges are initially recognized in other comprehensive income, taking into account deferred tax. Gains and losses are not realized until a hedged item affects
income. Derivatives are measured on the basis of current market rates as of the balance sheet date. When interpreting positive or negative fair value changes relating to derivatives, it is important to remember that they balance
hedged items whose values move in the opposite direction. A net EUR 5,019 thousand was charged to equity in
2014 (2013: EUR 9,301 thousand credited) for market value changes on the above derivatives in cash flow hedges.
Where hedge accounting is not applied, all unrealized gains and losses on the hedged item are recognized immediately in profit or loss; in 2013 this related to a net loss of EUR 1,511 thousand (2013: net gain of EUR 4,256 thousand).
The following sensitivity analyses demonstrate the impact on HOCHTIEF Group equity and profit that would result
from a 10% fluctuation in foreign currencies relative to each Group company’s functional currency. The analysis is

Management of interest rate risk
HOCHTIEF is exposed to interest rate risk through financial items primarily consisting of interest-bearing marketable
securities on the assets side and financial liabilities on the liabilities side of the Balance Sheet. Two approaches are
used to minimize this risk. Firstly, the Company uses natural hedging, meaning that it eliminates contrary interest
rate risk from primary financial instruments on the asset and liabilities side. The second method is to use interest
rate derivatives. These generally take the form of interest rate swaps used in accordance with the Group annual finan­cing
strategy to manage cash flow risk from changes in interest rates for variable-rate financial items.
As with currency derivatives, hedges for Group companies—with the exception of hedges in the Leighton Group—
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

are mainly administered via HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. There are also parallel regulations and guidelines, and
derivatives are used solely for hedging (i.e. not speculatively) as a matter of principle. The counterparties for derivatives entered into externally are generally banks with a top credit rating.

The maximum residual term of interest rate swaps both in cash flow hedges and otherwise as of December 31,
2014 is 31 months (2013: 43 months). The interest rate futures have a maximum residual term of 363 months
(2013: 36 months).
EUR 10,327 thousand was credited to equity in 2014 (2013: EUR 15,880 thousand) for market value changes on
interest rate derivatives in cash flow hedges. As in the prior year, this included EUR 1,190 thousand reclassified to
profit or loss. There was no hedge ineffectiveness. A net EUR 2,432 thousand was recognized in profit or loss
(2013: EUR 2,705 thousand) for market value changes on the remaining interest rate derivatives.
The following sensitivity analyses demonstrate the impact that a 1% fluctuation in the respective market interest
rate would have had on equity and on profit or loss. The analysis is based on holdings as of the balance sheet

Management of other price risk
Other price risk results at HOCHTIEF through investing in current and non-current non-interest-bearing securities,
chiefly shares and funds, that are classified as available for sale and therefore measured at fair value through equity.
Other price risk stems from participating interests that are classified as available for sale to the extent that they are
measured at fair value. Such items are shown in the following table. Participating interests measured at amortized
cost because their fair value cannot be reliably measured are not included.

HOCHTIEF actively manages price risk. Continuous monitoring and analysis of the markets make it possible to
marshal investments at short notice. This allows the Company to detect negative developments on the capital
market at an early stage and take appropriate action. Derivatives are only used to control price risk in exceptional
instances.
To hedge our share-based compensation plans, stock-based derivatives were entered into with a maximum residual
term of 51 months as of December 31, 2014 (2013: 63 months). These derivatives are not subject to hedge accounting, but are deployed as a natural hedge. Gains and losses in the fair value of these derivatives are contained in
personnel costs.
The following table shows the fair values of equity options, stock forward contracts, and index-based options:

Management of credit risk
The HOCHTIEF Group is exposed to credit risk from operations and from certain financing activities.
HOCHTIEF performs risk management for operations by continuously monitoring trade receivables at divisional
level. If a specific credit risk is detected, it is countered by recognizing an individual impairment.
The HOCHTIEF Group has given third parties financial guarantees in respect of companies accounted for using
the equity method. Financial guarantees are only given in respect of companies with top credit standing, restricting
to a minimum the probability of the guarantees being drawn upon. Loan commitments are only given to companies
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

accounted for using the equity method.

234

Group Report 2014

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

The maximum credit risk exposure of financial assets is equivalent to their carrying amounts in the Balance Sheet.
The actual credit risk exposure is lower, however, due to collateral given in favor of the HOCHTIEF Group. The maximum risk exposure on financial guarantees given by HOCHTIEF is the maximum amount to be paid by HOCHTIEF.
The maximum credit risk for loan commitments is the amount of the commitment. The maximum credit risk from
financial guarantees and loan commitments amounted to EUR 195,944 thousand as of December 31, 2014 (2013:
EUR 69,237 thousand). The probability of the financial guarantees and loan commitments being drawn upon is
very small as of the reporting date.
HOCHTIEF accepts collateral to secure contract performance by subcontractors, subcontractors’ warranty obligations, and claims to remuneration. Such collateral includes guarantees relating to warranty obligations, contract
performance, advance payments, and receivables. Acceptance of collateral is governed by a HOCHTIEF directive.
Among other things, this covers the contractual drafting, implementation, and management of all agreements. The
detailed rules vary according to factors such as the country jurisdiction and applicable case law. In the case of
credit risk, HOCHTIEF examines the credit rating of the party providing the collateral for all guarantees accepted.
HOCHTIEF uses external specialists (for example, rating agencies) to assess credit ratings where possible. The fair
values of accepted collateral are not disclosed as they often cannot be measured reliably.

The age structure of financial assets that are past due is shaped by industry-specific factors. Receipt of payment
depends on acceptance (inspection) and invoice checking, which can often take a relatively long time, especially
for large-scale projects. Most of the unimpaired financial assets that are past due are from public-sector clients

and industrial companies with top credit ratings.

Capital risk management
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

The HOCHTIEF Group manages capital with the aim of ensuring that all Group companies can continue to operate
as a going concern. The Group keeps the cost of capital as low as possible by optimizing the balance between
equity and debt as the need arises. These measures primarily serve to secure the best possible credit standing as
well as to maximize shareholder earnings.
The Group’s capital structure consists of the Balance Sheet items comprising net debt (current and non-current
liabilities less cash and cash equivalents) and shareholders’ equity. The Risk Management Steering Committee
assesses and examines the Group’s capital structure at regular intervals, taking into account the risk-adjusted cost
of capital.
The overall capital risk management strategy did not change in 2014 compared with the prior year.

Because current financial instruments have short residual terms and are measured at market value, their carrying
amounts correspond to market value as of the balance sheet date. Non-current securities in the available-for-sale
category are measured at fair value through equity and, as such, their carrying amounts also correspond to fair
value.
Shares in non-consolidated subsidiaries and other participating interests are measured at fair value if fair value can
be reliably determined. Otherwise, such items are measured at cost in the available-for-sale category.
In the disclosures on the fair value hierarchy for financial instruments measured at fair value, fair value is defined as
the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., the exit price). For non-financial assets,
fair value is measured assuming the highest and best use of the asset by market participants. A three-level hierarchy
is applied that reflects the observability of the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; e.g. quoted securities.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices); e.g. interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts.
Level 3: No relevant observable inputs available, hence unobservable inputs are determined as an exit price from
the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability; e.g. investments measured at fair
value determined by business valuation.

There were no transfers of assets measured at fair value between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
There were therefore likewise no changes in Level 3.
The fair value of investments in unlisted entities and of debt instruments not traded in an active market is measured
using the discounted cash flow method. Any discounting is done using current market interest rates.

Net profit from financial instruments

The calculation of net profit from financial instruments includes interest income and expenses, impairments and
impairment reversals, income and expenses from currency translation, dividend income, gains and losses on disposal, and other changes in the fair value of financial instruments recognized in income.
Impairments of financial assets totaling EUR 110,431 thousand (2013: EUR 29,576 thousand) were recognized in
2014. Of this figure, EUR 24 thousand (2013: EUR 96 thousand) relates to the carrying amounts of non-consolidated
subsidiaries and other participating interests measured at cost where a fair value is not available. In the prior year,
an additional EUR 68 thousand (2013: EUR 13,306 thousand) related to the carrying amounts of non-consolidated
subsidiaries and other participating interests measured at fair value. Impairments of EUR 3,490 thousand (2013:
EUR 425 thousand) were recorded on non-current financial receivables in the reporting year. Impairments of EUR
6,866 thousand (2013: EUR 8,562 thousand) were recognized for current financial receivables. Impairments of
EUR 99,526 thousand (2013: EUR 7,143 thousand) were recognized for trade receivables and impairments of
EUR 457 thousand (2013: EUR 44 thousand) were recognized for other current receivables and other current financial assets.

These commitments and potential obligations primarily serve as security for bank loans, contract performance,
warranty obligations, and advance payments. Most guarantees as of the reporting date related to participating interests and construction joint ventures. HOCHTIEF is also jointly and severally liable for all construction joint ventures in which it has an interest in Germany.
The syndicated credit and guarantee facility for EUR 2 billion taken out in December 2011 and extended ahead of
term in April 2014 continues to be a central long-term financing instrument for HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. The
syndicated facility has a guarantee tranche with a facility amount of EUR 1.5 billion, drawings on which amounted
to EUR 0.947 billion as of December 31, 2014 (2013: EUR 1.02 billion) and a EUR 500,000 thousand cash tranche,
which, as in the prior year, is undrawn as of December 31, 2014. The facility permits the furnishing of guarantees
for ordinary activities, mainly of the HOCHTIEF Europe division. The credit and guarantee facility had an initial term
of five years and was extended in April of the year under review to April 30, 2019.
In addition, the HOCHTIEF Group has available a further EUR 6.05 billion (2013: EUR 5.64 billion) in guarantee facilities provided by insurance companies and banks. This includes the EUR 944,096 thousand (2013: EUR 908,735
thousand) syndicated guarantee facility negotiated by Leighton Holdings in 2013. The latter facility has an initial
term of three years and is drawn in the amount of EUR 483,832 thousand (2013: EUR 690,862 thousand).
HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft has provided an unlimited bonding guarantee in favor of U.S. insurance companies
in respect of obligations of the Turner Group and the Flatiron Group. Bonding is a statutory form of security used in
the U.S. to guarantee performance of public projects. It is also used with other selected customers. The total bonding
amount is USD 6,500 million as in the prior year. USD 5,032 million was utilized in the year under review (2013: USD
4,027 million). No recourse has ever been made to this guarantee provided by HOCHTIEF, and none is currently anticipated for the future.
Group order exposure from awarded capital expenditure projects is EUR 22,521 thousand (2013: EUR 137,395
thousand) and mostly relates to mining activities at the Leighton Group.
Cash call commitments on financial assets totaled EUR 19,068 thousand (2013: EUR 36,817 thousand). EUR 13,059

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

The obligations from operating leases mainly relate to technical equipment and machinery leased by the Leighton
Group. Lease payments under operating leases were EUR 318,512 thousand in 2014 (2013: EUR 315,974 thousand).
Several non-consolidated companies in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division have a number of leasing arrangements.
The companies concerned are financed by third parties and HOCHTIEF itself holds neither interests in their equity
nor assets such as loans or receivables. Relevant activities are managed by third parties under contractual agreement, as a result of which they are not consolidated. The minimum lease payments under operating leases come
to EUR 244,789 thousand (2013: EUR 347,013 thousand).
Amounts due under long-term tenancies are EUR 194,499 thousand (2013: EUR 217,252 thousand). The term for
which such tenancies cannot be terminated is between two and 13 years (2013: two and 14 years). The amounts
due under tenancies are partly offset by anticipated rental income of EUR 90,046 thousand (2013: EUR 101,422
thousand).
Other financial obligations include EUR 116,453 thousand (2013: EUR 101,100 thousand) in commitments under
long-term contracts for the supply of goods and services.
Legal disputes
HOCHTIEF Group companies are involved in various legal disputes in the context of their operating activities.

Explanatory notes to the segmental data
Intersegment sales represent revenue generated between divisions. They are transacted on an arm’s length basis.
External sales mainly comprise revenue recognized using the percentage-of-completion method in the mainstream
construction business, construction management, and contract mining, in the amount of EUR 18,448,153 thousand
(2013: EUR 18,649,776 thousand). The sum of external sales and intersegment sales gives total sales revenue for
each division.
The share of profits and losses of equity-method associates and jointly controlled entities comprises income and
expenses, including impairment losses relating to companies accounted for using the equity method.
Depreciation and amortization relate to intangible assets with finite useful lives, property, plant and equipment, and
investment properties.
The impairment losses relate to intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment properties, and financial
assets.
Purchases comprise additions to intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment properties, equitymethod investments (excluding equity-method adjustments), subsidiaries, and other participating interests.
Total assets are equivalent to the divisions’ totals in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Gross debt equals total
assets minus consolidated shareholders’ equity.
Operational earnings (EBITA) are derived from earnings from operating activities as follows:

Operational earnings (EBITA)

The derivation of operational earnings from earnings from operating activities is based on the following considera­
tions:
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

Net income from participating interests contains all income and expense from equity stakes held for operational
purposes and is thus an integral part of the Group’s operational earnings.
Income and expenses classified as exceptional items for business management purposes or resulting from exceptional transactions hinder analysis of ordinary operations and should be attributed to non-operational earnings.
Consolidated earnings from operating activities were adjusted in the year under review by non-operational earnings of EUR 515,568 thousand (2013: EUR 105,049 thousand). The non-operational earnings item in the year
under review relates to an accounting provision to cover credit risk on project receivables in the HOCHTIEF Asia
Pacific division along with restructuring expenses.
37. Notes to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows classifies cash flows into operating, investing, and financing activities.
Exchange rate effects are eliminated and their influence on the cash position is disclosed separately. Changes in
cash and cash equivalents due to acquisitions and disposals of consolidated companies are shown separately under
cash used in or provided by investing activities. The EUR 309,079 thousand decrease (2013: EUR 16,720 thousand)
in cash and cash equivalents due to consolidation changes consists in its entirety of cash and cash equivalents
disposed of in divestments. The prior-year figure was the balance of EUR 21,936 thousand in cash and cash equivalents disposed of in divestments and EUR 5,216 thousand in cash and cash equivalents from acquisitions.

Group Report 2014

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

The EUR 2,585,359 thousand (2013: EUR 2,190,132 thousand) year-end total for cash and cash equivalents shown
on the cash flow statement matches the cash and cash equivalents item on the balance sheet. The total comprises
EUR 1,574 thousand (2013: EUR 1,988 thousand) in petty cash, EUR 2,316,922 thousand (2013: EUR 1,905,743
thousand) in cash balances at banks, and EUR 266,863 thousand (2013: EUR 282,401 thousand) in marketable
securities with maturities of no more than three months at the time of acquisition. Cash and cash equivalents to the
value of EUR 26,518 thousand are subject to restrictions (2013: EUR 65,553 thousand).
Net cash provided by operating activities represented a cash inflow of EUR 756,033 thousand. The balance of cash
flows relating to capital expenditure and asset disposals/divestments resulted in EUR 178,595 thousand in net cash
used in investing activities. The increase in the equity interest in Leighton Holdings, purchases of treasury stock,
and dividend payments made up the main factors in the cash outflow of EUR 375,809 thousand comprising net
cash used in financing activities. Including exchange rate changes, cash and cash equivalents increased overall by
EUR 395,227 thousand.
All non-cash income and expense and all income from asset disposals or arising on deconsolidation is eliminated
in net cash provided by or used for operating activities.
Net cash provided by operating activities included:
• Interest income of EUR 57,272 thousand (2013: EUR 46,119 thousand),
• Interest expenses of EUR 284,606 thousand (2013: EUR 312,629 thousand),
• Income tax paid amounting to EUR 81,792 thousand (2013: EUR 120,562 thousand).
After deducting the non-cash component of income from equity-accounted interests, net income received (as
dividends) from such interests was EUR 106,844 thousand (2013: EUR 195,557 thousand).
Divestments relate to the deconsolidation of fully consolidated subsidiaries. This reduced non-current assets by
EUR 342,708 thousand (2013: EUR 1,953,357 thousand) and current assets by EUR 1,665,507 thousand (2013:
EUR 334,661 thousand). Non-current liabilities decreased by EUR 60,192 thousand (2013: EUR 32,837 thousand)
and current liabilities by EUR 1,352,758 thousand (2013: EUR 324,588 thousand). As of the balance sheet date,
EUR 145,350 thousand (2013: EUR 2,131,612 thousand) of the EUR 1,067,124 thousand (2013: EUR 2,131,612
thousand) sale proceeds were settled in the form of cash and cash equivalents.
Dividends of EUR 103,964 thousand (2013: EUR 73,613 thousand) were paid to HOCHTIEF’s shareholders in the
year under review. Dividends paid to minority shareholders totaled EUR 108,120 thousand (2013: 357,608 thousand).
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

The prior-year figure included large cash outflows in connection with the sale of the airport business.
Debt repayments came to EUR 1,147,210 thousand (2013: EUR 2,757,684 thousand), compared with EUR 1,650,551
thousand (2013: EUR 2,617,671 thousand) in new borrowing.

The total financial assets of EUR 4,435,006 thousand include, under receivables from the sale of discontinued
operations, EUR 1,108,112 thousand in sale proceeds under the binding agreements for the sale of John Holland
and of the Services business at Thiess and Leighton Contractors. The cash inflow from these transactions is expected in the near future.
Financial assets are subject to certain restrictions on their use. Other than by financial liabilities, financial assets are
offset by advance payments from clients, cash call commitments on financial assets, and order exposure from
awarded capital expenditure projects. Advance payments from clients came to EUR 813,320 thousand (2013: EUR
173,393 thousand) and serve to fund contract costs. Cash call commitments on financial assets totaled EUR
19,068 thousand (2013: EUR 36,817 thousand), relating in the amount of EUR 13,059 thousand (2013: EUR
14,676 thousand) to PPP project companies in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division and EUR 6,009 thousand
(2013: EUR 22,141 thousand) to jointly controlled entities in the HOCHTIEF Europe division. Group order exposure
from awarded capital expenditure projects is EUR 22,521 thousand (2013: 137,395 thousand) and mostly relates to
the Leighton Group’s mining activities.
38. Related party disclosures
Significant related parties include ACS, the parent company of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. No material transactions were entered into between HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft or any Group company and ACS or its affiliates
during the year under review.
Further related parties comprise companies accounted for using the equity method that are material to the Group:
Sociedad Concesionaria Túnel San Cristobal S.A., and the Habtoor Leighton Group. Leighton Welspun Contractors is also included here pending its transition to a fully consolidated subsidiary. Material related parties also included aurelis Real Estate GmbH & Co. KG up to its deconsolidation in 2013.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Independent Auditors’ Report
We have audited the consolidated financial statements—comprising Group statement of earnings, consolidated
statement of comprehensive income, Group balance sheet, statement of cash flows, statement of changes in equity,
and notes to the consolidated financial statements, prepared by HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen/Germany,
as well as the group management report, which has been combined with the parent company’s management
­report for the financial year from January 1, to December 31, 2014. The preparation of the consolidated financial
statements and the group management report in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS), as applicable in the EU, and the regulations under German commercial law as complementarily applicable
under § 315a (1) German Commercial Code (HGB) is the responsibility of the Company’s Executive Board. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the group management report
based on our audit.
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with § 317 German Commercial
Code (HGB) in compliance with German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit such that misstatements materially affecting the presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with applicable accounting regulations and in the group management report are detected with reasonable assurance. Knowledge of
the business activities and the economic and legal environment of the Group and evaluations of possible misstatements are taken into account in the determination of audit procedures. The effectiveness of the accounting-related
internal control system and the evidence supporting the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and
the group management report are examined primarily on a test basis within the framework of the audit. The audit
includes assessing the annual financial statements of the companies included in consolidation, the determination
of the companies to be included in consolidation, the accounting and consolidation principles used and significant
estimates made by the Executive Board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial
statements and the group management report. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Our audit has not led to any reservations.
In our opinion, which is based on the results of our audit, the consolidated financial statements of HOCHTIEF
Aktiengesellschaft, Essen/Germany, comply with the IFRS, as applicable in the EU, and the regulations under GerConsolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

man commercial law as complementarily applicable under § 315a (1) German Commercial Code (HGB) and convey a true and fair view of the Group’s net assets, financial position and results of operations in accordance with
these regulations. The group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, conveys,
in the aggregate, a true and fair view of the Company’s and Group’s position and suitably presents the risks and
opportunities of future development.

MY
COMMUNITY

OUR
CONTRIBUTION
Economy: Economic growth and trade are dependent on access to markets. The right infrastructure
provides that access. We partnered with the non-profit organization Bridges to Prosperity again in 2014
and helped people in Rwanda, this time in the Ngororero district, gain better access to schools, markets,
and medical facilities. The new 54-meter-long footbridge over the Kiromozi River is used by some 350
locals every day.

Community: Ten HOCHTIEF employees worked with villagers to complete the bridge. This taught the locals
bridge-building skills they can now use and share with others. The HOCHTIEF group also learned a lot
about Rwandan culture. Team spirit remained high throughout the project and beyond.

Ecology: Our team used mostly regionally-sourced materials and simple tools to build the bridge. They
were careful to preserve the natural surroundings and leave the river’s flow undisturbed.

Glossary

Augmented reality
Supplementing the user’s view of the real world with computer-generated input, for example, by overlaying or superimposing images and videos containing additional information.
BREEAM
BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental
Assessment Method) is a UK-developed, internationally used
environmental assessment method for buildings. Based on
a straightforward scoring system with eight categories
(management, health and wellbeing, energy, transport, water,
material and waste, land use and ecology, and pollution),
BREEAM assigns assessed buildings an overall rating in
one of four rating bands.
Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index
The German Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index lists the
30 leading companies in terms of transparency with regard
to climate protection. The index is published by the Carbon
Disclosure Project, a global carbon transparency initiative
launched by institutional investors with the aim of collating
high-quality corporate climate-related information and making it publicly available. Using a standardized questionnaire,
the CDP annually surveys a wide range of companies—
including Germany’s 200 largest—on their climate protection policies and carbon emissions.
Cash flow
One of the key figures used to assess a company’s financial position. Represents the net inflow of funds from sales
and other operating activities.

Compliance
Compliance refers to conformity both with the law as well
as with internal rules and codes of conduct. The thematic
areas covered differ from company to company. The compliance function at HOCHTIEF is responsible for combating
corruption and economic crime.
Contract mining
In contract mining, a mine owner contracts out certain
operations to a service provider. HOCHTIEF’s Australian
Group company Leighton extracts commodities such as
ores and coal under long-term contract to mine owners.
Its services also include mine development and renaturali­
zation after mine closure.
DGNB (German Sustainable Building Council)
Since January 2009, the German Sustainable Building
Council (DGNB) has awarded DGNB certification to projects that are environmentally compatible, economically
efficient, and user-friendly. The certification system addresses all areas relevant to green building. Evaluation is
based on some 60 criteria in the categories environmental
performance, economy, sociocultural and functional aspects, technology, processes, and location. Certification
for outstanding performance in terms of the criteria is
awarded in gold, silver, or bronze. HOCHTIEF is a founding member of DGNB.
Directors and officers (D&O) insurance
D&O insurance is consequential loss insurance taken out
by a company for its decision-making boards. The insurance covers the boards’ personal liability risk from their
work for the company under company-law liability obligations.
Euroconstruct Group
A cooperation of several European research and consulting institutes that produces annual analyses of trends in
the European construction industry.
Financial close
Point in time when all the project and financing agreements have been signed and all the required conditions
contained in them have been met

Further Information

Long-term incentive plan (LTIP)
A long-term incentive plan is an incentives system or pay
component offered to selected managerial staff so that
they participate in the company’s long-term success, thus
securing their loyalty to the company.
Percentage of completion (PoC) method
Method of accounting for long-term contracts that computes the applicable costs and revenues generated by the
project up to the reporting date. Revenues, expense, and
earnings are thus reported in line with the progress of a project to date. This method supersedes the “realization principle” stipulated by the German Commercial Code, which
does not allow profits from construction contracts to be
recognized until the fiscal year in which a project is formally
accepted by the client.

Forward-looking statements
This Group Report contains forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the current views, expectations and assumptions of the Executive Board of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft concerning
future events and developments relating to HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and/or the HOCHTIEF Group and are based on information currently available to the Executive Board of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties and do not guarantee future results (such as profit before taxes or consolidated net profit) or developments (such as with regard to possible
­future divestments, general business activities or business strategy). Actual results (such as profit before taxes or consolidated net profit), dividends and other developments (such as with regard to possible
­future divestments, general business activities or business strategy) relating to HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and the HOCHTIEF Group may therefore differ materially from the expectations and assumptions described or implied in such statements due to, among other things, changes in the general economic, sectoral and competitive environment, capital market developments, currency exchange rate
fluctua­tions, changes in international and national laws and regulations, in particular with respect to tax laws and regulations, the conduct of other shareholders, and other factors. Any information provided on dividends is additionally subject to the recognition of a corresponding unappropriated net profit in the published separate financial statements of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft for the fiscal year
concerned and the adoption by the competent decision-making bodies of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft of appropriate resolutions taking into account the prevailing situation of the Company. Aside
from statutory publication obligations, HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft does not assume any obligations to update any forward-looking statements.
