TUI AG’S SUSTAINABILITY UPDATE

Sustainable Holidays Report 2014

Welcome
In December 2014, we completed the merger
of TUI Travel PLC and TUI AG to form the
world’s leading tourism business.
This Sustainability Update covers 2014,
the final year of TUI Travel’s three-year
Sustainable Holidays Plan ( pages 6 to 39),
and includes highlights of TUI AG’s
sustainability performance in 2014
( pages 40 to 47).
We are currently implementing our joint
sustainability programmes. The full details of
our 2020 sustainability strategy will be
released this Summer.

Future proofing our business
“TUI is the world’s leading tourism business – and leaders have to take
responsibility. Our society increasingly expects respected brands and
companies like TUI to demonstrate leadership for a sustainable future.
TUI has been recognised as a leader in sustainable tourism. We have
worked hard to embed environmental and social considerations into
business operations, because we believe it is vital to our company’s future.
We believe a clear focus on sustainability differentiates us from
the competition and generates value. Our listing in the Dow Jones
Sustainability Index for the ninth year in succession is endorsement of
our sustainability strategy, and is a spur to our unbroken commitment
to environmental, economic and social objectives. We also achieved joint
first place in the FTSE 350 with a ‘perfect 100’ score for climate change
reporting and transparency from the Carbon Disclosure Leadership
Index in the UK.

Our business case is clear. Sustainability delivers a range of benefits: cost
efficiencies, quality improvements and the enhanced engagement of our
stakeholders, including customers, colleagues, suppliers and destination
governments. It future-proofs our business and the global industry.
We are looking forward to continuing this record as TUI Group. Both
TUI Travel and TUI AG had a strong history and good reputation in this
area, and the joining of our businesses can only enhance and improve
our sustainability performance.
In short, sustainability is an integral component of a modern, efficient,
forward-thinking tourism company.’’

Stakeholder engagement
We communicate with our stakeholders – those who
have an interest in our company and its activities –
to help us develop as a business and to improve
our sustainable development strategy.
Our stakeholders include customers, colleagues,
investors, industry partners, academia, suppliers,
destination partners, governments, nongovernmental organisations and experts in
sustainable tourism. We engage with them regularly,
and incorporate their feedback into our plans.

We are conscious of the pressures that tourism can
place on local populations and resources. We work
in partnership with communities, governments and
others to support the sustainable management
of destinations. Our partners include the Global
Sustainable Tourism Council, the Dutch Association
of Travel Agents & Tour Operators, Deutscher
ReiseVerband, the UK’s travel industry association
ABTA, German development agency GIZ, and
The Travel Foundation.

As a tour operator flying 136 aircraft, our position on
aviation and climate change is particularly important.
We have developed collaborative partnerships with
several stakeholders whose insight and guidance
help us develop this position, including CDP, the
Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group (SAFUG),
Sustainable Aviation and Forum for the Future.

Driving sustainability
change at scale
‘’Looking back on the three years of our Sustainable
Holidays Plan, I’m pleased with the progress we
made in improving the sustainability impacts of
our business.
Following years of sustained effort to reduce fuel
consumption, our airlines are now Europe’s most
carbon efficient. In 2014, TUI airlines’ CO2 emissions
were just 69.9g per revenue passenger kilometre, and
over the last three years we tracked more than €53
million in savings from environmental efficiencies
across TUI Travel’s operations.

Jane Ashton

We also exceeded our ambition to deliver 10 million
‘greener and fairer’ holidays, taking over 11.5 million
customers to hotels with credible sustainability
certifications between 2012 and 2014.
Finally, we committed to taking customers with us
on our journey. Holidaymakers in five of our six key
source markets now rank us as the number one
holiday company for sustainability.
The future looks even more exciting. Following the
merger of TUI Travel PLC and TUI AG in December
2014, we are implementing our joint sustainability
programmes. The full details of our sustainability
strategy will be released this Summer and will
capitalise on the sustainability ethos of both
businesses and set clear, stretching goals for 2020.
We do not underestimate the sustainability challenges
that lie ahead. With international tourist arrivals set
to grow from 1.1 billion in 2014 to 1.8 billion by 2030,
we recognise a responsibility to seek new ways of
protecting the finite natural resources on which our
own business and the travel industry depend, whilst
maximising the social and economic benefits that
holidays can create for host destinations.’’
Jane Ashton,
Group Director of Sustainability, TUI Group

SUSTAINABLE HOLIDAYS PLAN
In this section we report back on the third and final year
of TUI Travel’s Sustainable Holidays Plan.

“It is often easy for companies like TUI who have a clear leadership position on sustainable
tourism, to sit back and let the rest of the industry catch up. But instead, TUI continues to strive
for excellence. Not only do we see tangible performance improvements on carbon, but TUI keeps
pioneering better ways for the whole industry to operate. The Group is determined that they, and
the wider industry, add economic value to destinations, but not at a cost to sustainability. The
resulting Total Impact Measurement and Management pilot of a way to evaluate a tour operator’s
economic impact, alongside social and environmental costs and benefits is really commendable.
It shows the value that the industry can bring, but also highlights the areas such as energy and
upskilling local people where more could be done. We need to be careful about numbers as absolute
truths, but pioneering this approach for the industry could shape the way that both destinations
and tour operators measure future performance – and that is what leadership is all about!’’

Destinations certifications
The travel and tourism sector accounts for 9%
of the world’s GDP, is responsible for one in 11 jobs
globally1 and is the main source of foreign exchange
in one-third of developing countries2.
We are proud of the positive role our industry
plays in the world, but we know that travel and
tourism can also have unintended negative
consequences. Our industry faces some significant
environmental challenges: water, for example, is
likely to become increasingly scarce in the coming
decades, particularly in island states. In addition,
the socio-economic impacts of tourism can be
complex, and vary widely across the world.

Our challenge is to maximise the positive social and
economic impacts of tourism in all our destinations,
and to minimise environmental impacts. Where
possible, we want to do so in partnership with
destination governments.
Recent UN research shows that only 34% of
countries said that their tourism sector was guided
by a ‘sustainable tourism’ policy3 – so there is a
real opportunity for us to support the inclusion of
sustainability considerations into tourism planning.
Greener and fairer
We encourage our hotels to implement credible
sustainability certifications to show their
commitment to social and environmental good
practice. As well as being good for the environment
and people, we have also found that our most
sustainably-managed hotels deliver higher quality
and customer satisfaction.

PERFORMANCE

We lend particular support to the Travelife
sustainability certification scheme. TUI is the largest
supporter of Travelife, and we featured over 540
hotels with this certification in 2014. We play an
active role on the Travelife Board and Steering
Committee and helped to develop new, stricter
criteria which were launched in June 2014. The new
criteria adhere to international standards (including
GSTC and Ecolabel standards) and cover areas such
as: reducing waste and use of water, energy and
harmful chemicals, supporting the local community
and protecting employees, human rights and wildlife.
www.travelife.org

Between 2012 and 2014, the number of hotels
we highlighted with sustainability certifications
increased considerably, from 850 to 5,900. Of
these, approximately 1,300 were GSTC recognised
schemes, and the remainder were environmental
management standards.

We will deliver 10 million ‘greener and fairer’ holidays. We will measure
this by the number of customers we take to hotels with credible sustainability
certifications from 2012-2014, e.g. sustainability certifications working with
the Global Sustainable Tourism Council (such as Travelife) and international
environmental management standards such as ISO 14001 and EMAS.
We took over 5.5 million customers to hotels with credible sustainability
certifications in 2014, making a total of 11.5 million since 2012.

2

We define a ‘credible sustainability certification’ as
one recognised by the Global Sustainable Tourism
Council (GSTC) or which conforms to international
environmental standards such as ISO 14001 and
the European Union’s Eco-Management and Audit
Scheme (EMAS) standard.
www.gstcouncil.org

GOAL BY 2015:

PERFORMANCE

1

Our goal was to deliver 10 million ‘greener and fairer’
holidays (that is, hotels with credible sustainability
certifications) between 2012 and 2014. In 2014, we
took over 5.5 million customers to hotels certified as
sustainable, bringing our total to 11.5 million customers
since 2012 – much higher than our initial goal.

ACHIEVED

In Winter 2013/14 and Summer
2014 we featured over 5,900 hotels
with sustainability certifications
(up from 850 in 2012).

www.tuigroup.com
TUI UK & Ireland was the first travel company
in the UK to be certified to the Travelife
standard for tour operators. Sawadee also

was the first major travel company in the
world to be certified, in 2013.

Destinations measuring impacts
Measuring tourism’s impact
We are trialling a ‘big picture’ approach to measuring and
understanding the impact of tourism. In partnership with The
Travel Foundation, and using a methodology developed by
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), we aim to value the various
economic, fiscal, social and environmental impacts of tourism
in Cyprus.
PwC’s Total Impact Measurement & Management (TIMM)
framework will be applied to our tourism operations, focusing
on a selection of hotels in Cyprus. This is the first time the
methodology has been applied to tourism. Cyprus was chosen
for this project as it is a mainstream destination, and an
important one for TUI.

All the impacts will be measured and valued, so that they can
be considered alongside the more traditional financial metrics
used for strategic business decisions. The impact of transport
to and from the hotels, hotel operations, the entire tourism
supply chain within Cyprus, and customer and employee
spending impacts were all within scope, covering aspects of
tourism such as: working conditions, social and community
benefits, local economic benefits, and tax contributions.
The Travel Foundation will be publishing a white paper in
Summer 2015.
www.thetravelfoundation.org.uk
Read more about TIMM on the PwC website:
www.pwc.com

The pilot project is expected to provide new insights into the
impacts, both positive and negative, of mainstream tourism
on a holiday destination and to highlight the practical
implications of undertaking holistic impact measurement
more widely in the industry and/or in other destinations.

Destinations human rights
Commitment to human rights
Human rights are basic rights that allow individuals the freedom to lead a
dignified life, free from fear or want, and free to express independent beliefs.
TUI is committed to the protection of human rights in compliance with
applicable laws, conventions and regulations throughout our worldwide
operations.
We acknowledge the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and
have many policies and initiatives in place to identify, prevent, mitigate and
account for how we are addressing key human rights issues and challenges.
• TUI signed up to the UN Global Compact in September 2014, committing
the Group to 10 universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights,
labour, environment and anti-corruption. www.unglobalcompact.org
• Our employee Code of Conduct commits us to respecting and observing
human rights.
• Our Supplier Code of Conduct sets out the minimum standards we expect
from suppliers and their employees, contractors, agents and subsidiaries
when working on our behalf. The code covers human rights and labour laws,
support for local communities and environmental impacts, as well as bribery
and corruption.

• Our internal policies, practices and guidelines also cover anti-discrimination,
grievance and whistle-blowing procedures, health & safety, sustainability,
anti-bribery & corruption, fraud, conflicts of interest, data protection and
security, various sanctions and third party due diligence.
• TUI joined Transparency International UK’s Business Integrity Forum in 2014.
• We have been named a Top Member of the Code of Conduct for the
Protection of Children from Sexual Exploitation in Travel & Tourism in 2014
and our businesses support child protection projects and campaigns.
• The majority of our businesses have incorporated environmental and social
minimum standards into contracts for accommodation suppliers.
• We reached our goal to deliver 10 million ‘greener and fairer’ holidays and to
encourage our hotel suppliers to implement credible sustainability
certifications. Travelife is the system of choice for the majority of our
businesses and we helped them to develop new, stricter criteria, including
human rights (incorporating the principles of the Ethical Trading Base Code),
which were launched in 2014.
We continue to work with stakeholders to understand and respond to human
rights issues better.

In 2014, we refreshed our programme to
raise awareness of child protection issues with
our colleagues across our ground handling
businesses. As part of the Don’t Look Away
campaign, colleagues were sent a video,
reporting procedure framework and access
to online training to help them identify and
report suspected cases of child exploitation.

TUI has formed a three-year
partnership with the German
development agency GIZ,
The Code and other industry
partners to focus on child
protection in Thailand.

TUI Nederland won the

– for example, our tour operator in the
Netherlands publishes a regular e-newsletter
on sustainability for suppliers.
• Many of our businesses recognise their top
performing sustainability hotels. TUI UK &
Ireland presented an award to Kassandra Bay
Resort in Skiathos, Greece, in 2014 because
of its impressive efforts to source locally. TUI
Deutschland named Hotel Casabela in Portugal
their top TUI Environmental Champion due to
excellent customer feedback on sustainability.
• We have an animal welfare strategy in place
across TUI, and audit attractions against the
Global Welfare Guidance for Animals in Tourism.
www.tuitravelplc.com

• We have incorporated environmental and
social minimum standards into contracts with
accommodation and excursion suppliers.
• The TUI Supplier Code of Conduct, launched in
2013, sets out the minimum standards we expect
from suppliers.
• We organised supplier workshops on
sustainability in Germany, Greece, Italy,
Morocco, Spain, Tunisia and Turkey in 2014.

PERFORMANCE

PARTIALLY ACHIEVED

66% of our 321 differentiated hotels had a
sustainability certification in 2014, up from
17% (of 202 hotels) in our baseline year (2011).

Differentiated hotels
We classify a portion of our hotels as ‘differentiated’.
These are hotels which offer experiences carefully
designed by us to meet the specific needs of the
target customer. Within the Sustainable Holidays
Plan, we focused on differentiated hotels as we are
the exclusive customer within our source markets,
and we have a level of influence and control over
how they operate. This means we can make a real
difference to their sustainability performance.
We have incorporated energy and water
consumption benchmarks – and, in 2014, social
criteria – into our contracts with differentiated
hotels (see Commitment #4 for details).

Destinations working with suppliers
Differentiated hotels continued
These goals proved to be some of the most difficult
in our Sustainable Holidays Plan, for two main
reasons:
• Differentiated hotels are popular with customers
and TUI’s strategy is to increase our offering
in this area. That means our target group of
differentiated hotels increased every year (from
202 in 2011 to 321 in 2014) – and new hotels
needed some time to make the changes required
to gain their certification.
• We increased the robustness of our certification
criteria each year to ensure our standards were
always at the leading edge of best practice. In
particular, we helped to develop new, stricter
criteria for Travelife in 2014. That means that
the bar was set higher for our hotels – and that
many still have work to do to meet our targets.

Commitment #4
Our differentiated hotels
will achieve an average
24kWh and 400 litres
for energy and water
consumption per person

Even though we haven’t achieved all our targets
in this area, we’re still proud of the progress we
made against them. Hotel sustainability is a critical
element of making our holidays special, and we’ll
continue to support and encourage our suppliers to
improve their performance and seek certification.
Our differentiated hotels met the energy
benchmark we set them, on average reducing
energy consumption per person per night by
10% between 2012 and 2014. We targeted a
20% reduction in water consumption at our
differentiated hotels and had made good
progress in 2013 – but the new additions to our
differentiated hotel portfolio in 2014 increased
average water consumption significantly. Since
water is likely to become scarcer in many
destinations, this is a critical area for us to
influence.

PERFORMANCE
PARTIALLY ACHIEVED

Our differentiated hotels achieved an
average 23.9kWh energy consumption
per person per night in 2014, compared
to 27.1kWh in 2011.1 This represents
a reduction of 10%, even though the
number of hotels in our target group
doubled in this period.

Monitoring and improving local economic
contribution
Monitoring and improving the local economic
contribution of a hotel is challenging. In 2013, we
invested in a system which has allowed us to track
and influence the environmental impact of some
of our key suppliers, as well as to begin to monitor
social indicators such as local employment and
procurement.

In 2014, we worked with global experts to better
understand the local economic contribution of our
hotels so that we can seek to improve our impacts.

Information provided by 170 hoteliers shows the
following socio-economic benefits from our hotels:
• 58% of employees in these hotels are from the
local region (and 89% are from the same country)
• 45% of food is from the local region (and 80%
is from the same country)
• These hotels have a ratio of around one staff
member to four guests
Blue Village Aegean Park in Rhodes uses cuttingedge geo-thermal cooling for air-conditioning

Water consumption at our differentiated
hotels decreased from 516 litres per person
per night in 2011 to 513 litres in 2014.2 The
hotels in the 2013 target group had reduced
their water consumption to 470 litres per
person per night, but the additions to our
portfolio in 2014 were heavier water users
and increased the average significantly. We
will continue to work with our differentiated
hotels – particularly the new additions –
to reduce water consumption.

We gather data from as many of our differentiated hotels as possible. Our energy data from 2014 is based on 262 hotels
(out of 321 differentiated hotels) and the baseline data from 2011 was based on 124 hotels (out of 202 differentiated hotels).
Our water data from 2014 is based on 248 hotels and the baseline data from 2011 was based on 102 hotels.

Carbon reporting
The challenge of climate change has never been more urgent than today.
We know that the future must be a low-carbon one, and we need to prepare
for it by reducing our environmental impact, and encouraging our suppliers,
customers and the rest of our industry to do the same.
Our customers trust us to make their holiday experiences special. But many
of the things that make a holiday special – beautiful destinations, predictable
weather and personal comfort – are threatened by climate change.
Travel and tourism accounts for around 5% of global carbon emissions1,
half of which is attributable to aviation. In 2014, TUI’s carbon footprint was
6,242,792 tonnes of CO2 and emissions from aviation account for over 88%
of our carbon footprint.
That is why carbon management is a critical part of our business practices.
Our carbon management strategy covers not only aviation but also hotels,
major premises, retail shops, water transport and ground transport emissions.
Managing our carbon footprint also saves us money, now and in the future.
Across TUI, improved management of energy, natural resources and fuel has
saved a total of €53 million over the last three years (2012-2014)2.

Carbon reporting
We have been reporting our carbon emissions on a voluntary basis for many
years now, and have done so transparently and consistently. We use the airline
carbon intensity metric of grams of CO2 per revenue passenger kilometre (RPK),
and have commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to audit and verify
this metric.
Some of our industry peers report with the same level of transparency, but
many do not. We believe that a standard metric and methodology for aviation
carbon reporting would create the basis for fair and informative comparisons
between airlines, enabling those holidaymakers who monitor their carbon
footprint to make an informed choice of airline.
TUI has reported on all of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission sources
required under the UK Companies Act 2006 (Strategic and Directors’ Reports
Regulations 2013). We have also invested in a web-based sustainability data
software solution that has improved the accuracy of our data. We report
on carbon, water and waste and socio-economic data.
For more details on our reporting, see the Data section on

page 38.

TUI was ranked joint first in the FTSE350 in the UK,
with a score of 100%, for our approach to carbon
disclosure and governance (CDP, 2014). This placed
TUI in the Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index

GOAL BY 2015:

PERFORMANCE

We will operate Europe’s most fuel-efficient
airlines and save more than 20,000 tonnes
of carbon from our ground operations.
We will measure this through TUI airlines’
average carbon emissions per revenue passenger
kilometre (gCO2/RPK) and CO2 saved from our
major premises, retail outlets, brochure paper
production, differentiated hotels and fleets
of vehicles (against 2011 baseline).

TUI airlines’ carbon emissions were 69.9g per revenue passenger kilometre
(gCO2/RPK) in 2014, making our airlines the most fuel-efficient in Europe.
TUIfly was independently ranked the world’s most climate-efficient airline
with more than one million passengers per year in the 2014 atmosfair Airline
Index, for the second year in a row. Against our baseline year, we saved
17,580 tonnes of carbon from our ground operations, largely through
reducing emissions from retail shops, brochure print runs and ground
transport. We fell short of our 20,000 target as the hotel occupancy rates
increased significantly.

Sustainable fuels
Sustainable fuels represent a real opportunity for the aviation industry
to reduce its carbon footprint. There has been significant progress in
recent years, but sustainable fuels are not yet financially competitive
with kerosene, the current aviation fuel.
TUI is a Council member of Sustainable Aviation, which brings together
key players in the UK aviation industry – including airlines, airports
and manufacturers – to discuss the challenges and opportunities for
aviation in the long term. We contributed to Sustainable Aviation’s
roadmap for sustainable fuels, published in December 2014 which
outlined some key points to help accelerate the commercialisation
of sustainable aviation fuels.

In 2014, TUIfly Nordic joined the Nordic Initiative for Sustainable
Aviation (NISA), which brings together key players from the Nordic
aviation sector to push forward the development of sustainable
aviation fuels.
TUI Nederland’s airline Arkefly is partnering with AlgaePARC (part of
Wageningen University and Research Centre in the Netherlands) to
facilitate the development of sustainable biofuel from algae. An algae
photobioreactor has been sponsored as part of the partnership.
TUI is also a member of SAFUG (Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users
Group), a coalition of global airlines that account for approximately
one-third of global aviation fuel use.

Recycling on-board
Our airlines are recycling as much cabin waste as possible, focusing
on drink cans, paper and plastic bottles. Reducing cabin waste is an
operational challenge because of space constraints, international
legislation regarding catering waste and, in some cases, lack of recycling
infrastructure at airports. In 2014, waste was segregated on 66% of
TUI airline flights, up from 58% in 2013.
Thomson Airways also donated over £100,000 worth of recycled
old-style crew uniforms to a Luton-based homelessness charity called
NOAH, to be used by those who need them for job interviews and
work placements.
ISO 14001 certifications

Sustainable Aviation believes that, with the right policy and investment
framework, UK aviation can reduce its CO2 emissions by up to 24% by
2050 through sustainable alternative fuels. This could generate up to
£265 million in economic value for the UK, and support up to 4,400 jobs.
www.sustainableaviation.co.uk

All five of our charter airlines are now covered by the internationally
recognised ISO 14001 environmental management certification
scheme, with Arkefly achieving their certification in September 2014,
and Jetairfly in February 2015.

Reducing CO2 emissions from offices, shops
and brochures
We focus our carbon reduction efforts on our 50
major premises – most of which are offices with over
100 people in them – and from 1,650 retail shops.
Highlights:
• TUI Nordic was the first tour operator in the
region to achieve ISO 14001 certification in
2014 and TUI Deutschland successfully renewed
its ISO 14001 certification, which it has held
since 2003.
• An ‘energy dashboard’ was rolled out to all
Thomson and First Choice shops, giving a simple,
real-time indication of how each shop is
performing against its energy targets. It has
helped reduce CO2 emissions by 24% over three
years. When the behaviourial change aspect was
introduced in the fourth year we achieved

a 19% reduction in a single year. Retail shop
managers were able to respond to regular
updates, follow advice and encourage their
teams to be proactive to save energy.
• TUI UK & Ireland achieved the international
energy management standard ISO 50001
in January 2015.
• Since 2012, we have reduced CO2 emissions
from the manufacture of brochures by 51%.
TUI Deutschland reduced brochure pages by
4.7 billion between 2011 and 2014.
• The TUI Digital Assistant app is a ‘one stop shop’
for everything customers need when booking a
holiday and preparing for their trip. It has now
been downloaded over 1.4 million times, and is
available in eight countries. The app has made
significant reductions to customer printed
material.

Greener cruising
Our water transport operations make up the third
largest area of TUI’s carbon footprint, contributing
just over 4% of our total carbon emissions. We are
committed to making environmental improvements
in this area of our business.
Thomson Cruises is the UK’s third largest cruise line,
carrying 250,000 passengers per year. It operates
five cruise ships in destinations including the
Mediterranean, Canaries and Caribbean.
The company has introduced a wide range of more
efficient procedures and technology including single
engine running, or drifting on passage, where speeds
allow; so that the engines can run at their most
efficient speed and installing new equipment on
board, from the laundry to air conditioning plant –
cutting the demand for energy produced by the ship.

We operate over 800 vehicles and we have been
working to make measurable environmental
improvements across these operations. We have
reduced CO2 emissions by 22% over the last
three years.
Ultramar, our largest ground transport company,
based in Spain and carrying 10 million passengers
per year, has several measures in place to improve
fuel efficiency. These include training drivers on
more efficient driving techniques, investing in
new, fuel-efficient vehicles, and installing satellite
navigation in all vehicles to monitor fuel consumption.

TUI AG’S SUSTAINABILITY UPDATE

Sustainable Holidays Report 2014

Colleagues engagement
Today’s employees are motivated not only by money
and status, but also by the knowledge that their
employer’s values align with their own. This is even
more evident among young people: 80% of 13-25
year olds want to work for a company that cares
about its impact on society1 .
Our employee Code of Conduct sets out clearly
the behaviours we expect from all our colleagues.
It includes human rights, business ethics and
transparency, and is inspired by the guiding
principles of the UN Global Compact.
We were shortlisted for an HR Excellence Award in
2014 for embedding the Sustainable Holidays Plan
throughout our Company. We want our colleagues
across the world to consider TUI a leader in
sustainability, and to feel that they can take action
in their day-to-day lives.

GOAL BY 2015:
Our colleagues will rate TUI as a
leader in sustainability
We will measure this through the Your
Voice global opinion survey results
– aiming to meet High Performing
Company scores for responsibility
towards the environment and
community for all colleagues and
senior leaders.

Sustainability training
We are embedding sustainability into key parts of
the training calendar – for example, inductions
for new starters – and also deliver bespoke
sustainability training where it is needed.
For example:
• Sustainability is part of online learning platforms
– for example, TUI Nederland has developed
seven sustainable tourism modules for colleagues
and TUI UK has rolled out a new online induction
for retail with sustainability as a core module.
Thomson Airways also rolled out an
environmental management system e-learning
module designed to engage its teams of people
right across the airline, i.e. colleagues in In-Flight
Operations, Cabin Crew, Engineering, Ground &
Customer Operations.

PERFORMANCE
PARTIALLY ACHIEVED

Your Voice was last undertaken in 2012,
and was due to be repeated in 2014.
However, our merger at the end of 2014
meant that our HR department’s priority
was to ensure a successful transition, and
the survey did not take place. We plan to
launch a new TUI-wide employee survey
in 2015. Our most recent results are from

www.forbes.com
Sustainable Development Evaluation 2014 (weighted by colleague numbers)

• Face-to-face sustainability training is also key
– for example, TUI Nordic delivered sustainability
training to sales colleagues in Stockholm this year.
• TUI’s Learning and Development team worked
with City & Guilds to develop a new, innovative
qualification that includes two units on
sustainability – nearly 100 colleagues are
currently working towards this qualification.
• Our international graduates work on a
sustainability challenge during their 18-month
placement – for example, developing sustainable
excursions and sustainability features for hotels.
• The business case for sustainability is integrated
into our ‘high potential’ training programmes
across TUI.

2012, when 74% of colleagues agreed that
we act responsibly on environmental
matters, 68% agreed that we are socially
responsible, and 78% of senior leaders
agreed with both statements.
That means we won’t be able to judge
our progress against this Sustainable
Holidays Plan goal. We will develop a
colleague engagement metric alongside
our next sustainability strategy.

PERFORMANCE

ACHIEVED

In 2014, 74% of our businesses cover sustainability in inductions and 74%
of our businesses offered training on sustainability for colleagues (both
up from 71% in 2012)2. Our businesses have been particularly focused on
training customer-facing colleagues in retail and in resort. Sustainability
has been embedded into Group management development programmes.

Motivating our colleagues
We want our colleagues to take action on
sustainability, and we communicate both our
successes and challenges on sustainability, so that
they understand why we are committed to further
improvement.
Our local communications teams use their expertise
to choose the best channels for their audience.
Across TUI, sustainability information can be found
in recruitment materials, intranets, newsletters,
inductions, blogs by senior managers, short videos
and e-learning modules.
Here is a selection of initiatives from 2014:
• Specialist Holidays Group organised a
sustainability week with a different theme
for each day, including Go-Green Tuesday
and Switch Off Friday.

• TUI Belgium organised a free breakfast for
colleagues who cycled to work during their
sustainability event in March.
• TUI Nederland produced an engaging booklet
on sustainability to share with colleagues, and
a dedicated newsletter for their product
department.
• TUI UK & Ireland had a sustainability stand at
a company-wide Product Day and a dedicated
Sustainability Day (as part of Make Holidays
Greener month) with stalls from local producers
and a very popular clothes swapping event.
• TUI Deutschland also organised a Sustainability
Day, encouraging colleagues to cycle to work
together and shared information about TUI’s
sustainability-related projects.

Commitment #15
We will launch a Group-wide sustainability communications
campaign

PERFORMANCE

ACHIEVED

98% of our businesses communicate with colleagues on sustainable
development1 (up from 91% in 2011). During 2014, sustainability
has been further embedded into Group communication channels
including the TUI e-magazine, intranet, fortnightly e-newsletters,
and sustainability campaigns and competitions.

Sustainable Development Evaluation 2014 (weighted by colleague numbers).

Many of these initiatives are now annual events,
showing their enduring popularity with TUI
colleagues.
Champion networks
Our networks of sustainability champions stretch
across the whole of TUI, bringing together
colleagues who know how to inspire change in their
area of the business. For example, TUI Nordic runs
a network of ISO-coordinators who helped to
implement ISO 14001, TUI Deutschland has a group
of environmental ambassadors who meet regularly
and help to raise awareness of sustainability, TUI
Nederland has placed sustainability champions in
each product department, and TUI UK & Ireland
has established champion networks in retail, head
office and overseas.

In 2014, championed by the HR Director and
executed by the reward team, TUI UK & Ireland
added a Sustainability category to its annual
recognition awards. The category recognises
individuals who played their part in delivering our
sustainability strategy. Sarah Clarke, IT Project
Manager, was the winner in 2014 because of her
endless energy when working on sustainability
projects, striving to advocate sustainability among
her colleagues.

Bee campaign We ran a colleague campaign to support a beekeeping
community in Mexico that had recently started a business selling honeybased products to nearby hotels, including TUI ones. The project was
kick-started by the Travel Foundation. We received over 1,600 ‘likes’
from colleagues (for every ‘like’ TUI donated €1.50) which was then
matched by the business raising over €5,000 for the project.
www.tuigroup.com
We also ran a competition for colleagues to win some of the products.
One winner from Germany said: “It is great that TUI provides our guests
in our hotels with very special and carefully selected natural cosmetics that
are locally produced! This will contribute to a unique customer experience
for the guest, adding to special memories about their TUI holiday!”

contributed over €4.4 million to more than 70
charities. We are the largest corporate sponsor
of the Family Holiday Association, a charity that
provides simple holidays for disadvantaged children

appointed its President in 2013 with other senior
leaders from TUI providing their time e.g. by being
Trustees.
Colleagues working for our B2B websites and
ground handling agencies supported more than
20 charities and good causes across the world.
Many of these good causes were local charities and
hospitals in destinations such as Peru, Sri Lanka
and India, who received donations of food, clothes
and toys as part of a Christmas charity campaign.

Sustainable tourism competition
During 2014, we ran a TUI-wide competition
asking for our colleagues’ tips on how to make
holidays ‘greener and fairer’. Colleagues from TUI
Benelux, TUI France, TUI UK & Ireland, in our
destinations and specialist and activity businesses
and Group functions submitted their top tips,
including using refillable drinking bottles, looking
for hotels with sustainability certifications,
encouraging use of public transport, supporting

local attractions, shops, restaurants and crafts,
packing lighter, and saving water with shorter
showers. The winner, chosen by Salli Felton,
CEO of the Travel Foundation, was the idea for
each destination to provide a set of tips for
holidaymakers, to help them make eco-friendly
choices and provide valuable information about
the destination. We will be looking to see how we
can implement many of these ideas throughout
the customer journey.

In July 2014, TUI organised a series of beach cleans for the Travel Foundation’s
Big Holiday Beach Clean, part of Make Holidays Greener month. The purpose
of the campaign is to build understanding of the simple steps that everyone
can take to protect the environment and local wildlife on holiday. Teams of
colleagues from across the world, including Cape Verde, Dominican Republic,
Greece, Jamaica, Mexico, Portugal, Spain, Sri Lanka, Turkey and the UK, took part.

Community volunteering programmes are one of the most popular ways in
which we engage our people in sustainability. Colleague volunteering has a
positive impact not only on the projects, but on our volunteers as well, allowing
them to experience sustainable tourism firsthand and to develop their own skills.

TUI organised over 30 beach cleans in 20 destinations, involving 700 colleagues
and holidaymakers. Approximately 400 bags of rubbish were collected,
representing over 35,000 pieces of rubbish from 30 kilometres of beach
worldwide.
In one region in Spain, our annual beach clean has prompted the municipality
to reinstate the official beach cleaning service.

Commitment #16

PERFORMANCE

PARTIALLY ACHIEVED

We have been able to track 33,000 hours of colleague volunteering since 2012, but
we believe that the real number of hours dedicated to volunteering is much higher
than those we have captured in our data. We know that 80% of our businesses
support volunteering1, an increase of 7% since 2011, and many of our businesses
allow colleagues one day per year to volunteer for a charity in their local area,
many of them using the opportunity to work together in teams further enhancing
collaboration and team work when back in the office. In our next strategy we will
look at other ways to measure our colleagues’ contribution to the community.

Project Discovery

Lending a hand in the Dominican Republic

Jill Carter, Director of Retail at TUI UK, visited Montego Bay as part of our Project
Discovery overseas volunteering scheme. Jill, who is also responsible for developing
knowledge of sustainability among the company’s retail teams in the UK, used her
skills to help villagers at the Rastafari Indigenous Village to develop a tour. The trip
had a profound effect on Jill. “Since the trip, I’ve been thinking about what I can do to
incorporate everything I learnt into a training plan,” she says. “I was passionate before
the trip, but it was a really overwhelming experience.” Project Discovery, run by TUI
UK & Ireland in partnership with The Travel Foundation, has been running since 2007,
and has taken 86 volunteers to 31 sustainable tourism projects in 18 destinations.

In July 2014, over 30 TUI colleagues in the Dominican Republic supported
a month-long summer camp for 40 children at Juanillo Basic School.
The theme of the camp was ‘recycling’, brought to life through painting,
drawing, gardening, crafts, jewellery, African dance and Zumba. Thirty
TUI employees participated in these activities, and also organised a
movie night for the children, showing the environmentally-themed
film The Lorax. The camp ended with an exhibition of all the projects
undertaken by all the children, as well as performances of zumba
dance, moonwalking and a sale of desserts donated by employees.

Colleagues innovation
Ideas come to life
In the first year of our Sustainable Holidays Plan, we
ran the Green Ideas Factory competition, asking for
colleague ideas on how we can green our business
and generate commercial benefits. We had over 120
ideas from 18 countries and nearly 1,500 colleagues
voted for their favourite idea. Now, at the end of our
Sustainable Holidays Plan, we look back to see how
many of the ideas and themes have come to life
across the Group.
Greener airlines
• One of the winning Green Ideas Factory
submissions was implemented in early 2014, as
Jetairfly introduced electric cars for ground
colleagues at Brussels Airport. Arkefly has also
introduced electric vehicles at Schiphol Airport,
Amsterdam – its main operating base.

• Colleagues from Arkefly suggested a central
hub for new airline sustainability ideas. We have
since established a dedicated network of airline
environmental managers from across TUI, who
meet regularly to share best practice.
Going digital
• There has been a significant reduction in
brochures across the business – a reduction of
22% in brochure pages in the last year alone.
• Two of our airlines, TUIfly and Thomson Airways,
have switched to e-ticketing.
• The TUI Digital Assistant app has now been
rolled out in eight countries and downloaded
over 1.4 million times as a ‘one stop shop’ for
everything a customer needs to maximise their
holiday experience before and during their
holiday. This has reduced customer printed
material.

Volunteering for the
environment
Many of our colleagues’ ideas
covered how we can work together
to conserve the local environment.
We have several volunteering
schemes in place across the Group,
with colleagues dedicating tens of
thousands of hours to local causes.
page 28

• Many technological trials have taken place in
resort, including digital welcome meetings, free
Wi-Fi on transfers, digital notice boards in resorts,
and airline and resort colleagues using iPads.
Many of these trials have been rolled out more
widely.
Choosing sustainable hotels
• We have been working hard with our hotel
suppliers to encourage them to achieve
sustainability certifications. We now highlight
approximately 5,000 hotels with sustainability
certifications, up from 700 in 2012.
• We also took 11.5 million customers to these
hotels over three years, exceeding our target
of 10 million.
• Our tour operators and B2B websites such as
hotelbeds.com and bedsonline.com are making
it easier for customers to find these hotels by
using logos and search functions.

Making our excursions greener
• In Summer 2014, the Collection was launched –
a set of excursions tailored to give customers
a true taste of the destination. As well as other
criteria, excursions have to meet specific
sustainability standards in order to be included
in the Collection. page 33
• Sustainability clauses have been integrated into
contracts with excursion suppliers and we helped
develop and roll out animal welfare guidelines
across TUI.
• The ‘shared transfer’ initiative (where customers
from different TUI source markets travelling to
the same hotels join the same coach) from our
destinations services team has been very
successful and has now been rolled out in many
destinations.

Commitment #17
We will drive product and process
innovations through sustainability

PERFORMANCE

ACHIEVED

The focus in 2014 was on implementing the ideas
generated via the Green Ideas Factory colleague
innovation competition launched in the first year
of the strategy. Many of the ideas submitted by
our colleagues have now come to fruition.

Customers insights
Our customers are critical to delivering some of our
most important sustainability goals. We need to
make sure that clear links are made between
sustainability and the holiday experiences they
value, and encourage them to take action in a way
that is engaging and memorable.
Recent research from the German Federal Ministry
of the Environment1 found that 61% of consumers
want to book a sustainable holiday. This mirrors
our own research2 which also found that modern
mainstream consumers are more engaged with
sustainability compared to traditional mainstream
consumers:

• One in two would be willing to book a more
sustainable holiday if available
• One in two want their holiday company to be
clear about what they do to make their holidays
more sustainable
• They are more interested in social and community
issues than traditional mainstream consumers
• The sustainability aspects that interest them
most in the destination are: fair working
conditions; learning about the country and the
people; and changing their behaviour to help
the environment.

We have also found a positive correlation between
more sustainable holidays and customer
satisfaction3. This confirms our belief that our
sustainability commitments support the drivers of
consumer holiday preference – price, quality, food,
service and unique destinations. Minimising waste
in energy and resources helps us deliver value for
money. Hotels that treat their people and the local
environment with consideration are developing a
quality product with friendly staff. Beautiful and
unique destinations rely on the tourism industry
for protection.
Our goal is for TUI brands to be recognised for
providing customers with more sustainable holidays.
We measure this through our annual brand
performance survey in key source markets, carried
out by an independent company.

The Collection
The Collection is a set of new, exclusive excursions
that have been tailored to give customers a true
taste of the destination. They were launched in
2014 and are now offered by the majority of our
tour operators.
Each excursion in the Collection must be exclusive
to TUI and meet specific criteria for sustainability
(based on ABTA’s sustainable excursion criteria),
showing that it is bringing benefit to local people
and minimising its impact on the environment.
Over 84,000 customers enjoyed these excursions
last year, and customer satisfaction research
showed that they valued the ‘sustainability’ and
‘local flavour’ aspects most of all.

GOAL BY 2015:
Customers will regard TUI as a leader in delivering more sustainable holidays
We will measure this by our performance in consumer research in our key source markets.

PERFORMANCE

PARTIALLY ACHIEVED

Consumers in five of our six key source markets (Belgium, France, Germany, the
Netherlands and Sweden) consider our brands to be the leading holiday companies in
terms of environmental and social responsibility in 2014. In the UK, we were ranked
second. Fritidsresor, our brand in Sweden, was named the most sustainable travel
company in Sweden in the 2014 Sustainable Brand Index and by the Differ survey.

crayons, an inflatable ball and an SOS children’s bracelet.
The contents are carried in a backpack made from recycled

reduced by more than a quarter to save weight on-board
the aircraft which saves fuel.

PERFORMANCE

ACHIEVED

We have engaged 6.1 million holidaymakers in sustainable tourism since

Customers communicating sustainability
Sustainability is not yet a primary driver of
consumer preference for mainstream holidays.
But the more we link the aspects of a holiday that
we know customers value (quality hotels, great
food, friendly staff and unique destinations) to
sustainability, the more we will build a shared
understanding of its role in supporting what makes
holidays special. Most of TUl’s businesses
communicate with customers on sustainability.
In 2014, many of our businesses enhanced the
sustainability content on their websites:
• TUI Deutschland revised and updated its
sustainability website, including its TUI
Environmental Champion and EcoResort
hotels. www.unternehmen.tui.com
• TUI Nederland developed a sustainable
accommodation landing page. www.arke.nl

• TUI Nordic enhanced functionality so
customers can search for hotels with
sustainability certifications on its websites.
www.fritidsresor.se
• Hotelbeds used a logo to highlight over 5,000
hotels with sustainability certifications on its
B2B website. www.hotelbeds.com
As an integrated tour operator, our relationship
with customers is unique because of the many
touchpoints along the customer journey. This
gives us an opportunity to communicate with
customers throughout their holiday, and really
bring sustainability to life. We plan to focus on
this area over the coming years.
For example:
• Research stage – we communicate how we
are managing the impacts of holidays and
highlight ‘greener and fairer’ hotels (those
with sustainability certifications) using logos.

Group Sustainable Development Evaluation

The scope of this report from pages 6 to 37 in the
Sustainable Holidays Plan section includes data
and progress on sustainable development activities
from businesses owned by TUI Travel. Data is for
the financial year 2013/14 (referred to throughout
as 2014 or FY2014), running from 1 October 2013 to
30 September 2014, except where otherwise stated.
We have indicated where data refers to joint ventures
or Group suppliers.

The 2014 Group Sustainable Development
Evaluation was used to assess and report on
performance from our businesses across the Group.
The 2014 Evaluation consisted of questions relating
to Embedding Sustainable Development, Carbon
Management, Destinations, Colleagues and
Customers.

Data sources
For this report we gathered data for our
performance indicators from two main sources: the
2014 Group Sustainable Development Evaluation
and our 2014 annual sustainability data collection
process.

In December 2014, the Evaluation was sent to the
Managing Directors of TUI Travel businesses, and
responses represented over 51,000 colleagues.
To ensure the responses reflected the size of the
businesses that responded, we weighted them
by colleague numbers.
In September 2014, we sent an amended version
of the Group Sustainable Development Evaluation
to TUI Travel’s hotels and cruise ship operations.

We tailored the survey questions to the recipients,
focusing on their carbon emissions and
environmental management practices. The survey
was sent to the environmental managers of our
differentiated hotels and the operations directors
of our cruise businesses.
Carbon Disclosure Project
In 2014, for the seventh consecutive year, TUI Travel
was featured in the Climate Disclosure Leadership
Index. TUI Travel is the only tour operator to be
featured in this index and our score places us in the
top 10% of the FTSE 350 for our approach to carbon
disclosure, governance and performance.

Greenhouse gas emissions

We continue to improve our airlines’ carbon emissions
per passenger km, replacing older, less efficient aircraft
and driving a programme of fuel conservation across
our airlines. This has helped us reduce our carbon
emissions per passenger km by 10.3% since FY2008.

During FY2014, TUI Travel further developed their
a web-based sustainability data software solution.
Using multiple methods of data capture, this software
has enabled us to improve data accuracy and provide
advanced monitoring and reporting tools. This has
allowed us to comply fully with UK mandatory
greenhouse gas reporting requirements with robust
and auditable data.

TUI Travel has reported on all of the greenhouse gas
(GHG) emission sources required under the Companies
Act 2006 (Strategic and Directors’ Reports Regulations
2013). The organisational boundary used for its
Scope 1 & 2 and, where appropriate, Scope 3 inventory
of GHG emissions is operational control and it
corresponds to the Company’s consolidated financial
statements. TUI Travel is disclosing carbon dioxide
equivalent (CO2e) data for both its absolute and relative
emissions. CO2e refers to CO2 and the other five
Kyoto GHGs – (Methane (CH4); Nitrous oxide (N2O);
Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs); Perfluorocarbons
(PFCs); and Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).

In FY2014, the efficiency of TUI Travel airlines was
69.9g of CO2 per revenue passenger kilometre (CO2/
RPK). TUI Travel cruise and expedition ship operations
emitted an average of 301g CO2/RPK in FY2014.
In FY2014 the total water footprint from TUI Travel’s
differentiated hotel properties was 19,436 million cubic
metres of water.

‘’Tourism plays a hugely positive role
across the world, delivering nearly 10%
of global jobs and GDP. It also generates
significant indirect and induced economic
benefit – a ripple effect that is particularly
important in developing countries, where
tourism is often a significant export.

Thomas Ellerbeck

2014 saw TUI AG continue its excellent
track record on sustainability.
In September, we signed the UN Global
Compact, committing TUI AG to 10
universally accepted principles in the areas
of human rights, labour, environment
and anti-corruption. TUI’s employee
Code of Conduct, which applies to all its
businesses, is inspired by the guiding
principles of the Global Compact.
In 2014, TUI Cruises launched Mein Schiff 3,
a cruise ship with exceptional environmental
credentials. It is 30% more carbon efficient
than comparable ships and sets a new
standard for the industry.
I am proud of our ongoing commitment to
training for young people in destinations.
Three of our Robinson Clubs support
hospitality training schools, ensuring a
strong future for the tourism industry and
fulfilling careers for the next generation.

greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants –
TUI Cruises has optimised voyages continually and
improved intelligent route planning. Furthermore,
silicone anti-fouling paint has been applied to the
hulls of all its vessels. This enhances flow dynamics,
as do the ducktails installed on the aft ship.

More sustainable shore excursions

Protecting biodiversity

The ‘green and fair’ category of shore excursions
was introduced in 2013. The shore excursion
department has developed clear criteria for ‘green
and fair’ excursions and used these to highlight tours
that are particularly environmentally and socially
beneficial.

In the field of marine biodiversity, TUI Cruises is
working with the SECORE foundation, a leading
coral conservation initiative, to protect coral reefs.
With the support of TUI Cruises, SECORE designs
restoration measures to counteract the decline of
the reefs.

Guests have responded very well to the excursions
offered in this category. For every ticket booked,
TUI Cruises donates €5 to environmental projects
and organisations. During Summer and Winter
2014/2015, more than €100,000 was raised in this
way for charitable purposes.

A coral breeding station in Curaçao, Dutch Antilles
nurtures endangered elkhorn corals and transplants
them along the reefs. This means that the project is
not only helping to preserve and develop the coral
reefs on Curaçao, but also contributing new insights
into the restoration of coral, which will support the
protection of threatened coral species all over the
world.

Hapag-Lloyd Cruises has four ships and
is the leading provider of expedition and luxury
cruises to the German-speaking market.
On-board technology and ship management
Hapag-Lloyd Cruises are equipped with modern
environmental technology, maintained through
regular shipyard stays and enhanced with stateof-the-art technological features. All ships have
seawater desalination systems for water treatment,
a biological sewage treatment system for
wastewater, TBT-free underwater coatings and
modern waste incinerators.

Responsibility for the management of the ships
is assumed by Hapag-Lloyd AG, which is certified
in accordance with ISO 14001 (environmental
management) and ISO 9001 (quality management).
Efficient cruising
All Hapag-Lloyd Cruises routes are calculated on
the basis of an economical average speed which
is significantly lower than the ship’s maximum
performance. This lowers fuel consumption by
approximately one third – currently one of the
best and most effective methods of reducing
fuel consumption.

Cruising in the polar regions

Offsetting CO2 emissions

As a member of the International Association of
Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO), Hapag-Lloyd
Cruises observes their guidelines on all Arctic and
Antarctic voyages. In order to protect the sensitive
polar waters, the cruise ships use marine diesel
rather than heavy fuel oil. The cruise company
also engages customers and crew in saving energy,
and use efficient on-board technologies to reduce
energy consumption.

In partnership with the climate protection
organisation atmosfair, Hapag-Lloyd Cruises is
the first cruise operator to offer its guests the
opportunity to offset their cruise-only carbon
emissions. Using an online climate calculator,
passengers can calculate the greenhouse gas
emissions of their cruise in advance and offset
them by contributing to a project that provides
solar lamps in rural areas of India. A quarter of the
offset amount is paid by Hapag-Lloyd Cruises.

in holiday hotels and is audited by independent,
accredited specialists. It focuses on commitment
to sustainable development, and environmental
performance must always be evident to the guests.

Hotels and clubs in the TUI Hotels & Resorts

they have been ranked among the TUI Environment
Champions and hold a recognised international or
national environmental standard. As well as sound
environmental performance, they must also
demonstrate commitment to improving their local
socio-economic impact. In 2015, 44 hotels displayed

The EcoResort website describes in detail how
the TUI hotel brands express their responsibility

The Robinson Clubs in Spain and Portugal annually
generate more than 1,500 megawatt hours with
their solar collectors and photovoltaic arrays,
providing the energy to heat up to 85 % of the hot
water consumed. The Iberotel Palm Garden in
Turkey also covers 75% of its hot water consumption
as well as the energy for heating the children’s and
baby pool with a photovoltaic system. The Robinson
Club Agadir uses a solar system with a total area
of 900m² – the largest for a hotel in Morocco – to
produce hot water and keep the pool complex warm.

TUI owns over 220 hotels, including brands such
as RIU, Grecotel and Robinson Club. TUI Hotels
& Resorts brands are among the environmental
leaders in their destinations and are committed
to climate protection.

Many clubs and hotels in the TUI Hotels & Resorts
portfolio obtain their energy from renewable
sources.

Heat production in the Robinson Club Cala Serena
in Mallorca is entirely carbon neutral. Three 200-kW
biomass boilers generate hot water, heating and
pool heating. Thanks to the installation of a wood
pellet system, around 220,000 litres of conventional
heating oil are saved every year.
The Dorfhotel Sylt has committed to local
sustainability by installing an extremely efficient
gas-fired combined heat and power (CHP)
generator. The power station has the capacity to
produce 680 megawatt-hours of heat per year
(MWh/a) and 392 MWh/a of electricity, which
would be enough to supply power to around 100
households. This has the potential to cut annual
emissions of CO2 by approximately 165 tonnes.

Water

Waste

Water is one of the most precious resources on the
planet. In some countries of the world, including
many holiday destinations, demand for water
exceeds natural reserves. TUI Hotels & Resorts
has implemented several measures to save water
and steadily cut water consumption per guest
and bednight. Hotel guests are informed about
ways of saving water.

Controlled waste management aims to conserve
resources, reduce environmental impacts and
costs, and recycle waste into a recovery loop.
TUI Hotels & Resorts implement many measures
to cut waste volumes. It starts with buying more
local or regional produce, as long as it is available
in appropriate quantities and quality. This avoids
unnecessary food miles and additional packaging.
The Grecotels on Crete, for example, obtain fresh
food from their own Agreco Farm, which supplies
the hotels with organic fruit and vegetables.

Many hotels use endemic plants for their gardens,
as they are ideally adjusted to the environmental
conditions. Drip irrigation at times of the day when
the sun is less intense helps save precious water
supplies. Some RIU hotels also use xeriscaping,
which involves investigating factors such as climate
conditions, light and soil conditions before selecting
suitable plants.

There has also been a focus on separating waste
materials, increasing reuse, and disposing of waste
properly. However, this approach depends in part
on local infrastructure for waste disposal and
processing.

Castelfalfi
A little medieval village in Tuscany, which lost its last
resident in the 1960s and had been largely neglected
ever since, is now the nucleus of a tourism project
launched by TUI AG. The 1,100-hectare Castelfalfi
estate is being carefully restored by TUI in an
investment programme worth €250 million, with the
involvement of local stakeholders. The renovation
project of Castelfalfi has been developed in line with
the latest environmental considerations by applying
the most sensitive environmental techniques and the

Plastic waste poses a particular danger at sea,
because it can be eaten by marine life or enter the
food chain indirectly by being ground down over
time. Robinson Club Maldives is avoiding waste from
plastic bottles thanks to its sustainable treatment
of drinking water. In June 2013, the Club began
operating its own soda-making facility. The system
uses reverse osmosis to desalinate and purify
seawater. By adding minerals and carbonic acid, the
freshly generated drinking water is converted into
soda water and decanted into one of 7,500 new glass
bottles, which are cleaned locally. This cuts out plastic
waste altogether, eliminating the transport and
disposal of around 400,000 plastic bottles annually.

alternative sources of energy. At the heart of the

Biodiversity

Sea turtles

As a global business, we are aware that our activities
have an impact on biodiversity at the local, regional
and global levels. At the same time, tourism is more
dependent than almost any other economic sector on
having an intact environment and natural landscape.

Since 2011, RIU Hotels & Resorts and the

joint projects to protect sea turtles on the Cape Verde
island of Boa Vista. RIU provides logistical and
financial support to the organisation in all its projects.

TUI has defined biodiversity quality and action
targets, which are implemented throughout the
Group in the form of specific programmes.
Achievements are reviewed on a regular basis, and
comprehensive internal and external communication
is provided, including on the Group’s website.
Through model projects, partnerships and actions
of our own, we also hope to influence opinion among
the decision-makers in destination countries.

In Cape Verde, the egg-laying and nesting season
for sea turtles begins in July and continues until
mid-October. Boa Vista’s Lacaçao beach, where the
Riu Touareg hotel is located, attracts especially large
numbers of breeding turtles. Every night, rangers
watch over the egg laying, protecting the animals
and later moving the nests to a safe place where
the eggs can hatch in peace.

To educate tourists and the local population,
RIU supports BIOS.CV with its information and
awareness-raising campaigns. Weekly events
for guests are held at the Riu Touareg, including
documentaries about biodiversity in the area and
details of the measures that are being taken to
protect the environment.
Other projects to protect endangered sea turtles
are carried out by the TUI hotel brands Iberotel in
Turkey, Grecotel in Greece and Robinson on the
Canary Islands, always in partnership with local
conservation groups.

TUI has developed a souvenir guide in
cooperation with the Federal Agency for
Nature Conservation (BfN). In destinations
where this kind of information is needed,
‘TUI’s Little Guide to Preserving Species’
briefs TUI customers about illegal souvenirs
associated with endangered species and
about alternatives that promote the local
economy.

Costa Rica: A biological hotspot
RIU has set up a private conservation area in Costa Rica.
The protected site covers 200 hectares of land in the
coastal mountain range of Matapalo, close to two of the
company’s hotels. The reserve is home to more than 250
plant and animal species – some of them facing extinction
– and is therefore extremely valuable for biodiversity in
the region. The site is also part of the biological corridor
called Chorotega, helping to maintain vital links between
the nature conservation areas.

By designating this area as a protected zone, RIU is playing
a significant role in preserving the unique flora and fauna
of Costa Rica. A detailed management plan has been
drawn up, setting out all the measures and activities to
be undertaken – including combating illegal hunting and
preventing forest fires. To preserve Costa Rica’s natural
heritage in the long term, there is close cooperation with
the national Ministry of Environment and Energy under
the SINAC Programme (Sistema Nacional de Areas de
Conservación).

TUI AG Good causes

It was back in 1995 that TUI companies based in Hanover began collecting for
charity, selecting one charitable project to adopt each year. Since then, colleagues
in Hanover have raised around €530,000 for these good causes. The projects have
ranged from counselling groups via educational day centres and free lunches for
disadvantaged children, to associations helping children suffering from cancer.
Funds are raised over a period of twelve months through sale events and collections.
In 2014, TUI’s good cause was an outpatient hospice serving children and teenagers
in the region around Hanover. AKHD provides emotional and financial support for
youngsters confronting a terminal illness, and also for their parents and siblings.

TUI Foundation
In 2000, TUI set up a trust, the TUI Stiftung, to mark the 75th
anniversary of Preussag AG, now TUI AG. Since its inception, the
trust has funded projects to the tune of nearly €5 million, and it is
endowed with capital of €12.5 million. The purpose of the trust is
to promote education and training for children and young people,
culture and the arts. The TUI Stiftung is currently amending its
profile, and from 2015 has started to run projects of its own in
the field of education and culture.
