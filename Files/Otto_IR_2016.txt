Ho w the future of w ork is
al ready changing us to day

We’re in the midst of a revolution. Those who
have been working for a long time know full well
what it felt like, say 20 years ago, to go to work.
The job was dictated by the time clock, chains of
command were clearly defined, and creativity
primarily meant guessing what would please the
boss.
Things are changing drastically. In a company
like the Otto Group, this change is perceptible at
all levels. These days, it is crucial for good ideas
to gain acceptance quickly – regardless of who

This annual report focuses on the future of
work. To this end, we invited external experts
to engage in discussion. Together, we investigate why strict hierarchies are becoming
obsolete and what focusing on the needs
of the customers means for our day-to-day
business. We ask what tools can be used to
promote this work transformation and how
robots and artificial intelligence will fundamentally change our practices.
For these discussions, we visited places

push the limits so that our employees have all the creative
possibilities. And we intend to push the limits when it
comes to developing bigger ideas for our future and
society as a whole.
The things we need to achieve our goals are what we
want to create every day: a clear view of our customers’
future needs, the huge opportunities offered by a digital
world, the unimagined possibilities of even closer collaboration between our colleagues, and the fascinating
opportunity of getting the best people and keeping them
inspired. Last but not least, we have pushed the limits

Over the previous financial year,
which was mostly overseen by my predecessor Hans-Otto Schrader, we saw our
e-commerce sales increase by more than
EUR 500 million to over EURO 7 billion –
from existing business. In achieving this, the
Otto Group has consolidated its key position
as one of the world’s leading online retailers.
We are proud to say that our company – full
of its own traditions – has become a world
champion of transformation in the international retail market.
But it would be dangerous just to keep
looking back in an intensely competitive
market with so many major digital players.
We are looking forward. I and my fellow
Board Members have worked together
to set the ambitious target of taking the
Otto Group on a strong path to sustainable
growth again.
We already have what we need to
achieve this – our 50,000 or so colleagues.
It is our firm intention to push the limits
together. This is what our new Purpose
says – one that we devised with thousands
of colleagues. We intend to push the limits

When did you last have to admit that one of your employees was
right, not you?
B O D O JA NSSEN
That happens to me every day. So often that
I do not even think in the categories right and wrong any
more, and no longer claim to know better. My colleagues
often have much more insight into specific topics and have
ideas that are much more effective than mine.
ALEX A N DER BIRKEN
I’m very familiar with that. Just yesterday
we discussed a major event in which we will be bringing
together the managers of the entire Group. I had very clear
ideas as to how this event should take place. But then there
were quite different ideas – and finally I was happy to admit
that they were much better.
What you’re just saying – that bosses can be told what to do –
would have been very much the exception years ago. Why is a
new corporate culture so important today?
AB
I think that the social upheaval triggered by digitisation
is the most powerful change since the Renaissance. We
cannot fully predict this yet, because we are in the middle
of it. The new technical possibilities have a massive impact
on how we communicate, how we perceive, how we shop
and how we work, in short: how we live. Generation Y –
those born between 1980 and 1990 – has completely
different demands with regard to jobs than the generations before.
BJ
Most corporate structures come from the late nineteenth
century. This was a militarised society in which people went
to work with a kind of sense of duty. Their personality was
given up at the factory gate. That’s over now. I believe
that the next generations will increasingly also perceive
themselves as spiritual beings who no longer want to
separate work and leisure.

Is it a matter of a more equitable work-life balance?
The term work-life balance has bothered me for a long
time. It suggests that the moment I go to work, I stop
living. And when I stop working, I start living again. I think
such an attitude makes you ill in the long run. People
also want to be alive at work, and to evolve in their work.
I would like to think my colleagues are happy to go to
work, that they don’t regard it as opposed to life. We also
initiated the Kulturwandel 4.0 (cultural change) process
in the Otto Group for that reason. I’m firmly convinced
that if we don’t commit to radical changes, we have no
chance of survival.
How so?
AB
The upheavals in the Internet business of the past ten
years have been disruptive. E-commerce is now entirely
dominated by mobile devices. Even our wall units are
bought via smartphone today. The world has changed. If
I only react to it, I’m too slow and too passive. It’s about
speed and agility. With rigid structures you can no longer
do justice to the demands of today.
Can you give up control and build up speed at the same time?
BJ
It can actually only be done this way. In our company, it’s
been our experience that the teams that have a high
degree of self-determination and are not subject to classic
management have the highest degree of innovation. And
that’s speed. Innovation is only about speed.
AB
A rigid structure that works through military values such
as orders and obedience hinders agility. We know this from
the software engineering area, where agile methods are
now commonplace. We know that only with these methods
are we able to react quickly to changes in technology so
that we remain competitive.
AB

OTTO

GROUP

– Annual Report 2016/17

Mr. Janssen, you have subjected your company,
a family-run hotel chain, to a massive transformation. It used to be very hierarchical. Today,
you emphasise values such as own initiative,
self-organisation and humanity. How do you
organise such a change?
BJ
I consider management as a service. I
believe management should have only
one goal: to support people in becoming
aware of themselves, their own abilities
and inclinations. The task of management
is to accompany this process and then to
give colleagues the tasks that correspond
to their personality. If this is how you
understand management, change is
something quite natural.
AB
In the Otto Group we simply try out a lot
of things. We are in a test phase, which is
also a kind of cultural change – just look
and see if it works. For example, we have
started to hold what are called stand-ups.
Anyone who wants to can come along. And
I, or a colleague, stand at the front, give a
talk, and then virtually anything can be
discussed.
BJ
We have a kind of internal Facebook.
There are no barriers, which means the
dishwashers can look at everything I am
working on if they want. Everyone can see
everything. There are no secrets. This is
symbolic of our corporate culture.
But all change provokes resistance.
BJ
Resistance – the word sounds so negative.
But it’s central to any change. We know
this from the human body. When we
do sport, we need resistance to grow.
We need resistance; it’s essential to
develop strength. And this also applies
to the company. Resistance is a very
important factor, provided it arises out
of a constructive attitude. Destructive or purely passive
resistance is problematic. But my experience here is also
that if you openly approach people and engage with them,
you can use this productively.
AB
I think the biggest changeover process is actually taking
place in middle management. These are often colleagues
who have been part of the company for many years,
who have grown into their role and a certain type of
management. I always encourage colleagues to articulate
very clearly what they have a problem with. Various
channels must be open for that. One person is keen to
express their criticism at a stand-up in front of a large
audience. Others have a problem with this – but they also
have to be heard.
Can a change process such as Kulturwandel 4.0 also trigger
anxiety?
AB
Of course. As a manager, I have to face this. The question
of attitude is key to the entire cultural change. You have
to be aware of why you act and how to behave towards
others. This applies to individuals as well as to entire
business areas. Anxieties are often initiated by unconscious
triggers – but if you become clear about them, half the
anxiety is already gone and you can work with it.

Janssen

The task of management is to enable employees to be aware
of their inner attitude. And when they are self-aware, they
are freer from external things such as status, recognition,
position, function. If you base everything on only that, there
is a risk that is breaks away once change happens. This
creates anxiety. But if you’re aware of what you stand for,
what you can do to make sure you yourself are a key player
and not just a plaything, then strength comes from this –
and you’re ready to endure the complexities that changes
bring. Or even to make use of them.

GROUP

– Annual Report 2016/17

Do you find it difficult to exemplify what you expect from your
colleagues every day?
AB
Of course. You’re always falling into the efficiency trap. Often
the days are clocked by countless telephone calls, conferences
and other prescribed topics. This is something you want to
complete quickly and efficiently, but you can also quickly lose
what’s important to us: listening to each other, interacting
with each other, perceiving each other. I still catch myself out
too often. Then I tell myself: Alexander, you should have taken
two or five minutes for the other person. This is all the more
important since the process of transformation in which we
find ourselves is completely open. We say quite honestly that
we don’t know how it will all end. We are getting involved in
something we no longer control completely. This is in itself
already an incredible cultural change. But it only works if this
openness is accompanied by a different openness: constant
dialogue with our colleagues.
B J 	Anyone who wants to manage others must first learn to
manage themselves. And this is an incredibly difficult task
that you have to face again and again every day.
What does the transformation process mean for corporate
culture? Aren’t you running the risk of losing your identity?
A B 	To do this, we first have to define the corporate culture we’re
talking about. Each company in the Otto Group has its own.
We’re firmly convinced that it’s a good thing, because this
is the only way to trade meaningfully or provide services
appropriately in the various countries. But of course, there’s
something like a common thread which runs through all Otto
Group companies. It has something to do with passion for the
customer, but above all, with a sense of responsibility – and
the process in which we find ourselves at the moment doesn’t
challenge this. It’s rather the expression of this consciousness
that we have responsibility.
What does this actually mean?
A B  
That, for example, we should shape
relationships with our suppliers in such a way
as to create reasonable working conditions.
If we want to buy products made under
humane circumstances, that costs money in
case of doubt. But I’m firmly convinced that
this is becoming more and more important –
and that customers also pay more attention
to this and hold us responsible.
B J   
The sensual orientation can be a decisive
sales argument. If I have two similar
products, and behind one is a company that
stands for something that is reasonable to
the customer, he will decide for it. This also
applies in the company. We talked about
generation Y before. Their representatives
no longer give up their personality at the
factory gate. These colleagues are not only
bound to the company by money. They want
to do something meaningful. Responsibility
and meaning are clearly the unique defining
characteristics of the future. Profitability is
only the basis of our existence. The purpose
of our actions is to make people successful.

At a time when no one was even talking much
about these issues, our company founder
Werner Otto said something very similar:
“Our employees are not there for the company
– the company is there for our employees.”

LEADERSHIP

A modern corporate culture can only stand the test of time if company
executives live and breathe it. In the Otto Group, various measures
help to pave the way to fewer managerial levels, more teamwork and
greater individual freedom. The target: more openness and thus greater
opportunities to respond quickly and flexibly to the market.

AGILE COMMUNITY

T

R
E

It’s not only line managers who think of
ways to make their teams more agile.
Employees also discuss how they can help
management to act with greater agility.
To put it another way – what is the actual
benefit of adopting agile methods in project
management? Issues such as these are
regularly covered by the “Agile Community”
at Barcamps – a group dedicated to incorporating agile methods, approaches and
processes into individual Group companies.
#Agilegroupie.

AGILE RECRUITING

18

Recruitment today takes on a new
dimension. Whether an applicant will fit
to the team and adapt to the corporate
culture are just as important as his or her
professional qualifications. Applicants
also place increasingly higher demands
on employers and expect the recruitment
process to move along at a significantly
faster pace. Agile recruiting methods are
designed to meet the requirements of
both parties. Processes have been streamlined – for instance, OTTO no longer asks

E
R
V

for a covering letter. And the departments
have a greater role to play. In short – more
scope for the ideal match.

H Y B R I D P R O J E C T
D E V E L O P M E N T
Satisfying the customer with a maximum of
individual responsibility for those involved
and short project cycles are the goal of
agile project development in the Otto
Group. This is combined with elements of
classic management such as planning and
reporting – a hybrid approach that is showing
best results.

MARKET PLACE FOR
I N T R A P R E N E U R S

The goal: a start-up culture within the
Group, using the crowd as a resource. The
intrapreneur market place is how we get
there. Employees upload an idea, which is
then assessed by the internal crowd who
invest credits during a fund-raising phase.
Successful ideas are then further developed
with the entrepreneur along the lines of a
business concept. Ultimately, the Executive
Board makes a clear-cut decision on whether

or not to set the ball rolling. Manufactum has
been acting as the pilot company for this so
far, but the option will soon be available to
other companies within the Otto Group.

L E A D    F A C T O R Y

Agile management means establishing
a framework to encourage optimum,
independent responsibility. The “Lead Factory”
helps young managers in this process. Experienced mentors recount their practical experiences. At the same time, effective tools are
provided to help reflecting on their own performance.

3 6 0 °    F E E D B A C K

Something that is completely normal for
employees can also be extremely useful
for line managers: feedback on the quality
of their work. The Otto Group uses a
professional tool from the Cut-E company
for this purpose. Internal and external
feedback providers are recommended
using an automated, anonymous system.
The outcome is not a rigid evaluation but
constructive feedback on the personal development of the line manager.

PERFORMANCE

“In the monthly letter, decisions are now
­e xplained, not just proclaimed. We feel involved now. This makes selling fun again!
But we must continue to find new ways to
­a ddress our customers. Maybe the range
needs to be adapted to local customers.”

The Witt Group from Weiden is demonstrating that cultural
change is not a feel-good measure, in fact it boosts
business. Today, the over-the-counter retail business
runs just as smoothly as the mail-order business.
Turnover per square meter sales area is increasing.
That has not always been the case. However, some smart
counter-measures were taken, with employees taking
the central role. The conclusion is that only someone
who is passionate about the company can take care of
the customers in a friendly and personal way. Three
employees talk about the changes.

WE ARE
WITT!
“The need to make savings and development
oppressed the mood in
2012, so the most important thing was clear,
open communication.
That had to become the
norm for us. Today, the
customer is in the centre of attention. He isn’t
interested in our internal processes.”

Previously, board meetings were similar to a black box.
You knew that they took place and that important things
were negotiated there – but most of the employees did not
know what exactly these things were. Since mid-2016, this
has not been the case: following these meetings, a Member
of the Executive Board reports on the key decisions in
a video. This is published promptly via ottogroupnet,
the Group-wide collaboration platform. Management Board
meetings at Bonprix are held in the same vein: up to four
employees can now attend in person as guests, a video of
the Management Board made immediately after the meeting
sums up the results for all employees. At the British
company, Freemans Grattan Holdings (FGH), the Chairman
of the Executive Board informs his staff about current
strategic considerations and economic development on a
quarterly basis, transparently and openly.

This is how inhibition thresholds are broken down. Dr Rainer
Hillebrand,
Member
of
the
Executive
Board,
personally
addressed all employees’ questions concerning Kulturwandel
4.0 (cultural change) at the
Heine-Casino. The same principle – dialogue across hierarchies – is taking place at OTTO,
EOS and also at Group level:
at lunch. Here, employees can
chat with Members of the Executive or Management Board quite
freely
about
anything
and
everything, put forward ideas
or simply brainstorm together.
Another open format now also
being practised in the Otto
Group is called Fishbowl: a
round table in which discussions are held in a small group
and the rest listens, can step
into the group themselves and
ask questions – for example to
CEO Alexander Birken.

CONTINUE!
A whole Group has been set in motion
with Kulturwandel 4.0 (cultural change).
To make further use of this momentum,
the Culture Cup has been awarded within
the Otto Group. The first prize went to the
Shopping 24 Internet Group. The operator
of product search engines was convincing
due to its transparency, cooperation and
rapid decision-making. Shopping  24
was able to record not only a significant
increase in revenue, but also above-­average
levels of employee satisfaction. This
was also confirmed by the independent
rating portal Kununu, which distinguished Shopping 24 as the best German
employer in the retail and consumer
goods sector for the second time in a row.

Can you remember a really good recent shopping experience?
N EEL A M O N TG O M ERY
Yes. It was with Lego. My boys are
‘Lego-crazy’. Not only did the company know who I was
but also how old my kids were and even which characters
they liked.
You bought online?
NM
I did. Then I decided to go into a store and the staff had
exactly the same information when I walked in. That’s very
impressive because often you can have quite a disjointed
experience between the store and online. This was a a
great example of simple but effective personalization.
AN DREW D O HERT Y
I bought the Google Pixel phone. I actually
wanted to hold it in my hands before I bought it. But I
couldn’t because there is no physical place to see, touch
and buy that phone. So I had to take a leap of faith that
the phone would impress me. And it did.
What are the main differences between customer behavior today
and in the 1990s?
AD
I like to compare shopping with television 25 years ago
when we were told what to watch and when to watch it.
The decisions were made for us by the networks. But now,
if I want to watch all of Game of Thrones in one go, I can.
In the past we were being told what to buy by retailers,
but now we’re seeing that consumers are not only free to
decide what they want to buy, but also very importantly,
when they want to buy it, and from where.
NM
That‘s true. These days customers are more influenced
by many things beyond the control of retailers. That’s an
essential change enabled by technology specifically social
media. Customers want to get information from other
customers. Today, brands are no longer defined by what

they say about themselves but what others say about
them.
Would you say that the customer is in the lead today?
NM
Definitely. The customer has more options than ever before.
Brands don’t have the same access to customers that they
used to enjoy. So we all have to be more creative, more
inventive – that’s why bloggers and networks/platforms
have become so powerful within that dynamic.
AD
We are exposed to so much aspirational imagery today. We
see one of our favourite movie stars, bloggers, or favourite

OTTO

GROUP

– Annual Report 2016/17

youtubers, using a product and nobody is talking
about the product in a way that says “Please buy
this” – The products are just being used, or seen in
a natural way, and this has a very powerful effect
on customers.
What role does personalization play today and in the
future?
NM
I think we are very much at the beginning of that
journey and few retailers really deliver today.
Customers will expect a deeply personalized
interaction using predictive technology in the near
future and will be unforgiving of those retailers
who do not get on board.
AD
We’re entering a new era where customers are
moving away from product acquisition and
towards product access. I don’t own any of my
music. I rent it. I wanted to change music providers
recently and go over to another one that was a
little cheaper, but when I changed, none of
my playlists were there, and none of the music
recommendations were personalised. It felt like
they didn’t know me at all, so I ended up having
to go back to the original and pay the higher price.
NM
Otto Now is an interesting model in terms of
leveraging more income from rental, being able
to reach much more customers and develop a
subscription relationship with the customer.
Why do you think people are starting to prefer renting
to buying?
NM
If I want five different luxury handbags for
different events, then renting rather than
investing in one large purchase makes sense,
don’t you think? Renting often feels like a smart
economic decision. You often feel proud of
yourself. It’s also perfect if you want to own the
very latest product but can’t afford the purchase
price up front. Uber and Airbnb have already
demonstrated the power of shared networks and
assets. For the model to work though, providers
need a deep understanding of customers’ needs
and the data intelligence to predict them as well
as the technology to manage the platform.
But at the same time lots of people are afraid of companies
knowing too much about them. Do you understand this fear?
AD
If I had asked someone ten years ago if they would be
comfortable using a product like facebook which would
track their location with GPS, learn about their likes and
interests, know who their friends are, what they are
looking at – no one would have told me that that sounds
like a good idea. But now even my grandmother is sitting
there on facebook “liking” things all day. Customers say
that they are afraid of giving away so much personal
data, but if we look at what customers actually do, they
demonstrate again and again that they are willing to give
it up to get access to products. It is crucial that companies
take their data protection responsibilities seriously.
NM
Collecting data enables personalised content and it’s
critical that customers see the value provided to them from
using their data. At the same time, retargeting is in danger
of becoming a negative trend right now. If you interrupt the
customer journey too often, you abuse trust. Customers
expect that data improves their experience and sales offers
can sometimes cause more irritation than pleasure.

There is too much screaming advertising. It’s like screaming
at a person “Buy me, buy me”. We have to transition
towards whisper advertising – advertising that comes in
the right volume at the right time.
NM
Speaking of advertising, I am almost shocked these
days when I watch an episode of Game of Thrones on a
traditional channel because I had forgotten that there’s
so much interruption of my viewing experience. Only five
years ago, I totally accepted it. Netflix and other streaming
services have completely reshaped my expectations.
A disruption-free user-journey … What other trends do you
predict for the future of shopping?
AD
I think the line between physical retail stores and e-commerce
will be quite blurred. Just like Neela’s experience with Lego.
She started online and then transitioned into a physical store
in a seamless way. In the future we will also see items being
purchased online and 3D printed at home on demand.
NM
Exactly. Expectations of the physical experience will increase
even further. Customers want stores to be visually stunning
and they will want a sensory experience. When I go to Asia,
I am always reminded how good they are at providing the

whole package. They are much better at blending together
shopping with entertainment, art and family – the whole
thing is much more vibrant and alive. Some shopping centres
in Europe are too cold and clinical and places you want to
get out of as fast as possible. In the UK market, which is
relatively advanced in multi-channel, we see multichannel
retailers winning again. They realized that if you can go into
an attractive store, have a fantastic conversation about a
product with a knowledgeable person and pick up or
order packages to home or stores that’s a very compelling
shopping experience!
Where within the Otto Group are you trying to address these
developments?
NM
Take Crate and Barrel. One of the things we recognized is
that especially for high-value purchases like furniture people
typically do want to speak to an experienced associate. And
our associates are really very experienced. But customers
often don’t want to complete the transaction in the store
where they’re kind of under pressure. So now we offer the
customer the possibility to go into the store to get help and
then we send him the offer via mail afterwards so that he
or she can finish the purchase from home. There used to
be this unwritten rule: “There is no way people will feel
comfortable to buy a 5000-dollar sofa online.” That’s just
not true anymore. But it also means: if we offer a different
experience in our online shop than the one you experience
in our store, we immediately lose
some of our brand trust.
What does a contemporary brand
have to look and feel like in 2017?
AD
A brand is a virus. It’s organic, it
breeds, it mutates daily, and it’s
everywhere. A brand is not just a
logo that the marketing team is
responsible for. A brand is bigger
than just marketing, it should
be embodied by everyone from
the Executive Board and CEOs
to every employee in the field.
Our job is to create the best
conditions for the virus to grow.
NM
A brand is like telling a story. If you
tell exactly the same story over
and over again, it becomes boring.
It is a fine line: you need the core
of your brand to stay consistent,
it needs to evolve with customers
and society.
Which brands at the Otto Group are
doing well in terms of changing and
adapting to the market and customer behavior?
NM
Bonprix is successfully developing into an international
known and appreciated brand with very loyal customers.
Crate and Barrel is very well recognized brand in the US and
has historically been defined by a unique in store experience.
One point that’s important too: poor after sales experiences
can really damage your brand. It makes people trust you less
in the medium to long term. We have put a lot of effort in our
post sales experiences such as our call centres. All retailers
and brands generally need to think more critically about this
experience.
AD
The online sales process has changed the way we think
about purchasing products. We no longer need to worry

so much at the moment of sale, because in the back of our
minds we know we can easily return the product later if
it’s not what we want. So instead of deciding if we should
buy an item or not, we now only need to decide whether
we want to return it or not.

Within the Otto Group there are different levels of brands. On the
one hand you have all the different companies, on the other hand
you sell different brands within the Otto Group world. What role
does a brand on that level play?
NM
At the end of the day we’re a group and we’re not customerfacing at that level. So therefore our Group values are
probably more important than the idea of a brand. But
when you get into the individual business you will find very
strong brand positionings and characteristics. For example:

OTTO

And these unproductive things are really valuable if our goal is
to create the right conditions for customers to give themselves
permission to feel good and spend money.
Therefore, the people who work in customer-facing roles
need to be brilliant. I’ve been spending a lot of time recently
in call centres and I’ve been impressed by how engaged our
colleagues are in answering calls and interacting with the
customers in a very human way. That’s what I like about the
Otto Group. We are a very human company and we have a
strong set of personal values which can be a great strength if
they come across in our customer interactions as well.

Bonprix offers women who know what life is all about
inspirational fashion experiences. At the brand level it is
very important to define what you stand for because there
is no customer loyalty without a strong brand message.
Brands are something that have to be actively managed,
they have to be believed by every person who works in the
organisation and that’s the real challenge these days.
What does this all mean for the employees?
AD
I am talking a lot about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
people always ask me: “But will we lose our jobs to robots?“
I think there will be a shift in the kind of roles available to
humans in the future. Loving your job and being really
good at it will become increasingly important, because
we’ll see that certain jobs can easily be replaced by robots.
If I have a choice to interact with Siri or Google or one of
the speech recognition products or a grumpy sales person
who has had a bad day, I am probably going to prefer to
interact with the friendly AI that knows me, even if it is
a little clunky. Robots do a great job at repetitious tasks,
but humans are really good at asking questions and other
“unproductive” things like art, storytelling, and imagining.

Customers who buy furniture come
into contact with the retailer eight
times on average: they might first spot
a piece of furniture on Instagram, go
to the furniture store website, use
the app to show it to a friend later on,
visit the furniture store, mull over the
purchase at home … Crate and Barrel
understands: online or offline, it’s all
one world. It’s about engaging with
the customer at each point of contact
with personal advice. In August 2016,
the first stores launched the “Design
Services” project. This focuses on the
digital “Mood Board”, where customers
can store products. Design specialists
provide personalised proposals. Then
in the store, where customers can
examine the products by touching and
handling them, the “Mood Board” is
used during on-site discussions with
the experts concerning details and
customisation requirements. The
customer receives the results by e-mail,
and can complete the purchase online
without any pressure. For a fee, the
interior design expert will also come
to the customer’s home for a detailed
consultation (from USD 99). To date,
none of the competitors has offered
this, and it leads to a conversion rate of
around 80 percent, long-lasting brand
loyalty and happy customers. In 2017,
all branches will be implementing this
concept.

A built-in kitchen is not something we buy every day. As a rule, customers usually

words at the moment are assessment portals, offering a wide range of concise
opinions. Küche & Co, the multi-award-winning retail specialist for built-in kitchens,
provides the customers of their approximately one hundred franchise partners
their own rating portal. On the distributor side, the tool ensures greater scope and
visibility in terms of the individual studios on the Internet, and customers benefit
from optimum transparency. This builds trust. Küche & Co welcomes every kind
of feedback. According to Managing Director, André Pape, “That helps us to get

Instead of a newsletter for all, OTTO
is now continuing to focus on the
’Products for you’ newsletter. The
content is regenerated by software
personally for each customer on the

only when there is relevant news for
this particular user. The success of such
measures has already been quantifiable
since 2013: OTTO developed what is
called a dynamic attribution model.
This is a procedure in which the success
rate of all advertising channels is determined individually. Advertising can be
done more effectively like this, instead
of using the scattergun approach. The
advantage for OTTO is advertising
that reaches its mark. The benefit for
customers is advertising that is no

Today’s online commerce is
mobile. The goal of the corporate Mobile Lab is therefore
to help all Group companies
develop their own apps.
In 2016, for the very first time, more
customers discovered Otto Group
deals from their mobile devices
than from their PC. All Group companies should therefore have their
own apps to meet this demand.
Experts from the company-owned
Mobile Lab founded in 2015 and
subsequently extended to include
an “App Acceleration Centre”, are
helping to develop them. Companies can have their apps realised
by specialists from planning to
implementation or use a series
of specially developed shopping
and service modules based on a
modular design. The development
time per app has been cut to eight
weeks. This gives customers faster
access to the apps of their favourite
shops that are also always state-ofthe-art. The Mobile Lab think tank is
now working on messenger service
applications.

Once upon a time, possession was everything. This is no longer the case, as
evidenced by the success of streaming services. No one owns a Netflix film.
And increasingly fewer people are purchasing their own car. It is enough
just to use one, which explains the boom in sharing models such as Car2Go,
Drive Now or Uber. According to a study by PwC, the sharing economy
world-wide has exceeded the USD 15 billion mark, and an annual volume
of USD 335 billion is forecast by 2025. With OTTO Now, OTTO is testing
out the “renting instead of buying” principle in the areas of technology,
household goods and sport. Do you need a camera for your holiday? Do
you want to test out how a treadmill works in your own home? Would
you prefer to rent a washing machine rather than buy one? No problem.
State-of-the-art technical products are immediately available. Delivery,
installation and maintenance are all included in the monthly rental fee
and you have the added bonus of contributing to sustainability.

Customer data opens up new access to the customerfor retailers,
but also entails a high degree of responsibility. It is clear
that only if customers know their data is secure will they
trust the retailer. In the Otto Group, therefore, all Group
companies are committed to maintaining a high standard of
data protection and information security. The aim is to
achieve a consistently high level of security throughout
the Group.

Satisfied customers buy again. And
whether they are happy with offer,
advice and retailers can be measured with intelligent software.
Three questions on customer satisfaction in the digital age to Otto
Group Executive Board Member
Dr ­Winfried Zimmermann.

Big Data is already helping with pricing or personalisation of advertising. To what extent are large
amounts of data interesting in the context of customer satisfaction?
Big Data means in this context data points that give
us information about our customers’ mood, in other
words: customer feedback. We get much more of this
now, because social media offer many more channels
and possibilities for them to express their opinions. At
the same time, customers on the net also actively seek
out the opinion of others when making decisions to
purchase or use products. There is a huge treasury of
data to be opened upt.

Which analysis tools can you use to measure customer satisfaction?
There is a wide variety of instruments, from web
analytics to customer surveys. But the challenge
does not lie in the measurement itself. The exciting
thing is how are these measuring instruments used
to implement measures in respect of customers?
Intelligent software helps us here, for example to sift
through all the feedback on all channels from service
chat to Instagram profile for topics that are relevant
from the customer’s perspective. With Crate and
Barrel, for instance, it was evident that order updating,
exchange and return had to be further optimised. At
the same time, such tools have a “social listening”
function: they help us understand why customers
buy from us – or from our competitors, and then we
can act accordingly.

H o w the future o f w ork is al ready changing us to day

OTTO

Against the background of these new possibilities,
how do you assess the role that employees will play
in future in the matter of customer satisfaction?
Personal contact, which is always in the foreground
with us in the form of advice, service chats and hotlines,
will surely continue to play this important role or
become even more relevant. What is also exciting,
however, is what happens when speech recognition
works so well that machines really recognise what
customers want, if what are called “text to intent”
processes can also read the subtext. This certainly has
an impact on what kind of contact will continue to
run through people, and what kind will run through
machines.

HOW

In the Elb­
philharmonie in Hamburg, the Chairwoman of
the Management Board Microsoft Germany,
Sabine Bendiek, and Petra Scharner-Wolff,
Chief Financial Officer of the Otto Group, take
time to discuss the flexibility, creativity, and
the office of the future.

You rarely get good ideas
when sitting on your own in the office. I find it useful
to be in an unusual environment: a Fintech trip to New
York or a trade fair in Germany. Somewhere where
you not only meet colleagues from your own industry
but also other people from other areas. You can then
exchange ideas and reflect together. Good ideas come
from interaction. But sometimes I get a good idea in the
shower. That’s practical, of course, because a shower is a
daily occurrence.
Many companies including Microsoft and Otto Group are
going to great lengths to try and create conditions that
encourage employees to work together as creatively as
possible. Why is that? Are good ideas and innovations
really more important than ever before?
P S W There has been pressure to be innovative for decades.
On the one hand, we have to adapt much more
quickly today – that’s one thing that has changed.
This inevitably also calls for different working
methods. On the other hand, industry has become
far more permeable. More and more companies are
also operating outside their traditional business zone.
For instance, Google is now building cars. The online
bookseller does not only sell books anymore but
food, fashion – basically eveything you can imagine.
This means that the pressure is generated not only
by the normal competitive environment but also by
entirely different sectors. Nowadays, completely new
competitors are involved. Therefore, we have to ask
ourselves a lot more questions, more often, constantly
seeking different approaches, particularly as far as
new technologies are concerned.
SB
At the same time, the latest technologies have greatly
accelerated product development cycles in companies.
The fact that technology is simply everywhere today
P E T R A S C H A R N E R- W O L F F

How do you get good ideas?
B E N D I E K I do something that has nothing to do with my
work. I enjoy walking or sailing. That clears my mind! Or I go to
an exhibition or listen to music in the hope of getting a fresh
perspective on things. Above all, I have learnt that you can
develop lots of new ideas simply by chatting to other people.

means that innovation is becoming increasingly important in
all company sectors. Previously, at Microsoft, we only talked
to our customers’ IT managers but now we are frequently in
touch with product managers as well as the marketing and
financial departments.
P S W We are trying out a lot of new working methods for the first
time in IT because IT staff had to reinvent the wheel years
before the rest. Previously, many activities in our company
were carried out in entirely separate units. Even the various
IT sectors were still working traditionally, alongside each
other. When these areas started to really communicate
with each other and network – triggered by a Group-wide IT
project – other departments throughout the
Group followed suit. Today we are working
virtually as a whole – the previous units are
pretty much a thing of the past. Ideas are
now being developed in small packages –
along the lines of agile working in IT – and
quickly converted without initially having to
draft a thousand or so Powerpoint slides.
The Elbphilharmonie where we are today is
also fascinating because even when you are
in the upper left-hand corner of the great hall,
you can still hear when someone in front of
you, to the right, is speaking quietly. How do
you ensure that your employees hear about
important company developments and contact
each other?
SB
We have developed a series of formats
and channels for this purpose in addition
to conventional methods such as e-mails
or newsletters. These range from quarterly
business talks, where we are in touch with
all employees through seminars and a Skype
video stream, via daily dialogue on our social
media network, Yammer, through to my
videoblog books with updates on strategies
and business developments. Thanks to this
diverse, two-pronged approach, all opportunities for discussion are covered. Personally,
I recently held a so-called “YamJam Session”
for all employees via social media. There
were over 100 questions and responses in 30
minutes. You cannot get such low-threshold
feedback with meetings or newsletters
alone. This type of exercise promotes
dialogue and boosts knowledge. There’s
also another point to this. You also have to
create the right environment for people to
chat and network together.
So what do such modern facilities look like?
SB
Much more open and transparent than
before. In our new Munich office, which
we developed in conjunction with the
Fraunhofer Institute, there are four
different areas. There are workplaces
where people can work quietly, in a
concentrated manner. Then we have
areas with sofas and armchairs where
people can relax and chat. The design of
this area is friendly and inviting. Then we
have meeting rooms where the emphasis
is very much on technology, allowing all

teams to work together virtually. Last but not least, we
have areas where employees can simply take time to sit
comfortably and reflect on ideas, with a pleasant view over
the surrounding area. That’s also an important part of the
work.
Do these areas work for you?
SB
Yes, but some people do not like to sit down there yet
because it might give the impression that they have
nothing to do.
PSW
We are also remodelling everything on our campus,
especially our new networking areas such as our new
coworking area, Collabor8, two new bistros and a new

boulevard which encourages staff to work outdoors, all
of which have been very well received by employees.
However, some areas are not as popular yet. For instance,
we have a row of comfortable seats directly facing the
window, where employees can sit quietly and reflect. This
area is known as “Elbstrand”. Directly behind this is a
normal working area. It means that someone is relaxed,
sitting down and reflecting, looking out of the window
whilst others right behind them are working hard on the
computer. That hasn’t worked so far. The quiet area should
be a bit more secluded. But maybe it’s a case of getting
used to it.

GROUP

But do you know what I find charming? You say, we’ve tried
something and learned from it. I believe that this is a very
important skill that has to be developed even further in the
company. Just simply trying something – and then being ok
to admit that maybe we are not there yet. But we will keep
developing and we will learn from it.
What meetings and events do you use to encourage staff and
their creativity?
P S W The formats have become much more diverse in recent
years. It is interesting to note that this doesn’t only apply
at management level. A lot of incentives come from the
workforce. The Hackathon is a typical example of this.
You are talking about the events in
which staff work together on developing software or hardware.
P S W Yes. We have a very active commu­
nity within the workforce that organises
this type of event. Members of staff book
the rooms, prepare topics, invite guests
from outside the company and simply
carry out the event. And everyone involved
gets a great deal of pleasure from this
exercise. I believe that one of the key
strengths of the Hackathon events is that
they are directed towards practical implementation. It’s not simply about philosophy
and theory. Solutions are developed and
can be put into practice the next day in
the normal working environment. It’s also
great to network with all of the different
workshop participants. I can see what staff
get out of it – sheer enjoyment and they
are really inspired!
SB
I agree. It generates incredible drive
and a positive element of competition
prevails. Everyone wants to do something
good in the individual group – participants
encourage each other. We carry out Hackathons with many customers and other
external partners. There are also unusual
elements which are not really businessrelated. For example, one Hackathon
with Germany’s Aktion Mensch lottery, to
generate ideas as to how technology can
be used to improve the living conditions of
people with disabilities. Great things came
out of this exercise.
Could such joined events prevent you
from overlooking your customer in
times of rapid internal change?
SB
As a technology company, it’s
easy for us to be enthusiastic about the
exciting things we are developing and
forget what use really means. Therefore,
one of the key doctrines for me is that
we are only successful if our customers
are successful with our products. That
means we constantly have to do a reality
check: what we are doing here? Does it
help the customer? It’s important to
check this over and over again with
concrete examples and in conjunction
with the customer. Have we achieved

SB

GROUP

what we set out to achieve together? Have we
improved? Is follow-up required? What can we
learn from this?
New technologies help to bring us closer to our
customers – over and above our normal market
research. It has become much easier for our
customers to provide direct feedback via social
media. We can better understand interactions
between our customers and us, and we have a
better idea of requirements. We can also offer
much lower threshold contact options than before.

Innovation days, short lectures, community events – the Otto Group provides employees with numerous opportunities to learn something new and
get to know each other professionally across departments and companies.
For example, at the annual innovation days, the OTTO e-commerce team invites employees to put forward future online trading concepts. In 2016,
participants submitted almost 100 proposals and converted 18 of them into
prototypes including an algorithm that provides customers with helpful
evaluations. Top executives give short presentations to more than 300 employees at so-called TED conferences whilst the “ON” community provides

When people are able to work
independently,
they
surpass
themselves. For this reason,
the EOS Group revamped its IT
structure in 2016. As part of
the PACE project, IT specialists formed product teams that
now implement tasks self-sufficiently. This approach allows
colleagues to network more effectively and to work faster
with greater flexibility.

The more open the dialogue,
the better the collaboration. This provides the
basis for Baur’s “Kulturrad”

approach,
setting the tone for the

With Skype for Business, the Otto Group
is introducing staff to fewer emails
and faster dialogue. Colleagues can
chat or participate in audio and video
conferencing using the skype software
for computers and mobile ­
devices –
regardless of their location. Decentralised teams can hold meetings in
virtual conference rooms and still see
colleagues face to face, despite the
distance, thanks to video technology. There are no longer any boundaries
to sound collaboration. Employees in
different locations can all view a
document at the same time, work on it
and review it together via a screensharing function. They can also hold
discussions via a chat window opened
up alongside. The icing on the cake?
The collaboration platforms and email

colleagues are available, out of the
office, in a meeting or do not want to

Mr. Otto, you basically
came up with the initiative for Collabor8.
Why is this project so
important to you?
It’s a visible sign of Kulturwandel
4.0 (cultural change) in the Otto
Group. We have so much talent
in the Group that needs to come
together. Collabor8 is just what
we need. We will obviously also
network on other platforms such
as ottogroupnet, but personal
exchange is still important in
this digital age.
Collabor8 provides an ideal
working environment for up
to 200 employees to work
together over an area of 1,700
square meters. What is the key
function in your o
­ pinion?

Ideas should be developed in
these areas. The heart of the
building, the so-called “Arena”,
can accommodate 60 employees.
Mobile workspaces can be
arranged as needed. Quiet areas
can be used for tasks requiring
a great deal of concentration.
But Collabor8 is more than just
a working space. It is a meeting
place, a forum for creativity.
Employees can come together
here, hold meetings and swop
their offices for an inspiring
environment. It’s been scientifically proven that people don’t
come up with the best ideas if
they sit behind their desks all day!

B E N JA M I N OT TO

What impact do these areas
have within the Otto Group?
The Group will continue to adapt
to flexible working requirements

that projects such as Collabor8
create a momentum that can’t

IS THERE ANYTHING A

HUMAN BEING
CAN STILL DO
BETTER
THAN A
COMPUTER?

And how
does the
Otto Group benefit from Big Data? Dr R
­ ainer
Hillebrand and Professor Dr Michael Feindt
met up at the old power station in Berlin and
­discussed data, digitisation, and the future of
retail.
Nowadays, data is often referred to as 21st century oil – a vital
resource for any business. So how has handling data changed
over the last decade?
M I C H A E L F E I N D T Companies have always collected information
about their customers and their own financial situation, but
the way in which it is stored has fundamentally changed.
Information that was once entered in Excel tables or jotted
down on notepads is now saved in databases, which makes
data access and analysis much easier. This also has an impact
on data quality, which is much better than it was ten years
ago.
R A IN ER HILLEB R A N D
As the Otto Group is a mail-order company with a remote operating set-up, information has always
been extremely important. It starts with simple things such
as who is calling and what is the delivery address, and continues right up to after-sale customer feedback. Thanks to
advanced digitisation, data can be collected using entirely
different methods and in greater quantities than ever before.
It can also be processed much faster and stored at a fraction
of the cost – something we hardly even dreamt about ten
years ago.
Large quantities of data are one thing but analysing this is another.
What challenges do you face in this respect?
RH
The key question is how can we filter out the right
information to satisfy customers’ requirements from the
mass of data we accumulate? When a customer is looking
for a specific product, we have to come up with an ideal,
tailor-made solution.
This is where you have your finger on the pulse, Mr. Feindt. With
your colleagues at Blue Yonder, you have developed an algorithm
that facilitates data analysis and works independently.
MF
Our algorithm calculates how our customers’ purchasing
habits change on a day-to-day basis. This is very important in

our customer approach, as Mr. Hillebrand
has already pointed out, but it is also
important from a business management
perspective. For a mail-order company,
inventory management and speed of
delivery are crucial. These processes are
optimised in our case through artificial
intelligence.
How does this work?
MF
As much information as possible is
analysed focusing on historical sales data,
prices, discounts, the weather forecast
for the next few days and the season, i.e.
any factors that can influence a purchase.
The system does this for every item in the
range. This helps the retailer to decide
which products will be ordered from the
manufacturer and in what quantities, and
which products are not so urgent. The
goods are already in the warehouse before
the customer orders them, which obviously
speeds up delivery times. Furthermore,
you store as many items as you need. This
means that no bulk quantities are left over
at the end of the season and, from a supermarket perspective, there is far less waste.
Your artificial intelligence system works
independently and automatically. It takes on
tasks previously carried out by people because
it is faster and more efficient. What does this
mean for the corporate culture of the Otto
Group?
RH
It means a change, of course, but people
shouldn’t view the use of algorithms
solely as a threat to jobs. Algorithms help
us to improve our customer service and
operate more efficiently. That’s good for the
company and therefore for every employee.
We have to face the challenges of the
future. The Otto Group is a large company
with numerous options. If we lose one task
today, a new one is being created elsewhere
in the company. Obviously, employees have
to be more proactive today. It’s no longer
a case of learning something and resting
on our laurels for the next 50 years. Job
descriptions are constantly changing and
people have to retrain and learn more. But
we are helping our employees to move with
the times.
MF
Digitisation is an innovative process as
we have seen over and over again in the
history of mankind. CERN, for instance,
the European Organisation for Nuclear
Research, where I worked as a physicist, was created sixty
years ago. At that time, hundreds of women sat in huge halls
with slide rules and logarithm tables, and calculated what
physicists needed for their work. These jobs no longer exist
having been taken over by computers. But would we want to
go back to those days? We are currently in a transition phase.
Throughout history, the more efficient has always prevailed
so we certainly cannot stop digitisation. It’s definitely not a
case of replacing people but about helping them to improve.

THE
   DIGITAL

REVOLUTION IS STILL
AT ITS VERY BEGINNING,

A FEW HOURS AFTER
THE

BIG BANG
Dr

Rainer

Hillebrand

I’m convinced that the relationship between man and
machine will become closer because human beings can do a
lot of things beyond the realms of artificial intelligence.
What?
MF
A machine cannot think strategically about formulating
corporate goals for the coming years. Similarly, it is light
years away from designing next season’s fashions. Mankind
is always superior when it comes to creativity. But machines
optimise processes more efficiently, e.g. repetitive processes

such as the ordering of goods. Let’s consider the partnership
in this way: man devises the strategy and the machine
implements it. I strongly believe that there will be as much
work as there is today. Fact is that at some point we just did
not need a boiler man on trains anymore either. But people
don’t have to do all the donkey work.
RH
It’s like that: People have a lot of experience. And experience is
based on information we accumulate through life. Algorithms
can connect this wide range of experience-related data in a
more logical, stringent, error-free manner than we can. But
they need processes within a narrow framework. When we
make a decision, lots of things come into play – a certain
knowledge, experience and gut feeling that software simply
doesn’t have – at least, not yet.
Today, people are worried about their jobs on the one hand
and their data on the other hand, which is collected by many
companies. How do you allay your customers’ fears?
RH
On the one hand, we follow the legal framework rigidly. The
Otto Group is a family-run business and we rely on our good,
reliable reputation built up over many years through a correct

approach, values and social responsibility. It would be foolish
to risk this reputation. At the same time we want to offer our
customers great service. To do this, we need as much information about our customers as possible. Everyone is familiar
with this predicament. On the one hand people are worried
about what will happen to their personal data – will it be
misused? But on the other hand, everyone wants a good,
personal service. We have learned from experience that
customers are happy to pass on personal data to us if it means
an improvement in the end product and we explain how the
data will be used. If we don’t adopt this approach, people are
rather reluctant to pass on information.
No company can afford to work against its customers
and upset them by acting unscrupulously. But something
strange is happening with data protection in Europe. I
have chatted to younger people about this on numerous
occasions. I would say that 95 percent of them are not
interested in what companies do with their data. Many
do not know that messenger services read every message
and create profiles of the sender and recipient and their
networks, and sell these to the
advertising industry.
But does it really bother them?
MF
People say that the
younger element doesn’t care.
Young people are not bothered by
the advertising they receive through
social media. They have a relaxed
attitude when it comes to their
data and US companies in particular
make full use of this. We have to ask
ourselves if we are placing ourselves
at a competitive disadvantage if we
are too reserved. I personally think
that our attitude isn’t bad but our
competitors are far more aggressive
than us. How do we deal with this?
We don’t talk about it enough.
RH
This is why the Otto Group
is constantly calling for equal
competition between American and
European companies. In addition
to the comparatively less stringent
data protection in the USA, Amazon,
Google, Ebay and even the Chinese
companies have another competitive edge. Their markets are huge
and they have a lot more customers.
They create profiles from the
customers’ personal data, link
these and deliver the perfect service.
Europe is also a big market but the
various languages and jurisdictions
complicate matters.
Can Europe still catch up?
MF
We still have a chance.
Digitisation now ranks highly on the
list of priorities of most companies.
But change doesn’t happen overnight.
Germany is still very conservative,
which is perhaps also due to our
previous success model. The value
of data and software is not apparent

here yet. A car has a value that can be grasped. This can also
be rather expensive and we are investing billions of euros to
develop this. The Americans have long since moved on to this
kind of thinking. The world’s most expensive companies are
software and data companies. This is where daylight dawns –
software is extremely important. It’s a long drawn-out process.
I’m not sure if we’ll catch up.
You both work in areas in which forecasts are very important.
What will the retail market look like five years from now?
RH
I would be happy if I knew what it would look like in a year’s
time. Digital change will certainly remain the driving force
in retail. The opportunities to collect and store data and
make them useable by algorithms will go from strength to
strength. After the smartphones success story – 50 percent
of our business runs via mobile devices – the next big topic
will be conversational commerce and going beyond touch
with chatbots and voice input playing a major role in the
purchasing process.
What developments lie ahead?
RH
Personalisation and individualisation will continue to be
key topics along with an even better understanding of what
customers are looking for and how they will behave. Blue
Yonder will continue to be very helpful for us in this respect.
It is fair to say that the progress of the digital revolution
is still at its very beginning, basically a few hours after the
Big Bang. There’s a long way to go – we haven’t had the full
impact yet.
MF
That’s true. I think that anyone who hasn’t jumped on the
digital train yet will be left standing on the platform. Over
the years, several large trading chains have gone into liquidation because they failed to take technological innovation
seriously.
And it probably won’t stay that way – right?
MF
Anyone who carries on as before and foregoes the ten
percent you need to transform yourself with digitisation will disappear. The message is hard but simple. As
a company, you have to keep on your toes. New, hitherto
unknown technologies will emerge. But the potential must
be harnessed and used. What we can predict is that most
companies will switch to Algorithmic Merchandising. This
means a combination of purchasing, supply chain, advertising, pricing and sales. These elements react and interact
with each other and are controlled by algorithms. In the past,
different departments did different things – the one hand
didn’t know what the other hand was doing. Everything was
much less co-ordinated.
And what will the customer’s shopping experience look like?
RH
It will look exactly as the customer wants it to!

ROBOTICS

A WHOLE

Robots are still a rare sight in
public. But, in ultramodern parcel
centres they have been sharing the
packing for a long time now. In the
foreseeable future, they could be
rolling through the cities as parcel
carriers and even improve the
transport of goods in long-distance
transport. Hanjo Schneider ventures
a look at the future of logistics.

the classic carrier, it is simply not designed to do so.
The fact is, however, that development is extremely
rapid. We cannot imagine what robots might be able
to do in 10 years. But robots will definitely not replace
people in parcel delivery in the foreseeable future.
What other tasks can robots take over in logistics
in the future?
If we define robots in a broader sense and add
self-propelled transporters and trucks, the potential
of such systems in logistics is definitely great. After
all, millions of goods have to be moved day after day.
Autonomous or at least semi-autonomous operating transporters could
be a logical further development –
not only in inner-city delivery, but
also in long-distance transport at
night. For the time being, however,
autonomous transport systems
are visions of the future, especially
since there are still many open legal
questions on legislator’s side.
What are the advantages
of robots?
Robots work autonomously at
best and can be used around
the clock. This opens up entirely
new possibilities for logistics in
particular. A delivery request even
at two o’clock in the morning would
not be a problem with an appropriately equipped
delivery robot. On-demand delivery is also easier
and more targeted with automated systems,
benefiting the customer.

Where are robots already in use in logistics and
order picking in the Otto Group?
Of course, at present everyone is talking about our
Starship robots, which have delivered parcels for
Hermes for the first time in August 2016. Robot
delivery of real parcels to active customers – this
was a true premiere in Germany! Behind the scenes,
though, we have been using automatic systems
in logistics for much longer. In our state-of-the-art
parcel centres, for example, sorting has been largely
automated for many years, thanks to digital high
tech. At the Haldensleben location
in Saxony-Anhalt, since mid-2016
Hermes Fulfilment has also been
testing driverless “Weasel” vehicles,
which significantly accelerate the
picking of parcels.
Where will robots shape the
future?
In my opinion, the topic of robotics is still in its infancy. At the same
time, it is clear that robots will
increasingly find their way into our
daily lives – including in the Otto
Group, in the field of parcel delivery or customer service. Chatbots
are a good example of this.
What tasks will there still be for
humans?
There’ll be enough! Let’s take the parcel delivery:
a Starship robot, for example, can neither drive a
transporter with more than a hundred parcels on
board nor climb stairs. The machine doesn’t replace

is permanently connected online with the headquarters

position can be precisely determined by GPS. The robot
reacts to oncoming obstacles within a few milliseconds.
After the first test in Hamburg, a second test run is to
take place in London in 2017.

PROCESSES AND SOFTWARE

ALGORITHMS
FO R TH E
­S H O P P I N G
B A S K E T

Big data technologies create the possibility
of processing mass data using complex
mathematical processes. Especially at
OTTO, it has been possible to optimise
many business processes with the help of
artificial intelligence – from image recognition to improved use of article images
in the customer dialogue through to
individual product recommendations in
digital and analogue channels. The Group
companies Blue Yonder (see from page 44)
and Risk Ident also work with tailor-made
algorithms.
Blue Yonder, for example, uses algorithms
that are based on artificial intelligence
in a big way for online, fashion and food
merchants. Business processes at retail
companies are optimised and automated
with solutions for demand forecast,
predictive merchandising, supply chain
optimisation and price optimisation. As
part of the "replenishment optimisation"
product, the algorithm evaluates hundreds
of data sources every day to fully automate
millions of daily orders from supermarkets.
For this purpose, the software incorporates
factors such as the day of the week, the
weather, advertising campaigns, actions
or range adjustments, for example. As a
result, stock can be optimally adjusted to
demand – sales, customer satisfaction and
earnings can be increased. The self-learning
anti-fraud software FRIDA from Risk
Ident also uses the latest technologies
to protect the e-commerce activities of
Group companies and many other online
merchants in real-time against fraudsters – even before the goods are shipped.

CONVERSATIONAL COMMERCE

Machines understand language better and better. In future,
they will order products for us on demand. A radical change.
People who stare at screens? That could soon be history,
because virtual assistants will soon be taking over the
connection between the analogue and the digital world. And
they don’t follow the click of a mouse or a touch, but work
on demand. Messenger apps such as Whatsapp or Facebook
Messenger will provide what are called chatbots, which
support the user in all life situations, including shopping. They
contact online retailer on voice command. Chatbots know
users’ preferences and speak their language. The process
needed for this is called natural language processing – the
software learns to understand what its users say. No more
typing is required, you have a conversation with the algorithm.
This will also be possible outside messenger apps – on the
websites of the Otto Group’s online retailers for example.
On demand, the virtual assistant then looks for a fridge. It
asks the model, colour, size and provides the results at once.
Today, already 57 percent of Internet users use chat or video
chat in customer centres. Chatbots are still in their infancy,
however, and still understand too little. But the technology
will be successful in the next few years. And the Otto Group?
It is already intensively seeking out business opportunities in
the context of the “Beyond Touch” initiative, and is creating
the technological prerequisites for conversations with smart
systems.

MOBILE DIY MARKET

Online and offline shopping grow
together. From now on, customers in
the home improvement, home and garden sectors can use their smartphones
to search and purchase via the app in
the online portal hagebau.de. The app
also serves as an intelligent shopping
aid for the on-site Hagebau market. The
Otto  Group and Hagebau operate the
online portal as a joint venture.

RENTING INSTEAD OF BUYING

Washing machines, treadmills, coffee
machines and games consoles are all
available on the new OTTO Now platform.
OTTO, for test purposes, is giving customers the option to rent products from categories such as technology, household
goods and sport. The offer is particularly
attractive for residential communities
and young families with children whose
needs are constantly changing. This
option is also available to so-called early
adopters, who are the first to use innovative products and therefore set trends.

THE VALUE CHAIN AS A
KEY CHALLENGE

E

For the Otto Group as a trading group, the complexity
of the value chain is an enormous challenge for systematic activities, geared towards sustainability aspects. The
biggest social and ecological impacts of business activities are incurred in the preliminary stages of an extended
supply chain. To handle this, the Otto Group fundamentally reoriented its sustainability management in 2013.
Since then, it has determined ecological impacts and
social risks along the entire value chain and quantified
these through external costs and risk-working hours. The
Otto Group now has a solid basis for decision-making
to promote the sustainable direction of their business
models efficiently and effectively.

The social consequences are represented by the fifth
impact category of social risks and measured by riskworking hours. To do so, the Group determines the countryand industry-specific risk that indicates the chance of
working hours performed in violation of minimum social
standards. By quantifying environmental and social
impacts, the Otto Group receives a realistic picture of the
external effects associated with its business activities, i.e.
its ecological and social footprint.

QUALITATIVE EVALUATION BY
STAKEHOLDERS
In addition, the individual topic areas are assessed by
internal and external stakeholders (see the x-axis of the
matrix on page 66). Topic areas refer to the effects by
impact category and value-adding stage (for example,
greenhouse gases in the Trade value-adding stage). In
addition to the 20 topic areas, stakeholders in 2016 estimated the relevance of the topics of animal welfare,
recycling and resource efficiency for the Otto Group. The
evaluation of all issues was performed in view of the
next two to five years.

M ATERIALIT Y M ATRIX 2017
In the matrix (see chart, page 66) all results of the Materiality Analysis are merged. It shows which topic areas
are particularly relevant to the Otto Group because of

A comparison of the results with the 2015 analysis shows the
following changes:

T

▶ ▶ Social risks in trade were rated higher, mainly due to possible adjustment (adjustment of

U

the minimum wage in Germany and corresponding cost ef fects).

R

▶ ▶ The impact category of greenhouse gases was rated less relevant in the entire value chain.

E

This could result from the perception that the Paris Agreement will enforce climate regulations
ef fectively.
▶ ▶ From the point of view of external stakeholders, the additional topics of recycling and

The issue of animal welfare has little relevance (little need for action) for the business model
of the Otto Group.

sourcing allows companies to use CmiA cotton in

approach” is similar to the green electricity
model: CmiA cotton does not have to be detected in individual products. The decisive factor
is that a corresponding quantity flows into the

supply chain. In 2016 the Otto Group helped, for example, to develop a “Guidance package” with
recommendations for action to identify and avoid precarious working conditions for refugees in the
Turkish clothing industry.
In order to improve the climate change mitigation of textile manufacturers in the supply chain,
the Otto Group set up the Carbon Performance Improvement Initiative (CPI2) together with seven
other trading companies. The range of topics has been expanded to water and chemicals. In the
CPI2 data tool, more than 400 improvement measures are now available with information on their
effort and benefits. In 2016, 168 textile manufacturers producing for the Otto Group followed these
recommendations.

ORIENTATION FOR CONSUMERS
According to surveys, consumers often feel overwhelmed by the multitude of labels when it comes
to sustainable consumption. The GOODproduct label serves as identification and combines all
relevant seals and certificates with sustainable added value. Unlike in the case of food shopping,
“eco” or “organic” in fashion shopping is more associated with renunciation and a bad conscience.
This is why the term GOODproduct is used, which conveys a positive shopping experience that
is both socially and environmentally compatible. The GOODproduct label was introduced by the
Group company OTTO in July 2015. Meanwhile, it is also used by the Group companies Baur, Heine,
Schwab and Unito.

The majority of its business relates to working with external customers, however services carried out within the
Otto Group also play a significant role.

GROUP STR ATEGY
Co nsolidate d Financi al State m en ts

BUSINESS M ANDATE
The shareholders’ business mandate defined in the 2013/14 financial year specifies the framework conditions and
guiding principles within which the Otto Group’s sustainably profitable business models are to be developed and
operated. Furthermore – in harmony with the Group’s future mission statement – this lays the basis for the further
development and realisation of the Group strategy and also for portfolio and investment management.
The business mandate and future mission statement highlight the importance of sustainable action, whereby business goals are combined with social and environmental responsibility. The Group strategy is derived directly from this
basis. The Group strategy covers the strategic segments of the Otto Group, namely Multichannel Retail (with special
emphasis on online retail), Financial Services, and Services (primarily logistics) as well as the strategy for complying
with social and environmental responsibility (Corporate Responsibility Strategy 2020 – hereafter CR Strategy 2020).
These strategies are transferred to the Group companies by means of portfolio management and other control mechanisms and are therefore linked with one another. The Group’s Executive Board is also incentivised to achieve both
the business and corporate responsibility goals.

STR ATEGIES IN THE SEGMENTS
The Otto Group is internationally orientated and covers nearly all relevant value levels in retailing and retail-related
financial services and services. The Group will continue with this strategic orientation.

OTTO

Multichannel Retail
In the Multichannel Retail segment, a fundamental strategic goal is the further development of e-commerce – and
in particular retail via mobile devices – as a sales channel that has shown the strongest growth and is a key driver
of future expansion.
The Otto Group’s focus is on the further development and, in particular, the ongoing digitisation of its successful
retail model, as well as the strengthening of its brand concepts. Of particular note in this regard are the continued
intensive expansion of otto.de and, in the growth area of brand concepts, of international brand bonprix. The About
You open commerce model also represents an important growth area for the Otto Group. This focus has helped the
Group to continuously expand the channels it uses to reach end-consumers as well as its expertise in the core competencies of online retail. It also allows the Group to use this specific experience to further develop other existing multichannel brands.

Again the focus here is on driving the ongoing transformation of the individual retail concepts towards greater levels
of digitisation. It also includes intensively building up further business intelligence in order to personalise the Group’s
offering to an even greater degree, with a clear focus on the customer journey and special emphasis on retail sales
through various devices.
Within the Multichannel Retail segment, the focus is on venture and incubation activities by the Otto Group’s investment companies. This enables the Group to secure early access to innovative ideas, promising new business models
and well-qualified, talented individuals from business and technology areas with an entrepreneurial mindset.
Furthermore, apart from benefiting from its own retail activities, the Otto Group also benefits from the development of digital retail-related services and the growth of third-party online retail and associated sectors. For example,
services in the areas of big data, visual technologies, and advertising marketing are already being marketed successfully to third parties.

Financial Services
The Otto Group’s strategy in the Financial Services segment is primarily aimed at ensuring the responsible international development of the receivables management business. In addition, the Otto Group is continuing to develop
new digital financial services such as automated receivables management and fraud prevention, and in doing so, is
actively and systematically shaping the ongoing digitisation of this segment.

Services
Services are becoming an increasingly significant factor in business activities with end-consumers. B2C and B2B
services, which are grouped under the Hermes umbrella brand, represent a further focal point within the Otto Group’s
strategy. Besides speed, reliability and the transparency of the supply chain, the Hermes Group places particular
importance on service quality at all points of contact with the end-consumer. Future growth is focused primarily
on growth in the distribution sector. This focus will help to expand the Group’s significant position as a provider of
retail-related services, both in Germany and internationally in attractive e-commerce markets such as the United
Kingdom.

CR STR ATEGY 2020
The Otto Group’s Executive Board is convinced that sustainability is the foundation of long-term economic success in
business. The CR Strategy 2020 therefore forms an integral part of Group strategy. Moreover, since the 2014/15 financial year, the Executive Board’s variable remuneration is now also linked to the achievement of the targets set out in
the CR Strategy 2020. The principles of sustainable development are thereby firmly anchored in the Group organisation and its business processes. Concretely, the CR Strategy consists of five specific sub-strategies. These cover key
areas of the business model that can be specifically influenced by the Otto Group: Social responsibility within the
supply chain, environmental protection at Group sites and during transport as well as environmental and resource
protection in the manufacturing of textiles, furniture products, and catalogue paper. In order to reduce the ecological and social impact of the Otto Group’s business activities in an effective and measurable way, Group-wide goals
have been defined for each of the five sub-strategies right up to the year 2020.2

PORTFOLIO M ANAGEMENT
An essential strategic goal of the Otto Group is to strengthen its portfolio. The course required in order to achieve
this goal is set by the strategies for the segments.

Basic Information about the Group

Portfolio management comprises continuous assessment of the profitability and future viability of each individual
Group company while also ensuring that targeted investments are made in promising, future-oriented business
models right across the strategies for the individual segments. The Group is thus placing itself in an agile starting
position so as also to be able to take direct advantage of new business opportunities in the future.
Gro u p M anage m en t Rep or t

Portfolio management is aimed at strengthening the Otto Group’s financial capability, whereby the debt service
ratio (net financial debt/EBITDA) and the leverage ratio (net financial debt/Group equity) – on the basis of the “FDL
at equity” presentation of the Otto Group – are primary indicators of financial performance. The debt service ratio
in particular improved due to the earnings position in the past financial year. The Group aims to also improve the
leverage ratio in the future.3

AN IMPORTANT BASIC PREREQUISITE: FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF IT
In order to be able to successfully implement the Group strategy, the Group intends, by means of the continual
further development of all business processes – in particular in the areas of IT and business intelligence – not only
to keep up with developments in the relevant markets but also to continue to live up to the high claim to be one
of the global leaders among e-commerce companies. Continued investment in the IT infrastructure is necessary in

Co nsolidate d Financi al State m en ts

order to ensure that the Otto Group’s market position can be strengthened in the long term also. The Group companies invest autonomously in their own IT so as to orientate it towards future needs in accordance with competitive
demands. Central IT governance ensures that inter-departmental goals can be pursued. Furthermore, future-oriented
skills, in particular in the areas of business intelligence and mobile commerce (via the centralised mobile app acceleration centre, for example) continue to be built up in a centralised manner in order to support Group companies in
the best way possible.

INNOVATION
Online retail is by far the Otto Group’s largest distribution channel and the main future driver for the Group. In this
fast-paced environment, innovation is essential to secure sustainable success. Several central departments were set
up in the past few years in order to identify developments and technologies early on and to transfer these findings
to all of the Otto Group’s companies. As part of the E-Commerce Competence Center and its innovation radar initiative, innovation management involves monitoring and testing new technologies to determine their relevance for
use within the Otto Group. Trends that are considered particularly relevant are implemented as prototypes and the
findings that are obtained are made available to the entire Group. The overarching objectives of this are to secure
competitiveness and to generate growth momentum for the Group companies.

N o tes

OTTO

At this point, the Business Intelligence team also joins in, using cutting-edge technologies and the Group’s vast
data resources to develop forward-looking e-commerce solutions. The interdisciplinary team of strategists, big data
specialists and data scientists uses algorithms derived from the latest scientific research on artificial intelligence,
such as deep learning, and state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques. In order to be able to make
better use of the diverse knowledge of these experts in the Group headquarters and in the Group companies, the
Knowledge Management team organises the networking of the knowledge holders at the various levels and ensures
efficient and timely transfer of know-how.

Some sample projects are presented below:

VIRTUAL REALIT Y
Virtual reality opens up entirely new opportunities for consuming and interacting with digital content – which means
that this technology also has the potential to fundamentally change the nature of online shopping. Although the
range and distribution of the hardware available has already gained considerable momentum and is being promoted
by some of the leading companies in the digital sector, applications in sectors such as retail are still at an early stage of
development. The Otto Group is one of the first large e-commerce providers to develop and test concepts for e-commerce shopping applications in the field of virtual reality.

MESSAGING WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF E-COMMERCE AND
CUSTOMER SERVICE
The majority of users are already communicating via smartphones, using messaging apps such as WhatsApp. Therefore, in order to maintain direct contact with customers in future, this channel is becoming increasingly important
for e-commerce providers as well. Messaging apps can serve as an information or service channel and thus make
it possible to provide highly personalised purchasing advice. Through the additional integration of chatbots, the
customer can engage in automated dialogue with a company and place orders, for example, which reduces the workload for “manual” customer support teams. For this reason, the Otto Group is assessing and testing the use of chatbots within its channels in order to further enhance its customer service offering.

DELIVERY ROBOTS
Delivery robots are autonomous vehicles that can be used for the “last mile”, i.e. delivering the parcel to its recipient.
Deliveries are sent to a parcel collection hub and kept there for up to ten days. Recipients can then use their smartphone to initiate delivery of their parcel by delivery robot – at the precise time that suits them best. Delivery robots
are more environmentally friendly and cause less air pollution than traditional delivery vehicles. They also contribute
to a reduction in traffic, as they use the pavements to make deliveries. As a result, they offer a cost-effective option
for the flexible delivery of individual packages within tight turnarounds. In autumn 2016, Hermes Germany GmbH
in conjunction with Estonian technology start-up Starship Technologies launched a pilot scheme in Hamburg on the
use of delivery robots to deliver parcels.

ECONOMIC
ENVIRONMENT
OVER ALL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
The economic development of the global economy in 2016 was characterised by a rise in the global gross domestic
product – hereafter GDP – of 3.1% in real terms (2015: 3.0%) and gradually stabilised over the course of the year. In
the last two quarters in particular, the global economy proved considerably more robust than in the previous years,
despite increased political uncertainty. In the advanced economies, overall economic expansion was exceptionally
dynamic, which is primarily attributable to positive development in employment and household consumption over
the year as a whole. In emerging economies, the period of weak economic performance observed over the past several
years did not continue, and there were increasing indications of an economic upswing in these countries. In China,
Co nsolidate d Financi al State m en ts

growth in overall economic output increased, but nevertheless remained at a comparatively moderate level. In addition, underlying conditions for countries exporting raw materials improved noticeably, with a considerable increase
in the cost of raw materials. In Russia, the recessionary environment was less pronounced than in the previous year,
and positive growth rates in real GDP were even recorded in the second half of the year. Against this background,
international trade grew by just 1.8% for the entire year (2015: 2.2%) and, despite a dynamic fourth quarter, proved
weak by comparison.
In a persistently difficult international environment, growth of the German economy proved remarkably dynamic in
2016 and was characterised by a noticeable rise in real GDP of 1.9% (2015: 1.7%). However, despite a dynamic start to
the first half of the year, the economy saw a slight loss in momentum over the last two quarters. Overall economic
expansion was driven by domestic factors, with private-household and state consumption expenditure in particular
increasing substantially once again compared to the previous year. Both the sustained rise in real wages and
continued stability in the labour market contributed to this dynamic development in private consumption expenditure. The annual average working population rose substantially by 1.0% (2015: 0.9%) compared to the previous year
and reached a new high of 43.4 million workers. The average annual unemployment rate for 2016 fell accordingly to
6.1% (2015: 6.4%). When viewed as a whole, foreign trade did not make a positive contribution to economic expansion in 2016. Despite continued recovery in the Euro area and increased economic stability in China, exports proved
considerably weaker than in the previous year, and also showed less growth than imports.

N o tes

OTTO

The economic recovery of the Euro area continued at the same moderate pace in 2016 and was characterised by
a rise in real GDP of 1.7% (2015: 1.9%). Overall economic output in the Euro area has thus displayed an uninterrupted upwards trend for the past four years. The rise in GDP was driven almost exclusively by domestic demand.
Private-household consumption expenditure benefited from a rise in real wages and growth in employment. The
ongoing positive development observed on the labour market since mid-2013 continued, with the annual average
unemployment rate falling to 10.1%, thus lying below the previous year’s figure of 10.9%. Increasingly expansionary
investment activity by companies and financial policy in most Euro area countries also had a positive effect on
domestic demand. The at times sharp differences in economic growth that have existed for some years between the
individual economies in the Euro area also persisted in the past year, but did not intensify further. Economic development in the European Union countries outside of the Euro area was predominantly dynamic in 2016, with Sweden
and Poland especially recording somewhat strong growth in overall economic output.

In the USA, the inflation-adjusted increase in GDP in 2016 amounted to 1.6% (2015: 2.6%), with economic growth
increasing considerably over the last two quarters, following a weak performance in the first half of the year. Overall,
however, the increase in overall economic output experienced a marked slowdown. Growth stimuli came primarily
from domestic demand. Private consumption expenditure increased noticeably again, recording real growth of 2.7%
(2015: 3.2%), whereas state consumption expenditure stagnated and corporate investment even declined in comparison to the previous year. The US labour market delivered a robust performance in the past year, resulting in continued
growth in employment and a fall in average annual unemployment levels to 4.9% (2015: 5.3%). As in prior years, given
that imports grew at a much faster rate than exports, foreign trade did not provide any positive impetus in 2016.

SECTOR-SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENT
MULTICHANNEL RETAIL
In 2016, the entire German retail sector recorded a nominal rise in revenue of 2.3% compared to the previous year
(2015: 2.6%). Adjusted for inflation, this corresponds to a rise of 1.8% (2015: 2.5%). The significant increase in retail sales
can be explained by the continued positive development of the German economy in 2016. Real wages grew noticeably once again by 1.8%, following the previous year’s increase of 2.4%. In addition, the continued growth in employment witnessed over the past ten years continued, with employment figures reaching a new high. Low interest rates
likewise provided positive stimuli. At 0.5%, the average rise in consumer prices in 2016 was decidedly moderate and
was only slightly above the previous year’s annual rate of inflation of 0.3%. In particular, the decline in energy prices
had a deflationary effect, as in the previous years. Against the background of this overall economic development,
private-household consumption expenditure, adjusted for inflation, increased by 2.0% in the past year (2015: 2.0%).
The German online and mail-order sales sector increased its sales of goods by 9.1% in 2016 to EUR 57.1 billion
(2015: EUR 52.4 billion). The share in total retail sales thus increased to 12.7%, considerably exceeding last year’s figure
of 11.7% as a result of the less dynamic development of the German retail sector.
In the e-commerce sector especially, above-average sales increases of 12.5% were recorded, whereby sales of goods
in pure online business exceeded EUR 52.7 billion (2015: EUR 46.9 billion). Clothing remained the best-selling class of
products in 2016 in the e-commerce sector – followed by electronics and telecommunications products, computer
equipment and games, software products and books. At the same time, classes of products that up to now were not
particularly compatible with the mail-order sector, such as furniture and decoration as well as groceries, once again
recorded significant increases in revenue.

Internet usage via smartphones and tablets also increased further in 2016 in Germany. In terms of sales, the
percentage of orders of goods in the German e-commerce sector placed via the mobile Internet rose slightly to
24.0% in 2016 (2015: 22.0%).

FINANCIAL SERVICES
Gro u p M anage m en t Rep or t

The continuing positive development of the German economy in 2016 also had an effect on the German financial
services sector. In the past year, the number of company insolvencies decreased for the seventh time in a row and
declined noticeably by 6.9% to 21,518 cases compared to the previous year (2015: 23,123 cases). The number of company
insolvencies thus reached its lowest level since the introduction of the German Insolvency Code in 1999. However,
creditors’ claims arising from filed company insolvencies rose to approximately EUR 27.4 billion (2015: EUR 17.3 billion)
and the average claim amount per insolvency was EUR 1.3 million (2015: EUR 0.7 million). The significant increase in
receivables combined with the decline in the number of company insolvencies is due to the fact that more economically significant companies had to file for insolvency in 2016 than in the previous year.
German companies’ payment behaviour stabilised at a very high level in 2016. Companies identified temporary
liquidity bottlenecks, payment default by their own customers and taking advantage of supplier credit as the main

Co nsolidate d Financi al State m en ts

reasons for not meeting payment obligations. On the other hand, low order volumes played a distinctly minor role.
The number of consumer insolvencies also declined in comparison to the previous year. With 77,238 cases, it was
3.9% below the corresponding figure for the previous year of 80,347 cases. Personal over-indebtedness, unchecked
consumerism, and intentional non-payment were given as the main reasons for not meeting payment obligations.
On the other hand, job losses played only a minor role in light of the continuing positive development of the German
economy. In 2016, it was primarily companies in the online and mail-order retail sectors, the craft sector and the
general service sector that were affected by poor payment behaviour at consumer level.

SERVICES
In 2016, the German transport and logistics industry was characterised by the fact that, overall, goods transport was
able to sustain the continued positive development witnessed since 2010 (with a slight decrease in 2012). Total freight
volume rose by 1.1% on average over the year and was thus slightly below the corresponding growth figure for the
previous year of 1.2%. The dynamic performance of the German economy in 2016 therefore also had an effect, albeit
in weaker form, on the transport sector.
Developments in individual transport-intensive sectors were varied. Road freight transport increased by 1.5%
(2015: 1.5%) compared to the previous year and continued to dominate goods transport in Germany with a share of
78.6% in total freight volume (2015: 78.1%). On the other hand, due to a negative development in freight volumes,

N o tes

OTTO

inland navigation recorded a minus figure of 0.8% (2015: – 3.1%) and rail freight transport recorded a decline of 1.6%
(2015: +0.6%). Air freight transport grew by 3.4% (2015: 0.1%) in comparison to the previous year.
In addition to a continued intensely competitive market environment, the development of crude oil prices and wage
costs in particular have had a noticeable influence on the German transport and logistics sector. Overall, general
cost levels in German goods transport displayed only a slight upward trend in 2016. In addition to higher personnel
expenses as a result of collective wage agreements, crude oil prices rose during the course of 2016. Nevertheless, the
rise in the price of crude oil proved decidedly moderate, which meant that the development of fuel costs did not have
a significant negative impact on the German transport and logistics sector.

COURSE OF BUSINESS
In light of the encouraging development among the larger Group companies, the Otto Group was able to sustain its
revenue growth and increase profitability at all earnings levels in the 2016/17 financial year.
Revenue showed positive development in all three segments and grew by a total of 3.4% to EUR 12.5 billion. On a
comparable basis, i.e. adjusted for changes to the scope of consolidation, the Otto Group achieved an increase in
revenue of 5.0%. E-commerce revenue in the Multichannel Retail segment recorded a particularly positive development, growing significantly by 7.7% to EUR 7.0 billion and on a comparable basis even by 10.1%.
Earnings before tax (EBT), amounting to EUR 261.9 million, increased significantly compared to last year’s EBT figure
of EUR 186.9 million. The major Group companies and sub-groups, such as OTTO, bonprix, Witt and EOS, were once
again able to generate very positive results in operational terms. While the myToys Group and the About You open
commerce model continued to have an adverse effect on the result, they showed very positive development in terms
of revenue. Due to the ongoing restructuring of its business model, SportScheck GmbH experienced a drop in revenue
and a negative impact on earnings related to the restructuring.
The retail activities of the 3SI Group in France, recognised as a discontinued operation since the 2015/16 financial
year – hereafter referred to as the 3SI Commerce operation – were successfully disposed of or wound up in the past
financial year and placed a strain on the Group’s consolidated earnings for the last time in the 2016/17 financial year.
Following a consolidated loss of EUR – 189.6 million in the 2015/16 financial year, the Otto Group recorded a consolidated profit of EUR 40.7 million.
Overall, the course of the 2016/17 financial year may be described as successful. The growth in revenue and earnings
(EBT) forecast for the 2016/17 financial year in the 2015/16 Group Management Report was surpassed.

THE GROUP’S FINANCIAL PERFOR M ANCE
The Otto Group’s revenue increased by 3.4% in the 2016/17 financial year, from EUR 12,104.4 million to
EUR 12,511.8 million. This corresponds to an increase of EUR 407.3 million, which was made possible due to the positive development in all three segments.
In the 2015/16 Group Management Report, currency-rate-adjusted revenue growth of approximately 4% was forecast for the Group on a comparable basis for the 2016/17 financial year. The currency-rate-adjusted revenue figure
recorded on a comparable basis for the 2016/17 financial year was above expectations.

Overall, 78.2% of the Otto Group’s revenue was obtained from the sale of merchandise (EUR 9,782.4 million, 2015/16:
79.1%), 5.8% from revenue from financial services (EUR 730.5 million, 2015/16: 5.6%), and 16.0% from revenue from
other services (EUR 1,998.9 million, 2015/16: 15.3%). The Group’s development in terms of revenue in the 2016/17 financial year was therefore characterised once again by the sale of merchandise through its online retail, catalogue business, and over-the-counter retail distribution channels.
With a share of 61.5% (2015/16: 61.7%) in the Otto Group’s revenue, Germany remained the Group’s most significant
regional sales market in the 2016/17 financial year. While 19.8% (2015/16: 20.4%) of revenue was derived from Europe
(excluding Germany and Russia), North America contributed 14.6% (2015/16: 13.8%) to the Otto Group’s revenue.

Developments in the Group’s individual sales markets were varied. In Germany, revenue growth of 3.1% was achieved
in the past financial year. Most notably the Group companies OTTO, bonprix Handelsgesellschaft mbH and the myToys
Group, but also e-commerce start-up Collins, which was launched in the 2014/15 financial year, recorded strong
revenue growth and contributed to the positive development in the main sales market in Germany. The rest of Europe
recorded a slight increase in revenue of 0.5% on a euro basis, which was strongly affected by fluctuations in the British
pound exchange rate. On a currency-rate-adjusted basis, revenue in the rest of Europe increased by a very satisfactory
6.0 %. The North American Crate and Barrel furnishings and lifestyle group reported a significant increase in revenue
of 10.7% both on a euro basis and in the local currency.
The Group’s gross profit margin amounted to 47.9% (2015/16: 48.2%) which almost was on a par with the previous
year. In absolute terms, gross profit rose by EUR 154.9 million to EUR 5,992.5 million.
While other operating income rose by EUR 18.8 million and personnel expenses fell by EUR 32.4 million, other operating expenses moved in the opposite direction with an increase of EUR 119.0 million. The decline in personnel
expenses was primarily driven by diminished negative impacts compared to the previous year resulting from the
reorganisation of the logistics infrastructure in Germany and from restructuring as part of portfolio measures in the
previous year. In terms of other operating expenses, it was primarily expenses for advertising that increased significantly. The reorganisation of the logistics infrastructure in Germany also had significant adverse effects in the 2016/17
financial year, which are included under both personnel expenses and other operating expenses.
As a result of these favourable developments in business operations, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation (EBITDA) amounted to EUR 730.4 million in the 2016/17 financial year, which is considerably higher than
last year’s EBITDA figure of EUR 638.9 million.
In the past financial year, depreciation, amortisation and impairments together fell by EUR 15.3 million to
EUR 365.0 million. This figure reflects a decline of EUR 15.7 million attributable to the amortisation of intangible assets
and of property, plant and equipment. At a total of EUR 90.1 million, impairment losses were on par with the previous
year’s level (2015/16: EUR 89.7 million). This includes impairment losses on goodwill amounting to EUR 5.1 million
(2015/16: EUR 17.9 million). In the 2016/17 financial year, impairment losses on other intangible assets and on property, plant and equipment were primarily attributable to software developed in-house and acquired customer lists,
as well as land and buildings, and predominantly related to one German retailer in the Multichannel Retail segment.
Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) increased to EUR 365.5 million in the 2016/17 financial year
(2015/16: EUR 258.6 million). Due to the stronger increase in EBIT in proportion to revenue, the EBIT margin increased
significantly to 2.9% compared to 2.1% in the previous year.
The Group’s net financial result in the 2016/17 financial year was EUR – 103.6 million, which is lower than the
previous year’s figure of EUR – 71.8 million. Net interest income (expense) amounted to EUR – 89.5 million
(2015/16: EUR – 105.8 million) and other net financial income (expense) amounted to EUR – 14.1 million compared
to EUR 34.1 million in the previous year. The decline in the net financial result was primarily due to the fact that the
disposal of companies in the framework of the portfolio optimisation process had less of an impact in the 2016/17
financial year than in the previous year.
Earnings before tax (EBT) amounted to EUR 261.9 million, which is a significant EUR 75.0 million higher than the corresponding result for the previous year of EUR 186.9 million.

With this EBT development, the EBT forecast given in the previous year was achieved. In the 2015/16 Group Management Report, the EBT figure forecast for the Group for the 2016/17 financial year was expected to significantly exceed
the EBT figure of EUR 186.9 million reported in the 2015/16 financial year.
The income tax expense for the 2016/17 financial year amounted to EUR 98.3 million and thus lay slightly above the
Gro u p M anage m en t Rep or t

previous year’s income tax expense of EUR 96.8 million. The increased current income tax in Germany was slightly
compensated for by decreased current income tax in other countries. Furthermore, tax expense increased as a result
of deferred tax.
The result from the discontinued operation 3SI Commerce in the 2016/17 financial year amounted to EUR – 122.9 million
compared to EUR – 279.6 million in the previous year. For more information, refer to the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements (see Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as at 28 February 2017, Note (5)(c): “Discontinued operations and disposal groups”).
With an increase of EUR 230.3 million, the profit for the year, at EUR 40.7 million, was significantly higher than the
annual result for the previous year of EUR – 189.6 million. Of this, EUR – 34.0 million (2015/16: EUR – 218.6 million) was

attributable to the owners of the parent company, EUR 68.9 million (2015/16: EUR 26.2 million) to non-controlling
interests and EUR 5.8 million (2015/16: EUR 2.8 million) to participation certificates.

MULTICHANNEL RETAIL
In the 2016/17 financial year, the Multichannel Retail segment achieved revenue of EUR 9,818.7 million
(2015/16: EUR 9,588.1 million) and contributed 78.5% (2015/16: 79.2%) to the Otto Group’s revenue. The increase in
revenue of 2.4% compared to the previous year was due in part to positive growth in the larger Group companies. On
a currency-adjusted basis, revenue increased by 2.7%. On a comparable basis, a satisfactory currency-rate-adjusted
growth in revenue of 5.2% was achieved (2015/16: 5.6%).
In the 2015/16 Group Management Report, a currency-rate-adjusted increase in revenue almost equal to the strong
revenue growth of 5.6% achieved in the 2015/16 financial year was forecast on a comparable basis. This forecast was
thus achieved.

GROUP

– A n n u a l Re p o r t 2016/17

Online retail, the distribution channel with the strongest growth, characterised segment development once
again in the past financial year. E-commerce revenue increased noticeably by 7.7% to EUR 7,016.5 million
(2015/16: EUR 6,515.5 million). The segment’s share in revenue amounted to 71.5% and lay distinctly above the corresponding figure for the previous year of 68.0%. The Otto Group therefore continued to benefit noticeably from the
very dynamic growth in the online retail market.
Group company OTTO’s performance was exceptionally positive in the 2016/17 financial year. Revenue rose considerably by 6.3%. The largest driver of growth was the furniture and furnishings product range. In addition, the bonprix
Group and the myToys Group in particular, as well as e-commerce start-up Collins, achieved considerably higher
revenue. The Heine Group experienced a decline in revenue of 23.5%, which was primarily attributable to the sale
of Alba Moda GmbH. SportScheck GmbH also experienced a decline in revenue due to the restructuring of its business model.
In terms of international activities, developments in revenue figures were very varied. Revenue in the Russian market
remained stable, despite ongoing difficulties in the domestic economic climate. In the rest of Europe, revenue
decreased by 4.5% on a euro basis, primarily due to the portfolio adjustment in France that took place in the previous
year and fluctuations in the British pound exchange rate in the 2016/17 financial year. On a currency-adjusted basis,
the rest of Europe recorded an increase in revenue of 2.5% in this segment. The North America region reported the
strongest growth in revenue. For the Crate and Barrel furnishings and lifestyle group, which primarily operates in
the USA and Canada, revenue increased by 10.7% both on a euro basis and in the local currency, due primarily to a
realignment in the product range.
The increase in revenue in the Multichannel Retail segment brought about an increase in gross profit of
EUR 87.7 million. In the 2016/17 financial year, the gross profit margin was 48.1%, which was on par with the previous
year (2015/16: 48.3%). Despite the continuing positive development among the core companies, earnings from this
segment were below the previous year’s figure. A high degree of strain, particularly due to the substantial increase
in impairment losses as well as to renewed intensified investment in new business models, led to a decrease in the
Multichannel Retail segment’s EBIT figure from EUR 178.1 million to EUR 146.1 million in the 2016/17 financial year.

FINANCIAL SERVICES
The Financial Services segment, which is primarily driven by the business operations of the internationally operating
EOS Group, reported a continued positive business performance in the 2016/17 financial year. Revenue from this
segment increased from EUR 678.3 million to EUR 732.4 million. This increase in revenue of 8.0% is attributable to
a high performance in debt collection. The EOS Group also completed significant debt purchases, which had a positive effect on the development of revenue figures in this financial year. In last year’s Group Management Report, a
currency-rate-adjusted increase in revenue that considerably exceeded the growth of 5.0% achieved in the previous
year was forecast for the 2016/17 financial year. This forecast was clearly achieved thanks to the currency-rate-adjusted increase in revenue of 8.2%. The segment’s share in the Group’s revenue was 5.9%, which was slightly higher
than the previous year (2015/16: 5.6%).
The Financial Services segment’s EBIT figure increased by EUR 94.1 million to EUR 297.0 million in the 2016/17 financial
year. This development was due among other things to the positive business performance in the area of consumer
credit; furthermore, the previous year’s result was negatively impacted by the business operations and closure costs
of the Yapital Group.

SERVICES
In the Services segment, a substantial increase in external revenue from EUR 1,838.0 million to EUR 1,960.7 million
was recorded in the 2016/17 financial year. The segment grew considerably with an increase of 6.7% in revenue. The
positive increase in currency-rate-adjusted revenue of 11.9% exceeded the currency-adjusted figure of just under 11.5%
that was forecast in the 2015/16 Group Management Report for the 2016/17 financial year. The share in the Group’s
Gro u p M anage m en t Rep or t

revenue rose from 15.2% to 15.7%. In the Services segment, external revenue amounted to 64.8% of total revenue in
the segment.
The segment is primarily characterised by the internationally operating Group companies under the Hermes umbrella
brand. These benefit from the rise in e-commerce revenue and the increase in retail-related services in the service
area in connection therewith. The Hermes Group was therefore able to increase its revenue in the 2016/17 financial year by 4.9% compared to the previous year. Hermes Germany GmbH in particular achieved excellent growth in
revenue, and the successful business expansion in France, due in part to the acquisition of GIRARD AGEDISS, also
contributed to the positive development of the segment. In contrast, Group company Hermes Parcelnet Limited in the
United Kingdom most notably experienced development in the other direction. The company experienced a decline
in revenue of 3.9%, which was negatively impacted by the performance of the British pound. In the local currency,

Co nsolidate d Financi al State m en ts

however, a satisfactory increase in revenue of 10.1% was reported.
Despite the negative impact on earnings resulting from the further development of the logistics infrastructure in
Germany, the Hermes Group generated a positive EBIT contribution. Extraordinary charges in Germany amounted
to a total of EUR 42.8 million, which are included under personnel expenses, other operating expenses and impairment losses. In the previous year, the Services segment was affected by extraordinary effects in Germany and France
amounting to EUR 68.6 million. The segment’s EBIT figure improved significantly in the 2016/17 financial year, rising
from EUR – 35.3 million to EUR 5.8 million.

HOLDING/CONSOLIDATION
Apart from the effects of inter-segment consolidation, the holding/consolidation item reported inter-divisional costs
of Group functions amounting to EUR 83.4 million (2015/16: EUR 87.1 million), which could not be reliably allocated
to the above-mentioned segments.

Cash flow from operating activities for the 2016/17 financial year amounted to EUR 183.6 million, which was below
the previous year’s figure of EUR 480.4 million. This was negatively impacted by the restructuring and subsequent
disposal of the 3SI Commerce operation in France, as well as the 3SI Group’s operating cash burn rate. The extension
of working capital also contributed to the decline, and is attributable in particular to purchases of receivables packages in the case of the EOS Group. Targeted investment in debt purchasing and international receivables management will increase the EOS Group’s profitability in the short-to-medium term.
Cash flow from investing activities in the 2016/17 financial year was determined by a number of elements, including
the continued high investments in IT and logistics, including for the further expansion of the Hermes Group’s logistics infrastructure and the ongoing upgrade of OTTO’s IT landscape, as well as the successful development of the
Crate and Barrel Group. Furthermore, a logistics service provider in France was acquired, in addition to further equity
investments by the EVC Group. Cash flow from investing activities in the 2016/17 financial year was also negatively
impacted by the disposal of Group companies from the discontinued operation 3SI Commerce in France.
Cash flow from financing activities was influenced by the increase in the Group’s net financial debt. The proceeds
from the assumption of other financial liabilities increased significantly in comparison to the previous 2015/16 financial year and led to a net assumption of cash and cash equivalents overall in the 2016/17 financial year.

Financing

The decline in equity of EUR 209.5 million is primarily due to actuarial losses on pensions obligations being taken into
account. The amount of actuarial losses resulted almost entirely from the sharp drop in the actuarial interest rate.
Furthermore, dividends paid primarily to minority shareholders resulted in a reduction in equity.
Non-current provisions and liabilities increased by EUR 377.6 million, corresponding to 12.1%, to EUR 3,504.5 million
in comparison to the previous year. This change is due in part to the significant increase in provisions for pensions,
which can be attributed to actuarial losses resulting from the decrease in the actuarial interest rate. In addition, a
bond amounting to EUR 250 million with a term of seven years was issued in the 2016/17 financial year. On the other
hand, two bonds due in the 2017/18 financial year were reclassified as current provisions and liabilities.
Current provisions and liabilities increased by EUR 442.9 million, corresponding to 14.2%, to EUR 3,569.3 million in
the 2016/17 financial year. This was essentially due to the increase in bonds payable, which resulted from the current
securities issued as part of the new commercial paper programme as well as from the reclassification of bonds from
non-current provisions and liabilities.

NET FINANCIAL DEBT
N o tes

OTTO

The Otto Group’s net financial debt increased by EUR 352.5 million to EUR 2,300.4 million in the 2016/17 financial year.
This represents an increase of 18.1%, which was primarily attributable to Group companies in the Financial Services
segment.
The larger operational Group activities continued to generate sufficient liquidity to sustain ongoing high investment
in IT and logistics infrastructure, as well as in the Otto Group’s new business models. The rise in debt is primarily
driven by the very high strain on liquidity caused by the restructuring and subsequent disposal of the 3SI Commerce
operation in France. Furthermore, the extensive purchase of receivables packages in the case of the EOS Group also
led to an increase in net financial debt.

decreased by EUR 211.6 million, whereby the decline, in addition to impairment losses from the previous financial
year, was primarily due to the proportionate disposal of the carrying amount of the Cofidis Group, accounted for
using the equity method. On the other hand, contrary effects on non-current assets arose from purchases of receivables packages in the case of the EOS Group as a result of the expansion of the receivables management business.
Current assets increased by EUR 635.6 million or 17.7% in the past financial year. This development is primarily due
to the purchase price claim from the sale of shares in Cofidis due in the 2017/18 financial year, which is included in
other financial assets and amounts to EUR 304 million. In addition, the inventories of large Group companies in the
Multichannel Retail segment increased as a result of the expansion of their business operations.

Capital expenditure on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment increased by EUR 50.8 million to
EUR 382.5 million in the 2016/17 financial year. This primarily related to IT and logistics infrastructures in various

Group companies.
The Hermes Group invested in the expansion of its logistics infrastructure and upgrading its software landscape in
both Germany (Hermes Germany GmbH) and the United Kingdom (Hermes Parcelnet Limited) in order to increase
capacity and respond to increased demand. In the 2016/17 financial year, Group company OTTO made high investments in the IT landscape, among other things, in order to position itself for future competitive requirements, particularly in the area of e-commerce. Moreover, extensive construction work was carried out at Hamburg-Bramfeld. In light
of the successful further development, the Crate and Barrel Group invested in IT infrastructure as well as in existing
and new over-the-counter retail stores. Furthermore, a number of additional Group companies from the Multichannel
Retail segment invested in existing and new webshops as well as in further digitisation.

REPORTING THE
FINANCIAL SERVICES
PROVIDERS USING THE
“AT EQUITY” METHOD
The following presentation shows, additionally, the Otto Group’s balance sheet based on reporting the Group companies in the Financial Services segment using the equity method – hereafter “FS at equity” – instead of by full consolidation, as is the case in the consolidated financial statements as at 28 February 2017. This approach presents the
Otto Group’s Multichannel Retail and Services segments excluding the banking-type structures in the Financial
Services segment. The presentation chosen permits a valid comparison with retail companies that do not have such
financial services activities.
The key financial figures and indicators in “FS at equity” show that the Otto Group’s retail and services sectors continue
to have a very sound financing structure. Total assets amount to EUR 7,144.9 million, compared to EUR 6,833.5 million
in the previous year. The increase is largely due to the growth of the EOS Group, which is reflected in an increased
amount of investments in associates and joint ventures. The Group equity ratio amounts to 17.5% compared to a figure
of 21.4% last year. The decline was primarily attributable to the actuarial losses relating to the valuation of pensions
recognised directly in equity.
In the “FS at equity” presentation, net financial debt increased by 8.8% to EUR 1,432.4 million compared to the
previous year, largely due to the continued strain on liquidity caused by the restructuring and sale of the discontinued operation 3SI Commerce. Theoretically, it would take 2.0 years to pay off the net financial debt completely
using results from operations (EBITDA). The central credit rating therefore improved despite the high payments for
the restructuring activities in France. The leverage ratio amounts to 1.1.

Opportunities and risks report

OTTO

GROUP

– A n n u a l Re p o r t 2016/17

OPPORTUNITIES AND
RISKS REPORT
The value-driven management of risk and opportunity is an integral element of the Otto Group’s corporate strategy.
Systematic, strategic corporate planning ensures that opportunities for growth and development and the potential to
optimise the business can be comprehensively identified and evaluated. Any risks that arise are countered by means
of a Group-wide Risk Management System – hereafter RMS. The purpose of the RMS is to ensure as balanced a relationship as possible between opportunities and risks from a business management point of view. To do so, it supports
decision-makers in identifying and minimising risks in good time and also in taking advantage of opportunities.

RISK M ANAGEMENT SYSTEM
All Group companies in which the Otto Group directly or indirectly holds 50% or more of the voting rights or over
which it is able to exercise a controlling influence are included in the RMS pursuant to Group-wide guidelines and
directives. Risks are collated from the bottom up – incrementally from the individual Group companies through the
sub-groups up to Group level. This approach ensures that risks are recorded where they arise. The RMS enables risks
to be identified and monitored at an early stage, so that appropriate measures can be taken immediately to limit the
possible repercussions of the risks, should they materialise.
The relevant process implemented for this comprises the following steps:

▶ Identification and quantification
Each year, the Group Controlling division carries out an inventory of risks across the whole Group. Risks to the
business reported by the respective Group companies and/or divisions are analysed in terms of their possible
impact over a three-year planning period. The principal risks are identified by the Group companies and divisions
according to defined operational and functional risk categories and fields using checklists. The risks are then
assessed according to their probability of occurrence and the amount of damage they could cause. This assessment is carried out both in gross terms before risk control measures, and in net terms after risk mitigation measures. Risks are included in reporting according to individually established materiality limits or possible levels of
damage, which depend on company size. The risks reported in the annual risk inventory are updated during the
year for the meetings of the Advisory Boards of Group companies. Moreover, ad hoc risk reporting ensures that
the Group’s Executive Board is immediately informed should new material risks occur at any other time than
the official reporting times named.

▶ Management and monitoring
The results of the risk inventory are presented in a risk matrix. This classifies all risks by their probability of occurrence and their economic effects and thus ensures that the Otto Group‘s risk situation remains transparent.
Group companies and/or functions safeguard the commercial success of their business operations by specifying countermeasures to avoid or mitigate risks, or to transfer risks to a third party through an insurance policy,
for example. Risks that have been classified as relevant because they are at least moderately likely to occur and
have major implications for earnings and liquidity, as well as indicators relevant to the risk are subject to more
intensive monitoring.

GROUP

Opportunities and risks report

The Executive and Supervisory Boards are informed of relevant developments in risk management. Responsibility
for risk management lies with the Group’s Executive Board and the managing directors of the Group companies.
The close interlocking of the Internal Control System with the Financial Controlling/Reporting divisions ensures the
effectiveness of the RMS.
Gro u p M anage m en t Rep or t

Coordinated corporate communication is a central component of risk management at the Otto Group. There are
binding regulations concerning the measures to be initiated in the event of an identified crisis. In addition, the
Otto Group helps obviate potential risks to its reputation by regularly issuing confidence-building PR communication on relevant Corporate Responsibility matters. The RMS is under constant development by the management division organisationally responsible, in cooperation with Group Controlling, and is reviewed by Group Internal Audit.

OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS ARISING FROM
M ARKET DEVELOPMENTS

Co nsolidate d Financi al State m en ts

As an internationally operating retail and service group, the Otto Group is dependent on the overall development of
the economies relevant to it, and on the resulting effects on consumer behaviour. The global economic outlook for
2017 is characterised by expected further growth in overall economic output. Nonetheless, there are still potential
risk factors and uncertainties influencing the performance of the global economy, which arise from pending decisions relating to economic, trade and monetary policy, the impact of the development in crude oil prices, potential
turbulence in financial markets and ongoing geopolitical crises.
A gradual increase in economic growth is forecast for advanced economies for 2017, which is likely to be characterised
by high growth rates in overall economic output. Against the backdrop of the progressive increase in employment,
rising private consumption expenditure and a highly dynamic corporate investment environment, the upturn in the
German economy will continue in the current year. In the Euro area, economic growth is set to continue at the same
moderate pace due to upward trends in the domestic economy and lead to a further improvement in the employment situation. In the USA, significant economic growth is expected in the current year, which will be primarily driven
by a continuous rise in private-household consumption expenditure. At the same time, pending economic and trade
policy decisions by the new US administration have resulted in uncertainty. On the whole, however, this provides
the Otto Group with an opportunity, as overall economic development in major sales markets in Europe and North
America, due to increased private consumption expenditure in particular, will have a positive effect on business
performance.

Following a pronounced weak phase, the overall economic situation in the emerging economies – and thus in potential growth markets for the Otto Group – stabilised for the most part in the past year, and strengthened economic
growth in the current year seems increasingly likely. However, structural problems remain in many economies in
these countries, and will at least partially inhibit the pace of economic growth in the future. In Russia, the signs of
overall economic recovery are expected to become stronger, although a sustainable economic upturn seems unlikely
due to the continuing adverse institutional conditions. The difficult labour-market situation and the inflation rate,
which remains high despite a noticeable decrease, will continue to have a negative impact on private consumption
expenditure due to falling real wages.

The very intense competition on the retail side continues to be a crucial competitive factor for the Otto Group. High
price sensitivity in the European and North American retail sector in particular continued to have a noticeable impact
on the development in these sales markets. It is also expected that cotton prices, which have been rising steadily
since March 2016, and crude oil prices, which are expected to stabilise at a low level, will have an neutral effect on
business performance overall. However, factor costs in manufacturing countries, primarily in Asia, will continue to
rise in the long term. Developments are continuously monitored and analysed to ensure that appropriate measures
can be identified, such as the potential relocation to other procurement markets. They are also taken into account
within the framework of the continued development of Group strategy and the renewal of offerings to customers.
The Otto Group’s strategy – its international positioning and the servicing of different market segments through
various sales channels – is instrumental in spreading risks in the long term. With its various business models the
Group is capable of facing the challenges of regional market developments as they arise. Active portfolio management supports the successful implementation of strategic goals. As part of an annual analysis of the Group portfolio, the potential of each Group company is evaluated and, where applicable, the portfolio is adjusted. Thanks
to continued efforts, further improvements have been achieved in the past year. The decision to discontinue 3SI
Commerce in France, an unprofitable operation operating in a difficult market environment, was successfully implemented with the sale of the associated activities. This provides the Otto Group with an opportunity to significantly
enhance profitability. At the same time, further potential portfolio optimisations present both opportunities and
risks. For instance, following several expressions of interest from other market participants in the warehouse logistics sector, further streamlining of the portfolio with regard to the French service providers could be conceivable.
In the Multichannel Retail segment, the Otto Group envisages significant growth opportunities in the continuous
further development of e-commerce. The success story of e-commerce start-up Collins, which was launched in
2014, continued in the 2016/17 financial year with the About You open commerce model. The open commerce model
continued to experience rapid growth, and achieved revenue in the triple-digit million euro range for the first time in
the past financial year. About You shows the greatest e-commerce growth potential in the fashion-discovery segment,
and as a result is continuously improving the personalisation of its online shop. In 2016, this included redesigning
the newsfeed and implementing several new features. By combining inspiring content, personal recommendations
and seamless integration with mobile devices, About You has already been able to significantly increase order rates
per customer. The company’s success is also attracting investors. In summer 2016, a number of strategic media partners acquired a minority share in About You. This new partnership with leading European media houses provided an
opportunity to drive growth even further.
Group company OTTO is one of Germany’s leading e-commerce companies. In the 2016/17 financial year, a number of
other sales activities and initiatives, such as “Germany tests OTTO”, were carried out with the aim of continuing the
dynamic growth levels of the previous year. Furthermore, with its “OTTO Now” rental model, OTTO has succeeded in
making a new, innovative business model available for market testing within a short space of time. This will allow
customers to rent products from ottonow.de for a period of time. This approach has allowed OTTO to access new
potential customer groups.
Both existing and new B2B business models for the digital retail domain have been grouped together under the
umbrella of Otto Group Digital Solutions GmbH. Thus, the Otto Group’s goal is to use innovative technologies to
develop new marketable concepts right across the Group portfolio’s value chain, and to fully capitalise on the continuously growing opportunities in digitisation. Otto Group Media GmbH, which offers marketing and user-based distribution services for advertising spaces, is set to continue its growth in the coming financial year. Using this business
model, the Otto Group will continue to maximise on existing potential within the Group. As a result, the Otto Group
has the opportunity to benefit from the growth in e-commerce via the advertising marketing channel.

Furthermore, the Otto Group sees clear opportunities in deeper market penetration of foreign target markets.
However, it must also contend with the economic and industry-specific risks inherent in these markets. The Crate
and Barrel Group’s business saw very positive growth across all brands and sales channels in the USA and Canada.
This was due to the multiple measures taken along the entire value chain. These measures relate to the presentation of product ranges in stores and in the online shop, as well as improvements in logistics and in organisational
Gro u p M anage m en t Rep or t

structures. Further measures are planned for the 2017/18 financial year, such as the opening of additional stores. At
the same time, further economic and trade policy decisions by the new US administration have resulted in uncertainty, which could lead to difficult import conditions. Venus Fashion, Inc., a bonprix Group company in the USA,
also recorded an encouraging increase in sales. Further growth opportunities are expected to develop here in the
future. In the United Kingdom, Freemans Grattan Holdings – hereafter FGH – recorded considerable growth in local
currency in the mail-order sector for the 2016/17 financial year. In addition to sustained high levels of investment in
its customer base, measures were taken to enhance the shopping experience, such as extending the order deadline
for next-day delivery to 10.30 p.m. and offering mobile apps. These measures have had a positive effect on business
performance. Through the implementation of further measures, FGH expects this growth trend to continue for the
2017/18 financial year. Nevertheless, there are a number of risk factors associated with the Brexit decision and the
direct impact that this could have on FGH’s business performance. As a result, a cross-divisional Brexit project team

Co nsolidate d Financi al State m en ts

was put in place to closely monitor developments with a view to recommending a requirements-based course of
action for the Otto Group. In Russia, the business performance of all of the Otto Group’s Russian activities is influenced by the overall economic conditions as well as the high volatility of the Russian rouble. Diverse measures have
been taken to counteract the resulting risks. Exchange rate fluctuations are currently favourable and signs of overall
economic recovery are expected to become stronger in Russia, therefore creating long-term growth opportunities
for the Otto Group’s activities.
Market opportunities for profitable growth continue to be seen in the Financial Services segment. Continued strong
growth is expected, particularly for the EOS Group, both in Germany and abroad in Europe. On the other hand, there
are risks associated with the potential tightening of legal conditions for operations as well as with potential default
by major customers, for instance due to a European banking crisis.
In the coming financial years, the Services segment is also set to benefit from the strong domestic and international
momentum in the markets in which the Hermes Group – hereafter Hermes – is active. However, the appeal of these
markets also means a high level of competition from existing and new market participants. Against this backdrop,
Hermes has created a comprehensive project portfolio to strengthen and develop its market position in a sustainable
manner, despite increasing competition and cost pressure. A new, innovative approach is being tested by carrying out
trials with delivery robots, for example. Furthermore, Hermes is currently optimising its geographical distribution in
Germany in order to substantially increase capacity, target new customer segments, and simultaneously improve

delivery times. This provides an opportunity to also benefit in the future from the rapidly growing e-commerce market
and the increasing number of deliveries from companies to private households. In the furnishing services sector,
Hermes has succeeded in maintaining its strong position as market leader. As part of its extended service offering,
the level of service for end customers was further improved by introducing delivery timeframes of three to four hours.
In an effort to strengthen the market position abroad, the completion of an acquisition opened up the French market
for furnishing services even further in the 2016/17 financial year.

FINANCIAL RISKS
The Otto Group’s worldwide orientation exposes it to a number of financial risks. These risks are identified, controlled
and managed with appropriate countermeasures. The Otto Group has to consider in particular the counterparty risk,
the liquidity risk and the market risk. A Group-wide binding directive (“special regulation for finances”) provides a
framework for the handling of financial risks.
The Group is exposed to a counterparty risk when contractual partners default on agreements. In a narrower sense,
counterparty credit risk refers to the risk inherent in a borrower or counterparty defaulting or partly defaulting on
liabilities due to a deterioration in its financial situation.
Adequate credit control systems are used to hedge credit risks, taking into account a reasonable risk segmentation
of the customer’s portfolio. Risk segmentation is continuously reviewed. Risk management also includes regularly
reviewing credit activities for business model-specific risks arising from changes in the macroeconomic environment. Existing response mechanisms are adjusted as needed. Furthermore, to reduce counterparty credit risk, the
Otto Group only works with commercial banks that have an adequate rating. Thanks to this qualitative selection
process and a balanced banking portfolio, the counterparty credit risk is reduced to a reasonable level. The Financial
Risk Controlling department regularly reviews the ratings of the Group’s banks.
The liquidity risk for the Otto Group consists in not having sufficient funds at its disposal to meet its payment obligations, or when the liquidity required cannot be obtained at anticipated conditions.
The financial management system ensures that Otto Group’s liquidity is maintained at all times. This ensures that
the Otto Group has sufficient funds at its disposal for its operations and investments. Financing instruments may
include money market products as well as leasing and factoring. A balanced banking portfolio together with sufficient free credit lines would guarantee the Otto Group’s liquidity at all times, even in a crisis-beset general economic
environment. Due to good ratings and close, long-term relationships with banks, the Otto Group remains in a position to hedge its liquidity through additional credit lines at any stage, even in a volatile financial market environment. No financial covenants are in place for the contracts concluded as part of central Group financing activities.
However, a risk may arise from the ongoing tightening of banking sector regulations. This may lead to banks offering
fewer credit options and being less willing to grant credit in the future. This risk was taken into account with the
bonds issued and the Group’s ability to access the capital market was demonstrated. With an issue volume of more
than EUR 1.7 billion, the Otto Group has been one of the largest unrated issuers since 2009. Since 2013, the EMTN
programme has provided the Otto Group with a platform for the flexible issuing of bonds, which the Group can
use to take full advantage of opportunities on the capital market. The Otto Group capitalised on this in the 2016/17
financial year with a public bond issue for EUR 250 million and a term of seven years. Since the 2016/17 financial year,
the Otto Group has also had access to a commercial paper programme for the issuing of short-term securities. This
enables the company group to also cover short-term financing requirements through the capital market in addition
to the use of existing credit lines with banks. The Otto Group’s liquidity needs are based on a rolling monthly liquidity
budget with a twelve-month horizon, and a daily budget with a horizon of four weeks or more. Both types of budget
are regularly reviewed for variances.

Opportunities and risks report

In the Otto Group, market risks within the meaning of the IFRS 7 categories are restricted to currencies and interest
rates. Foreign exchange risks arise from payments received in a foreign currency from customers and also from
payment obligations to suppliers which must be settled in a foreign currency. The latter primarily occurs when goods
are purchased in US dollars or Hong Kong dollars and subsequently sold in euros. An additional risk exists in Russia,
where goods are sometimes purchased in euros and sold in Russian roubles. Interest rate fluctuation risks arise in
Gro u p M anage m en t Rep or t

connection with the gains or losses incurred on interest-bearing items when interest rates change. Currency and
interest rate fluctuation risks are hedged by funding the underlying amounts in the same currency and with the same
maturity. Any remaining risks from open foreign currency and interest rate positions are assessed using appropriate
risk assessment methods. They are then further reduced as needed by the use of forward exchange and currency
option options, as well as interest rate swaps. The fundamental goal of risk management is to limit the impact of
market price fluctuations on cash flow to an acceptable level. An independent risk monitoring team examines the
appropriateness and effectiveness of the control measures, and compliance with reference rates and/or internal
rates of exchange. Appropriate reporting structures have been set up to ensure independent, regular risk reporting
to the various management teams. These guarantee both regular information about the current risk position and
also ad hoc reports.

Regarding the concentration of financial risks, refer to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (see Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements as at 28 February 2017, Note (37) Financial instruments).

OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS FROM
CORE PROCESSES
The Otto Group’s various operations give rise to opportunities and risks in the areas of procurement and logistics.
The ability to deliver good quality products promptly is a crucial competitive factor. Failure to deliver, delays and
inadequate quality can threaten the trust that customers place in the Group’s ability to process their orders reliably, and hence negatively impact mail-order sales. To counter these risks, the Otto Group practices professional
purchasing management, with special emphasis on the selection of its suppliers. Potential quality deficits are minimised through close collaboration with suppliers and manufacturers and through constant quality controls. This
systematic approach will also have a positive impact in light of the stricter legislation relating to placing textiles with
chemical substances on the market, allowing risks to be minimised. The Otto Group also places particular emphasis
on ensuring socially acceptable working conditions by means of a social management system and the inclusion of
suppliers of own brands and licensed brands in the social programme.

N o tes

OTTO

Apart from this, appropriate systems have been installed to support the purchasing processes. System support and
purchasing processes are constantly being fine-tuned to ensure the ready availability of goods at all times – even in
times of temporary shortages. Digital innovations are harnessed to develop and deploy data-driven, agile, and fast
processes.
The logistics area occupies a key position within the Otto Group. Highly advanced processes and systems are employed
here – from merchandise pick-up and goods movement to intelligent route planning for the Group’s own parcelservices providers. Based on many years of experience in logistics services, the Group maintains resources that are
able to cope even with the usual seasonal peaks. However, modified business models for intra-Group customers are
leading to new logistical challenges. For example, next-day delivery and extreme peaks in volume must be managed
by the Otto Group’s logistics companies. For this reason, logistical and IT changes must be made to existing systems,
and these challenges must also be addressed in personnel deployment planning. High-quality logistics services with
fast, reliable delivery times are defined in service-level agreements with both external and intra-Group customers
and are monitored on an ongoing basis. The logistics processes for the different ranges are now standardised and
documented, and form the basis for consistent service delivery.

The monitoring of developments in the raw materials market and rigorous cost control in the form of continual evaluation of the stock position using digital modules ensure an optimal stock structure across all product groups. The
expected long-term rise in purchasing prices and the general development of the markets are regularly reviewed
within the framework of risk management by those responsible for the individual product groups. If required, the
latter take suitable steps to strengthen the gross product margin.

OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS FROM
SUPPORT PROCESSES
The Otto Group’s IT systems are subject to continuous development in order to respond to constantly changing conditions and to the technical requirements of the business models and markets. The goal here is to decentralise the IT
systems and ensure that the the Otto Group’s IT department is in a position to provide the best possible support to
Group companies in terms of digitisation. By making IT customer relationships more professional and strengthening
the market focus of IT services, the Otto Group’s IT department is enabling Group-wide IT customers to focus on their
respective core businesses. The Otto Group sees this as an opportunity to safeguard the future online growth of the
Group in as optimal a way as possible.
In order to implement the decentralisation strategy, Group companies are given responsibility. They are responsible
for planning and managing the process of implementing their own decentralised IT strategies. The Group companies’
decentralisation plans, including any identified dependencies, are monitored centrally. Regular status reports on the
transformation ensure ongoing transparency. The particular challenges that emerge due to the parallelism of many
IT demands are counteracted by means of organisational and procedural measures which are designed and developed based on both current demands and changes expected in the future. An independent risk-control procedure is
established for key transformation projects.
For example, the A² programme was set up for digitisation purposes in the 2016/17 financial year. The A² programme
forms the framework for the significant expansion of the product range and the optimised creation of product data.
As such, it will provide the opportunity to profit even further from the growing e-commerce sector.
The pronounced use of information technology, particularly in confidential business processes such as e-commerce
and logistics processing, increases the need for protection against unauthorised access and misuse of data. The
Otto Group minimises these risks by deploying comprehensive security concepts. In addition to organisational measures, the security strategy comprises other elements such as installing firewall systems at a variety of levels and
deploying virus scanners and access controls at both operating system and application level. Furthermore, security
tests are regularly carried out by internal and external specialists, and the measures adopted on this basis are rigorously implemented and monitored.
The robustness and business continuity of the Otto Group’s own data centres, operated under its own responsibility,
are ensured by fire protection and emergency power supply systems, even after a fire or power interruption. Network
connection and power supply are provided by two separate sets of house lead-ins. Business-critical systems are stored
based on a redundant model in two data centres. This also applies to vital data that is permanently mirrored across
both data centres. Data is also regularly backed up. Data centres are protected in a number of ways and can only be
accessed via an access control system.

GROUP

Opportunities and risks report

The established IT emergency management process also provides for ongoing development of IT emergency precautionary measures. Regular emergency exercises are carried out in order to test the performance of the extensive security measures, both individually and as a group.
With a view to minimising risks, all system developments are carried out in separate environments; before going into
Gro u p M anage m en t Rep or t

current operation, they are subjected to a comprehensive range of tests and then released by a management team
comprising experts from the respective specialist departments and IT. The majority of the domestic SAP systems are
hosted at the data centres of a strategic partner who is regularly audited – together with their processes and service
performance – in accordance with defined criteria. These include audits by Group Internal Audit and also audit by
an independent firm of auditors.

CONTR ACT RISKS
Legal risks, compliance risks, competition issues and IP rights are assessed based on a comprehensive analysis of all
the relevant issues, consulting third-party experts as needed. Contracts are then drawn up in such a way as to mini-

Co nsolidate d Financi al State m en ts

mise these risks. Warranty risks are transferred to suppliers to the greatest possible extent, on the basis of contractual
stipulations. For any remaining risks, the Group maintains appropriate insurance coverage to minimise or completely
exclude any liability for damages.
At any given time, individual Group companies may be involved in litigation related to their operations. The
Otto Group has taken out insurance to minimise liability risks from these processes. At present there are no unusual
legal disputes to report.

OTHER RISKS
Other risks are identified within the framework of the central Risk Management System. They are analysed as to their
relevance and evaluated and steered with appropriate measures.

NO DISCERNIBLE OVER ALL RISK TO THE GROUP
Based on the information currently available, an overall assessment of the Group’s risk situation does not indicate
any risks that would threaten the Otto Group’s continued existence, either at present or in the future.

The continuous professional development and training of staff has always been a matter of great importance to
the Otto Group. Against the backdrop of the digital revolution, demographic and social change, and the shortage of
skilled workers that is becoming increasingly apparent, there is a growing need for a successful human resources
management strategy. One of the core objectives of the group-wide human resources strategy is therefore to support
and develop existing employee potential by ensuring that the right framework conditions and services are in place.
As a signatory to the “Diversity Charter” (http://www.charta-der-vielfalt.de/en/diversity-charter.html), the Otto Group
is committed to providing equal opportunities to each and every employee, regardless of gender, nationality, ethnic
background, religion or world view, physical ability, age, sexual orientation and identity. Diversity is also important
in order to be able to make use of the complexity of the digital revolution in innovative ways. For this reason, Groupwide Diversity Management focuses on the individual perspectives and capabilities of all employees. To support this
effort, the Group companies’ own specific diversity goals are continuously monitored and maintained using Groupwide diversity assessment measures.
Founded in 2012 by the Otto Group’s female executives, the aim of the “Power of Diversity” initiative is to foster the
development of future female executives across the Group through targeted activities, and thus increase the proportion of women in top management positions. In the context of the initiative, the Otto Group has already held two
Diversity Conferences which were each attended by over 100 female executives and a selection of male executives.
At the 2016 Diversity Conference, participants discussed the topics of diversity and leadership in the context of the
digital revolution. In addition, the “Boost Your Career” programme was specifically developed to promote the careers
of up-and-coming female executives. This programme is part of the Otto Group Academy’s strategic range of Groupwide development programmes, and was successfully run for the fourth time in 2016. The “Boost Your Network”
event in autumn 2016 also provided a platform that allowed participants of different “women and leadership” initi-

1 08

atives across the individual Otto Group companies to come together for the third time and exchange information.

Corporate Responsibility

In accordance with the German law on equal participation of men and women in managerial roles, the Otto Group
has set itself the following goals to be met by 30 June 2017: The Group’s Supervisory Board is aiming to reach a target
quota of 25% and the Executive Board is aiming to reach a target quota of 28%. Efforts are also being made by the
management boards of the Group companies covered by this law to ensure that at least one seat on each board
is filled by a woman. In terms of top-level management, the Group companies have set themselves the objective
Gro u p M anage m en t Rep or t

of achieving an average target quota of 23% and do not want to fall below an average target quota of 30% for the
second management tier.
As an internationally active group, networking and knowledge exchange between employees beyond company
and national boundaries is extremely important. A new company-wide work-shadowing platform was created at
the beginning of 2017 in order to help employees benefit more from mutual exchange, see things from different
perspectives, improve interaction and provide new impetus. With this platform, employees can proactively offer
and find work-shadowing opportunities that will promote collaboration and knowledge exchange and help them
further develop their competencies. After just a short time, there were already 50 work-shadowing places across
Germany offered on the platform. Another instrument for Group-wide and international exchange is the “Otto Group
JobFinder” app. The app compares Group-wide German- and English-speaking jobs vacancies with the user profiles

Co nsolidate d Financi al State m en ts

of registered employees and other interested parties and offers suitable job vacancies. As a mobile solution, the
JobFinder app appeals particularly to tech-savvy talent and is becoming increasingly used.
An essential pillar of the Otto Group’s human resources strategy is the Group-wide range of basic training courses
as well as the Otto Group Academy’s development programmes for executives and professionals that are systematically geared towards the needs of the Group. Using different Group-wide formats, emphasis is placed on conveying
the mindset and methods used in agile organisations. For example, participants in the Top Executive programme
undertook a Learning Journey. By doing so, they were able to gain a deeper insight into organisations where agile
work is the norm. Additionally, the first ever Digital Readiness Check and the Digital Readiness programme contributed to the development of an individualised training programme to create a common understanding among senior
management of the multifaceted dimensions of digitisation and to promote learning together. Regular inter-Group
events are also organised for alumni of the Otto Group Academy in an effort to strengthen Group-wide networking
opportunities.
The kickoff of the “Cultural Shift 4.0” initiative in December 2015 represents an instrumental step in ensuring the
successful development of the Group and its future human resources strategy. In this context, Dr Michael Otto
and Benjamin Otto, along with the Group’s Executive Board, called for a change in corporate culture within the
Otto Group. Since then, the core objective has been to make the Otto Group more agile, transparent and interconnected than ever before. Knowledge should be shared more intensively and there should be a more open approach

N o tes

OTTO

to suggestions. In order to facilitate this change, full involvement of and discussion with all colleagues will be crucial.
Furthermore, the systematic integration of changes in HR instruments is a key factor for ensuring that this change
will be effective in the long term. Group-wide initiatives such as “Multidimensional Feedback” and “Recruiting 4.0”
thus support change across the Group. The implementation of a dialogue-oriented feedback culture will be facilitated by versatile, situationally useful digital processes and feedback methods. The “Recruiting 4.0” concept focuses
on the applicant as a customer and emphasises the relevance of the cultural fit of a potential employee in addition
to technical competence.

SUSTAINABILIT Y
The Otto Group manages sustainability as a combination of economic, ecological and social requirements for the
entire value chain using the impACT management process. The measures that result from this process are implemented under the umbrella of the binding CR Strategy 2020.

CR STR ATEGY 2020
The CR Strategy 2020 is an integral part of the Group strategy and consists of five sub-strategies. These strategies
call for the use of sustainably grown cotton and wood products from environmentally responsible forestry. They also
focus on maintaining social standards in the supply chain and reducing CO2 emissions on site and during transport.
As of the 2014/15 financial year, the annual variable remuneration for members of the Group’s Executive Board is
linked to the achievement of the targets in the CR Strategy 2020.
The CR Strategy 2020 has been put into effect since 2013 in all major Group companies based in Germany and Austria
(with an annual external revenue of more than EUR 100 million)4. Together, they generate 59% of Group revenue and
are responsible for approximately 80% of the Group’s ecological impacts.

TARGET-ACHIEVEMENT STATUS AND FORECASTS FOR THE SUBSTR ATEGIES
All key indicators defined in the CR Strategy 2020 showed positive development in the past year. Thus the individual
forecasts for development in 20165 have been achieved. The Otto Group expects this positive overall development
to continue in 2017.

The Textile Strategy promotes the sustainable production of cotton: By 2020, sustainable cotton is to be exclusively
used for the Group companies’ own and licensed brands. The share of sustainable cotton used increased to 49% in
2016 (2015: 27%). The considerable increase forecast is primarily attributable to the increasingly established procurement processes for cotton from the Cotton Made in Africa initiative – hereafter CmiA – and the associated sharp rise
in procurement volumes. Group companies OTTO and bonprix Handelsgesellschaft mbH, as well as the Witt Group,
played a key role in this. As a result of the rising procurement volumes of CmiA cotton, the share of sustainable cotton
is expected to continue to increase considerably in 2017.

With its Furniture Strategy, the Otto Group aims to ensure that all products in its range of wooden furniture are
sourced from responsible forestry certified by the Forest Stewardship Council® – hereafter FSC. In 2016, the share
of FSC-certified wood as a percentage of the total wooden furniture product range was 46% (2015: 43%). The slight
increase in the FSC share that was forecasted is the result of agreements concluded between the Group companies
and major furniture suppliers. A more significant increase in the FSC share in the wooden furniture product range
Gro u p M anage m en t Rep or t

is expected for 2017.
The Paper Strategy aims to increase the share of FSC-certified paper used in catalogues to at least 50% by 2018.
This applies to catalogue paper printed using the gravure process as well as the offset process. In 2016, the share of
FSC-certified paper in use increased to 34% (2015: 28%). This slight increase was due to long-term agreements negotiated with suppliers by Group company OTTO, which is the main procurer of catalogue paper within the Group. As a
result of these supply agreements, the share of FSC-certified paper used in catalogues is expected to increase significantly in 2017.
With the Social Programme, the Otto Group seeks to create greater transparency as well as improved working conditions in suppliers’ factories. All suppliers for Group companies’ own and licensed brands with factories in risk coun-

tries6 are to be integrated into this programme. Integrated suppliers are suppliers that provide valid and accepted
social audits or certificates for all active factories at the time of production. In 2016, this applied to 80% of suppliers
(2015: 41%). The forecasted increase in the share of suppliers integrated into the programme can be largely attributed to the availability of improved data on the social status of factories. The Otto Group anticipates a further slight
increase in the integration rate in 2017. This forecast is based on further improvements in data management and the
subsequent termination of relationships with suppliers who do not fulfil the standards.
The goal of the Climate Strategy is to reduce CO2 emissions at the Trade value-adding stage. By 2020, adjusted 7
CO2 emissions at the Group’s own sites as well as in goods-procurement and goods-distribution transport are to be
halved in comparison to the base year of 2006. In 2016, absolute (unadjusted) CO2 emissions fell in comparison to
2015 from 246,000 t to 236,000 t. During the same period, adjusted CO2 emissions fell from 212,000 t to 196,000 t.
This corresponds to a reduction of 34% in relation to the base year of 2006. (2015: – 28%). The development of these
values exceeds the slight reduction forecast for 2016 and is primarily attributable to the shift from air freight to
less CO2-intensive forms of transport such as maritime, road and rail transport in the procurement of goods from
producing countries. Increased energy efficiency at the Group’s own sites and in goods-distribution transport also
contributed to the reduction in CO2 emissions. As a result of further anticipated increases in efficiency on site and
during transport, as well as in the Group-wide purchase of green energy, a significant reduction in total CO2 emissions is also expected for 2017.

OUTLOOK
OVER ALL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
According to estimates by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (Institut für Weltwirtschaft) – hereafter IfW
Kiel – the performance of the global economy is set to see a price-adjusted increase in global GDP of 3.5% in 2017
(2016: 3.1%). Therefore, the growth in worldwide production is also set to increase, however it will continue to remain
at a moderate level for the forecasting period. For advanced economies (particularly the USA and Germany), overall
economic expansion is expected to increase gradually during the year. In emerging countries, the overall economic
situation of the previous year has largely stabilised and a gradual increase in economic growth seems increasingly
likely for the forecasting period, even though structural problems continue to exist in many economies. In China, early
economic indicators since the beginning of the year have been pointing to continued high levels of growth for the
current year, which is likely to be characterised by a significant rise in real GDP. In Russia, signs of overall economic
recovery trends are expected to become stronger. However, in light of unfavourable institutional conditions, a sustainable upturn is unlikely. An increase of 3.0% (2016: 1.8%) is forecast for international trade in 2017, with the likelihood
of more significant dynamic growth in comparison to the previous year. Nevertheless, both the growth in worldwide
production and in global trade levels remain vulnerable to disruption. Potential risk factors for the forecasting period
are mainly due to the many uncertainties arising from economic, trade and monetary policy decisions, the impact of
the development in crude oil prices, potential turbulence in the financial markets, and ongoing geopolitical crises.8
German overall economic output is expected to rise in 2017 by 1.7%, as adjusted for inflation (2016: 1.9%). The sustained
upturn will continue to gather momentum as both the domestic economy and foreign trade will influence economic
development in the forecasting period. Private household consumption expenditure is set to further increase by an
estimated 1.4% (2016: 2.0%) in real terms, although at a considerably slower pace due to an inflation-related reduction
in purchasing power. However, private household consumption expenditure will be stimulated by the fact that the
growth in employment seen in previous years is set to continue to a noticeable extent in 2017, leading to an expected
drop in the average annual unemployment rate to 5.7% (2016: 6.1%). In addition, corporate investments are likely to
gain considerable momentum once again and, together with continued strong investment in construction, to have
an increasing influence on economic growth. Due to a sustained upturn in the global economy, foreign trade is set
to expand significantly. However, it is unlikely that any positive growth will be achieved just yet in the forecasting
period. Exports are expected to benefit from growing demand in major sales markets. However, it is anticipated that
imports will increase further due to upward trends in the domestic economy.9
In the Euro area, economic growth is expected to continue at the same moderate pace in 2017, with price-adjusted
GDP increasing by 1.8% (2016: 1.7%). As in previous years, overall economic expansion in the forecasting period will be
primarily driven by domestic economic factors. Private-household consumption expenditure is set to benefit from
the further upswing in the labour market in particular. The employment situation in the Euro area should improve
further in the forecasting period, leading to a drop in the average annual unemployment rate to 9.3% (2016: 10.1%).
Corporate investment is also set to increase further in view of persistently favourable financing conditions and stable
economic growth, and will have a noticeable impact on the expansion of overall economic output. Furthermore, most
Euro area countries can be expected to implement mildly expansionary fiscal policies. In the other European Union
countries, particularly Sweden and Poland, a strong and sustained expansion of overall economic output is expected
in the forecasting period.10

Outlook

In the USA, overall economic development in 2017 is expected to be considerably more dynamic compared to the
previous year, giving rise to a substantial forecast increase in price-adjusted GDP of 2.5% over the forecasting period
(2016: 1.6%). Positive impetus is expected to come mainly from the continued increase in private-household consumption expenditure, which will be supported by rising real wages, strong labour market performance and favourable
financing conditions. The growth in employment is also expected to continue in the current year, and the annual
Gro u p M anage m en t Rep or t

average unemployment rate is set to fall slightly to 4.8% (2016: 4.9%). Against the backdrop of increased capacity utilisation, corporate investment is expected to increase sharply. However, as in prior years, it is anticipated that foreign
trade will not have a positive impact on the expansion of overall economic output.11

SECTOR DEVELOPMENT
MULTICHANNEL RETAIL
Positive growth is expected to continue in the overall German retail sector in 2017, with a projected nominal increase
in revenue of 2.0%12 in sales (2016: 2.3%). Due to the expected increase in real wages and the anticipated continued
growth in employment, private-household consumption expenditure in Germany looks set to rise by 3.0% in nominal
terms in 2017 (2016: 2.6%). However, this would correspond to a price-adjusted increase of just 1.4% (2016: 2.0%)13.
The projected acceleration of consumer price inflation is expected to lead to a considerably slower rate of increase in
real private-household consumption expenditure in 2017 compared to the previous year14.
The German E-Commerce and Distance Selling Trade Association (Bundesverband E-Commerce und Versandhandel [bevh])15 is forecasting a continuation of the successful performance seen in German online and mail-order
sales sector in preceding years. According to these projections, sales of goods will grow to EUR 61.7 billion in 2017
(2016: 57.1 billion EUR), corresponding to an increase of 8.1% (2016: 9.1%).

N o tes

OTTO

In particular, the e-commerce sector will continue to experience stronger growth levels in the forecasting period, with
a projected increase in revenue of 11.0%, just slightly down on the previous year. Pure online revenue is expected to
rise to approximately EUR 58.5 billion (2016: EUR 52.7 billion). It is also expected that classes of products that up to
now were not particularly compatible with the mail-order sector, such as furniture and decoration as well as groceries,
will once again record significant increases in revenue in the e-commerce sector in 2017. In addition, shifts between
channels – such as more orders being placed via the mobile Internet – are expected to continue to a noticeable extent.

FINANCIAL SERVICES
The forecasted development in the German economy in 2017 will also have an effect on the German financial services
sector. The German Association of Debt Collection Companies (Bundesverband Deutscher Inkasso-Unternehmen e.V.
[BDIU])16 anticipates that due to the positive economic environment forecast, the payment behaviour of companies
and consumers will stabilise at a high level, although it will not improve further. It is expected that the continued drop
in company insolvencies since 2010 will continue at a marginal pace in the forecasting period, if at all, and that the
number of company insolvencies in 2017 will reach a figure similar to the year before, i.e. 21,500 cases approximately
(2016: 21,518 cases). The market for receivables management is still set to remain decidedly attractive in 2017. Against
this backdrop, the market leaders in this sector have invested heavily in recent years and have grown considerably.

SERVICES
Following the mid-term forecast of the German Federal Office for Goods Transport17, the German transport and logistics sector is expected to see positive growth in all transport-intensive sectors in 2017. Total goods transport is set to
grow by a probable 1.2% in the forecasting period (2016: 1.1%), and is expected to benefit both from the continuing
positive development of the German economy and from the anticipation of more dynamic growth in international
trade. This includes an expected rise in freight volumes: 1.3% in road freight (2016: 1.5%), 0.5% in inland navigation
(2016: – 0.8%), 2.5% in air freight transport (2016: 3.4%) and 0.4% in rail freight transport (2016: – 1.6%).
Alongside overall economic development, both crude oil prices and wage costs will have an influence on the future
development of the German transport and logistics sector. Wage costs are expected to grow further in view of the
wage agreements concluded in 2016 and those planned for 2017. Following a marginal increase in 2016, it is expected
that crude oil prices, which are still comparatively low, will stabilise during the forecasting period, and that the
German transport and logistics sector will only experience a slight increase in fuel prices, if at all. Nevertheless, due
to ongoing global economic risk factors, any forecast relating to the development of crude oil prices is subject to a
high degree of uncertainty.
Given the continued dynamic increase in revenue from online and mail-order sales expected for 2017, German
parcel-services providers will also face serious challenges in the forecasting period in terms of handling the everincreasing number of deliveries sent by companies to private households. This will require a sustained high level of
investment in logistics infrastructure.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE OTTO GROUP
In the 2016/17 financial year, the Otto Group launched various initiatives and continued to drive digital transformation. The consistent alignment of business models with customer requirements will also determine the direction of
the Group in the coming financial years. To accompany the Cultural Shift 4.0 process launched in 2015, a fundamental
Gro u p M anage m en t Rep or t

process was initiated within the Otto Group with the aim of ensuring that the Group achieves significant dynamic
growth in the e-commerce sector and retail-related services in the coming years. The requirements of the market and
of individual customers will be met with a high degree of flexibility, speed and innovation.
Expectations for overall economic development and sector development form the point of departure for the projected
development of the Otto Group and its segments in the 2017/18 financial year. The forecast is supported by the overall
economic conditions and sector growth projected for the relevant sales markets, i.e. Germany, the rest of Europe and
the USA. In particular, the continued increase in private-household consumption expenditure is expected to have a
positive influence on business performance in these sales markets.
Revenue from the Multichannel Retail segment amounted to EUR 9,818.7 million in the 2016/17 financial year

Co nsolidate d Financi al State m en ts

(2015/16: EUR 9,588.1 million), which was moderately higher (2.4%) than the previous year, and considerably higher
(5.0%) when adjusted for changes to the scope of consolidation. For the 2017/18 financial year, the Group expects an
increase in revenue that will be almost on a par with the very strong growth of 5.0% achieved in the previous year.
Significant revenue growth is anticipated for the parent company OTTO, the bonprix Group, the Crate and Barrel
group and the myToys Group as well as e-commerce start-up Collins, and is expected to be in the high-double-digit to
low-triple-digit million euro range. Revenue from other Group companies and sub-groups in the Multichannel Retail
segment is largely expected to hit the single-digit to mid-double-digit million euro range. Despite a persistently difficult overall economic environment, revenue from the activities of the Otto Group in Russia for the 2017/18 financial
year are expected to be on a par with the previous year due to its strong position in the Russian mail-order sector.
The Financial Services segment achieved significant revenue growth of 8.0% in the 2016/17 financial year. This
segment is influenced to a large extent by the EOS Group. In the coming financial years, it will continue to focus on
debt collection services, significant investment in debt purchasing – mostly in Germany and also in Western and
Eastern Europe – as well as business process outsourcing. Initiatives aimed at continuously optimising operational
processes, such as the increased use of business analytics in receivables processing, for example, will be advanced
further and will influence the performance of the EOS Group. In addition, further retail-related services in the Financial Services segment will be grouped together under the Otto Group Digital Solutions Group. For the 2017/18 financial year, the Otto Group expects revenues from this segment to be in line with the previous 2016/17 financial year.

N o tes

OTTO

The Services segment, which is largely dominated by the Group companies of the Hermes Group, continued to
grow noticeably in the 2016/17 financial year with external revenue growth of 6.7%. For the 2017/18 forecast year,
the Otto Group anticipates a further significant increase in segment revenue, which will fall just marginally short
of the previous year’s strong growth rate. This strong business performance is driven by Hermes Germany GmbH in
particular. Hermes Parcelnet Limited in the United Kingdom is also set to continue its successful performance in the
local currency.
Given the anticipated growth in business both with Group companies and third parties, the coming financial years
will also see significant investment in logistics infrastructure in the Services segment, particularly in Germany and
the United Kingdom. The Group will also continue to build up additional services. In July 2015, the Hermes Group
acquired a 28.5% share in LieferFactory GmbH, a start-up established one year previously. LieferFactory GmbH, in
which the Hermes Group has since acquired a majority share, specialises in same-day delivery and delivery within
specified timeframes through its “Liefery” service.

Outlook

OTTO

GROUP

– A n n u a l Re p o r t 2016/17

At Group level, the Otto Group achieved revenue growth of 3.4% in the 2016/17 financial year. The financial year was
significantly influenced by changes to the scope of consolidation, such that, when taken on a comparable basis,
higher revenue growth of 5.0% was achieved. For the 2017/18 forecast year, the Group is aiming for revenue growth
that will be on a par with the strong growth achieved in the previous year.
The process of streamlining and adjusting the Otto Group’s portfolio has already led to a sustainable increase in the
Group’s earnings capacity in the past 2016/17 financial year. In terms of the portfolio optimisation process, significant progress has been achieved, most notably as a result of the sale of the 3SI Commerce operation in France. The
Otto Group’s portfolio will continue to be reviewed in the coming financial years. In addition, the business models of
the Group companies will continue to be realigned as part of the digital transformation process.
Major Group companies and sub-groups, such as OTTO, Witt, bonprix and EOS, once again anticipate strong or very
strong EBT contributions in the 2017/18 forecast year. However, growth companies such as the myToys Group and
e-commerce start-up Collins, as well as newer business models in the Otto Group Digital Solutions Group will place
a strain on the Otto Group’s EBT figure, as planned. SportScheck GmbH, which is in the process of being restructured,
has succeeded in implementing a series of measures aimed at realigning its business model and will continue this
approach in the current financial year. Taking into account the above-mentioned influencing factors, the Group-level
EBT figure expected for the 2017/18 financial year will, on an operational level, be on a par with the strong earnings
position achieved in the 2016/17 financial year. In addition, ongoing portfolio optimisation efforts may have both a
positive and negative impact on EBT.

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
AND POLICIES APPLIED IN
THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Otto (GmbH & Co KG), Werner-Otto-Straße 1 – 7, 22179 Hamburg, Germany (Hamburg District Court (Amtsgericht),
Commercial Register No. HRA 62024) and its subsidiaries (the Otto Group) is a retailing and services group mainly
operating in three economic regions: Europe, North America and Asia.
The Group’s business segments comprise multichannel retail, financial services and other activities in the fields of
logistics and services. The financial services include services in connection with the granting of consumer loans and
debt collection services and also banking activities.
OTTO Aktiengesellschaft für Beteiligungen, Hamburg, is the parent and at the same time ultimate parent company
of Otto (GmbH & Co KG). The consolidated financial statements and the Group management report of OTTO
Aktiengesellschaft für Beteiligungen and of Otto (GmbH & Co KG) are published in the the German Federal Gazette.
The Executive Board approved the consolidated financial statements and the Group management report of Otto
(GmbH & Co KG) for publication on 24 April 2017.

(1)

PRINCIPLES

The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 28 February 2017 of Otto (GmbH & Co KG) were prepared in
accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) promulgated and issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB), as adopted by the European Union, in application of the regulations contained in
Directive (EC) No. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and Council dated 19 July 2002, in conjunction with § 315a (3)
of the German Commercial Code (HGB). In addition, the supplementary commercial law regulations pursuant to
§ 315a (3) in conjunction with § 315a (1) HGB were taken into account.
The IFRS requirements were met completely and give a true and fair view of the Otto Group’s financial position and
financial performance.
The consolidated financial statements were prepared in principle on the basis of the recognition of assets and liabilities at amortised cost. Available-for-sale financial assets and derivatives, which are measured at their respective fair
values on the balance sheet date, are excepted herefrom. In addition, assets and liabilities held for sale are measured
at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.
On the basis of the elective right contained in IAS 1, income and expenses recognised in profit or loss are reported in
the income statement, while reconciliation of the net result for the period to total comprehensive income through
other comprehensive income is recorded in a separate statement of comprehensive income.

136

GROUP

– A n n u a l Re p o r t 2016/17

Accounting Principles and Policies

Selected items in the income statement and balance sheet have been combined to improve clarity. These are explained
in detail in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The income statement is arranged according to the

(2)

CONSOLIDATION

(a)

CONSOLIDATION PRINCIPLES

Gro u p M anage m en t Rep or t

nature of expense method.

The Otto Group’s consolidated financial statements include all significant domestic and foreign subsidiaries over
which Otto (GmbH & Co KG) has complete control, as per IFRS 10, or joint control together with other parties, as per
IFRS 11 and IAS 28. In accordance with IFRS 10, control is considered to exist when Otto (GmbH & Co KG) has decision-making power over the relevant activities, is exposed to variable returns, and has the ability to use its power to
influence the amount of these returns.
The equity is consolidated at the acquisition date, using the acquisition method. The acquisition date is the date on
which the Otto Group obtains the ability to control the acquired company’s net assets and its financial and operating

Co nsolidate d Financi al State m en ts

activities. Under the acquisition method, the cost of an acquired equity interest, including any contingent consideration, is offset against the acquirer’s share of the fair value of the subsidiary’s acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the acquisition date. Any remaining differences are capitalised as goodwill. Negative differences
resulting from equity consolidation at the acquisition date are immediately recognised in the income statement.
Costs incurred in acquiring the equity interest are immediately expensed.
Any undisclosed reserves or charges recognised in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value upon initial consolidation are carried forward, amortised or depreciated, or reversed in subsequent periods, depending on the development of the related assets and liabilities. Goodwill is regularly reviewed for impairment in subsequent periods and
is written down to its recoverable amount if appropriate.
The regulations of IFRS 3 with regard to the complete remeasurement of assets and liabilities at the time control is
acquired are applied to step acquisitions of interests in companies in which the Otto Group acquires control. The fair
value of equity interests previously held by the Otto Group are included in any measurement of acquisition costs.
Any differences in the previous measurements of these interests are recognised in the income statement together
with amounts contained in accumulated other comprehensive income.
By contrast, step acquisitions at subsidiaries in which Otto (GmbH & Co KG) already had direct or indirect control
before the purchase are accounted for as transactions between shareholders. Any difference between the purchase

N o tes

OTTO

price and the share of net assets previously attributable to non-controlling interests resulting from the purchase is
shown under consolidated equity as net cost in excess of net assets acquired in step aquisitions. For such transactions, no undisclosed reserves and charges are recognised and no goodwill is reported.
Expenses and income and also receivables and payables between consolidated companies are eliminated. Any material intercompany profits or losses are eliminated.
Significant associated companies and joint ventures are recognised in the consolidated financial statements using the
equity method. Jointly controlled operations must be recognised with their share of assets and liabilities as well as
their share of income and expenses. In accordance with IFRS 11, joint control is considered to exist when the management of a company is contractually agreed and collectively performed.

1 37

Accounting Principles and Policies

OTTO

GROUP

– A n n u a l Re p o r t 2016/17

Associated companies are entities over whose financial and operating policies Otto (GmbH & Co KG) has the ability
to exercise significant influence, usually because it owns between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. In accordance
with IFRS 11, joint arrangements are divided into either joint ventures or joint operations, depending on the arrangement of the contractually agreed sharing of control. A joint venture is a legally independent company whereby the
joint controlling parties have rights to the net assets of the company. A joint operation is considered to exist when the
joint controlling parties have direct rights to assets and are directly responsible for liabilities. At the moment, there
are no joint operations within the Otto Group as the Otto Group has no residual interest in the individual assets and
liabilities of the joint operations of any company.
Disproportionate capital increases in return for contributions at associated companies that result in a reduction in
the Otto Group’s ratio of participation in these companies lead to an adjustment of the carrying amount of these
investments affecting profit or loss.
Consolidation methods are applied when determining goodwill and the Group’s share of the fair value of assets and
liabilities. Losses from associated companies and joint ventures which exceed the carrying amounts of these companies or other non-current receivables from the financing of such companies are recognised only where there is an
obligation to provide additional capital contributions. Costs incurred in the acquisition of the equity interest are capitalised as a component of the acquisition costs.
The financial statements of Otto (GmbH & Co KG) and all subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures
included in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared using uniform accounting policies.
The financial year-end date of the financial statements of companies included in the consolidated financial statements is normally the same as that of the parent company. Group companies with different financial year-end dates
are included based on the financial statements as at their own year-end dates, provided the date is no more than
three months earlier than the Group’s financial year-end date. Any significant events that occur between the different
balance sheet dates are taken into account.

(b)

TR ANSL ATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN FOREIGN
CURRENCIES

The consolidated financial statements were prepared in euros. Unless otherwise specified, all amounts are stated
in thousands of euros (EUR 000).
Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the euro are translated using the closing rate
as at balance sheet date. Goodwill is also translated at the closing rate, as are fair value adjustments to assets and
liabilities of subsidiaries recognised at the time of initial consolidation. Items in the income statement are translated
using the weighted average exchange rate for the year concerned. Equity components of subsidiaries are translated
at the corresponding historical exchange rate at the time they arise. Exchange differences resulting from the translation of foreign currencies are recognised as foreign currency translation adjustments under accumulated other
comprehensive income or non-controlling interests.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Closing rate

Co nsolidate d Financi al State m en ts

Average rate

Internally generated intangible assets are recognised at cost incurred during the development phase, i.e. after the
technical and economic feasibility of the asset’s development was determined and until its completion. Costs capitalised comprise all costs directly and indirectly attributable to the development phase.
Acquired intangible assets are measured at cost.
With the exception of goodwill and recognised trademark rights and domains in the Multichannel Retail segment
totalling EUR 26,604 thousand (29 February 2016: EUR 29,478 thousand), the Otto Group has no intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives. Appropriate maintenance investment is made to uphold the lasting recoverability of these
trademarks. All other internally-generated and acquired intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over
their useful lives commencing at the time they are initially used, as follows:

PROPERT Y, PL ANT AND EQUIPMENT

Assets included in property, plant and equipment are capitalised at cost and depreciated applying the straight-line
method over their estimated useful lives. Changes in residual values or useful life during use are taken into account
in the measurement of depreciation. The cost of property, plant and equipment produced internally within the Group
includes all direct costs and overheads directly attributable to their production. Subsequent expenses are capitalised
if these lead to a change in the purpose of the use or to an increase in the value in use of the asset. Gains or losses
from disposals of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reported under other operating income
or expenses.

Leased assets that are economically owned by the Otto Group (finance lease) are recognised at the lower of their fair
value or the present value of the minimum lease payments and are depreciated on a straight-line basis. The present
value of the minimum lease payments is recognised as a liability.
Depreciation is based on the following Group-wide useful lives:

If it is reasonably certain that ownership of the leased asset under a finance lease will pass to an Otto Group company
at the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over its useful life.
In accordance with IAS 20, government grants to encourage investment are deducted from the original cost of the
subsidised assets. The entitlement is capitalised when it is reasonably certain that subsidies will be granted and
conditions relating to the subsidies will be met.

IMPAIR MENT LOSSES ON INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERT Y,
PL ANT AND EQUIPMENT

Impairment losses on intangible assets, including goodwill, and on property, plant and equipment are recognised
when the carrying amount of an asset is no longer covered by the estimated proceeds from its disposal, or the
discounted net cash flow from its future use. If the recoverable amount cannot be determined for an individual asset,
cash flow is calculated for the next highest identifiable group of assets and for which such cash flows can be determined. Goodwill is allocated to the relative cash-generating units based on the Group’s internal reporting system.
Net cash flow from future use (value in use) is generally determined using the Group’s projections over a three-year
period, based on which net cash flow trends are inferred for the subsequent periods based on a growth factor of
0.20% to 2.00%. Projected net cash flows are discounted on an after-tax basis using a risk-adjusted, country-specific
interest rate. Other parameters are taken from standardised industry data. Discount rates of between 6.60% and
14.81% (29 February 2016: 7.01% to 13.66%) were used for the impairment tests.
Impairment losses are reversed in subsequent periods if the reason for impairment no longer applies. Such reversals
may not raise the carrying amount of the asset above the amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in earlier years. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Otto Group uses non-derivative and derivative financial instruments. These include cash and cash equivalents,
receivables, available-for-sale financial assets, financial liabilities, forward exchange transactions, interest rate swaps
and currency options.
Gro u p M anage m en t Rep or t

The Otto Group accounts for financial assets on delivery, i.e. on settlement date. Derivative financial instruments,
which are accounted for on the trading date, are an exception. A financial asset is recognised initially at fair value
plus any directly attributable transaction costs, provided the financial asset has not been assigned to the at fair value
through profit or loss category. Financial assets are subsequently measured either at fair value or at cost or at amortised cost using the effective interest method, depending on the IAS 39 category to which the financial instrument
has been assigned.
Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value less transaction costs and subsequently at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities classified as at fair value through profit or loss, however, are initially and subsequently accounted
for at fair value.

Co nsolidate d Financi al State m en ts

Financial assets and financial liabilities are derecognised provided that either the rights to cash flows generated
from the asset expire, or substantially all risks are transferred to third parties in such a manner that meet the criteria
for derecognition. The Otto Group sells receivables with terms of up to three years in the form of ABS (asset-backed
securities) transactions. Regardless of whether such receivables have been legally transferred to the transferee, the
Otto Group must continue to recognise them as long as any Group company substantially retains all the risks and
rewards of ownership under the terms of the contract concerned. As long as the receivable is still recognised by the
Group, any funds the Group company receives from the sale are treated as a liability until the customer has settled
the receivable sold in full. Another aspect of ABS transactions concerns the Otto Group’s obligation to service the
receivables sold. Appropriate provisions amounting to EUR 5,252 thousand (29 February 2016: EUR 4,774 thousand)
are recognised for these obligations as at balance sheet date.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation either ceases to exist, is rescinded or expires.

(i)

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and bank deposits. They are recognised at their nominal value.

(ii)

Loans and receivables, LAR

Trade receivables, receivables from financial services and other non-derivative financial assets in this category are
initially recognised at fair value. Receivables from financial services include purchased receivables that are reported

N o tes

OTTO

as financial instruments in the loans and receivables category.
Subsequent measurement is carried out at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
Impairment losses on receivables and other non-derivative financial assets are recorded on a value allowance account.
Value allowances are recognised as soon as objective evidence points to the existence of a credit risk for the financial
asset. Indications of an impairment loss can be, for example, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments,
deterioration of creditworthiness, high probability that the debtor will become insolvent, or a change in political or
macroeconomic conditions. The extent of the allowance depends on experience and estimates of the individual risk.
If irrecoverability is to be assumed, the items are derecognised.

Available-for-sale financial assets, AFS

Available-for-sale financial assets comprise investments in companies that are not accounted for according to IFRS 10,
IFRS 11, or IAS 28 and securities and other non-derivative financial instruments that are not classified as either cash
and cash equivalents, loans and receivables, or as held-to-maturity assets.
Available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date or, if this value cannot be
determined, at cost. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are reported in accumulated
other comprehensive income, net of tax. Changes in fair value are not recognised in the income statement until the
asset is sold, or until an impairment loss is recorded. Reversals of impairment losses on equity instruments are always
recognised in accumulated other comprehensive income, whereas for debt instruments they are recognised in the
income statement up to an amount equivalent to the initial impairment loss recognised in previous periods. Investments that qualify as equity instruments are measured at cost if the fair value can neither be determined based on
quoted prices or by reference to comparable instruments nor calculated by means of appropriate pricing models, in
cases where cash flows are volatile or cannot be reliably determined.

(iv)

Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost, OL

On initial recognition, financial liabilities are reported at their fair value taking into consideration premiums, discounts
and transaction costs. Subsequent measurement is carried out at amortised cost. Non-current liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

(v)

Derivative financial instruments (financial assets/liabilities at fair value
through profit or loss, AFV/LFV) and hedging relationships

The Otto Group uses derivatives as hedges against foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value.
Accounting for change in the fair value of derivatives depends on whether they are designated as hedging instruments and qualify as part of a hedging relationship under IAS 39.
If these conditions are not met, despite the presence of an underlying economic hedging relationship, changes in the
fair value of the derivative financial instruments are recognised directly in the income statement.
The effective portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative financial instrument designated and qualifying as
a cash flow hedging instrument (cash flow hedge) is recognised directly in accumulated other comprehensive income,
together with any attributable tax effect. The ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement. The effective portion is reclassified to revenue or to cost of purchased goods and services when the forecast cash flows from
the underlying transaction affect profit or loss.
In addition, there are options on shares held by the Otto Group in associated companies, in particular with respect to
shares in COFIDIS PARTICIPATIONS, Villeneuve-d’Ascq, France. These options are measured at fair value in accordance
with IAS 39. Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement under other net financial income (expense).

Net investment in a foreign operation

A change in the fair value of a monetary item classified as part of a net investment in a foreign operation that is
attributable to changes in the exchange rate is accounted for in accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains
or losses recognised in accumulated other comprehensive income are to be reclassified from consolidated equity to
the consolidated income statement when the foreign company is sold or liquidated. The monetary item represents
Gro u p M anage m en t Rep or t

a component of net investment in the foreign operation if the settlement of the item is neither planned nor probable in the foreseeable future.

(vii)

Fair value of financial instruments

The fair value of financial instruments is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement assumes that the transaction on which the price is based takes place either in the principal market or in the
most advantageous market to which the Otto Group has access. The price is measured using the assumptions that
market participants would use when pricing.
The fair value of financial instruments is calculated on the basis of appropriate market values or by applying other

Co nsolidate d Financi al State m en ts

suitable measurement methods. The fair values of cash and cash equivalents and other non-derivative current financial instruments are equivalent to their carrying amounts reported on the respective financial year-end dates.
The fair values of non-current receivables and other assets and of non-current liabilities are calculated based on
expected cash flows using reference interest rates in effect on the balance sheet date. The fair value of derivative
financial instruments is determined based on forward foreign exchange rates and reference interest rates on the
balance sheet date.
Interest rate swaps are measured using the present value of future cash flows calculated from observed market
interest rates at the balance sheet date for the remaining term of the contracts. Market values of forward exchange
transactions are determined by comparing the contracted forward price with the forward price on the balance sheet
date for the remaining term. The resulting value is then discounted, taking account of current market interest rates
for the respective currency on the balance sheet date. Currency options are measured using a recognised actuarial
method (Black-Scholes option pricing model), taking into account currency rates and volatilities applicable as at
balance sheet date. The Otto Group only concludes derivative contracts with banks that have an at least adequate
credit rating. The Group's own and counterparty-specific default risks are regularly monitored and are taken into
account when calculating the fair value of derivative financial instruments.

(e)

INVENTORIES

N o tes

OTTO

Inventories are measured as at balance sheet date at the lower of acquisition or production cost and net realisable
value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
The cost of merchandise and raw materials, consumables and supplies included in inventories is determined on the
basis of a weighted average price or with the use of the standard cost method.
The production cost of work in progress includes all direct and overhead costs attributable to producing the goods
and services.

PROVISIONS FOR PENSIONS AND SIMIL AR OBLIGATIONS

Provisions for pensions and similar obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method pursuant to
IAS 19, taking expected future salary and pension increases into account. The measurement of pension obligations
is on the basis of expert opinions on pensions, including any plan assets held to cover these obligations. Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. Remeasurement
includes the actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest included in net interest expenses)
and the effects of any asset limit (excluding interest included in net interest expenses). The Group calculates the net
interest expenses on the net defined benefit liability for the reporting period by applying the discount rate which was
used for the measurement of the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period. The net interest
expenses and the current and past service cost are taken to the income statement.

(g)

OTHER PROVISIONS

Other provisions cover all of the Otto Group’s legal and constructive obligations to third parties at the balance sheet
date as a result of past events for which settlement is probable and the amount of which can be estimated reliably. The provisions are measured at their probable settlement amount, taking all foreseeable risks into account.
This represents the best possible estimate of the cost of settling the present obligation at the balance sheet date.
Non-current provisions are recognised at their settlement value, discounted to the balance sheet date using appropriate market interest rates.
Provisions for restructuring expenses are recognised if the restructuring plans have raised a valid expectation at
the balance sheet date and have already been communicated to the parties affected by the restructuring, or their
representatives.

(h)

DEFERRED TA X

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised to account for the future tax effects of all temporary differences
between the carrying amounts reported for tax purposes and those recognised in the IFRS consolidated financial
statements, and also on tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the laws and regulations
enacted by the end of the financial year for those financial years in which the differences will be reversed or the
losses carried forward will probably be used. Deferred tax assets are recognised on temporary differences or tax loss
and/or interest carry-forwards only if it is considered sufficiently sure that they will be realised in the near future.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences resulting from assets and liabilities measured at fair value when
accounting for business combinations.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences in derivative goodwill only if the amortisation of derivative goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset, providing that they refer to income taxes raised by the same tax authority
and current taxes are eligible to be offset.

(i)

RECOGNITION OF INCOME AND EXPENSE

Revenue and other operating income is recognised at the performance date, provided the amount can be reliably
measured and it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the entity. Revenues are reduced by revenue
deductions.

1 44

GROUP

– A n n u a l Re p o r t 2016/17

Accounting Principles and Policies

When merchandise is sold to customers, the performance date is normally defined as the point in time at which the
customer becomes the beneficial owner of the merchandise. This transfer of beneficial ownership does not necessarily correspond to the transfer of legal ownership.
Deliveries of merchandise which, based on past experience, are expected to be returned are not recognised in income.
Gro u p M anage m en t Rep or t

The cost of such merchandise, including the cost of processing the return and deducting any potential loss on the
resale, is recognised in other assets.
Income from sale and leaseback transactions is immediately recognised in the income statement if the leasing
contract is classified as an operating lease and the selling price corresponds to the fair value of the related asset.
Interest income accruing to the Otto Group when merchandise is purchased on credit is recorded for the period
using the effective interest method. Fees from banking and other financial services, such as receivables management or collection activities, are recorded as income from financial services as soon as the service in question has
been performed.

Co nsolidate d Financi al State m en ts

Operating expenses are charged to the income statement at the time the service is rendered, or when the costs are
incurred. Lease payments from operating leases are expensed in the period the leased objects are used. Expenses for
advertising and promotion activities are charged when the Otto Group acquires the ability to control the goods and
services used in connection with these activities. In accordance with IAS 38, advertising and promotion activities also
cover the catalogues used in multichannel retail.
Interest is recorded as expense or income in the period to which it relates. Interest expenses incurred in connection
with the purchase or production of qualifying assets are capitalised in compliance with IAS 23. At the Otto Group, a
qualifying asset is an asset for which a period of more than one year is usually intended for its purchase or production.
The interest advantages of low-interest public-sector loans are recognised in the income statement and accrued to
the relevant period, whereby the portion for future years is posted to a deferred income item.
Dividends are normally recognised at the date on which legal entitlement to payment arises.

( j)

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

The share-based payment arrangements in the form of share options or share appreciation rights for management
at Group companies in the United States are recognised in accordance with IFRS 2. The relevant plans in the form
of share options or shares grant employees the right to tender shares acquired and/or received on exercising their

N o tes

share options at the prevailing value of the shares. Thus, such plans and the stock appreciation rights granted to the
employees are measured at fair value, recognised as an expense over the vesting period and classified as other liabilities in the balance sheet.

(k)

CL ASSIFICATION OF PARTNERS’ CAPITAL IN LIMITED
PARTNERSHIPS

Otto (GmbH & Co KG), the Group’s parent company, is organised as a limited partnership (Personenhandelsgesellschaft) under German law. Its limited partners have a statutory right of cancellation that cannot be precluded
by the partnership agreement and may therefore require the company to repay capital contributions, and a related
share of profits, under a carrying amount clause.

1 45

Accounting Principles and Policies

OTTO

GROUP

– A n n u a l Re p o r t 2016/17

According to IAS 32, puttable financial instruments are to be classified as equity, providing they fulfil certain conditions. These conditions include the assignment of the instrument to the class of instruments that is the most subordinate, the entitlement of the holder to a pro-rata share of the entity’s net assets on liquidation and the dependency
of the total expected cash flows attributable to the instrument on the profit or loss or from the change in the recognised net assets of the entity. These criteria apply to the limited partners’ shares in Otto (GmbH & Co KG) pursuant to
the statutory regulations and the provisions of the shareholders’ agreement with limited partners’ shares recognised
in consolidated equity. Profits distributed to limited partners are therefore expensed in the statement of changes in
shareholders’ equity as a shareholder transaction outside the total comprehensive income for the year.
Non-controlling interests in consolidated partnerships where such rights of cancellation apply are to be classified as
liabilities and are recognised as other financial liabilities, since these shares do not fulfil the criteria defined in IAS 32
with respect to the classification as equity. Changes in the value and interest components of liabilities are either
expensed or recognised as a gain in the income statement.

(l)

PROFIT AND LOSS PARTICIPATION CERTIFICATES

Profit and loss participation certificates issued by the Otto Group are a component of consolidated equity as long as
the terms and conditions governing the profit and loss participation certificates do not result in a repayment obligation on the part of the Otto Group, the emergence of which is outside the Otto Group’s discretionary power. The
benefits arising from these profit and loss participation certificates are accordingly shown as an appropriation of net
income. The transaction costs are accounted for as a deduction from equity.

(m)

PROFIT AND LOSS PARTICIPATION RIGHTS

The profit and loss participation rights that the Otto Group issues to employees are classified as financial liabilities
under IAS 32, because a repurchase obligation can arise for the Otto Group on expiry of a six-year waiting period at
the request of the holder of the profit and loss participation certificate, and these financial instruments, which are
classified as puttable, may have to be satisfied prior to the claims of the partners on liquidation. The company allowances granted on the basis of issued profit and loss participation rights are included under personnel expenses, and
performance-related profit and loss participation is reported under interest and similar income or expenses.

(n)

TR ANSACTIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES

Purchases and sales in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate on the day of delivery. Assets and
liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the closing rate at the balance sheet
date. Any resulting gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.

(o)

ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISPOSAL GROUPS

Assets or disposal groups are reported under assets held for sale, provided the likelihood of the assets or disposal
groups being sold within the next twelve months is very high and provided the assets are available for sale and are
not realised through continued use. These assets or disposal groups are measured at the lower of the carrying amount
and fair value less costs to sell. An impairment loss for a disposal group would first be proportionately assigned to
goodwill and then, taking into account the requirements of IFRS 5, to the remaining assets and liabilities, with the
exception that no loss is assigned to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets, and assets associated with
employee benefits that will continue to be measured according to other Group accounting methods.

Accounting Principles and Policies

Intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment are no longer subject to scheduled depreciation or amortisation.
Impairment losses that arise at the time of initial classification as held for sale, as well as subsequent gains and losses
that arise from remeasurement until the sale takes place, are recognised in profit or loss. Reporting will no longer be
carried out using the equity method provided that investments in associated companies and joint ventures, which
up to now have been included in the consolidated financial statement and calculated using the equity method, are
Gro u p M anage m en t Rep or t

reclassified as assets held for sale due to the criteria listed in IFRS 5.
A group of assets held for sale is classified as a discontinued operation under IFRS 5 if it can be clearly distinguished
from the rest of the Otto Group’s components in terms of business operations and cash flow, and if it represents a
major line of business. If a business operation is reported as a discontinued operation, it is presented separately in
the income statement. The comparative information in the income statement is adjusted retrospectively as if the
operation had been classified as a discontinued operation at the beginning of the comparative period.
Also presented under assets held for sale are groups of assets whose disposal is associated with a plan to abandon a
business operation and which will be disposed of within one year of being designated as held for sale.

USE OF ESTIM ATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

Co nsolidate d Financi al State m en ts

(p)

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs involves making estimates and
assumptions that affect the recognition of assets and liabilities, contingent liabilities at the balance sheet date, and
the recognition of income and expenses. Actual amounts may differ from the amounts arrived at using these estimates and assumptions.
In particular, material estimates and assumptions were made in determining uniform depreciation and amortisation periods for the Group on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (Notes (16) and (17)), the valuation
of investments within the framework of venture activities (Note (18)), allowances for merchandise and receivables
(Notes (19) and (20)), return rates for measuring delivery claims from expected returns (Note (6) and (22)), the parameters for measuring pension provisions (Note (25)), determining the fair value of obligations under put/call options
and share-based remuneration (Note (31)) and the likelihood that deferred tax assets can be utilised (Note (15)). The
measurement of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment in connection with impairment testing under
IAS 36 was based on budget data for forecasting cash flow and standardised sector information for determining
discount rates.
Following guidelines provided for in IFRS 7, pro forma currency and interest curves that may deviate from actual
market values on the balance sheet date were used for sensitivity analyses in Note (37)(c).

IFRS 9, which regulates the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, will in future
replace IAS 39. IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets and
replaces the previous categories of financial assets with three categories in which financial assets are measured
either at fair value, which is to be recognised in the income statement or in equity, or at amortised cost. IAS 39 regulations governing the classification and measurement of financial liabilities have largely been carried over to IFRS 9.
Furthermore, regulations for accounting for hedging relationships and the impairment of financial assets were elaborated. The implications of IFRS 9 for the Otto Group's consolidated financial statements largely depend on the Group's
future financial instruments, future economic conditions and the choice of accounting methods, and on future discretionary decisions taken by the Group.
The introduction of IFRS 9 means that it is no longer possible in the event of a sale to recycle components of accumulated other comprehensive income for investments in equity instruments which, up to now, had been classified as available-for-sale under IAS 39. In accordance with IFRS 9, these instruments will either be measured at fair
value in the income statement or, alternatively, value changes will be recorded in other comprehensive income. The
Otto Group is currently in the process of assessing future classification options for the consolidated financial statements. The Group does not anticipate any significant implications to arise from other changes to the classification
of financial instruments.
With the adoption of IFRS 9, the calculation of impairment losses on financial assets is based on a future-oriented
model for expected credit losses. This requires discretionary decisions to be taken in terms of assessing the extent to
which expected credit losses are influenced by changes in economic factors. The Otto Group is expected to adopt the
simplified procedure for the classification of risk prevention for trade receivables with and without material financial
components, as well as for leasing receivables. The Group is currently testing the implications of including projected
information when calculating impairment losses. Based on current knowledge, this is not expected to cause any
significant implications for the consolidated financial statements.

1 48

GROUP

– A n n u a l Re p o r t 2016/17

Accounting Principles and Policies

Pursuant to IFRS 9, it must be ensured that the accounting process for hedging relationships is consistent with risk
management targets and strategies, and that a qualitative and future-oriented approach is applied with regard to
assessing the effectiveness of hedging transactions. For hedging relationships with currency options, the fair value
component is to be recorded in equity in the future as hedging costs in other comprehensive income. The implications
arising from the new regulations result in a reduction in the volatility of the net financial result. The Otto Group does
Gro u p M anage m en t Rep or t

not anticipate that the additional regulations relating to hedging relationship requirements will have any significant effects on the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, IFRS 9 also imposes significantly more extensive
disclosure requirements, particularly in relation to hedge accounting, credit risk and expected credit losses.
IFRS 15, which contains the revised regulations for recognising revenue, replaces, among others, IAS 18 and IAS 11 which
have been applicable up to now, as well as a number of revenue-related interpretations. A five-step model will be
used to determine when and to what extent revenue is to be recognised. Revenue is then recognised when performance obligations have been met by transferring control of the asset or service to the customer. IFRS 15 also includes
extended guidelines on multiple-element transactions as well as new regulations on handling service contracts and
adjustments to contracts. The Otto Group is currently in the process of implementing the business-model-specific

Co nsolidate d Financi al State m en ts

review arising from the first-time adoption of IFRS 15.
In the Multichannel Retail segment, revenue is recognised at the time the performance obligations are fulfilled.
Revenue is therefore recognised when control of the asset is transferred to the end customer in tandem with transfer
of the asset. The criteria of IFRS 15 in relation to the transfer of control of goods will not lead to any significant adjustments to the time at which revenue is recognised. Regarding disclosure, there will be changes in the balance sheet
recognition of return deliveries as well as of interest income from consumer financing. In the Services segment,
revenue is recognised, in accordance with IFRS 15, at the time the performance obligations are fulfilled. The customer
benefits from these services as they are being performed. In the Services segment, there are no significant implications for the consolidated financial statements arising from the first-time adoption of this standard. In the Financial
Services segment, there are no significant balance sheet changes arising from the implementation of IFRS 15. In all
three segments, the Otto Group will divide the contract liabilities into outstanding benefit obligations with a term
of up to one year and outstanding benefit obligations with a term of more than one year. The latter primarily include
customer loyalty programmes, customer vouchers and extended warranties. The Otto Group is set to adopt the new
standard in full retrospectively. Furthermore, with the implementation of IFRS 15, significantly more extensive disclosures about revenue recognition will be required in the consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 16, which will incorporate the recognition of leases, replaces IAS 17 and the associated interpretations IFRIC 4,
SIC 15, and SIC 27. Differentiating between finance and operating lease agreements will no longer be applicable to
lessees. With the introduction of IFRS 16, all leases and associated contractual rights and obligations must be recog-

N o tes

OTTO

nised by the lessee in the balance sheet. As a result, the Otto Group's total equity and liabilities will increase by the
amount of the obligations from leases classified as operating leases under IAS 17 (see Note (42)). The regulations
from IAS 17 remain largely unchanged for lessors. A lease is still classified as a finance lease for lessors if it transfers
all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Furthermore,
IFRS 16 contains additional regulations relating to recognition, disclosures, and sale and leaseback transactions. The
Otto Group is still in the process of assessing the implications arising from the first-time adoption of IFRS 16 on the
consolidated financial statements, and has launched a corresponding implementation project.

Associates and joint ventures reported under the equity method

In the 2016/17 financial year, 8 companies were merged within the Otto Group (2015/16: 8 companies).
The consolidated financial statements include 108 companies (29 February 2016: 108) with a different balance sheet
date, normally 31 December. The inclusion of the companies with a different closing date had no significant effect
on the Otto Group’s financial position or financial performance, as major events that occurred after the different
balance sheet date were taken into account.
The Otto Group holds 49% of the shares in Baur Versand (GmbH & Co KG) and can exercise control under company
contractual regulations.
A wholly owned subsidiary of Otto (GmbH & Co KG) holds 1% of the shares in one of the subsidiaries of FORUM
Grundstücksgesellschaft m.b.H., Hamburg. Furthermore, the Otto Group does not have any controlling interest in

Discontinued operations

In the 2015/16 financial year, the decision was taken to dispose of significant Multichannel Retail activities in France.
The 3SI Commerce operation represents a significant and separable business operation and, in accordance with
IFRS 5, was classified as held for sale and reported as a discontinued operation. The sale was successfully concluded
in January 2017. The closure of the remaining companies was largely completed. As at the closing date, provisions
from the settlement for severance payments to personnel amounted to EUR 34,414 thousand.

In the 2015/16 financial year, the result for discontinued operations included lease instalments paid under operating
leases amounting to EUR 1,206 thousand. There were no contingent rent payments. Future operating lease payments
amounted to EUR 86 thousand for remaining terms of up to one year and EUR 31 thousand for remaining terms of
more than one and less than five years. No payments were expected from sublease agreements. There were no future
operating lease payments relating to the renting of properties. The present value of future operating lease payments
Gro u p M anage m en t Rep or t

amounted to EUR 4,602 thousand for discontinued operations.
The other comprehensive income and expenses for the 2015/16 financial year that related to discontinued operations
totalled EUR 2,920 thousand. Of this, EUR 1,319 thousand resulted from remeasurements of the net defined benefit
liability, EUR 1,177 thousand from fair values of cash flow hedge derivatives, and EUR 424 thousand from the adjustment items for the translation of financial statements in foreign currencies.
In the previous financial year, the companies that were classified as held for sale did not have net financial debt
overall, but instead had a small amount of excess liquidity.
In the 2016/17 financial year, the average number of employees in these companies calculated on a full-time equiv-

presented as a disposal group pursuant to IFRS 5 as at last year's balance sheet date. Alba Moda GmbH operates as a
mail-order company for fashion and was assigned to the Otto Group's Multichannel Retail segment.

(13) IMPAIR MENT LOSSES

Goodwill is written down on the basis of annual impairment tests. As a rule, the discounted net cash flows from the
value in use were used to determine the recoverable amount for the measurement of impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill undertaken in the 2016/17 financial year were primarily attributable to one German financial services provider for which the current earnings forecasts lie below the original expectations reflected in the
purchase price. This company is assigned to the Financial Services segment.
In the 2016/17 financial year, impairment losses on other intangible assets and on property, plant and equipment were
primarily attributable to software developed in-house and acquired customer lists, as well as land and buildings. They
primarily relate to one German retailer, one French holding company and one French insurance broker. The future
value in use was the basis for determining the impairment loss due to the inadequate development of earnings.

Loss carry-forwards for corporation and trade tax purposes can be utilised without restriction by domestic companies having a positive tax base of up to EUR 1 million. Any positive tax bases in excess of this amount may only be
reduced by up to a maximum of 60%. In Germany, companies are no longer entitled to deduct interest expenses for
taxation purposes if the interest expense exceeds EUR 3 million, the net interest expense exceeds 30% of taxable
earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation and if certain exceptions do not apply. There is no limit to
the non-deductible interest expense that may be carried forward as an interest carry-forward and offset in future
periods against positive tax interest earnings.
The corporation tax and solidarity surcharge, along with the effects of differences between foreign income tax rates
and the tax rate paid by the Group’s parent company Otto (GmbH & Co KG) are reported in the reconciliation table
under differences in tax rates between Germany and other countries.
Corrections in deferred taxes essentially relate to deferred taxes on the loss carry-forwards of domestic and foreign
companies.

Notes to the Consolidated Income Statement

Accumulated other comprehensive income and expenses contains tax income from the change in the temporary
differences in available-for-sale financial instruments amounting to EUR 581 thousand (2015/16: EUR 247 thousand), tax expenses from the change in the temporary differences in cash flow hedge derivatives amounting to
EUR – 573 thousand (2015/16: EUR – 5,491 thousand) and tax expenses from the change in the temporary differences
Gro u p M anage m en t Rep or t

in the pensions provisions amounting to EUR – 15,110 thousand (2015/16: EUR 6,269 thousand).
Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards only if it appears sufficiently likely that they can be realised in the near future. No deferred tax assets were recognised for tax loss carry-forwards of EUR 3,124,211 thousand
and EUR 2,659,019 thousand in the 2016/17 and 2015/16 financial years respectively. Of these, tax loss carry-forwards
of EUR 3,031,240 thousand and EUR 2,586,591 thousand respectively can be carried forward indefinitely.
Deferred tax expenses from the occurrence and reversal of temporary differences amount to EUR – 17,666 thousand
(2015/16: EUR – 11,494 thousand)
In the year under review, an interest carry-forward of EUR 65,901 thousand (2015/16: EUR 48,243 thousand) arose in
Germany for which no deferred tax assets were recognised. This sum can be carried forward indefinitely within the

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET
(16) INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Advance payments on intangible assets include EUR 37,088 thousand (29 February 2016: EUR 26,400 thousand) for
internally-generated intangible assets which are still in development.
In the 2016/17 financial year, borrowing costs amounting to EUR 48 thousand (29 February 2016: EUR 1,296 thousand)
were capitalised on qualified assets, pursuant to IAS 23. The underlying capitalisation rate was 2.95% (29 February
2016: between 3.20%).
Of the goodwill recognised under intangible assets, EUR 215,870 thousand (29 February 2016: EUR 210,666 thousand) relates to companies from the Multichannel Retail segment, EUR 116,504 thousand (29 February 2016:
EUR 119,606 thousand) to companies from the Financial Services segment and EUR 20,521 thousand (29 February
2016: EUR 6,067 thousand) to companies from the Services segment.
There are contractual obligations for the acquisition of intangible assets amounting to EUR 4,852 thousand
(29 February 2016: EUR 7,273 thousand).

(17) PROPERT Y, PL ANT AND EQUIPMENT
Subsidies received amounting to EUR 672 thousand (29 February 2016: EUR 258 thousand) were deducted from the
additions to the purchase or production costs of property, plant and equipment.
In the 2016/17 financial year, no borrowing costs were capitalised on qualified assets (2015/16: EUR 13 thousand)
pursuant to IAS 23. The previous year’s underlying capitalisation rates lay between 1.70% and 3.80%.
The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment held under finance leases are broken down as follows:

Contractual obligations to acquire property, plant and equipment (purchase commitments) amounted to
EUR 28,227 thousand (29 February 2016: EUR 49,692 thousand). The decrease in these obligations resulted from
the capitalisation of property, plant and equipment that took place for a Group company domiciled in the United
Kingdom and relates to the expansion of its logistics network.

Notes to the Consolidated Balance Sheet

(23) EQUIT Y
An essential objective of the Otto Group’s capital management is to ensure the sustained availability of long-term
capital. The main control measure used here is the debt coefficient (net financial debt in relation to Group equity).
Given the different capital requirements of financial services and retail activities, the coefficient is calculated in a
Gro u p M anage m en t Rep or t

different manner for these activities. Here, management draws on the consolidated financial statements in which
the financial services companies are accounted for in accordance with the equity method (see Note (38)). With regard
to the characteristics of these figures, the reader is referred to the Group Management Report.
Changes in the Otto Group’s equity are presented in the statement of changes in equity.

(a)

LIMITED PARTNERS’ CAPITAL

In accordance with IAS 32, the limited partners’ shares in Otto (GmbH & Co KG) are to be classified as puttable instruments. In accordance with the partners’ agreement, the following amounts – which are determined under German

commercial law – comprise the limited partners' capital:

Given the prevailing partnership structure, characterised by an indirect allocation of all shares to members of the
Otto family and the Michael Otto Foundation, to which the majority of Otto (GmbH & Co KG) shares were allocated
during the 2014/15 financial year, the puttable financial instruments have a virtually unlimited holding period. Given
the absence of market transactions and the Foundation’s intention to retain the shares as long-term foundation
assets, it is impossible to provide a reliable assessment of fair value at the balance sheet date.

(b)

CONSOLIDATED RETAINED EARNINGS

Consolidated retained earnings include the profit or loss generated by companies included in the consolidated financial statements, unless these amounts have been distributed. Offsets for goodwill undertaken in the consolidated
financial statements under the German Commercial Code (HGB) up to 28 February 2002 and retained pursuant to
IFRS 1 have a reducing effect.

OTTO

In compliance with legal requirements and the articles of association, an amount of EUR 40,948 thousand
(29 February 2016: EUR 41,696 thousand) of consolidated retained earnings was not available for distribution as at
28 February 2017.

(c)

NET COST IN EXCESS OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IN STEP
ACQUISITIONS

The adjustment item contains differences arising from the step acquisition of shares in companies in which the
Otto Group already had the power of control. Such acquisitions are to be treated as transactions at partner level.

GROUP

(24) PROFIT AND LOSS PARTICIPATION RIGHTS
The Otto Group offers employees at selected Group companies in Germany a capital participation plan in the form
of participation rights. Each year, each employee at these companies has the option of buying a package that may
comprise up to twenty profit-sharing rights at a par value of EUR 250.00 each. Under the terms and conditions
governing profit and loss participation rights dated 10 April 2007, these rights share in all Group profits and losses
based on the IFRS consolidated financial statements of Otto (GmbH & Co KG). However, in some cases the loss allocation is limited to 30% of the par value of the profit and loss participation rights. In principle, these packages are to
be held for a period of at least six years, with the participation right recognised as non-current corresponding to the
proportion attributable to this period.
As at 28 February 2017, 31,743 packages worth EUR 27,376 thousand (29 February 2016: 35,513 packages worth
EUR 31,231 thousand) had been subscribed to.

(25) PENSIONS AND SIMIL AR OBLIGATIONS
Occupational pensions in the Group take the form of both defined contribution plans as well as defined benefit plans.
The expenses of defined contribution obligations and defined benefit obligations are included in personnel expenses,
except for net interest income. The compounding of the net pension obligation acquired in prior years is reported in
net financial result. The retirement plans are organised in compliance with the legal, tax and economic conditions
prevalent in the respective countries.
Under defined contribution pension plans, Otto Group companies make payments to external pension institutions and have no further benefit obligations to the beneficiaries. Expenses for defined contribution pension plans,
excluding payments made to statutory pension plans, amounted to EUR 11,273 thousand in the 2016/17 financial year
(2015/16: EUR 12,808 thousand).
Provisions for defined benefit pension plans are recognised for obligations arising from accrued rights and current
benefits payable to former and active Otto Group employees and their survivors. The structure of the plans is normally
based on the length of service, remuneration, status and the contributions of employees.
The principal defined benefit pension plans are in place at the Otto Group companies domiciled in Germany and
the United Kingdom. Pension plans in Germany are normally unfunded. These comprise employer financed benefit
obligations and defined contribution obligations financed by both the employer and the employee. A major part of
the employer-financed benefit obligations were closed as at 1 January 2014 for new entries. At the companies domiciled in the United Kingdom most pension plans are funded. These plans are predominantly based on the frozen
average salaries of employees. The plans in the United Kingdom were closed with effect from 28 February 2009 for
new entries. The plans benefits in Germany and the United Kingdom are predominantly rendered in the form of
pension payments.

GROUP

– A n n u a l Re p o r t 2016/17

Notes to the Consolidated Balance Sheet

The Otto Group is exposed to various risks in connection with the defined benefit plans. Besides general actuarial
risks, such as the longevity risk and the interest rate fluctuation risk, the Otto Group is exposed to the currency risk
and the capital market or investment risk. Pension payments in Germany are secured against the consequences of
insolvency in accordance with the Occupational Pensions Act. For this, annual contributions are paid to the PensionsGro u p M anage m en t Rep or t

Sicherungs-Verein VVaG (Pensions Security Association Mutual Insurance Association).
The main part of the plan assets held in the Otto Group relates to the companies domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The plan assets serve only to fulfil the benefit obligations. The underpinning of these benefit obligations with cash
and cash equivalents represents a reserve for future cash outflows. The plan assets are invested and managed by an
independent trustee. The overriding investment policy and investment strategy are based on the aim of generating
a yield from the plan assets which, together with the contributions, is sufficient to meet the benefit obligations. In
view of the present shortfall, the company has undertaken to eliminate this deficit in the long term by means of
regular endowment. The level of the endowments is renegotiated every three years within the framework of the
Funding Discussions. In addition, there is state supervision by the authority responsible for these matters (Pensions
Regulator). The benefits payments are to a large extent legally secured against the consequences of an insolvency.

Co nsolidate d Financi al State m en ts

For this purpose, annual contributions are made to the Pension Protection Fund.
Calculation of the provisions for pensions for the defined benefit plans is on the basis of actuarial assumptions,
pursuant to IAS 19. Measurement is based on the following weighted assumptions:

The costs of managing the plan assets diminish the income for the plan assets. The remaining administrative costs
Co nsolidate d Financi al State m en ts

are not deducted from the income from plan assets.
In the 2017/18 financial year, the Group expects to pay EUR 21,144 thousand into the defined benefit plans and also
anticipates that EUR 59,379 thousand will be paid out from these plans.
The weighted average term of the present value of the defined benefit obligation is 19.4 years (29 February 2016:

Provisions for restructuring obligations include expected severance payments and other restructuring-related
personnel expenses incurred based on programmes to avert hardship for employees affected by downsizing and
collective bargaining agreements, in the Services segment in Germany, France and England, for example. These provisions additionally include anticipated expenses in connection with the premature termination of lease agreements
owing to restructuring measures.
Provisions for asset removal and site restoration, which apply especially to leasehold improvements, were recognised
at the present value of the anticipated costs. These costs were correspondingly capitalised as a component of the
purchase or production costs of the assets at the time the obligation was incurred.
The provisions for personnel costs mainly comprise topping-up amounts for partial retirement obligations and also
anniversary bonus entitlements.
Provisions for warranties and customer goodwill payments are recognised for the probable total claim amounts, for
warranties established by law or contract or undertaken voluntarily, and for customer warranty claims on delivered
merchandise.

(31) EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION PROGR A MMES
In the 2006/07 financial year, a Group company in the United States established a virtual share option programme
as a long-term employee incentive plan. Under IFRS 2, this programme is classified as a cash-settled share-based
Gro u p M anage m en t Rep or t

payment. The transaction currency for grants and repurchases of the appreciation rights is the US dollar.
The appreciation rights granted annually under this plan vest pro rata temporis over a period of 60 months. At the
end of this vesting period, the amount of appreciation is paid out on the basis of the rights that have vested. This
amount of appreciation is defined based on a fair value of the company, arrived at by applying an EBIT multiplier and
taking into account a net financial position defined in the contract.
The plan allows for a maximum of 590,000 appreciation rights to be issued.

NOTES TO THE
CONSOLIDATED CASH
FLOW STATEMENT
(32) DEFINITIONS
In the Otto Group gross cash flow is an internal control measure for managing the companies’ and segments’ contributions to liquidity. Gross cash flow corresponds to earnings before interest and tax, adjusted for the profits, losses
and dividends of associated companies and joint ventures and also for material non-cash income and expenses.

(33) COMPONENTS OF CASH AND CASH
EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents are made up of the following components:

Of the cash and cash equivalents reported in the consolidated cash flow statement, EUR 10,896 thousand have been
deposited as collateral (29 February 2016: EUR 9,950 thousand). The limited availability is primarily due to contractual agreements in connection with ABS transactions.

(34) NON-CASH TR ANSACTIONS
Material non-cash financing and investment transactions in the 2016/17 financial year relate to the closing of finance
lease contracts to the amount of EUR 23,862 thousand (2015/16: EUR 21,704 thousand).

Gro u p M anage m en t Rep or t

NOTES TO THE SEGMENT
REPORTING
(35) PRINCIPLES
In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 8, segment reporting is based on the management approach. This harmonises segment reporting with internal reporting to the relevant primary decision makers, which contains information presented to these decision makers in the course of regular reporting that is then used to allocate resources for
the divisions within the Group. In accordance with the Group’s internal management structure, segment reporting
is based on the Group’s business segments.

(a)

Co nsolidate d Financi al State m en ts

To supplement the business segments, additional information is provided on the geographical regions.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

The Otto Group conducts business in the following business segments:

Multichannel Retail
The Multichannel Retail segment includes all of the Group’s operations that involve selling consumer goods to retail
customers. Business is conducted by means of a multichannel strategy that covers online and distance selling as well
as over-the-counter retail, whereby e-commerce sales form the main focus of this segment.

Financial Services
The Financial Services segment includes receivables and liquidity management services.

Services
The Otto Group’s Services segment comprises logistics and purchasing services. Logistics services include a wide range
of activities, from procurement and transport services through to home deliveries to end customers and services
related to delivered merchandise.

(b)

GEOGR APHICAL REGIONS

In addition to Germany and Russia, the Otto Group is especially active in other European countries, and in North

N o tes

OTTO

America and Asia. Other regions covers operations in all remaining regions.

(36) SEGMENT INFOR M ATION
Segment data is determined on the basis of accounting and measurement policies used for preparing the consolidated financial statements, with the exception of leasing agreements within the Group, which are reported as operating leases. Receivables, expenses and income resulting from transactions between the individual segments are
eliminated in the Holding/consolidation column. Such transactions are conducted on normal market terms. The
Holding/consolidation column also includes expenses for central corporate functions that cannot be reliably assigned
to individual segments.

Notes to the Segment Reporting

OTTO

GROUP

– A n n u a l Re p o r t 2016/17

Third-party revenue results from the sale of merchandise and the provision of services including financial services.
Internal revenue relates to the exchange of products and services between segments.
Earnings figures show the segments’ contribution to the Group’s earnings. Here, EBITDA represent earnings before
taking the net financial result, income tax and depreciation and amortisation into account. Taking into account the
depreciation and amortisation sustained, EBIT constitutes earnings before interest and before income taxes.
Segment assets include non-current assets for the relevant segment, i.e. intangible assets (including goodwill),
property, plant and equipment, and interests in associated companies and joint ventures, as well as current assets.
Segment assets do not include other investments, finance receivables, current income tax credits, deferred tax
assets and cash and cash equivalents. Only in the Financial Services segment are finance receivables included under
segment assets.
Segment gross cash flow is based on EBIT, from which all non-cash income and expenses are eliminated.
Segment assets can be reconciled with Group assets as follows:

(37) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
NON-DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Otto Group uses a wide range of financial instruments in its various lines of business.
The tables below list the financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the categories of financial instruments
under IAS 39. Cash flow hedges are recognised separately.
Pursuant to IFRS 13, all financial instruments accounted for in the financial statements at fair value are categorised
into three levels:

Co nsolidate d Financi al State m en ts

Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2: input factors other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities,
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices);
Level 3: factors for the measurement of the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Reclassifications between the various levels are recognised at the end of the reporting period in which the change
is made.
There were no reclassifications between the various categories of financial instruments in the 2016/17 financial year.
The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and liabilities, including their classification in the fair value hierarchy, as at 28 February 2017. It does not contain any information about the fair value of
financial assets and liabilities which were not measured at fair value if the carrying amount represents an adequate
approximation of the fair value or the fair value corresponds to the present value of the relative long-term financial
instrument, using current interest rate parameters. Finance lease liabilities are calculated in accordance with IAS 17
and are therefore not assigned to any measurement category in the table as per IAS 39. The fair value for finance
lease liabilities is not shown, as calculating the fair value would not yield any significant additional information.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Owing to its international activities, the Otto Group is particularly exposed to risks from fluctuations in foreign
exchange and interest rates. The Otto Group companies use derivative financial instruments to limit these risks.
The use of derivative financial instruments within the Otto Group is governed by specific guidelines and is permitted
only for hedging existing underlying transactions, or forecasted transactions that are sufficiently probable. These
binding guidelines specify responsibilities, areas of authority, reporting requirements, and a strict separation of
trading and settlement. According to this guideline, trading transactions with derivative financial instruments may
be entered into only with banks of sufficient creditworthiness.
The Otto Group uses foreign currency forwards, currency swaps and currency options to hedge completed or forecasted business transactions. As part of the Group’s interest rate hedging, risks are minimised through interest rate
derivatives in the form of interest rate swaps.

The Otto Group recognises certain derivatives as cash flow hedges pursuant to IAS 39 if they meet the hedging relationship requirements of IAS 39.
Cash flow hedges are used to hedge interest rate fluctuation and currency risks related to variable cash flows from
highly probable future transactions (merchandise purchasing and revenue) as well as from existing credit agreements. The effectiveness of the hedging relationships was tested at the balance sheet date using the dollar offset
method with the help of the hypothetical derivative method.
There are the following hedging instruments which meet the criteria of IAS 39 for classification as cash flow hedges:

The underlying transactions hedged eventuate in a period of up to six years in the case of foreign exchange derivatives
and up to eight years in the case of interest rate derivatives. Furthermore, currency risks are hedged for periods of up
to five years. The probable cash flow effects will occur in the same period. The nominal volumes of the hedging transactions are associated with planned transactions and with underlying transactions that have already been recognised, amounting to EUR 75,994 thousand in the case of foreign exchange derivatives and EUR 342,742 thousand in
the case of interest rate derivatives. For recognized underlying transactions from a hedging transaction with foreign
exchange derivatives, EUR 2,948 thousand from accumulated other comprehensive income was included at cost.
The Otto Group enters into derivative transactions on the basis of the master netting agreements in the German
Master Agreement for Financial Derivatives Transactions. In cases of certain credit events, such as a default, all
outstanding transactions under the defaulted master netting agreement are terminated and the value as at the date
of termination is determined. A single net amount should be used to offset all transactions. As there is currently no
specific credit event such as a default on a bank loan and, consequently, no legal entitlement to offset the recognised
amounts, the agreements concluded do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the balance sheet.

FINANCIAL RISKS

Owing to its international activities, the Otto Group is exposed to a number of financial risks. These include in
particular the effects of fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates. These risks are reduced through existing
treasury and risk management processes.
All material interest rate fluctuation and foreign exchange risks are fundamentally limited by refinancing in the same
currency and/or with the same maturity. Any remaining risks from open foreign currency and interest rate positions
are further reduced by the use of derivatives such as foreign exchange forward transactions and interest rate swaps.
The conditions for using these instruments are specified in a guideline issued by the Executive Board, compliance
with which is monitored by an independent risk management department.
A central liquidity management system additionally ensures that the Otto Group has sufficient funds at its disposal
for its business operations and investments.
Owing to the nature of its business activities, the Otto Group is essentially exposed to currency risks arising from
fluctuations in the US dollar, the Hong Kong dollar and the Swiss franc. An overview of the movements of currencies
that have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements can be found under Note (2)(b).

EBT

In the Otto Group, exchange rate hedges are partially accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with IAS 39.
In the overview above, fluctuations in the market value of the effective part are shown in equity.
The reported effects on earnings primarily result from fluctuations in the measurement of derivatives which were
concluded to hedge operating cash flows, but are not accounted for according to hedge accounting. These derivatives are mainly associated with planned but not yet concluded contracts where the currency exchange risk follows
a counter trend. When calculating the earnings effects, these cash flows are not included in the underlying operating
transactions. The actual risk of the net position is thus much lower.
The Otto Group is also exposed to interest rate risks from variable interest-bearing receivables and liabilities.
A hypothetical increase/reduction in the market interest rate of 50 base points for all currencies (parallel shift of the
interest rate curve) with all other variables remaining constant would result in the following effects on the earnings
before tax (EBT) and equity of the Otto Group, which would principally effect the net financial result:

GROUP

DEFAULT RISK

The Otto Group is exposed to the risk of its business partners not being able to meet their obligations. Credit checks
are performed to reduce the default risk, the maximum amount of which corresponds to the carrying amounts recognised for the relevant financial assets. Appropriate allowances are made for recognised default risks, especially in
trade receivables and receivables from financial services. For assets recognised in the balance sheet the carrying value
corresponds to the maximum default risk.
Trade receivables and receivables from financial services are essentially due from private customers and are normally
not hedged by special instruments, with the exception of the usual retention of title typical for the retailing business.
Because receivables are widely spread, only small amounts are actually allotted to individual customers. The risk of
maximum default is thus highly improbable.
Deposits at banks and financial assets are only held with associates that enjoy faultless creditworthiness in line with
rankings from an internationally-recognised rating agency.
Loans and receivables not impaired or overdue are monitored intensively in the various lines of business. In Multichannel Retail and for financial services companies, credit management is a crucial element in operational processes.
There are only very few receivables with a remaining term of up to one year which have only not been classed as
impaired or overdue because of subsequent negotiations and overdue financial instruments which are not impaired.
There are no objective indications that the debtors are unable to meet their obligations. Receivables are automatically written-down in a standardised process when there are delays in payment.

(e)

LIQUIDIT Y RISK

The Otto Group’s financial management system ensures that the Group’s liquidity is maintained at all times. It
also ensures that the Otto Group has sufficient funds at its disposal for its operations and investments. Minimising
financing costs is an essential ancillary condition for effective financial management. The basic principle is to match
open positions through natural hedging. Financing instruments may include money and capital market products such
as loans, bonds or ABS (asset-backed securities), as well as guarantees, leasing, sale and lease back, and factoring.
The requisite underlying data is generated as a rolling monthly liquidity budget with a 12-month planning horizon,
and a daily budget with a horizon of at least four weeks. Both types of budget are regularly reviewed for variances.
There is no risk concentration relating to the above-mentioned liquidity risks.

(38) CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT
ACCOUNTING FOR THE FINANCIAL
SERVICES SEGMENT UNDER THE EQUIT Y
METHOD (FS AT EQUIT Y)
(a)

GENER AL COMMENTS

The business undertaken by Group companies in the Financial Services segment differs fundamentally from the
Otto Group’s retail and services activities. To provide an even more differentiated insight into the financial position and financial performance of the Otto Group’s trading and service activities by eliminating the structures in
the Financial Services segment, another view was added to the IFRS consolidated financial statements for the year
ended 28 February 2017.
It eliminates the assets, liabilities, expenses and income of Group companies in the Financial Services segment
from the consolidated financial statements, and instead reports the interests in Financial Services companies using
the equity method. This reporting of interests in Group companies in Financial Services using the equity method is
based on the overall percentage held at the level of the parent companies concerned which are not allocated to the
Financial Services segment. Hence, non-controlling interests in the share of earnings or share of net assets of Group
companies in the Financial Services segment are only reported if these interests are held by third-party shareholders
of parent companies in other segments. Furthermore, for the purposes of the balance sheet, financial liabilities are
offset against receivables from companies in the Financial Services segment, which result from centralised financing
in the Financial Services segment.
The procedure described here deviates from IFRSs in that it forgoes the full consolidation of companies in the Financial Services segment that would have to be consolidated pursuant to IFRS 10 (and is reported in the IFRS consolidated financial statements), based on the Otto Group’s ability to exercise control over such companies. Furthermore,
financial liabilities are offset against receivables from companies in the Financial Services segment, which result from
centralised financing in the Financial Services segment.

Auditors’ Report

OTTO

GROUP

– A n n u a l Re p o r t 2016/17

AUDITORS’ REPORT
We have audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by Otto (GmbH & Co KG), Hamburg, comprising
the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated balance sheet,
statement of changes in consolidated equity, consolidated cash flow statement, and notes to the consolidated financial statement, together with the group management report for the financial year from 1 March 2016 to 28 February
2017. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report in accordance with
IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315a (1)
of the German Commercial Code [HGB] are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report based on our
audit.
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Section 317 of the German
Commercial Code [HGB] and the generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by
the German Institute of Public Auditors [IDW]. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit such that
misstatements materially affecting the presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations
in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework and in the
group management report are detected with reasonable assurance. Knowledge of the business activities and the
economic and legal environment of the Group and expectations as to possible misstatements are taken into account
in the determination of audit procedures. The effectiveness of the accounting-related internal control system and the
evidence supporting the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the group management report are
examined primarily on a test basis within the framework of the audit. The audit includes assessing the annual financial statements of those entities included in consolidation, the determination of entities to be included in consolidation, the accounting and consolidation principles used and significant estimates made by the management, as well
as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Our audit has not led to any reservations.

Auditors’ Report

In our opinion, based on the findings of our audit, the consolidated financial statements comply with IFRSs as
adopted by the EU, the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315a (1) of the German
Commercial Code [HGB] and full IFRS and give a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of
operations of the Group in accordance with these requirements. The group management report is consistent with
the consolidated financial statements , complies with the German statutory requirements, and as a whole provides
a suitable view of the Group’s position and suitably presents the opportunities and risks of future development.
