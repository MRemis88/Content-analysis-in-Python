About this report

Telekom has been providing extensive information to the general public
about its objectives, its activities and the progress made in the relevant
economic, ecological and social areas as part of corporate responsibility (CR) reporting since 1996.
The title "We take responsibility" is used for the seventh consecutive
time since it is an expression of Telekom’s long-term commitment to CR.
It is our intention to become a leader in our industry as a responsible
company. In this undertaking, the CR report is a central communication
tool that informs our internal as well as external stakeholders of the progress we have made on this path between March 2014 and February
2015, and of the goals we are setting for the future.
Additional sources for CR-relevant content
In addition to the online 2014 CR Report, we also provide information
on our involvement in the community and in society in our Annual
Report, and in our Data Privacy and Data Security Report. We report on
Deutsche Telekom’s current CR activities on the Group’s website under
the heading "Responsibility". The national companies provide information about their CR commitment on their Internet portals and in their
own publications.
In order to reduce the complexity of our report, we have often provided
links to other internal and external websites. Readers will find information provided by our national companies on their profile pages in the
2014 CR Report.
Reporting period, scope of application and target
groups
The 2014 CR Report is a Group report that includes many national
companies in which Telekom holds a majority stake. This report ties
in with the 2013 CR Report. The reporting period for the various topics
spans from March 01, 2014 to February 28, 2015. All quantitative data
and indicators refer to the 2014 calendar year. Any deviations are
marked accordingly. This CR report is addressed to our stakeholders.
These include analysts and investors, CR ranking and rating agencies
and NGOs as well as all other groups interested in our corporate activities such as customers, employees and representatives from the worlds
of science, research, education and politics.
Looking back: CR reporting at Deutsche Telekom
Deutsche Telekom has been reporting on its sustainability activities
in various publications since 1996. From 2003 through 2006 we published a combined annual HR and Sustainability Report. An interim
report issued in 2007 formed the transition to our current CR reporting.
Since 2008 the Telekom Group has been publishing a comprehensive
CR Report each year.

Online reporting since 2010
We have been publishing our CR Report exclusively online since the
2010/2011 reporting year to meet the increasing requirements and
changing user preferences of our stakeholders. The online 2014 CR
Report has been available since April 30, 2015 in German and English.
Interest in our CR report is high. This can be seen in many ways including the fact that more than 2,700 people accessed our report even in
March 2015, one month after the reporting period had ended.
The homepage gives readers a convenient introduction to this extensive
report by highlighting three global topics that our stakeholders feel
are very relevant: protecting customer data, environmental and social
standards in the supply chain and enabling people to get involved in the
information and knowledge society. We engage in open dialog on each
of these topics and provide examples of how Deutsche Telekom is
addressing these social challenges.
The start of every detailed page features a short introductory paragraph
explaining why that particular topic is important to sustainable development and the ongoing business success of Deutsche Telekom. A download area, search and dialog functions and performance indicators
displayed with interactive features make it even easier for readers to
navigate the report. What’s more, the info cart lets readers select different content and create a customized PDF file.
Most sections include a section on Deutsche Telekom’s management
approach. Here we explain how Telekom approaches key sustainability
topics, contributes to positive development in these areas and works
to prevent or reduce negative impacts. The introduction also contains
consolidated information on topics such as our strategic approach and
goals, management tools, policies and guidelines, internal and external
standards and the latest organizational developments.
This year’s report focuses on content relevant to the reporting period.
The "CR facts" and "Socially responsible investment (SRI) facts" sections
highlight further details. They provide background information on
a variety of topics that can be accessed directly from the text via links.
Readers can also access the "CR facts" section by clicking in the margin
column.
Together with this online report we are also publishing an e-paper with a
summary of selected developments in the reporting period. It is entitled
"Corporate Responsibility 2014 – Overview. We take responsibility"
In addition to publishing the online CR Report, we have been using
the We Care app magazine, which is published regularly, since 2014
to reach a wide target group, sparking their interest in corporate responsibility and inspiring them to get involved.

About this report

Selection of the main topics for the 2014 CR Report
We conducted a multiple-phase materiality process to help us select
our reporting topics. The process is a regular component of our annual
CR reporting activities that helps us identify the topics with maximum
relevance for us and our external stakeholders.
Structure of the current report
The online 2014 CR Report has been designed as a progress report
that focuses on the key developments of the reporting period. The
reader can access the six main sections of the report by using the

Implementation of international reporting standards
Deutsche Telekom’s 2014 CR Report complies with the guidelines
(G4 core) of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).
This 2014 CR Report also serves as a Communication on Progress
(COP) from Deutsche Telekom as part of the United Nations Global
Compact. The Global Compact communication on progress provides
an overview of specific measures that we have taken to comply with
the Global Compact principles. Deutsche Telekom also publishes an
extensive annual compliance statement regarding the German Sustainability Code.

Customers
Society
Employees
Suppliers
Climate and environment

These are complemented by three additional sections:
 The Strategy and management section describes the management
of CR processes and the Group-wide integration of Deutsche
Telekom’s CR strategy.
 The majority of our national companies whose CR activities are
described in this report have their own profile page. The profile
pages can be found under the National companies menu option.
 In the Performance indicators section, consolidated and commented performance indicators provide information about our
progress in the past few years.
Assurance engagement
Selected KPIs in the 2014 CR Report from Germany as well as from our
national companies T-HT Hrvatski Telekom (Croatia), Magyar Telekom
(Hungary), OTE and Cosmote (Greece) and T-Mobile USA were audited
by the auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) as part of an assurance engagement.
As our reporting activities are based on the guidelines of the internationally recognized GRI-G4 (core) standards published by the Global
Reporting Initiative, all of the indicators checkmarked in the GRI index
have been reviewed by an independent auditing firm. The independent
assurance report can be found under the assurance report menu item.
All audited content of this report is marked with and will remain
effective until the next CR report is published.

Statement by the Chairman of the
Board of Management
Dear Readers,
2014 was a successful year for Deutsche Telekom. We invested,
expanded and continued to improve the high quality of our networks.
Our positive sales results are proof that Deutsche Telekom is on the best
road to achieving its goal of becoming Europe’s leading telecommunications provider. With this goal in mind, we rely on innovation and
responsibility for sustainable development.
Our services connect people and enable everyone to get involved in
the information and knowledge society. For this reason we continue to
intensify our investment in the build-out of our network infrastructure.
We also give people the tools they need to use our services safely and
securely by offering extensive educational programs. Our "Yes, I can!"
initiative helps children and young people from disadvantaged backgrounds learn personal skills and boost their confidence.

Timotheus Höttges, Chairman of the Board of Management, Bonn, Germany.

However, it is also important that we gain and retain our customers’
trust. We have been in compliance with the highest data privacy standards for years. Our ten-point program has helped us specify these
standards further to guarantee even better online security.
As a responsible company, we are also committed to helping find
solutions to challenges in society. We develop pioneering solutions that
help ensure universal healthcare and shape an energy-efficient society.
By outsourcing their IT to our highly efficient data centers, for example,
companies can reduce their energy consumption significantly.
We are committed to sustainability throughout our entire value chain.
We have made considerable progress in managing our climate protection measures by including the indirect CO₂ emissions produced by our
customers and suppliers. High environmental and social standards have
priority in our supply chain and we review these extensively. We value
long-term procurement relationships and work with our suppliers as
partners to help them develop further.
After all, social responsibility is also a question of principles. With this
in mind, I would once again like to underline our commitment to the
principles of the United Nation’s Global Compact and the German
Sustainability Code. I would also like to invite you to read this report
and learn more about how we put our commitment into practice.
Sincerely,
Tim Höttges

About this report
Group profile

Group profile

Deutsche Telekom is one of the world’s leading integrated telecommunications companies, with some 151 million mobile customers, 30 million
fixed-network lines, and more than 17 million broadband lines.
We provide fixed-network/broadband, mobile, Internet, and IPTV products and services for consumers, and information and communication
technology (ICT) solutions for business and corporate customers.
Deutsche Telekom operates in more than 50 countries. With a staff of
some 228,000 employees throughout the world, we generated revenue
of 62.7 billion euros in the 2014 financial year, more than 60 percent of
it outside Germany.
So that we can continue to be successful, we are already evolving from
a traditional telephone company into an entirely new kind of service
company. Our core business, i.e., the operation and sale of networks
and connections, remains the basis. But at the same time we are proactively committing to business areas that open up new growth opportunities for us.
We believe that economic, social and ecological perspectives can be
reconciled. Sustainability underpins all of our business activities. The
fact that we are the first DAX-30 company to introduce a quota for
women in management, or that we cover our entire power requirements
in Germany from regenerative sources are just two examples of this.
In other words, we have a clearly defined objective: We want to be a
business enterprise that delights its customers, creates value for its
investors, and in which employees enjoy their work.
Business development in 2014
Group revenue increased considerably by 4.2 percent in the financial
year 2014. The United States operating segment in particular contributed to this revenue trend as a result of the inclusion of MetroPCS since
May of last year and continued strong customer additions. Our Germany
operating segment sustained slight revenue losses. Decisions by regulatory authorities and competition-induced price reductions adversely
affected our revenue in the Europe operating segment. The contribution
to revenue made by our Systems Solutions segment decreased as a
result of the realignment of the business model to generate sustainable
growth.
Net profit/loss
Net profit increased substantially to 2.9 billion euros. The increase was
due in particular to income from the sale of the Scout24 group totaling
1.7 billion euros. Income of some 0.4 billion euros from a transaction
completed in the United States concerning the acquisition and
exchange of mobile spectrum also had a positive effect. Expenses of
some 0.3 billion euros from the decommissioning of the MetroPCS

CDMA network had a negative effect. Impairment losses recognized
on goodwill and other non-current assets were down by 0.7 billion euros
year-on-year at 0.1 billion euros. This decrease was partially offset by
a 0.4 billion euros increase in depreciation and amortization, especially
in the United States operating segment.
You will find more detailed information on Telekom’s financial data
in our 2014 Annual Report.
Group structure and operating segments
The following graphic provides an overview of organizational structure
of our Group, which we will explain below.
The organizational structure at a glance

 Germany: The Germany operating segment comprises all fixed-network and mobile activities in Germany. In addition, it provides intermediate telecommunications services for the Group’s other operating segments.
 United States: The United States operating segment combines

 Europe: comprises all fixed-network and mobile operations of
the national companies in Greece, Romania, Hungary, Poland,
the Czech Republic, Croatia, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Austria,
Albania, the F.Y.R.O. Macedonia, and Montenegro. The EE joint
venture in the United Kingdom, which had previously been assigned
to the Europe operating segment, was transferred to the Group
Headquarters & Group Services segment as of January 1, 2014.
In addition to consumer business, individual national companies
also offer ICT solutions to business customers. On May 30, 2014,
we completed the acquisition of GTS Central Europe Group (GTS).
Since then, GTS has been helping us to further develop the international business customer segment. The Europe operating segment
also comprises the units International Carrier Sales & Solutions
(ICSS), Group Technology, and the Global Network Factory (GNF):
ICSS mainly provides intermediate telecommunications services

Telekom publishes a comprehensive declaration of conformity with
the German Sustainability Code. The German Sustainability Code
aims to make companies’ sustainability performance transparent and
com-parable under a binding framework. Deutsche Telekom’s declarations of conformity can be viewed here. The German Sustainability

"Secure networks for sustainable development"
Thomas Kremer, Member of the Board of Management for Data
Privacy, Legal Affairs and Compliance, acted as interim Board Member for Human Resources to during the reporting period. Consequently, Mr. Kremer was also in charge of corporate responsibility at
the company. In an interview, Mr. Kremer talks about the challenges
that Deutsche Telekom faces in this area and gives an outlook
regarding the Group’s future sustainability activities.
Mr. Kremer, telecommunications products and services play an
increasingly vital role in our everyday activities. Is Deutsche Telekom
really able to make these more sustainable?
Definitely. Take climate protection, for example. Telecommunications
helps us reduce greenhouse gas emissions every day. Smart meters
and smart home solutions, for example, make our homes more comfortable, secure and energy efficient. We also help companies significantly
reduce their carbon footprint by outsourcing their data to the cloud. We
even help reduce CO2 emissions in the agricultural sector with intelligent networking.

Yes, there is a risk. But we cannot let that happen. For that reason,
Deutsche Telekom is working to provide fast, secure networks for everyone and is investing massively in this technology. But that is not enough.
Close collaboration between politics and business is key here, too. That
is why we have entered into more than 5,000 cooperation agreements
for broadband expansion with a host of communities.

But the environment is not our only concern. To us, intelligent networking means that data can be accessed quickly and reliably at any time.
Our security standards here are higher than ever before. This is especially true for healthcare services. Our society is faced with the challenge
of providing universal healthcare to an aging population. Our products
can make a significant contribution to patients’ wellbeing and support
doctors and clinics at the same time. In 2014, for example, we collaborated with the Dresden University Hospital to develop an IT platform for
healthcare services. The platform has set the bar throughout Europe.
Protecting personal information from unauthorized access is naturally
very important as well.

Use of our Internet portals and services offers many possibilities but
hides dangers as well. That is why I feel it is important to teach children
and young people how to navigate the web safely. Instant messaging,
social networks and chat rooms are all a part of our children’s everyday
lives. As a father, I see it every day at home. Students need to be made
aware of the risks and consequences of providing personal information
at an early age. Our Teachtoday platform helps teachers, parents and
children learn and teach media skills.

But our responsibility goes beyond providing our customers with
sustainable products and services. We have set high social and environmental standards for our own company and expect our suppliers to
comply with these standards as well. We reviewed compliance with
these standards at 72 percent of our suppliers in 2014, based on procurement volume. We help our suppliers guarantee environmental
standards throughout their own supply chain.

We have been a leader in data privacy and security in our industry
for some time now. Although we will never be able to guarantee total
security in the race against cyber crime, protecting customer data
from unauthorized access is our top priority. We launched our Mobile
Encryption App to the market in 2014. The app provides our business
customers with a global encryption solution of the highest quality that
can be used worldwide. We have considerably strengthened our team at
our central Cyber Defense Center and, in collaboration with the German
Chamber of Industry and Commerce, created a certified training offer
for becoming a cyber security professional. Our efforts were recognized
by the European Trusted Brands 2014 study. The study found that
Deutsche Telekom is Germany’s most reliable brand.

Only people who have the right skills and access to technology can
benefit from the advantages of digital services. However, not everyone has the same opportunities to use these services. Is there a risk
that digitization could lead to the exclusion of parts of our communities?

Media skills alone are not enough to protect people from online
dangers. As a provider, how do you guarantee Internet security?

Vision

In addition to various individual solutions it is also important to guarantee at a political level people’s right to determine for themselves what
happens to their data. Just look at the espionage scandals over the past
few years. For that reason, we are committed to translating our high
standards into law in Europe and advancing these standards with technological progress. This is the only way to strengthen people’s trust in
the digital world.
Last year you acted as interim Board Member for Human Resources
in addition to your Data Privacy responsibilities. How do you get
employees involved in the company’s commitment to sustainability
and how do you define sustainable human resources management?
The only way a company can be successful is hand-in-hand with its
employees. The same goes for sustainability. For me, it starts with training and study programs. We are currently one of the major companies
offering training programs in Germany with almost 9,000 apprentices
and students on cooperative study programs. Our "Responsibility wins"
competition has been encouraging trainees to get involved in their
communities and for the environment since 2009. We also encourage
all of our employees to volunteer with events such as our Social Days,
days on which we give our employees the chance to volunteer in community projects or activities to protect the environment. We also support
initiatives in which our employees are active with donations. Volunteering is very beneficial when it comes to internal HR development. It
strengthens identification with the company as well as social skills.

20

With data volumes growing, it is not that easy. We will continue reducing
our energy consumption through targeted efforts to increase the efficiency of our network infrastructure. Reducing energy consumption in
facility management and our vehicle fleet remains a focal point of our
efforts as well. We discuss other specific progress in this area in this
report.
I am positive that positioning Deutsche Telekom as a sustainable company holds tremendous opportunity. As I mentioned at the start of our
interview, we provide solutions to many challenges our society is faced
with. It will be up to us in coming years to continue to advance these
solutions. In doing so, we will secure the success of our business and
position Deutsche Telekom as an innovative company ready to take on
the future.

Those are only a few examples.
Sustainable human resources management is much more. Diversity
is a key word you hear time and again. Everyone should have the opportunity to get involved in working life in line with their interests and skills,
regardless of gender or age. That includes companies creating a framework that enables work-life balance in all phases of life. Fair pay, performance-based assessment, lifelong learning, modern work models and,
of course, preventive healthcare are all part of this. We spend more than
400 million euros a year on training and development alone. However, it
is also important to provide tools for socially acceptable staff restructuring so that we can effectively master changes, particularly when it
comes to our employees. Good relationships based on trust between
employer and labor representatives are key here.
What is Deutsche Telekom’s long-term approach in terms of
sustainability?
As Europe’s leading telecommunications provider, we intend to assume
a leading role when it comes to sustainability. For that reason we will
push ahead with our activities in this area both within and outside of our
company. We work together intensively with our suppliers throughout
our supply chain to establish social and environmental standards in
emerging markets as well. In view of the intricate structures in place
in the information and telecommunications sector, that poses a real
challenge, but we are on a good road.
We have set an ambitious but realistic goal with our climate protection
strategy. We intend to reduce total CO2 emissions at our Group (not
including T-Mobile US) by 20 percent by 2020 compared to 2008.

Values and Guiding Principles

Values and Guiding Principles

Corporate responsibility (CR) is based on shared values. We communicate our fundamental values to our employees within the scope of
Guiding Principles as a way to effectively integrate these values into our
corporate culture. Many of our employees once again contributed activities and ideas to put our Guiding Principles into practice in celebration
of the fifth year of Guiding Principles Day.
Our Code of Conduct and our Social Charter are other tools that we use
to ensure that our Group and our partners show corporate responsibility
in their conduct. Our compliance management, which makes sure that
our business activities are in compliance with laws and regulations, are
based on these documents.
Embracing our Guiding Principles
Deutsche Telekom’s Guiding Principles are a key tool in our human
resources activities. They form the basis of reliable cooperation at the
company and help us keep delighting our customers with our products
and services. We regularly communicate the Guiding Principles via our
internal media to help incorporate them into our employees’ everyday
work routines. To this end, we also host our annual Guiding Principles
Day.
We have been conducting pulse surveys for several years now to find
out what our employees think about different Deutsche Telekom topics.
We use this tool to assess the effectiveness of our communication
regarding the Guiding Principles as well as other activities. In the survey,
we ask employees to rate the statement, "I experience the Guiding Principles being practiced in my day-to-day work," on a scale of one to five.
We continue to receive positive feedback from our employees. 70 percent of our employees gave a positive response (a rating of four or five)
in our November 2014 survey, similar to the previous year. These consistent results indicate that the Guiding Principles continue to play a
prominent role.
Guiding Principles Day
Deutsche Telekom held its fifth Group-wide Guiding Principles Day on
September 25, 2014. All of our employees were called upon to think
about the Guiding Principles and come up with ideas on how to effectively implement them in day-to-day work. The message was that we
don’t just live our Guiding Principles one day a year – we make them a
basic principle behind our daily activities and continue to pursue them
with determination.
Before the event, employees voted to decide which Guiding Principle
should be the focal point on September 25. The majority of our employees chose the second Guiding Principle, "Respect and integrity guide
our behavior." Our fifth Guiding Principles Day therefore focused on

what we as a team, what each individual can do to ensure that we treat
each other and our customers with more respect and appreciation.
The 2014 Guiding Principles Day was a huge success throughout the
different countries and cultures. With numerous activities, events and
initiatives, Deutsche Telekom employees showed how they are motivated by our corporate values to let respect and integrity guide their
behavior. At an event held at our headquarters in Bonn, for example,
seven employees gave presentations on what the Guiding Principle,
"Respect and integrity guide our behavior," means to them. The presentations were inspired by the TED talks, which focus on encouraging
experts from a variety of disciplines to share ideas.
Code of Responsible Conduct for Business
Deutsche Telekom was one of the first companies to sign the Code of
Responsible Conduct for Business, which was presented to the public
in November 2010. All of the members of our Board of Management
signed the code, making an express commitment to responsible corporate governance in line with the principles of the social market economy,
to fair competition, cooperation with employee representatives, business excellence and sustainability. We have incorporated this commitment into our conduct as a business and have assumed a leading role
in putting our commitment into practice:
The code asks that we engage in sustainable business practices and
responsible corporate governance for the good of the people. Deutsche
Telekom consistently addresses these requirements in its core business
and along its supply chain and takes responsibility for its employees
and in society. We guarantee respect for human rights without exception.
Our products and services connect people and increase the productivity
of numerous processes, helping Germany and Europe to remain competitive in international competition and bring prosperity. Our smart,
digital solutions create new ways to effectively address social challenges such as climate change and to simplify our lives for the long term.
Our network serves as a vital line of communication in our efforts: fast,
reliable, secure and accessible to everyone. These efforts, just like all of
our activities, are focused on people. We provide transparent information on our plans and technologies, engage in fair practices and are
always open to dialog.
In line with the code, we continue to expand our leading position as
a sustainable company as well as our ongoing efforts to optimize our
value-added processes. We are making our networks, products and
services more energy and resource-efficient and reducing the environmental impact and carbon footprint of our business activities. In 2014

Deutsche Telekom - Corporate Responsibility Report 2014

Strategy & management
Values and Guiding Principles

22

our Board of Management approved a Group-wide climate protection
target for 2020. We also help our over 30,000 suppliers engage in
business practices that are just as sustainable as our own, e.g. with our
supplier development program. Along with audits and pre-qualification
measures, we rely on partnership and dialog throughout this process,
as we do in our relationships with our many stakeholders.
Development through dialog and partnership is also a central concept
in our human resources management activities. It served as guidance
when creating our internal social network, TSN, and our MOOC (massive open online course) open educational platform. More than 3,600
Deutsche Telekom employees participated in our first MOOC. During
the course, 140 interdisciplinary, international teams developed
numerous business concepts that are tailored to the needs of our
customers and will provide long-term benefits. Deutsche Telekom
is currently considered to be one of the most attractive employers.
Our social commitment, however, is not just to our customers, partners
and employees. We feel it is our responsibility to support the development of media skills in our community and help young people become
more confident. Our efforts in this area include the Teachtoday initiative,
which promotes learning with digital media. We have also been involved
in the "Yes, I can!" initiative for some time now. Since 2010 this initiative
has given more than 60,000 children and young people from disadvantaged backgrounds an opportunity to learn key skills for an independent
and confident life.
T-Spirit – a project to create a new corporate
culture
The telecommunication sector and business are changing rapidly. This
affects not only the commercial side of the business and how a company is organized, but also its internal culture. This was the reason
behind the launch of a company-wide T-Spirit project in 2014, which
aims to explain T-Mobile’s strategy and create a corporate culture that
is consistent with the company’s brand promise and today’s dynamic
conditions. Through the T-Spirit project T-Mobile Netherlands wants to
shape the company in the way it is envisioned to be, and thus make a
clear mark on the telecom sector.
Volunteers from the company are now engaged in four working groups:
New Way Of Leading, New Way Of Working, Live The Brand, and Creative Deployment a group that is going to develop initiatives. Instead of
clear roles and responsibilities with defined milestones for firmly set
goals right from the start, the project is working with initial ideas and a
committed approach to co-create.
The T-Spirit Day on 30 September 2014 was the kick-off event for the
T-Spirit program. 800 employees participated in 40 different creative
sessions to promote the T-Spirit, learn about T-Mobile’s projects,
exchange knowledge, and develop ideas. The sessions included for
example workshops named “How to build the best mobile network?”,
social hangouts, blind dating for employees or “The best sales training
ever”.

CR strategy

Deutsche Telekom aims to be the leading telecommunications provider
in Europe. We also want to be at the forefront of our industry when it
comes to taking social and ecological responsibility.
With our Group-wide CR strategy, we have committed ourselves to
sustainable corporate governance. Deutsche Telekom’s Board of
Management first approved the CR strategy in 2008. The CR strategy
is based on our Group strategy and also provides a framework for the
international subsidiary when it comes to implementing CR in their
areas of responsibility. Central components of the CR strategy include
our CR action areas and our CR program, in which we have specified
our targets and the measures to achieve them. Deutsche Telekom’s
stakeholder involvement strategy is another important part. Implementation of our CR strategy is facilitated by organizational and management
structures which allow the Group Board of Management and the top
management at our international subsidiary to embrace this strategy.
 Deutsche Telekom’s central CR unit, Group Corporate Responsibility is responsible for strategic CR management and communication
activities.

CR Policy adopted for the entire Group
In March 2014, the works council also approved our first Group Policy
on Corporate Responsibility, which had previously been approved
by the Board of Management. This policy is now being gradually introduced at all of our national companies. The process has already been
completed at Group headquarters as well as at Telekom Deutschland
and T-Systems International. In 2014, the first international subsidiaries
began submitting the policy to their decision-making bodies for
approval so that implementation could begin.
The CR Policy emphasizes how important corporate responsibility
has become at our company over the years. It specifies the rights and
obligations of corporate entities and functions and addresses the following: governance structures, sustainable business practices, a responsible supply chain, resource and energy efficiency, climate protection,
social commitment and involvement in the community, and providing
sustainable products and services to our customers. The policy also
describes the Group’s CR organization, with the Group Board of
Management assuming overall responsibility for CR.

 The CR board with its broad organizational basis within the Group
helps to keep our CR strategy in line with our Group and brand
strategies as well as with our corporate values.
 The HR Leadership Team (HR LT), an advisory and decision-making
body within the Human Resources (HR) Board department, is
responsible for generic aspects of corporate responsibility.
 The CR managers from the different business areas and international subsidiaries are responsible for operational implementation
of the CR strategy. They established the CR Manager Network at
Group level to facilitate decisions and information exchange
regarding key developments.
Regularly reviewing the effectiveness of our CR strategy and determining to what extent we have been able to lead the way are important
aspects in assessing and managing our CR program. That is why we
use key performance indicators (KPIs) to regularly gauge our CR performance. We conducted a review of our KPIs in 2014. Instead of using
the term CR KPIs, we now refer to ESG KPIs (environmental, social and
governance key performance indicators) in order to emphasize their
importance in Deutsche Telekom’s business success.

CR action areas

Knowledge that is available to everyone and a society that is becoming
increasingly connected open up new ways for people to tackle global
challenges like climate change and living in an aging society. Deutsche
Telekom lays the foundation for this with its extensive network infrastructure and its products and services based on this network. In this
way, we facilitate connected life and work, connect the unconnected,
and contribute to a low-carbon society. Our customers and employees,
suppliers, investors, our environment and society are just some of the
stakeholders that benefit from Deutsche Telekom’s involvement in these
three CR action areas, all of which are directly connected to our core
business.
... for connected life and work
We are helping shape the change in the increasingly digitized work and
living environment. Deutsche Telekom supports cultural change with
innovative products and solutions toward greater self-determination and
quality of life both in our professional and personal lives. Our goal is to
be a driving force for sustainable life and work.
… for connecting the unconnected
Irrespective of their social or economic opportunities, we try to get as
many people as possible involved in the development of the society they
live in. With this in mind, we promote numerous community initiatives
and support projects for media skills development.
… for a low-carbon society
Global warming and its consequences are one of the greatest challenges facing mankind. We have launched large-scale initiatives to
reduce our own emissions for the long term. At the same time we are
also empowering our customers and partners to make their contribution
to climate protection with our solutions.

ESG key performance indicators

ESG key performance indicators

We use the ESG KPIs as a management tool in our CR activities. They
help us to systematically improve our services, and some are included in
our Annual Report due to their relevance in value creation. We reviewed
the KPIs extensively during the reporting period and updated some of
them in order to make sure that these KPIs continue to contribute to
effective corporate management and meet the expectations of our
stakeholders. Following this review, we changed the term CR KPI to ESG
KPI as an indication of their role as a management tool for environmental, social and responsible governance within and outside of our Group.
For the purpose of integrated financial and sustainability reporting, the
KPIs also map the six types of capital addressed in these reports and
therefore also reflect the essential aspects of the sustain-able value of
our company (see graphic).

The two ESG KPIs, Used Cell-Phone Collection and CO2 Emissions
have been revised. For the sake of comparability, we will additionally
report the previous KPI on cell-phone recycling this year. We are also
currently piloting three new ESG KPIs to gauge the effectiveness of our
social commitment and are preparing a revised version of our Energy
Consumption ESG KPI.
ESG KPIs
In order to manage its CR performance, Deutsche Telekom uses seven
key performance indicators, that apply throughout the Group: the ESG
[i] key performance indicators (ESG KPIs):







Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) ESG KPI
CR Employee Satisfaction ESG KPI
Sustainable Procurement ESG KPI
CO2 Emissions ESG KPI
Energy Consumption ESG KPI
Social Commitment ESG KPI
Used Cell-Phone Collection ESG KPI

All international subsidiaries of Deutsche Telekom are required to
record data on the Group-wide ESG KPIs. These represent 99 percent
of the Group’s net revenue.
We extensively reviewed the KPIs in terms of relevance for management
practices and updated some of them. The reference for comparison
of the Used Cell-Phone Collection ESG KPI was changed from "number
of customers" to "number of mobile phones in circulation." This makes
it possible to more precisely illustrate the ratio of the number of cell
phones sold to the number of those returned. When customers use the
devices for longer periods of time, the environment benefits from this
decision and, as a result, this has a positive impact on the KPI. We also
adjusted our CO2 Emissions ESG KPI in line with our international
climate protection target. We expanded the KPI to include all Group
entities that participate in helping us realize our climate protection
target. The extended scope affects the current volume of CO2 emissions
as well as the figure recorded in 2008, on which our climate protection
target is based. In 2014 we piloted three new KPIs to measure our social
commitment and have begun reporting these externally for the first time
in this report. Our activities are based on the methods employed by the
London Benchmarking Group (LBG), which incorporate the aspects,
"input," (effort/involvement), "output" (results) and "impact" (change).
 The Community Investment ESG KPI illustrates activities in which
Deutsche Telekom was involved in the community either financially,
through its employees, or through donating materials.
 The Beneficiaries ESG KPI reflects the number of people who got
involved in community activities and the number of people in the
target group that benefited from such activities.
 The Media Literacy ESG KPI reflects the number of people we
have reached through programs addressing this topic. This KPI
establishes a direct correlation between these activities and our
core business.

ESG key performance indicators

In order to increase the relevance of the Energy Efficiency ESG KPI for
management practices, we want to introduce an adjusted KPI for the
target-oriented management of energy efficiency in all relevant corporate areas, including Technology, Procurement, and Sales, in the near
future. One possible approach would be to calculate energy consumption per product group (customer equivalent). Despite these adjustments, we plan to continue to report on the previous ESG KPIs so that
our readers will be able to compare the data.
ESG KPI reporting in the Annual Report
In our 2013 Annual Report, we forecast trends for three of our ESG KPIs
– Energy Consumption, CO2 Emissions, and Sustainable Procurement –
for the first time in compliance with the German Accounting Standard
GAS 20. In the case of all three ESG KPIs, actual developments in the
2014 financial year exceeded our forecast. Both the Energy Consumption and CO2 Emissions ESG KPIs improved slightly instead of remaining constant as predicted. This is due to the fact that revenue grew more
strongly and energy consumption less strongly than anticipated. The
ratio between actual emissions and our climate target base year 2008
also improved as a result of extending the scope for the CO2 Emissions
ESG KPI. The Sustainable Procurement ESG KPI increased more than
planned as a result of further suppliers being audited for compliance
with our social and environmental standards. In future, we expect these
ESG KPIs to develop as follows:

Demographics Management: Analysis of relevant
performance indicators
Large companies like Deutsche Telekom employ up to four generations,
some of whom have very different backgrounds, values and education.
In view of the demographic shift, the way we live, work and learn is
going to change considerably in the coming decades. Based on the
age structure at our corporation, this is particularly going to impact
Deutsche Telekom in Germany. We are prepared for this development
because our company’s success depends on the contribution of every
person and every generation. For that reason, we have developed a
comprehensive demographics management process that includes
concepts for training, health, leadership and different working models.
Our workforce structure management is aligned with demographic
aspects.
To help us effectively conduct and manage our demographics management activities, we have intensified our monitoring of such HR indicators
as well as of qualitative indicators with a high relevance for demographics. We consider it important to take both objective HR indicators as
well as subjective assessments, e.g., from our employee survey, into
account.

 Over the next two years we expect our Energy Consumption ESGKPI
to fall or fall slightly, i.e., a positive development. Network migration
to IP technology and consolidation of the T-Systems data centers
will be the main factors helping us to achieve major energy savings.
These savings will be partly counterbalanced by the expansion of
T-Mobile USA and the accompanying rise in energy consumption.
 Since our CO2 emissions are largely driven by our power consumption, the resulting positive trend is similar to the development
described for the Energy Consumption ESG KPI. We will also strive
to achieve a slight reduction in our CO2 emissions ESG KPI for
the years 2015 and 2016. Our expectation for the Group units
participating in the climate protection target is that, in 2020, CO2
emissions will lie 20 percent below the rate of the base year 2008
(excluding T-Mobile USA). The CO2 Emissions ESG KPI figure will,
however, also include emission figures for T-Mobile USA. Since
strong business growth will continue to increase power demand in
the foreseeable future, the KPI will only improve slightly in the period
up to the year 2016.
 In 2015 we expect to reach the forecast target of 75 percent for the
Sustainable Procurement ESG KPI. In subsequent years, we assume
that the ESG KPI will only rise slightly since audits focus on strategic
suppliers and those with an increased CR risk.
Our Social Commitment ESG KPI shows that in 2014 our performance
was again rated significantly higher than the level of importance
attached by the public to the subject.

Internationalization

Putting a shared CR strategy into practice is particularly challenging for
an international corporation and requires a coordinated, collaborative
approach at all Group units. To help this process along, we established
CR managers at various Group entities who have the necessary skills
and resources to support us in realizing our key CR targets worldwide.
CR manager meetings and web conferences are held regularly.
We focus on three action areas in our CR strategy internationalization
efforts. Most of the 28 national companies represented in our CR
Manager Network have already embraced these action areas and
included them in their local CR strategy.
International cooperation in the CR Manager
Network
The CR Manager Network provides a forum for its members to cooperate internationally and to discuss and approve the Group’s CR activities
at regular conferences and conference calls. The 13th and 14th CR
manager meetings were held in Bonn on May 5 and 6 and November 13
and 14, 2014.
The focal point of the spring meeting was how specific CR activities can
contribute to the success of our business. At workshops on energy,
waste and recycling, the supply chain, and the protection of young
people from unsuitable media content, participants assessed the
respective contributions these activities can make. Participants also
discussed national CR strategies and best practice cases at the international subsidiaries, for example, in areas such as corporate volunteering.
The November meeting focused on Opportunities and Risks of Sustainability at a panel discussion and in various workshops. Dr. Robert
Pojasek from the Harvard Extension School talked about risk management and sustainability. At the workshops that followed, participants
discussed how to turn risks into opportunities.

CR governance

CR governance

Deutsche Telekom has created an integrated governance structure for
CR in order to closely link strategic management and operational implementation throughout the Group. The Deutsche Telekom Board of
Management carries general responsibility for CR. The Group has developed this structure to make sure that sustainability is part and parcel of
all business activities, emphasizing its commitment to society.
Current organizational structure

As one of the innovation drivers at our company, the CR unit is part of
Group Transformational Change & Corporate Responsibility (GCCR).
GCCR, which directly reports to the Member of the Board of Management responsible for Human Resources, is responsible for advancing
our corporate culture with a focus on innovation, individual responsibility, entrepreneurship, and social responsibility.
Another pillar of our CR governance structure is the HR Leadership
Team (HR LT). The team is an advisory and decision-making body for
the Human Resources (HR) Board department. It is made up of managers reporting directly to the Board Member for HR and makes decisions
regarding Group-wide policies and guidelines, CR positioning and the
strategic focus of the CR department.
The CR unit and the HR LT are advised and supported by the CR Board
when it comes to CR management and strategy enhancement.
The CR managers from the different business units and international
subsidiaries are responsible for operational implementation of the
CR strategy. They collaborate intensively within the international CR
Manager Network where they coordinate their activities and share best
practices.

Integrated HSE management system
We want to make sustainability a component of all our business processes and of our employees’ everyday lives. Our health, safety and
environment (HSE) management system helps us make this possible.
The system is based on the international standards OHSAS 18001
for occupational health and safety and ISO 14001 for environmental
management. Around 72 percent of our employees across the Group
are currently employed at an ISO14001-certified company (as of February 2015). Around two-thirds of our employees outside Germany work
at an OHSAS18001-certified company. Through our compliance with
legal regulations, we meet the essential requirements for OHSAS18001
certification in Germany. In order to get as many employees as possible
involved in our HSE management activities, our goal is to have all of our
companies located outside of Germany with more than 50 employees
certified in compliance with both standards by the end of 2015.
CR controlling and integrated reporting
Deutsche Telekom’s CR controlling system plays a key role when it
comes to steering our CR activities. It has been supported by an ITbased data collection system for the past five years. The system guarantees transparent reporting on ESG (environmental, social, and governance) data and KPIs. It supports standardized, mandatory processes at
the Group and national level and enables Group-wide benchmarks. This
IT support gives us additional capacities to conduct extensive analyses
of ESG data. For example, it makes it easier for us to assess whether we
have achieved our CR targets. Ten additional T-Systems international
subsidiaries collected ESG data for the first time during the reporting
period. The first step for them was to report on the energy data relevant
for the climate protection target. The entities covered by the Energy
Consumption and CO2 Emissions ESG KPIs represent 99 percent of
the Group’s net revenue.
We use the data to calculate our ESG KPIs, which we then use to measure our CR performance throughout the Group. In 2014, we reviewed
the KPIs in terms of their suitability for managing and reporting our CR
activities and adjusted them where necessary. As part of the review, we
also worked on preparations for introducing new KPIs. In order to
improve the significance of the Energy Consumption ESG KPI, we are
planning to map our energy consumption in relation to the average
consumption per product group ("customer equivalent"). We are also
planning to introduce three new KPIs to gauge the effectiveness of our
social commitment activities. These are scheduled to be included in our
reporting processes as of 2015 and will reflect our efforts, the activities
we support, and their results.

Reporting on ESG KPIs outside the CR report
We also use the Energy Consumption and CO2 Emissions ESG KPIs as
important performance indicators in our internal reports. These KPIs are
included in two reports addressed to the entire Board of Management.
Once every quarter, relevant CR information is included in the DT Group
HR Management Report using these two KPIs. As of 2015, we will also
be using an annual climate protection report and a controlling report,
which will be issued several times a year, to inform the Group Board of
Management of our progress in achieving our climate protection target.
We have also integrated ESG KPIs into our Annual Report within the
scope of gradually combining our financial and CR reporting processes.
Further information on this can be found in the Finance section.

Investors interested in sustainability often prefer to focus on long-term
yields instead of short-term profits because companies who rely on
sustainable business practices tend to be more competitive in the long
term. That makes their investment (socially responsible investment, SRI)
an important component when it comes to securing capital for
Deutsche Telekom AG in the long term.
SRI investment products generally consist of securities from companies
that have been declared compliant with ESG (environmental, social and
governance) criteria. The trend in demand for T-shares in this category
therefore serves as an indicator helping us assess our sustainability
performance. We use our Socially Responsible Investment ESG KPI to
analyze how the financial markets perceive our CR activities.
Investors concerned with sustainability often refer to ratings published
by specialized SRI analysts. That gives these ratings influence on our
company’s reputation in the finance industry. This is why the rating
given to our company by SRI analysts plays a role in determining
whether or not we will be able to win over and retain long-term investors
and achieve our goal of keeping our company’s medium and long-term
cost of capital at a low level.
We use different formats – both in our reporting as well as in direct
dialog – to inform SRI analysts and investors of our CR activities.
Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) ESG KPI
Following last year’s KPI review we decided to keep our Socially
Responsible Investment ESGKPI in its current form. At the end of 2014,
around 21 percent of T-Shares were owned by investors who consider
SRI criteria in their investment decisions at least to some extent. Two
percent of T-Shares were held by investors who give priority to SRI
aspects when managing their funds. Increasingly, our efforts toward
more sustainability and social commitment therefore pay off in terms
of reputation.
Investor communication expanded
We have been publishing relevant Deutsche Telekom ESG KPIs in our
Annual Report for several years now, also providing forecasts regarding
their future development. Financial market players interested in sustainability can also review ESG information in the Socially Responsible
Investment (SRI) section of our investor relations portal. Interested
parties can also find additional information on these topics in the SRI
facts info box provided as a supplement to this CR report.
In addition to our reporting activities, we also engage in targeted dialog
with investors. Our CR and Investor Relations (IR) units, for example,
conduct joint SRI roadshows on the topic. The first SRI webinar was

also hosted during the reporting period with the participation of several
major financial institutions. We also responded to numerous direct
requests for information made by analysts and investors, covering the
entire spectrum of ESG criteria, from climate protection and human
rights to data privacy and diversity.
Current position in rankings and ratings
More and more investors are looking at our company’s sustainability
performance when deciding whether or not to invest. Deutsche
Telekom’s ESG (environmental, social, and governance) performance
is assessed in CR ratings, which offer investors a reliable basis for their
investment decisions. As in previous years, the T-Share was once again
listed in important sustainability ratings in 2014. Rating agency oekom
singled us out as the world’s best telecommunications company in
terms of ecological and social performance. Deutsche Telekom was
again rated among the top ten in the SAM rating and, as a result, was
awarded the Bronze Award in the SAM Yearbook. We have also been
listed in the STOXX Global ESG Leaders Index for four years and in the
UN Global Compact 100 Index and the Climate Disclosure Leadership
Index for two years. The FTSE4Good Index again listed our share in the
reporting period. You will find an overview of these ratings in the section
on KPIs.
Integrated reporting
CR is becoming increasingly important to our core business. This can
be seen in the internationally emerging trend toward intensified integration of financial and non-financial reporting. More and more companies
are including sustainability aspects that are highly significant to the
company’s value creation, such as environmental protection, employee
interests, and sustainable products, in their traditional management
reports. Deutsche Telekom welcomes this development. Integrating this
information encourages people from various Group functions to discuss
CR topics and paints a more consistent picture of our company’s financial and non-financial performance.
Responsibility is an integral component of our business activities, which
is why we report on the responsibility we assume in different sections of
our Annual Report and make reference to how sustainability contributes
to value creation in our corporate processes. We have been reporting
on our ESGKPIs in our Annual Report since 2011. Since 2013, we have
also included a qualitative trend forecast for the two upcoming financial
years for our Energy Consumption, CO2 Emissions, and Sustainable
Procurement ESG KPIs. As a result, we were in a position to compare
trend forecast and actual developments in our KPIs for the first time in
our 2014 Annual Report and in this year’s CR Report. You can find
more information in the section on ESGKPIs.

By integrating financial and non-financial content, we intend to meet
the requirements of SRI investors on the one hand and more effectively
incorporate cross-functional issues, such as ESG aspects, in different
areas of the Group on the other. We held a cross-department workshop
on integrated reporting in November 2014 to intensify the link between
CR and annual reporting activities.
Tax policy guidelines
The Group Tax department is responsible for ensuring that the
Deutsche Telekom AG Group pays taxes and duties at national and
international level in accordance with the applicable statutory provisions. This involves maximizing the scope available for optimizing taxes
on the one hand, and fulfilling the social and community responsibility
of a multinational company on the other. Group Tax makes sure that
the Deutsche Telekom Group complies with all its tax obligations in
Germany and abroad, in particular that it pays the taxes in accordance
with the local laws and regulations applicable to the individual Group
entities. This includes the Group’s income taxes, which must also be
regularly reported in our IFRS financial statements, as well as VAT and
income tax payable within the context of customer transactions and for
Group employees. Group Tax also ensures that the corporation has an
efficient tax structure within the framework of German and foreign tax
law as applicable in each country, i.e., that the Group does not carry
any unnecessary tax burden. The goal is to achieve sustainable tax
efficiency for the corporation, something in which transparent, reliable
cooperation with local tax authorities is deemed to be indispensable.
In addition, Group Tax also has the ambition to contribute as much as
possible to the success of Deutsche Telekom’s operations, e.g., by
providing detailed tax advice regarding new business models or innovative technological developments. In such matters, the department is
particularly focused on immediately clarifying any unresolved tax lawrelated issues as well as providing practical solutions to meeting all
applicable tax requirements.

Strategy & management
Stakeholder involvement

Stakeholder involvement

Companies are constantly balancing the expectations of a variety of
stakeholders when managing their business. That is why a company’s
success depends on recognizing the interests and demands of its stakeholders and meeting and addressing these whenever possible and reasonable. One basic expectation stakeholders have is that the company
keeps them informed of how it is meeting their demands. Deutsche
Telekom goes even further by actively surveying its stakeholders and
involving them in its management processes.
Precise knowledge of our stakeholders’ interests and views is a basic
prerequisite. We use tried-and-true market research tools to conduct
systematic stakeholder surveys to learn more about these interests and
views. It is Deutsche Telekom’s conviction that sharing information with
its stakeholders promotes the company’s innovation processes. It helps
us solidify existing alliances, evaluate collaboration options, and enter
into new partnerships. This is particularly important in terms of our
sustainability targets, which we can only achieve in collaboration with
partners from the worlds of politics, society, science and research, and
industry.
Management approach
We take the interests of our stakeholders seriously and work to effectively involve them in our business activities. In 2011 we developed our
stakeholder involvement strategy to assist in this process. The strategy is
based on the AA1000 standard, an internationally recognized guideline
for evaluating sustainability management and CR reporting. We
reviewed and in part redesigned our strategy in 2013.
During the reporting period we used different and, in some cases, new
formats to implement our strategy. One of these formats is publication
of the We Care app magazine. We also introduced an internal CR newsletter that provides our employees and managers with information
roughly every two months on CR activities within the Group.
The Figure of the Week is another new format we introduced in 2014.
We use it as a concise way to keep Deutsche Telekom employees and
visitors up-to-date on sustainability topics. Each week we use a figure
to highlight an aspect of our activities. This information is presented on
our intranet and on a display in the foyer at our Headquarters in Bonn.
In order to ensure that our CR activities are structured effectively, we
regularly assess how our stakeholders perceive and rate these activities.
We take a multifaceted approach here:
 Within the scope of our materiality process, we systematically ask
our stakeholders about their expectations when it comes to successful dialog. This tells us how we can most effectively include them in
our management processes through our dialog efforts.

 We use CR topic monitoring activities developed for us by an
independent research institute to identify and analyze what our
stakeholders currently feel are the most important topics. This
helps us continue to develop our expertise in current CR-relevant
discourse and support our stakeholders as well-informed dialog
partners in addressing issues that are relevant to the community.
 We ask our stakeholders to weight our focal points in the context of
our CR action areas using a phased materiality process. We also
ask to them to tell us how well our sustainability messages fit their
perception of the Deutsche Telekom Group and thus evaluate our
communication efforts.
Implementing our stakeholder involvement strategy
We provide our employees with six stakeholder involvement principles
to help integrate stakeholder involvement into our corporate culture. We
also organize internal network meetings with the CR managers at the
international subsidiaries and with employees from other departments.
At these meetings, we talk about our experiences in working with stakeholders, share best practice cases and work together to come up with
joint activities.
"Good to know" – internal CR newsletter launched
We also introduced an internal CR newsletter in 2014 under the title
"Good to know" to provide information on new and key developments.
Published every two months in German and English, it is distributed
internationally to members of the Board of Management, managers,
and interested employees. Close collaboration between CR and our
core business is a key focal point. In the first two issues, we featured
the following topics: leveraging business potential with CR, Scope 3
emissions, sustainable supply chain and socially responsible investment. The newsletter already has 500 subscribers since publication
of its first issue.
We Care: New app magazine covering CR topics
We created the new We Care app magazine in 2014. The first magazine
issue focused on “Change”. The second issue will cover “Confidentiality”, explaining the pitfalls in the digital world and showing how exposed
users are to these risks.The magazine, which features entertaining
content such as "Why cows are sending text messages and how life will
be smarter in the future," is scheduled for regular publication. Another
new feature is a quiz that lets readers test their knowledge and compete
against their friends. The app magazine shows how Deutsche Telekom
lives its social commitment and provides succinct information on important sustainability topics. Readers will also find all kinds of tips and
tricks to help them act more responsibly. The We Care app magazine is
available for free at the App Store for all Android and iOS smartphones
and tablet PCs. In March 2015, our app magazine was downloaded
around 38,000 times.

precise knowledge of our stakeholders’ interests and views is a basic

Management approach
To be able to focus our CR activities effectively, it is important to
determine how these are perceived and assessed by our stakeholders.
That is why we engage in comprehensive CR topic monitoring and use
market research methods to regularly compare our CR activities and
dialog processes with our stakeholders’ expectations.
Meeting dialog expectations strategically
When developing our stakeholder involvement strategy, we asked our
stakeholders what they expect from their dialog with us in order to help
us more effectively meet their expectations. The result:

Information on how the results are being implemented

Based on our stakeholder involvement principles, we put these stakeholder expectations into practice to a large extent. Our principles are
based on the basic idea that stakeholder relationships call for a dialog
on an equal footing.
CR market research
In addition to engaging in open dialog with our stakeholders, we also
use market research tools to learn about stakeholders’ expectations.
Since 2013 we have included indicators on Deutsche Telekom’s CR
performance in terms of our social commitment and the supply chain
in our Group CRQI (corporate reputation quality indicator) survey.
The results of this survey help form the basis for our Social Commitment
ESG KPI. It determines the public perception of Deutsche Telekom’s
CR activities as a ratio of the general perception of how important it
is for companies to get involved in social issues. Although our performance was rated just as high in 2014 as it was in 2013, the topic
continues to lose its importance for the general public. The value of
our Social Commitment ESGKPI increased again in 2014 as a result.
We began revising our Social Commitment ESGKPI within the scope
of the KPI review we conducted during the reporting period to help
us more effectively assess the success of our activities.
For the sake of comparability, we will continue to collect data for and
report on the previous version of the Social Commitment ESG KPI.
In addition our KPIs, our analysis of the market research results showed
that the following topics are important to Deutsche Telekom stakeholders: involvement in the community and education, access for all generations, employee-friendly working conditions, responsible conduct, customer orientation, and data privacy. The survey results give us valuable
information that helps us structure our CR activities in accordance with
topics that are important to stakeholders and helps us further develop
our CR communication and CR controlling.

Results of the materiality process

Results of the materiality process
The purpose of our multi-phase materiality process is to identify topics
that are relevant to our sustainability management practices. During the
last reporting period, we held an internal workshop and conducted a
two-week, external survey (previous year’s CR report). We have further
refined the process since then.
Materiality process 2014/2015
The first step was to take stock of the most important topics for us and
our stakeholders. This was based on the materiality results from the
previous years. We included the following sources in our analysis in
order to complete this list and incorporate the concerns of stakeholder
groups whose participation in our survey has been limited:
 Our own NGO radar (to include civic organizations)
 Questionnaires from companies such as RobecoSAM and
Sustainalytics (to more effectively include analysts)
 The materiality analysis conducted by the Global e-Sustainability
Initiative (GeSI) in 2014. This materiality analysis, which was conducted for the entire IT industry, is based on expert interviews with
stakeholders and online surveys of GeSI members. It provides
guidance for the entire ICT industry.
We also weighted the topics internally. To do this, we looked at the
results of an internal, cross-departmental materiality workshop conducted in 2013 and statements made by topic owners at our Group
in 2014 on topics such as human rights, the supply chain and energy
and emissions. The purpose of the interviews conducted with these
experts was to further accentuate the materiality analysis from Deutsche
Telekom’s perspective and consolidate the list of topics. Reporting
boundaries for the different topics were also included in the discussion
for the first time. This is particularly important due to changing stakeholder expectations as companies are increasingly being expected to
assume responsibility beyond the scope of their own structures.
We then compared the consolidated topics with the GRI aspects. Since
December 2014, we have also been offering our stakeholders the
chance to participate in an online survey on our homepage for an
unlimited period of time. This gives them the opportunity to give us feedback at any time and helps us identify changing expectations at an early
stage.

Results of the stakeholder survey
We changed the structure of this year’s stakeholder survey. Instead
of sending out standardized questionnaires to all of our stakeholder
groups, we decided to let participants decide for themselves which
topics they wished to address. The survey also includes numerous
opportunities to add comments. Group-specific, open questions invited
stakeholders to contribute their own thoughts and suggestions.
By the end of March 2015, 233 people had taken the survey, in particular Deutsche Telekom customers (102) and employees (70). Investors
(13), potential employees (13), analysts (5), NGO and business representatives (4 each), employee representatives and suppliers (3 each),
media and research (2 each) as well as political representatives (1) also
took the survey. An additional nine participants could not be classified
into any of these groups.
When asked in which areas they felt Deutsche Telekom should be particularly active, most participants voted for network expansion, customer
satisfaction, data privacy, human rights and climate and environment.
Weighting within these topic areas showed a focus on our sections
"Customers," "Networks" and "Strategy and management."
The results confirm our original findings. On average, participants gave
the suggested topics the same ratings we saw in the stock-taking phase,
with only a few exceptions. "Employee data privacy" and "investment
volume for network expansion," for example, were rated as "somewhat
relevant" instead of "less relevant." You will find all of the survey results
in the diagrams below. We consider topics that we and our stakeholders
rate as "somewhat relevant" or "very relevant" to be material. We regularly analyze this ongoing feedback and incorporate the results into our
sustainability management practices.
More participants, more donations
We want to encourage our stakeholders to get involved with our online
survey, which we have made available for an unlimited period of time.
As an additional incentive, we donate 3 euros to the "Yes, I can!" initiative for every person who participates. We had donated 699 euros by
March 2015.
Ten topics of great relevance identified
We used the results of our multi-phase materiality process to identify ten
topics with particular strategic relevance over all chapters. Our reporting
on these topics received external assurance, indicated by a check mark
in the report. Of great relevance are:

the type and extent of our stakeholder involvement is based on the
results of a case-related relevance analysis. the more relevant a stakeholder group is to the topic or project concerned, the more intensive
stakeholder involvement will be. depending on the intensity, we make a
distinction between three types of involvement: information, dialog, and
participation.

Political advocacy

Political advocacy

The political sector and regulatory authorities influence the development and availability of the network infrastructure, technologies and services. Not only does this directly impact the competitiveness of telecommunications companies, it also impacts business in general, which
relies on having a fast network infrastructure as well as state-of-the-art
telecommunications services. In addition to economic factors, networks
and services are of considerable importance for maintaining a sense of
community in society. That is why we engage in active, ongoing dialog
with interested stakeholders from politics and the general public.
Many governments, parliaments, authorities and non-governmental
organizations worldwide consider Deutsche Telekom to be a valued
dialog partner when it comes to ICT and innovation. As a company
seated in Germany, we are in particularly high demand with institutions
located in Germany. We have also set up offices in Brussels to ensure
constant dialog with the institutions of the European Union as well as
associations and other community organizations. We engage in active
dialog with similar institutions in countries in which Deutsche Telekom
is active, particularly in the European markets and in the United States.
Lobbying instruments
Our partners from parliaments, governments, and non-profit organizations need to uphold their independence and integrity. This principle
is codified in Deutsche Telekom’s Guiding Principles. For example, they
prohibit donations to political institutions in Germany as well as nontransparent attempts to exercise influence. Instead, these guidelines
recommend basing our political communication on facts, expertise,
credibility, and integrity. In the interest of credibility, Deutsche Telekom
is also registered in the public Transparency Register for lobbyists in
Brussels, where all required information is documented. This is the
basis for recipients to experience information provided by Deutsche
Telekom as authentic and trustworthy, so that it can be assimilated in
opinion-building processes in the political arena and society.
Deutsche Telekom’ lobbying activities are based on ethical principles
and legal regulations. Every Group employee is required to comply
with Group policies. These policies form the basis for open, transparent
lobbying that is in compliance with the law. These regulations also apply
to the representation of our interests within the scope of collaboration in
associations and any relevant committees.
Investment incentive needed for broadband networks
Fast broadband networks have become a central infrastructure feature
as well as a factor for site selection and success in all business sectors.
Germany needs a high-performance, reliable and secure broadband
infrastructure, ideally with nationwide coverage. Deutsche Telekom has
been making considerable contributions for years by investing heavily in
the infrastructure for fixed-network and mobile Internet. For years the

company has been investing billions of euros in broadband in Germany
and has been more involved than any other company in closing gaps in
broadband coverage, particularly in rural areas.
Building out nation-wide, next-generation access networks (NGA)
requires joint efforts of politics and business. In view of the ambitious
broadband goals at both the national and European level, the main
purpose of telecommunications and regulatory policies needs to be
improving planning reliability and, in particular, the financial power
of companies willing to invest in the market as well as maximizing the
potential for economically viable network build-out by the private sector
using all technologies available. In areas where broadband roll-out is
not economically feasible, it is up to the public sector to develop technology and provider-independent development programs to help
finance these efforts. Forward-thinking regulatory policies need to
actively support investment in modern broadband networks and prevent
unnecessary financial burdens and red tape for the network operators
investing in networks. The successful liberalization of the telecommunications market has created self-sustaining, functional infrastructure
competition in Germany. We need to continue to strengthen the investment capacity and competitiveness of the German and European telecommunications industries in response to global competition.
As the result of many years of regulatory policy that has focused
exclusively on price reduction, the industry is lacking the funds needed
to realize the investment being demanded by the political sphere.
Regulated charges need to reflect cost and price trends and create
effective incentives to invest in new networks. Regulated companies
need price flexibility, particularly for NGA networks that are set up under
competitive conditions. This is the only way to guarantee competitiveness and full capacity utilization and, therefore, economic efficiency.
Updating regulatory policies continues to be an important task. In view
of the fact that the competitive landscape, the technologies and
demand are all highly dynamic, market regulation needs to be reviewed,
modified and, in some cases, reduced. Regulatory intervention need to
be based on proven market failure to keep them from unnecessarily limiting innovative rate plans and products. Open access needs to be
embraced as a basic principle so that competition and the ability to
choose are guaranteed for consumers in connection with all network
build-out projects.
Regulatory policy needs to be rebalanced along the entire digital value
chain. In view of the fact that the Internet and telecommunications
market are converging rapidly and in light of the growing market power
of a few global Internet players, sector-specific regulation of telecommunications is creating more and more of an imbalance. The same laws
and regulations that apply to telecommunications companies also need

Deutsche Telekom - Corporate Responsibility Report 2014

Strategy & management
Stakeholder involvement
Political advocacy

to apply to Internet companies providing the same services. The objective here needs to be creating equal competitive conditions and
enabling fair distribution of the financial burden involved in broadband
roll-out. It is also high time that the European legal framework for
telecommunications, which has been in place since 2002, be revised
in detail to address the pressing issues that the sector currently faces.
Protecting the open Internet
The topic of net neutrality continues to draw political attention. EU
Commissioner Neelie Kroes, who is responsible for the European ICT
sector, presented a draft regulation to harmonize the legal framework
to the EU Parliament in September 2013. This "EU telecoms package/
digital single market package" also aims to harmonize regulation on net
neutrality throughout the EU. Rules on traffic management, transparency and allowing or prohibiting online commercial product and service
differentiation are planned.
Deutsche Telekom remains committed to preserving an open Internet.
Content and services will continue to be available online in accordance
with the best effort principle, meaning they will be available to the extent
permitted by the available resources. Deutsche Telekom will continue to
expand and optimize its infrastructure so that we are able to cope with
rapidly increasing amounts of data traffic and constantly upgrade our
network. This is the only way for us to meet our customers’ increasing
demands and live up to the requirements of online content and application providers who also want to provide their services in high quality in
the future. However, telecommunication networks cannot be operated
without an effective network management system.
That is why Deutsche Telekom is developing business models based on
the "best effort" Internet principle that online businesses can use to offer
innovative services that pose specific demands on transmission quality
and quality of service. This will include managing the rapidly growing
volumes of different types of data streams in the net. Content will in no
way be controlled. Deutsche Telekom supports the freedom of the Internet and does not influence user or provider content in any way.
Deutsche Telekom will continue to take a non-discriminatory approach
to marketing services with different quality-of-service levels in competition with other network operators. This gives consumers greater choice
and guarantees a high quality level.

 Maintaining consumer data privacy, for example in the online advertising business,

 Improving comprehensive, cross-technology protection of young
people at national and EU levels, in particular by continuing to
advance a comprehensive, Group-wide minimum standard within
the EU and continuing to engage in dialog with organizations
involved in the protection of minors both nationally and at EU level,
 Improving customer service standards and customer protection in
the telecommunications sector, for example when switching providers for fixed-network and mobile services, and
 Encouraging improved transparency toward our customers and in
collaboration with the entire industry.
Deutsche Telekom once again made progress in 2014 in regard to
switching fixed-network providers - both internally as well as in collaboration with other telecommunications providers in Germany. The goal is
to make it easier for both fixed-network and mobile consumers to switch
providers without any service interruptions. In all these areas, Deutsche
Telekom stands for a constructive and solution-oriented approach
that is geared to both the consumers’ interests and the interests of our
company.
In order to provide better transparency to customers, Deutsche Telekom
took the initiative in 2014 and revised its rates in Germany (see the new
Magenta1 portfolio). Deutsche Telekom thus took an important step in
improving transparency and simplifying its products and communication, giving customers a clearer picture of what they can expect from
their fixed-network and mobile rate plans.

Consumer dialog
One of Deutsche Telekom’s aims is to become the most highly regarded
service company in the industry. That is why we again gave high priority
to consumer-related topics in 2014. We further strengthened internal
functions dealing with consumer relations in order to improve exchange
between Deutsche Telekom’s product and service development areas
and our external stakeholders from politics and civil society.
Central topics in legislation and in stakeholder dialog as well as efforts
to create voluntary regulations for the industry beyond legal provisions
included:

Compliance

Deutsche Telekom’s business is based on the principles of integrity
and respect. Compliance, which is understood as the lawfulness of
corporate activities, therefore plays a significant role in the Group’s
business activities.
Management approach
Deutsche Telekom has clearly expressed its commitment to complying
with ethical principles and current legal standards. This commitment
has been incorporated in our Guiding Principles and Code of Conduct.
Deutsche Telekom has been practicing comprehensive compliance
management since 2005 to make sure conduct throughout the Group is
ethical and complies with legal provisions. All compliance management
activities are in line with legal regulations and with Deutsche Telekom’s
Privacy Code of Conduct, a policy on handling personal data within the
Deutsche Telekom Group.

tackle these challenges are extremely varied. Depending on the business model, size, and risk situation, these companies need different
compliance management solutions.
That is why we have created a toolkit for maturity-based compliance. The
purpose of the toolkit is to define compliance management system
requirements at the different Group companies, taking their economic
development, business strategies, and risks into account. We classified
the companies based on their current life cycle phase (from start-up to
market leader) and their specific compliance risks in a matrix. In addition,
we defined five clusters along with minimum standards for each aspect
of the compliance management system. For example, we determined
which compliance policies need to be implemented by our subsidiaries,
how often the subsidiaries need to participate in the compliance risk
assessment, and how often they need to submit a compliance report.

Responsibility for the compliance management system lies with the top
management level at Deutsche Telekom in the Board department for
Data Privacy, Legal Affairs and Compliance. The compliance organization is comprised of the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) as well as
central and local compliance units. The compliance organization helps
employees live compliance every day at work. A policy database makes it
easy for employees to access policies quickly. Employees of Group companies can use the database to get an overview of which policies apply
at their company. The compliance organization also helps policy publishers implement policies throughout the Group and document as defined
by the process. We regularly conduct general compliance and extensive
anti-corruption trainings, which the majority of our employees attend.

In 2013 and 2014 we grouped our subsidiaries based on the concept
and assessed to what extent their current compliance management systems met our expectations. One area we assessed was whether a company was doing too much or too little with regard to individual compliance activities. We used these findings to more effectively structure how
we use our resources. The concept was also used in developing compliance activities at newly acquired or newly founded subsidiaries.

Deutsche Telekom conducts wide-scale measures to raise employee
awareness of compliance issues. Managers also act as facilitators and
discuss the topic with their employees. We thoroughly analyze their
feedback and use it to come up with different measures including
expanded compliance training offers tailored to the information needs
of our employees as well as accompanying communication initiatives.

 Establishing a compliance organization in all major Group units

Deutsche Telekom has set up two online portals called Ask me! and Tell
me! for questions and tips on the topic of compliance. Employees can
find reliable information on laws, internal policies and codes of conduct
relevant to their daily activities on the Ask me! portal. The Tell me! portal
helps clear up cases involving violations of statutory or internal regulations. Both employees and external parties such as business partners
and customers can notify us of any violations by e-mail, phone or fax.
Maturity-based compliance implemented
The ICT industry is characterized by dynamic change. Companies need
to constantly update their core business, tap into potential in growth
markets, realize innovative business ideas, and open up new business
fields. As a result, Deutsche Telekom Group companies that have to

Compliance management certification
The compliance management system helps guarantee compliance, i.e.,
the lawfulness of our corporate activities. Key system components
include:

 Risk-based derivation of a compliance program and its consistent
implementation through policies, training, consulting offers, and
communication measures
 Compliance controls and compliance due diligence (analyzing
compliance risks involved in acquisitions)
 Making sure that the company responds appropriately to violations
In addition to the eight Deutsche Telekom companies in Germany that
have already been certified, we also had auditors evaluate compliance
management systems at international subsidiaries. In 2013, 13 international subsidiaries were certified in compliance with the IDW 980 auditing standard with another two followed suit in 2014. The audits focused
heavily on anti-corruption. This certification is proof that the certified
compliance management systems used by the companies listed below
is effective when it comes to identifying corruption risks and preventing
violations.

International collaboration on compliance
Different legal practices and cultural values in the countries where
Deutsche Telekom is active represent a significant compliance challenge. The increasingly dynamic development of global ICT markets
and intensified international competition also influence Deutsche
Telekom’s compliance strategy.
In line with the Group’s international structure, strategic issues are discussed with an international compliance advisory team and a shared
compliance approach is defined. The team is a trend-setter of sorts, as
it provides an impetus for designing and implementing balanced
compliance structures at the Deutsche Telekom Group.
We have also been promoting Group-wide compliance collaboration
for years through meetings of the representatives of all compliance
organizations from our international subsidiaries. The International
Compliance Days celebrated their tenth anniversary in 2014. More than
100 people responsible for compliance from 27 countries met at
Magyar Telekom in Budapest on April 2 and 3, 2014. Under the slogan,
"Compliance today and tomorrow," they discussed compliance strategies and trends as well as new approaches to collaboration.
Preventing and fighting corruption
All Group units regularly audited for risk of corruption
We take a wide spectrum of internal measures to prevent and fight
corruption. The compliance risk assessment forms the foundation of our
compliance management system. The assessment helps us identify and
evaluate compliance risks and develop appropriate prevention measures. Deutsche Telekom created a tool-based process that has to be
applied every year throughout the Group. For the process, we assigned

50

responsibilities and defined straightforward assessment criteria that are
clearly documented. Companies are selected to participate in the compliance risk assessment process based on the maturity-based model
described above. 81 companies participated in 2014 and a total of 94
Group companies undergo the process at least every two years.
The Deutsche Telekom Compliance department has introduced a
Group risk map that takes an extensive, systematic approach and
illustrates risks that could be significant to our company. This risk map
is extensive and enables globally active companies to conduct systematic risk analyses of their business models. It currently covers 30 risk
categories. Each subsidiary can add additional categories specific to
their business needs.
This involves defining which specific threat each risk poses to the subsidiary and stating which measures have already been implemented to
mitigate this risk. If necessary, additional measures are developed to
reduce the risks to a manageable level, as defined by the risk strategy.
Responsibility for the compliance risk assessment lies with the respective Group company. Our central compliance organization provides
support and advice in these matters.
They inform the subsidiary’s management of the results of the compliance risk assessment. These results are used in the subsequent year’s
compliance program, which includes defined measures and responsibilities. The local management has to adopt a documented resolution to
approve program. The compliance program measures are monitored
closely.
Investigation based on clear criteria
Deutsche Telekom has specified clear criteria for investigating suspected cases of corruption. The company only starts investigations if
a violation of legal or internal regulations is reported with a sufficient
degree of detail. We thoroughly investigate any tips that meet these
requirements. Any violations we uncover during our investigation are
sanctioned appropriately— measures may include the termination of
employment relationships and asserting claims for damages. Any weaknesses identified in the internal control system during the investigation
are systematically analyzed and remedied.
International recognition for transparency
Deutsche Telekom is a global leader in transparency. This was confirmed in a study conducted by Transparency International. We came in
seventh place among the 124 largest corporations worldwide covered
by the study and even landed first place in a Germany-wide comparison.
The study was based on company information available to the public
regarding the scope of company anti-corruption programs, disclosing
economic ties, and disclosing financial expenses and income in specific countries.
Major ongoing litigation
Deutsche Telekom is party to several proceedings both in and out of
court with government agencies, competitors, and other parties. The
proceedings mentioned in the 2014 Annual Report are of particular
importance from Deutsche Telekom’s point of view.

Human rights

Human rights

As an international player, the Deutsche Telekom Group assigns high
priority to human rights compliance, especially since the ICT sector is
frequently criticized for deficiencies in its supply chain. That is why we
have established comprehensive social standards at Deutsche Telekom
and implement these using appropriate methods. We attach particular
importance to granting the right to collective agreements and supporting diversity and equal opportunities. We expressly require our suppliersto also assume responsibility as a way of making sure human rights are
also protected outside of our Group.
Management approach
Deutsche Telekom has made an express commitment to the UN Guiding
Principles on Business and Human Rights published by the United
Nations Human Rights Council in 2011. These principles require businesses to systematically identify the impact their operations have on
human rights, and to prevent, neutralize or compensate these where
necessary. In order to meet these requirements, we have developed an
extensive program to implement the guiding principles and introduced
an ongoing process comprised of several interconnected measures and
tools as illustrated in the graphic below.

We have incorporated this obligation to respect human rights in
Deutsche Telekom’s fundamental policies, our Guiding Principles, the
Code of Conduct and the Social Charter. The Employee Relations Policy
and our Diversity Policy also play a key role for the respect for human
rights.
Tools for assessing the possible impact on human rights
During the reporting period we conducted our first extensive human
rights impact assessment with stakeholder consultations at one of our

international subsidiaries in order to assess our human rights activities
and the possible impact on human rights within a country. We also continued the process launched in 2013 to integrate human rights issues
into the typical company valuations conducted in the context of mergers
and acquisitions. To implement our Group Policy on Employee Relations, we also conduct special assessment processes to assess
employer-employee relationships.
Revised Social Charter applies worldwide
Our Social Charter is applicable at all Deutsche Telekom Group units
worldwide. The Social Charter is our way of implementing the recommendations contained in the UN Guiding Principles and we have
expressly committed ourselves to respecting human rights throughout
the Group and requiring our suppliers to do the same. During the 2013
revision, we created a central point of contact at Group level for human
rights issues.
The Social Charter comprises two tools that we use to assess compliance with our policies. Every year we draw up a central Social Performance Report with the participation of all 111 fully consolidated
Deutsche Telekom subsidiaries. This report did not record any violations
of our Social Charter during the period from October 2013 to September 2014. We have also been offering a central point of contact for
human rights issues since 2013. Eleven reports regarding human rights
issues were submitted to it in 2014. One communication channel used
for this purpose was a special e-mail address: humanrights@telekom.
de. Others used our anonymous whistleblower system which allows
them to submit their information anonymously. The information we
received involved cases of discrimination and alleged violations of labor
standards and the right to freedom of expression. After careful investigation, some of the reports did not prove to be justified. We introduced
countermeasures in one case to remedy the situation. The information
we receive is always treated as confidential and with respect.
Communicating the Social Charter
We hosted different dialog events in 2014 to communicate the contents
of our Social Charter to our employees and suppliers. Through direct
dialog with our contacts at our international subsidiaries, we discussed
the results of the amendments we made to our Social Charter and
talked about current human rights topics.
We used our sixth Sustainable Procurement Dialogue Day on March 26,
2014, in Bonn to get our suppliers more involved in our human rights
efforts. One of the three working groups at the event focused on
Deutsche Telekom’s human rights due diligence in its supply chain.
You can find more information and details on the event in the section
on Suppliers.

Comprehensive human rights impact assessment
finalized
In 2014, we pursued a country-specific approach in assessing the
impact of our business activities on human rights. With the help of a
specialized consulting firm, we conducted a human rights impact
assessment at a T-Systems subsidiary. The assessment featured various
stakeholder consultations including dialog with suppliers and a government representative as well as interviews with rights-holders. The impact
assessment is based on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and
Human Rights and assesses at a national level the impact of business
activities on human rights within and outside of the Group. The objective is to pinpoint the opportunities and risks involved in our business
activities, identify people potentially affected by these, develop measures and introduce an ongoing improvement process.
Training on human rights
We offered targeted training and conducted campaigns to raise awareness during the reporting period to implement the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Human rights webinars were held
for Human Resources, Risk Assessment and Procurement units to focus
on their specific issues. We also engaged in dialog at different units,
including Data Privacy, to raise awareness for these issues and asked
those responsible to rate their own performance in terms of human
rights.
The implementation of the UN Guiding Principles also requires us to
assume responsibility for the supply chain. That is why we created training materials on our Social Charter and the human rights principles it
entails and integrated these materials as a module in our e-learning tool
for suppliers in Germany during the reporting period.
Cross-industry collaboration
Deutsche Telekom has been participating in the German Global Compact Network’s business and human rights peer learning group to
analyze and improve related management skills since 2013. Members
keep each other up-to-date regarding the latest developments and
design measures for engaging in human rights due diligence. In 2014
we collaborated on the creation of training materials and conducted
case studies on human rights violations. We also shared ideas and
experiences with the UN working group on business and human rights.
In addition to the peer learning group, we also participate in other working groups that address the topic of human rights. Platforms include the
ecosense Forum for Sustainable Development of German Business,
which is hosted by Deutsche Wirtschaft e.V., the Global eSustainability
Initiative (GeSI) a working group run by the Global Industrial Relations
Network, and the Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC).

Risk and opportunity management

53

Risk and opportunity management

For us, comprehensive risk and opportunity management also includes
considering the risks and opportunities of corporate responsibility (CR).
As part of our CR management, we pursue a strategy in which different
stakeholder groups are systematically involved in identifying current
and potential risks and opportunities. To this end, we participate in a
number of committees and initiatives. Continuous monitoring of CR
topics enables us to systematically identify stakeholder positions on
relevant sustainability issues. To this end, we use, for example, our NGO
Radar, which summarizes the activities, research projects, publications
and opinions of relevant non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and
assesses them for Deutsche Telekom. In addition, we ask our stakeholders on an annual basis as part of our CR reporting which sustainability
issues are important to them.
Climate protection
At present, we do not see any severe risks to the achievement of our
climate protection targets within our reference period. Deutsche Telekom
sees climate protection above all as an opportunity. ICT products and
services have the potential to save seven times as many CO2 emissions
in other industries as the ICT industry emits itself (SMARTer2020 study).
Examples of resulting external opportunities include changed customer
expectations, political measures to implement the energy revolution, the
growing consideration of sustainable criteria in tenders and in procurement, as well as the interest of sustainable investors (socially-responsible
investing – SRI). The Carbon Disclosure Project, for example, advises
767 institutional investors (approx. USD 92 trillion) on selecting investments in climate-friendly assets. Opportunities that Deutsche Telekom
can develop itself are the continuous reduction in its own electricity,
as well as a reduction in carbon emissions by means of climate-friendly
products and services, thus also tapping into new target groups.
Supply chain
We see more sustainability in our supply chain as an opportunity. It
helps to enhance our reputation and our economic success. Thus
through a development program, we help strategic suppliers to introduce business practices that are socially and ecologically acceptable
and economically efficient. The program launched in 2014 has already
produced measurable initial successes and is to be rolled out further
in 2015. At the same time, our global procurement activities can expose
us to country- and supplier-specific risks. These include, for example,
the use of child labor, the conscious acceptance of environmental
damage or inadequate working and safety conditions in the local
supplier factories. Reports by NGOs or the media can give rise to risks
to the company’s reputation, but also to supply risks. We reduce these
risks by systematically auditing our suppliers.
Health and environment
Mobile communications, or the electromagnetic fields used in mobile
communications, regularly give rise to concerns among the general

population about potential health risks. There is intense public, political,
and scientific debate of this issue. Acceptance problems among the
general public concern both mobile communications networks and the
use of mobile devices. In mobile communications, this affects mobile
infrastructure build-out and the use of mobile devices. In the fixed
network, it affects sales of conventional DECT (digital cordless) phones
and devices that use WiFi technology. There is a risk of regulatory
interventions, such as limiting electromagnetic radiation or the implementation of precautionary measures in mobile communications
(e.g., amendments to building law or labeling requirements for end
devices).
Over the past few years, recognized expert organizations such as the
World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Commission
on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) have repeatedly reviewed
the current limit values for mobile communications and confirmed that
if these values are complied with the use of mobile technology is safe
based on current scientific knowledge. In 2011, despite a lack of scientific evidence, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC),
a WHO agency, classified high-frequency electromagnetic fields as
"possibly carcinogenic" as a precautionary measure on the basis of
isolated indications. This is the weakest category indicating a potential
carcinogenic effect. Drinking coffee is also included in the same category. However, the classification provoked an increase in media coverage, as well as controversy among experts. The German Commission
on Radiology Protection criticized the IARC’s classification on the basis
that there is insufficient scientific evidence for it in the Commission’s
view. There is still agreement among all institutions and expert committees that there is so far no scientific evidence of a health risk from highfrequency electromagnetic fields but there is a need for more research
into this issue.
We are convinced that mobile communications technology is safe if
current safety standards are complied with. We are supported in this
conviction by the assessment of the recognized bodies. The basis of
our responsible management of mobile communications is Deutsche
Telekom’s EMF Policy. With this policy we are committing ourselves to
more transparency, information, participation, and financial support
of independent research on mobile communications, far beyond that
which is stipulated by legal requirements. We aim to overcome uncertainty among the general public by pursuing an objective, scientifically
well-founded, and transparent information policy.
We also remain committed to maintaining our trust-based, successful
collaboration with local authorities over and above the statutory requirements. This will not change even after the longstanding cooperation
with local authorities in connection with the build-out of the mobile
network, which in the past was implemented on the basis of voluntary
commitments by the network operators, was regulated by law in 2013.

Data privacy

Data privacy

Millions of customers entrust Deutsche Telekom with their data. In order
to live up to this responsibility, we place the highest priority on protecting our customers’ personal information. Deutsche Telekom’s activities
in the areas of data privacy and data security set the standard for numerous companies. That is why more and more companies are asking us to
share our experiences and information on this topic. We plan to expand
our role as an in-demand expert and solutions provider for data privacy
and data security.
Making our data privacy measures transparent to the public is a principle of utmost importance for us. We are the first DAX-30 company to
publish an annual data privacy report, which documents all relevant
processes at the Group. We have been publishing an integrated report
on data privacy and data security since 2011.
In addition to publishing this annual report, we provide information on
all internal incidents involving data theft and abuse that have been
reported to investigating authorities at www.telekom.com/dataprotection. The website also features our latest measures to improve data
privacy as well as tips for keeping personal information safe.
Transparency report published
Deutsche Telekom strictly enforces compliance with the regulations
concerning the secrecy of telecommunications within its area of responsibility and makes sure that data privacy is guaranteed. Wherever the
authorities encroach upon these basic rights with requests for interception activities and data, we make sure that they are processed strictly
in accordance with the law. Without exception, Deutsche Telekom only
takes action when the necessary legal preconditions are met. Deutsche
Telekom has been publishing its annual case figures since 2014 to
ensure greater transparency. We published our first transparency report
during the reporting period. This report indicates the number of telephone lines intercepted by order of the authorities during the 2013
review period. It also contains information on the number of traffic data
records, subscriber data, and IP addresses provided to the authorities.

Network and infrastructure expansion

Network and infrastructure
expansion
Many people today consider fast, secure, full-coverage telecommunications networks to be an indispensable part of their everyday lives. These
networks make new forms of communication and collaboration possible, make it easier for people to get involved, and boost economic
development. They also facilitate the emergence of new business
models. Production processes and services become more efficient
and decision-making processes are enhanced due to the wide range
of information available on the Internet. Our response to this increasing
demand is to provide attractive offers. That is why we continue to push
the expansion of our infrastructure and increase data transmissions
speeds in both our mobile communications and fixed-line networks.
Management approach
The globally generated data volume will increase tenfold by 2020 compared to 2013, according to a study conducted in 2014 by US-based IT
company EMC. That would mean 44 billion gigabytes in the networks a
year instead of 4.4 billion. The amount of digital data being produced in
Germany alone is expected to grow from a current 230 billion gigabytes
to 1,100 billion. Networks need to be continually expanded to be able to
handle this volume.
Deutsche Telekom has been the largest investor in this area in Germany
for years now and will continue to drive network expansion. The main
objectives of our pan-European integrated network strategy (INS) form
the basis for these activities: growth, efficiency and quality. We will continue to expand our networks, increase the efficiency of our systems and
further strengthen our role as a leader in network quality. Our integrated
network strategy is in line with the network expansion goals specified
by the EU Commission and the German federal government [Digital
agenda and Broadband strategy].

Upgrading and simplifying our network architecture
We intend to make our networks faster and more efficient. In order
to achieve this, we are going to deactivate all analog PSTN (public
switched telephone network) platforms that we no longer need and
switch our entire telephone network to IP-based lines by 2018. Thanks
to this switch, Deutsche Telekom will reduce the carbon footprint of
its fixed and mobile networks in Germany by around 40 percent by
2020 compared to 2008. The switch to IP technology, which requires
considerably less energy compared to earlier network technologies,
will contribute significantly to the overall reduction of CO2 emissions.
Further, we will rely on fiber optics when updating our network architecture in order to meet our customers’ demands for fast network connections. Using VDSL vectoring technology, which is based on fiber optics,
[Implementing our INS strategy in the fixed network] will increase download speeds up to 100 Mbit/s, and upload speeds even up to 40 Mbit/s.
But vectoring requires more energy. To reduce this need for energy, we
are working on control solutions for energy-efficient operation of our
systems when data traffic is low. The combination of IP technology and
VDSL vectoring is already considerably more energy-efficient than conventional PSTN technology.
And by simplifying our network architecture, we will also reduce energy
consumption significantly, for example by introducing a broadband
access server. The server assumes the role of several conventional network elements, e.g., routers, which can then be deactivated.
Mobile workplaces, multimedia applications and high-quality online
services continually boost the demand for higher bandwidths. We are
taking fiber optics closer to our customers in order to ensure the longterm success of our business.

Network expansion based on four pillars
Deutsche Telekom’s integrated network strategy (INS) for Europe is
based on the four pillars LTE, fiber optics, VDSL vectoring and hybrid.
In addition to expanding the LTE mobile network, fiber-optic expansion
in combination with VDSL vectoring technology is the short and
medium-term focus of Deutsche Telekom’s INS for Germany. In March
2015 we launched our integrated hybrid offer, a combination of LTE and
fixed-network line, thereby considerably increasing bandwidths throughout Germany.

With our network rollout we plan to make ultra-high-speed Internet available to 80 percent of the German population by 2018. This is subject
to regulatory changes. This means that we will considerably expand the
fiber-optic network using FTTC, or fiber to the curb. For FTTC, fiberoptic cables are installed in the main cable up to the cable distribution
box (the gray street cabinets found on sidewalks in German cities). From
there, customers can be provided with large bandwidths via VDSL vectoring using the existing copper cable.

We have defined two goals as part of our INS in Germany that we plan
to achieve by 2018: Firstly, we plan to be able to offer LTE connections
to 95 percent of the population. Secondly, progress of the fiber-optic
network rollout should allow VDSL vectoring lines with bandwidths of
up to at least 50 Mbit/s for around 80 percent of all households. This is
subject to regulatory changes.

With FTTH, or fiber to the home, the fiber-optic cables are taken into the
home. This will enable products with up to 200Mbit/s for downloads
and up to 100Mbit/s for uploads, for example. FTTC alone already provides download speeds of 50 Mbit/s, which doubles to up to 100 Mbit/s
when FTTC is combined with vectoring. Upload speeds are even quadrupled to up to 40 Mbit/s through vectoring.

Networks
Network and infrastructure expansion

We have been driving our vectoring infrastructure rollout since November 2013. Expanding the fiber-optic network, however, involves a great
deal of time and financial expense. That is why expansion is currently
not economically feasible in some regions and will only be possible
through close collaboration between politics and business.
Implementing our network strategy in the mobile
network (LTE)
All of the Deutsche Telekom Group’s national companies made considerable investments in 2014 in expanding their LTE networks and continue to make rapid progress in network rollout: More than 35 percent of
our mobile base stations were equipped with LTE technology in the
Europe segment (12 European countries besides Germany) by the end
of 2014. That means that 62.5 million people could theoretically use
LTE to make mobile calls in their hometown as long as they have signed
a contract for these services and have an LTE-capable device. Depending on the region, our national companies provide between 30 and 79
percent coverage. We are planning to increase this to between 75 and
95 percent by the end of 2018.
LTE expansion has been well on track in Germany too. We achieved
approx. 80-percent coverage by the end of 2014 and plan to increase
this to 95 percent by the end of 2018.
We are also making considerable progress with transmission speeds in
mobile communications. We set the standard throughout Germany in
early 2014 with LTE Plus, a service based on the Cat 4 standard. The
service in the LTE 1.800 network attains download speeds of up to
150 Mbit/s, 50 Mbit/s more than conventional LTE networks More than
150 German cities benefit from this service. Speeds of up to 300 Mbit/s
have even been possible since fall 2014 with LTE Advanced based on
the Cat 6 standard. Radio antennas have also been set up in many rural
regions to enable LTE via the 1,800 MHz frequency. In trade journal
connect’s network test, readers voted our mobile communications network the "best network" for the third time in a row.
As an innovation leader, we continue to advance our products and
services. We achieved a new speed record of 580 Mbit/s in the LTE
network in early 2014 in a field test conducted under real conditions.
These speeds are made possible thanks to a new type of interplay
between frequency bundling and MIMO (multiple input multiple output)
technology.
One router, two networks: the hybrid connection
The hybrid connection is another pillar of our integrated network
strategy that literally integrates networks. In fall 2014 we began offering
our customers in Germany a combination of IP fixed-line and LTE
mobile communications in a single fixed-line product thanks to hybrid
technology. When customers require more bandwidth for their DSL connection, our hybrid service automatically activates LTE using a special
hybrid router. This means that the transmission rates of both networks
are added together. This is particularly useful in areas where we have
only been able to offer limited Internet bandwidths via the fixed network.
In 2014 we became the first mass-market provider worldwide to offer
this type of hybrid solution Hybrid connections have been available
in selected German states since fall 2014. We expanded the offer to
customers throughout all of Germany in spring 2015.

Collaboration for broadband expansion
Deutsche Telekom collaborates with a number of local governments
in its efforts to expand the fiber-optic broadband network. We signed
our five-thousandth collaboration agreement in May 2014 within the
scope of the More Broadband for Germany project. Since the project
first started in 2008, we have extended broadband coverage to almost
two million additional households alongside our regular broadband network expansion in this way. Rural communities in particular benefit from
our partnership approach in which we work with them to come up with
shared solutions.
Migration to IP technology
All signs point to IP, the universal code of the 21st century. Thanks to IP
technology phone calls are no longer transmitted via analog channels
or using ISDN technology but in the form of data packets, a method that
has been the standard in online and mobile communications services
for some time now.
By setting up a pan-European IP fixed network we converge the
previously separate networks and make them more efficient and higherperforming at the same time.
We had switched around 5.8 million households in Germany to IP technology by the end of 2014. In the other EU countries we increased the
share of IP connections from 27 percent to 39 percent over the course of
2014. IP technology is also a requirement for VDSL vectoring with download data rates of up to 100 Mbit/s and upload rates of up to 40 Mbit/s.

Cyber Security

Hacker attacks are increasingly becoming more professional and the
damage they cause more serious. Every day roughly 100,000 new kinds
of malware are identified, more than twice as much as a year ago. As a
responsible ICT provider, we are fighting this trend. Our business model
includes guaranteeing our customers a high degree of security and
effectively protecting the data and infrastructure of the people and companies who use our services from unauthorized access.
Management approach
We are particularly concerned with protecting our customers from
online dangers, as well as warning them and helping them should they
fall victim to online crime. We bundle our expertise in our Cyber Security
business area, giving us the capacities necessary not only to identify
cyber attacks early on but also to respond quickly with countermeasures. We are developing new ways to prevent attacks on an ongoing
basis. In April 2014 we opened our own Cyber Defense Center where
we analyze online behavior patterns and develop defense strategies.
Collaborating in the name of security
Cyber security is a shared responsibility. We work with research institutes, industry partners, public institutions and other online service
providers worldwide to fight cyber crime and improve online security.
For example, we regularly exchange information on new malware
developments with anti-virus providers. We have also entered into a
partnership with California-based cyber security specialist FireEye for
our business customer segment. Together, we offer a comprehensive
service to business customers in Europe that gives companies fast,
effective protection against IT espionage and cyber attacks.
With the goal of improving collaboration revolving around digital
security, we regularly host the Cyber Security Summit in collaboration
with the Munich Security Conference. The third of these summit meetings between major politicians and business players took place in
November 2014 at our Group Headquarters in Bonn.
Cyber Defense Center opens
Cyber criminals focus their attacks on valuable patents, technologies
and other corporate knowledge. In many cases, it is difficult to determine
the extent of the damage caused by these attackers. At our new Cyber
Defense Center, which opened in Bonn on April 16, 2014, we bring
together our cyber defense expertise under one roof, enabling us to
more quickly identify, ward off and track cyber attacks. We use the knowledge gained at the Cyber Defense Center to not only protect our own
infrastructure but also to develop IT security solutions for our customers.

approach significantly reduces the amount of data we need to analyze
and makes it possible for us to initiate countermeasures more quickly.
We also use an intelligent early warning system in our analyses that
fabricates weaknesses in different devices connected to the Internet.
These honeypots provoke attacks, identify their origin and document
the type of attack. Telekom currently operates 180 honeypots, which
recorded more than one million attacks daily in 2014. This number only
came to 300,000 in 2012. Every day we publish the latest figures and
other statistical analyses at http://www.sicherheitstacho.eu.
The new center is an advancement of our Telekom Cyber Emergency
Response Team (CERT), which manages security incidents for all of
Deutsche Telekom’s information and network technologies internationally.
In creating the Cyber Defense Center, we are continuing to expand on
our own cyber security expertise. We developed a continuing education
program for our employees to become Cyber Security Professionals.
The program was certified by the Cologne Chamber of Commerce and
Industry.
Working together to fight cyber crime
The Munich Security Conference and Deutsche Telekom held their
third joint Cyber Security Summit (CSS) on November 3, 2014. Around
180 experts and decision makers attended the event, which was held at
Group Headquarters in Bonn as in past years, to discuss digital defense
in an increasingly connected world. In addition to representatives of the
German federal government, the EU, NATO and the U.S. federal government, a number of top managers from major international corporations
took part in the discussions.
The CSS gave leaders from the worlds of business and politics the
chance to talk to each other about future cyber threats and about how
to further improve the security strategies needed to defend against
those threats. Topics included protecting critical infrastructures, the
tension between data privacy and data security, the need to raise awareness and prevention. Participants also used the CSS as an opportunity
to bring fresh impetus into the concept of digital defense collaborations.
Cyber Security Summit for Kids
Following the CSS, we hosted the first ever summit especially for kids
on November 4, 2014. The purpose of the event was to teach kids on a
secure use of modern communications technology.

At the heart of the center is a system that analyzes attacks. We use this
system to pursue a focused defense strategy, which is based less on
broad-based prevention measures and more on the targeted analysis of
behavioral patterns potentially related with cyber attacks. This focused

Mobile communications and health

Electromagnetic fields (EMF) are a prevalent element in our connected
world, even if we are not able to perceive them directly. Their effects on
our health remain a topic of discussion. It is very important to make sure
that they do not present a problem for people or the environment when
we use them in mobile communications.
The effects of electromagnetic fields have been thoroughly researched
over past decades in numerous scientific studies. The World Health
Organization (WHO) analyzes the findings of scientific research and
recently made a statement regarding the results in October 2014. In
its statement the World Health Organization concludes that the current
threshold values for electromagnetic fields ensure that mobile communications technology can be used safely but that further research is
required. Deutsche Telekom has made a commitment to actively
address scientific research on mobile communications and health,
and provides detailed information on the Group website regarding the
latest technology and scientific risk assessments published by expert
committees and organizations.
Management approach
Our goal is to make our mobile communications infrastructure and
our new products, as well as the processes on which they are based,
as resource-efficient, environmentally friendly and safe for health as
possible. In Germany these activities are based in particular on voluntary commitments by mobile communications providers and an agreement with local authorities’ associations. Compliance with these voluntary commitments is reviewed every two years. The German federal
government’s Information Centre for Mobile Communications e.V.
(IZMF) published an extensive expert report on the topic in May 2014.
Our Group-wide EMF Policy, which we adopted in 2004, plays a pivotal
role. The policy specifies standardized minimum requirements in the
area of mobile communications and health, requirements that by far
exceed those set forth by national laws. Our policy provides our national
companies with a mandatory framework that makes sure that the topic
of mobile communications and health is addressed in a consistent,
responsible way throughout the Group. All of our national companies
have officially accepted the EMF Policy and implemented most of the
required measures.

 Information: We provide consumer information that is easy to understand and pursue a fact-based, sound information policy. On our
Group website we provide the latest information to those interested.
We also provide our customers with information on the SAR levels
of their devices. In addition, customers can get information on SAR
levels at many of our shops, via our free environmental hotline or via
e-mail.
 Participation: We rely on close collaboration and constructive
dialog with all those involved, including communities, when it
comes to network expansion. Our goal is to find amicable solutions
and negotiate acceptable compromises, which can only be
achieved by responding fairly to critical arguments and being ready
to learn from mistakes.
 Research and partnerships: Our guidelines call for funding
targeted research, scientific excellence, transparency, objectivity
and intelligibility.
We conduct quarterly reviews of compliance with our EMF Policy. The
findings are used to improve individual aspects and develop solutions
in different working groups such as the EMF Core Team and the EMF
Technical Working Group.
Evaluating and implementing the EMF Policy
Our goal is to put our EMF Policy into practice seamlessly throughout
the Group. We help our national companies do this by providing specific
tools. We developed standardized policies for funding research, for
example, and published these on the Deutsche Telekom website in
November 2014. Our national companies are using these policies in
their funding programs. We also rely on the independent initiative of our
national companies and encourage them to continue to improve their
measures even if they have already effectively introduced the EMF
Policy. The dialog conducted by the Deutsche Telekom national companies with other network providers and with consumers, politicians and
scientists plays a central role in this context.
Regular monitoring activities show us that the EMF Policy is being
implemented in all of our action areas. We also continue to optimize
current measures being employed at national-company level.

Our EMF Policy stipulates the following principles and measures:
 Transparency: We place importance on discussing issues involved
in mobile communications openly. We make all relevant information
regarding our mobile communications equipment in Germany
accessible to the public, e.g., on the EMF databases operated by the
German Federal Network Agency.

 T-Mobile Austria is working to improve transparency regarding EMF.
Within the scope of these efforts, for example, the Austrian national
company is helping the Austrian industry association, Forum
Mobilkommunikation, create classroom material for schools.

Sustainable products

Technological progress offers many ways to address the challenges
posed by climate change, scarcity of resources, and nationwide healthcare. Information and communications technology (ICT) plays a key role
in this context. Our products and services make climate-friendly consumption a reality for our customers and offer new approaches to
healthcare.
Management approach (sustainable products)
ICT helps industry, service providers, and consumers pursue a more
sustainable approach and holds tremendous market potential for that
very reason. According to the Smarter2020 study, for example, 16.5
percent of all greenhouse gas emissions worldwide could be cut by
the year 2020 through targeted use of ICT. But sustainability is more
than just protecting the climate. It also means reducing resource consumption, stabilizing power grids, simplifying work processes and
further improving medical care. ICT makes a considerable contribution
to all these tasks.

to reduce CO2 emissions by more than 16,000 metric tons per year and
reduce costs by more than EUR15 million. Dynamic Workplace lets
employees work outside of the office from any location. Among other
benefits, around two million hours previously spent commuting can thus
be used for more productive or more pleasant activities. You will find
other advantages and further details in the illustration below. This example shows how sustainability criteria can give us a competitive advantage. That is why we intend to systematically address these criteria when
marketing our products. The next step will be to review other products
on the same basis.

We are committed to systematically leveraging the vast sustainability
potential of ICT. To do this, we focus on the growth areas of smart
energy, connected car, and e-health. In 2014 we also developed our
own assessment tool to analyze sustainability impact commercial
opportunities of selected products.
Managing sustainable products also calls for systematic measures to be
implemented throughout the supply chain. That is why we have already
developed extensive processes to guarantee compliance with sustainability criteria. We use our Design Principles as a guideline when developing new products. We also use recognized environmental labels such
as the Blue Angel and the TUEV Certified Green Product label. The
requirements behind these labels show us how we can further improve
our products and help us keep our customers informed about the
sustainability benefits our products offer. We address our customers
with a variety of measures and offers in order to make sure that our
products are reused or disposed of professionally at the end of their
life cycle.
Business potential through sustainability
In order to systematically tap the opportunities presented by sustainable
products and to create a sustainable product portfolio, we identified
68 potentially sustainable products and solutions in our current portfolio in a pilot project conducted in 2014. We selected Dynamic Workplace, Connected Car, and Smart Metering as pilot products to be
tested for their contribution to sustainability and the resulting business
potential they hold. We identified their benefits in view of all three pillars
of sustainability: environmental, social, and economic. We found, for
example, that Dynamic Workplace, a cloud-based offer for business
customers, makes it possible for a company with 35,000 employees

Innovation in growth areas

Innovation in growth areas

By developing smart solutions in the areas of smart energy, connected
car and e-health, Deutsche Telekom has been able to tap new, highgrowth business areas over the past few years. Cloud computing and
machine-to-machine communication are other areas in which we have
developed sustainable products.
By focusing on these areas, we contribute in different ways to creating
more efficiency and convenience for our customers as well as helping
them reduce their impact on the environment and their carbon footprint.
This also positions us as a modern technology group that is able to
anticipate and influence future developments. It is for this reason that
we invest in wide-ranging research and development activities, in particular at our main research institution, the Telekom Innovation Laboratories (T-Labs). We invested at total of EUR95.6 million in research and
development throughout the Group in 2014. We are also committed to
financing professorships and cooperate with universities in the creation
of pioneering ideas.
Smart energy
Climate-friendly energy supply calls for smart solutions for the measurement and control of energy flows. On the one hand, consumers need to
be able to see how much energy they are using and when so that they
are motivated to cut back their consumption. Smart meters create the
basis for this. Within the scope of our pilot project to identify business
potential through sustainability, we also studied the sustainability advantages of smart metering in detail. Households can reduce their electricity consumption by up to 8 percent by using smart meters. According
to our calculations, installing smart meters in 7.8 million households in
Germany would reduce CO2 emissions by up to 1.2 million metric tons
by 2020.
On the other hand, natural fluctuations in the supply of wind and solar
power need to be balanced in order to regulate grid loads and prevent
power failure. This requires a smart grid that uses ICT to flexibly regulate
power storage or decentralized combined heat and power stations.
Managing the demand of millions of end-consumers, for example, by
switching devices on and off as needed, can also help stabilize the
grids. Smart meters provide energy providers with real-time information
on power consumption and power generation at homes and companies.
That is why using smart meters will be a key prerequisite for restructuring the energy market. The German federal government paves the way
for large-scale installation. It is planning to install eight million smart
metering systems connected to the ICT network by 2029 and another
40 million meters that can be hooked up to the network by 2032,
making smart metering a business area with strong development
potential for our company.

At the same time, we are aware of our responsibility to protect our
customers’ data. Deutsche Telekom complies with the requirements
specified in the Federal Data Protection Act. This includes recording
and transferring only data that is genuinely required. If a distribution
network operator requires the data for network or load management
purposes, anonymized data will suffice. Deutsche Telekom also transmits the data encrypted through a public key infrastructure in compliance with the specifications passed by the German Federal Office for
Information Security (BSI). Our gateway administration service makes
sure that only authorized parties who require the data for their services
get access to the data.
Energy transparency and efficiency for business customers
Deutsche Telekom also provides businesses with solutions to reduce
their energy consumption. The visualization of energy consumption can
help a company’s facility management identify and realize reduction
potentials. This information is provided through smart metering, supplemented by appropriate KPIs such as energy consumption per square
meter and a comparison of consumption at different locations. Experience has shown that companies can reduce their consumption by
around 15 percent.

QIVICON – Living in a smart home
There are many ways in which a smart home can make life easier. It lets
residents conveniently control and monitor a large number of building
and security technology devices and functions, including home entertainment. If in the past customers bought a smart-home solution, they
could only use the functions and devices of their particular provider and
not those offered by other providers. The challenge therefore was to
come up with a multi-vendor smart home solution. Deutsche Telekom
and other key players together developed the QIVICON platform on
which any company, regardless of their industry or size, whether they
are a utilities company or a building technology vendor, can offer their
own solutions. This platform gives consumers the option to customize
their own combination of different offers. More than 30 partner companies and brands currently offer their solutions on the platform. Offers in
the energy sector, for example, include consumer products from EnBW,
Vattenfall, RheinEnergie, and Deutsche Telekom. Solutions like smart
radiator thermostats can reduce energy consumption by up to 30 percent. Partner companies offer other security and convenience products,
and the range of QIVCION-based offerings and devices is growing constantly.
To accelerate the smart home standardization process, we joined the
international open-source community Eclipse Foundation in 2014, an
association founded to encourage the development of open-source software. We are going to open our platform to developers and start-ups so
that we will be able to offer our users an even greater variety of products
and services in the future. We intend to also offer our open, multi-vendor
platform at international level in future.
QIVICON’s open, non-proprietary approach was recognized by the
international corporate consulting firm Frost & Sullivan in the reporting
period. Frost & Sullivan named QIVICON the most innovative smart
home solution and presented it with the European Visionary Innovation
Leadership Award 2014.
Readers of Chip computer magazine rated QIVICON as "good" in 2014.
One of the aspects they praised was the fact that the platform is so easy
to install. Users can use apps developed by QIVICON partners to individually or automatically manage, monitor, and combine connected
devices via any Internet-enabled computer, smartphone, or tablet. To
help conserve resources, QIVICON partners, for example, offer products
including a feature that automatically turns down the heat as soon as a
window or door is opened.
Data in safe hands
All communication via the QIVICON Home Base, which is connected to
the Internet via servers, is encrypted. Any user data related to QIVICON
is stored exclusively on Deutsche Telekom servers in Germany. All
devices from partner manufacturers that are controlled via QIVICON
employ wireless technology based on state-of-the art security functions.
Data security was confirmed during the reporting period by an independent IT security test conducted by AV-Test GmbH. The test rated
QIVICON as "secure" and verified that the encryption technology used
provided effective protection against non-authorized access.

Machine-to-machine communication and connected
car: Solutions for more efficiency
Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication and Connected Car are
important growth areas for Deutsche Telekom. We offer our customers
numerous benefits by connecting machines digitally. The technology
quickly synchronizes the work processes of customer devices and cars
or even entire industrial systems. This increases industrial productivity,
makes transportation more reliable (and more accurate) and helps
reduce energy consumption and conserve resources.
We support the German federal government’s Industry 4.0 initiative
through our involvement in M2M communication. The initiative’s
objective is to make Germany more competitive as a technology
business location. At the same time, we are also involved internationally
in promoting efficiency through connectivity, for example, as part of the
Smart Wine M2M project.
The Smart Wine project is a collaboration between our subsidiary in
the FYRO Macedonia and the Ss Cyril & Methodius University in Skopje
to optimize wine cultivation processes. The technical basis for the project is a sensor-supported system that monitors grape development
and controls all of the production processes. It helps winegrowers lower
their consumption of energy, water, and chemicals. Besides this, the
system provides information on plant disease, weather problems, and
optimal harvesting dates. The product has already been launched on
the market. It can easily be adapted to other agricultural production
sectors.
M2M solutions for more efficient transportation: Examples
There is considerable potential for using M2M in the logistics sector.
Within the scope of our Connected Car Group business area, we
develop customized solutions that tap this potential. We collaborated
with logistics
company DB Schenker in 2014, for example, to develop an application
for more efficient fleet management that uses a traffic light system to
give drivers tips in real-time on how to optimize their driving behavior.
In addition, we will continue the Smart Port Logistics pilot project for the
Port of Hamburg in 2015 and gradually incorporate it into commercial
operations. The goal of the project is to improve truck traffic flows at the
Port of Hamburg and in its vicinity. Large amounts of data are used to
analyze the current traffic situation and create short-term forecasts.
Among other things, this provides truck drivers with information on
waiting times and alternative routes.
In late 2014, we also signed an agreement to found a joint venture with
the world’s largest mobile provider, China Mobile. Both partners will
hold a 50-percent share in the company. The joint venture will use the
platform technology and some of the services from our Connected Car
business area to develop innovative solutions for the Chinese market
from 2015 onwards. These solutions are to help customers plan their
routes more effectively and encourage fuel-efficient driving.

Big Data Award for green truck management
In collaboration with DB Schenker logistics, we implemented a solution
for more efficient fleet management in 2014. The solution was awarded
second place in Computerwoche magazine’s Big Data Award in September 2014. The application uses mobile communications and GPS
to track all vehicle movements and analyzes their energy and resource
consumption. A traffic light system provides drivers with real-time tips
on how to optimize their driving behavior.
If requested, the system can also calculate the CO2 emissions produced
for each piece of freight. This provides clients with information on their
supply chain’s carbon footprint, which they can then use for targeted
reduction measures and communication purposes.
E-health
Connecting services creates numerous improvements in the healthcare
sector. They make it possible for many people with disabilities to live an
independent life. Not only do telemedical assistance systems help
reduce costs, they also offers patients, their families and medical staff
a wide spectrum of ways to simplify their work and daily lives. A study
on digital remote patient care that we conducted in collaboration with
the Berlin Charité hospital in May 2014 found that doctors need less
time to analyze results, leaving them with more time to talk to the patient
and their colleagues. Hygiene requirements are met by using tablets.
So there is nothing to stop us from making these systems part of daily
routines.
Model project for comprehensive healthcare
One example of our work in this area is our collaboration with Carus
Consilium Sachsen GmbH, a subsidiary of the Dresden university
hospital. Together, we are building an open, accessible, interdisciplinary
IT platform for medical care for people living in Eastern Saxony. The
Telehealth Ostsachsen model project is expected to help guarantee
comprehensive, local medical care in rural regions for patients in the
comfort of their own homes. At the heart of the project is a virtual round
table at which patients, doctors, insurance providers, hospitals, and
other medical healthcare providers can take an interdisciplinary
approach and work together online. We have provided special standardized software and secure data transmission channels for the project.
A basic version of the platform passed initial internal tests in late 2014;
the plan is to go online in July 2015 with three sample applications
for congestive heart failure, after-care for stroke patients, and tissue
analysis.
The project uses a full-coverage approach that involves all participants
and is exemplary even at European level. It shows how comprehensive,
long-term telemedical support for healthcare can be provided effectively
at a supraregional level. This is one of the reasons why the EU and the
Free State of Saxony support the project with almost EUR10 million.

Sustainable ICT solutions

Deutsche Telekom is helping millions of consumers and business
customers effectively lower their energy consumption and reduce CO2
emissions with our growing offer of green products and innovative ICT
solutions. We have been offering services to dematerialize business
processes such as online billing, digitized workflows and cloud computing for several years now. This contributes to the success of our "Lowcarbon society" CR action area. We also want to give as many people as
possible the chance to participate in the information society and to use
the opportunities it offers. For example, we make it easier for people
with age-related or physical limitations to use modern means of communication. We develop products and services that meet their needs and
continue to work on improving user friendliness. Throughout the Group,
Deutsche Telekom also offers various subsidized rates to provide lowincome customers and people with disabilities with an opportunity to
place calls and surf the Internet at low cost.
Sustainability advantages with cloud computing
Cloud computing is often more resource- and energy-efficient than
operating ICT processes outside of the cloud. Significantly less hardware and energy is needed for computer programs and other IT processes at our data centers because capacities are much better utilized.
By transferring their IT to the cloud, customers can do without their own
servers and storage media; their IT processes are seamlessly moved
to the cloud. Before this happens, we conduct a cloud maturity check,
which establishes whether the existing business and IT processes fulfill
the necessary preconditions for cloud computing in compliance with
the Open Data Center Alliance (ODCA) maturity method. This helps
customers develop and implement the right cloud strategy for them.
Energy consumption declines by up to 80 percent by transferring IT
to the cloud due to the high degree of standardization in the datacenters. That is why we are constantly improving the efficiency of
our data centers.
Sustainable solutions from the cloud
Since 2014, we have been offering standardized cloud solutions
designed for large companies with our Cloud Integration Center product (formerly Enterprise Marketplace). Companies can use the center to
access cloud services as needed. Their applications, servers, and other
infrastructure are operated at our data centers. The Cloud Integration
Center also supports solutions in which applications from independent
third-party software vendors are provided via the Telekom Cloud
(Shared Software as a Service – SaaS). One example of this is a sustainability management software that T-Systems began selling in collaboration with WeSustain software company and which can be purchased
from the Cloud Integration Center.

T-Systems has also been offering the doculife® product since 2014
which allows companies to fully transfer their document management
processes to the cloud. This service covers a range of applications from
central administration and secure archiving through to direct, webbased access. In addition to using less energy than IT solutions run inhouse, companies can use the service to significantly reduce their
paper consumption thanks to digitalized processes.
Leading provider of cloud services
We were recognized for the quality of our cloud services in 2014.
The Experton Group rated us as a "leader" in all six of the categories
reviewed in their Cloud Vendor Benchmark. We got top scores in cloud
services for small and medium-sized enterprises, our Business Marketplace cloud marketplace, and our Dynamic Workplace. The Experton
Group used product tests, interviews with experts, and customer reference stories to rate more than one hundred cloud services providers.
Product certification
We see sustainable products as crucial in helping us distinguish ourselves in the ICT market. This applies to services and infrastructure as
well as phones and routers. That is why we require our suppliers to
comply with environmental and social requirements and monitor their
compliance. We also keep our customers informed about environmental
aspects, manufacturer conditions, safe, low-energy and demand-based
usage, and resource-conserving disposal options at the end of the
product life cycle.
All of our DECT phones in the Sinus series have been certified under
the well-known Blue Angel environmental label since 2013. We are
planning to have other products certified under this label in 2015.
More and more of our products are also being certified under the TUEV
Certified Green Product environmental label. This label exceeds the
Blue Angel criteria in ways such as requiring inspections of working
conditions and production sites. Some of our products have already
been certified, for example, the Speedphone 10 and the W 724V router.
Blacklist on environmentally harmful materials
In 2014 we conducted a study on harmful materials in cell phones in
collaboration with the Fraunhofer Institute for Reliability and Microintegration. The study identified materials that, although harmful to
the environment, are currently not prohibited. We defined Deutsche
Telekom’s own list of prohibited materials over and above those covered
by legal standards in order to send out a clear signal for a reduction in
the industrial usage of substances that are problematic for the environment. Our suppliers are required to comply with this blacklist by the
end of 2015.

organization to commission a study in order to support the initiative
and address the demands of different stakeholders for a smartphone
that is as fair and sustainable as possible. Representatives of 16 expert
organizations, including Greenpeace and the German Federal Environment Agency were asked their opinion of the sustainability of the Fairphone 1.0. The following aspects were addressed:






Use of conflict-free resources
Smart, sustainable design
Fair production conditions
Recoverable materials and/or recycling
Transparency.

DUH published the results in June 2014. The study found that the Fairphone was a transparent, pioneering initiative. At the same time, it also
admitted that it is not possible to guarantee total fairness right away with
such a complex product. Fair structures on a larger scale still need to
be created on the procurement markets. The study pointed out that the
only way to do this was through collaboration among business, politics,
and NGOs.
Don’t buy, rent
By using our products, our customers can help conserve resources and
reduce electronic waste and CO2 emissions. We pursue two models:
rental services for routers and media receivers and used cell-phone
collection programs.
We want to make sure that old routers and media receivers do not just
end up in the trash. That is why we promote the "Don’t buy, rent" approach. We reduced our monthly rental fee for long-term rentals as
an incentive for customers to use the devices for longer periods of time.
Once the leasing period has expired, the devices are returned and
either processed in accordance with environmental standards or properly recycled. We have also introduced longer minimum terms of contract for media receivers. This encourages first-time users to keep their
devices longer, reducing goods volumes, and resource consumption.
We actively and effectively promote the rental service in many ways
including at Telekom Shops, online, and in product flyers. The offer
has met with great customer response. The number of people using
the rental service had grown to around 7.4 million by the end of 2014
compared to 6.5 million in the prior year.
Used cell-phone collection measures
We organize numerous activities to encourage people not to stick the
cell phones and smartphones they no longer use in a drawer or cupboard, but to hand them in for recycling or reuse instead. We came up
with a number of ways for people to turn in cell phones and created
incentives to participate.

68

Since 2013, we have been giving our customers the option to exchange
their used, high-quality cell phones and smartphones for a voucher at
our Telekom Shops. In November 2014, we also set up the Handysammelcenter online collection portal in collaboration with the Deutsche
Umwelthilfe (DUH) environmental organization. Companies can use the
portal to properly and safely dispose of their used cell phones and
smartphones free of charge. We provide these companies with a proof
of disposal for the cell phones they send in. The portal can also be used
by authorities, associations, and other organizations to initiate their own
collection campaigns. The entire return process, including data deletion, has been certified by DEKRA. Once they have been returned, the
devices are either reused or disposed of using environmentally friendly
methods. Any profit generated in this way is donated to nature conservation and environmental protection projects run by DUH.
We also supported a collection campaign during the 2014/2015 school
year conducted under the patronage of the Minister President of the
Saarland, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, in which around 80 percent of
secondary schools in Saarland participated. A campaign portal was set
up to accompany the used cell-phone collection campaign and special
classroom materials were developed on the topics of used cell-phone
collection and resource efficiency.
We also conducted other campaigns during the reporting period to
encourage people to hand in their used cell phones. In April 2014 we
conducted a Germany-wide campaign on the topic. Customers were
given a 100-euro discount if they turned in their used cell phones when
signing a new contract. We launched a Christmas campaign at the end
of the year giving customers who returned their used cell phones 20
percent off of accessory purchases. In 2014, we also collaborated with
DUH to initiate a cell-phone campaign involving all groups at the German Parliament. Members of all parliamentary groups were asked to
collect used phones in their constituencies and offices and turn them in
to us for safe disposal. More than 1,200 used cell phones were handed
in within the scope of the campaign.
In 2014, we collected 153,537 used cell phones and smartphones
throughout Germany and either reused them or had them properly
recycled. The joint cell-phone collection system run by Telekom
Deutschland and DUH entered its eleventh year in 2014. More than
1.8 million used cell phones have been collected so far.
Take-back recycling program in Greece
This take-back recycling program for batteries, ink cartridges and
phones was launched in June 2013 with the aim of enhancing recycling
activities in the OTE-COSMOTE-GERMANOS retail network, as well as
strengthening society’s environmental awareness. By the end of 2014
the program had been implemented in almost 500 retail outlets. During
2014, more than 50 t of batteries, ink cartridges and phone devices
were collected. For each ton of phone devices collected during the first
year of the program implementation (7.6 t from June 2013 to June 2014)
€1,000 was donated to two environmental NGOs who are active in
organizing environmental educational programs for school communities, in particular with respect to forest and wild life protection.

Handset recycling at T-Mobile US
T-Mobile USA’s handset recycling and reuse program provides the
opportunity for customers to bring their used handsets to any T-Mobile
location in the United States and Puerto Rico. Since handset recycling
is one of the main environmental challenges in the telecom industry,
T-Mobile USA is looking at all phases of the device lifecycle and creating incentives for customers to reuse, repurpose and recycle their used
handsets.
Through the JUMP!™ upgrade program customers are offered strong
incentives to bring their handsets back to T-Mobile USA. It is proving
successful as increasing numbers of customers are bringing their
handsets back to T-Mobile. Anytime customers are ready to upgrade,
they can trade in their eligible device and receive credit for all remaining
device payments, up to half of the original cost. T-Mobile then refurbishes and sells these devices to customers who are looking for used
handsets at more affordable prices.
In 2014, we took back more than 5.7 million handsets. In total, our
recycling rate* was 31 percent in 2014.
*Calculation: total annual handset returns (minus buyers’ remorse
returns) / total handsets sold.
Barrier-free products and services
Deutsche Telekom makes it easier for people with disabilities to have
access to the knowledge and information society. Not only do we offer
subsidized rates to people from low-income households, we also offer
them to people with hearing and vision impairments. Our company also
supports them with products and solutions especially designed to meet
their needs.
Products and services for the hearing impaired
We set up a hotline (Deaf Hotline) for deaf and hearing-impaired customers in 2003. The hotline offers customers emergency IT assistance,
among other services. Customers can send an e-mail, fax message or
letter, or use their video phone to communicate with our specially
trained employees for any requests they may have. The employee either
answers the question directly or lets the person know how to contact
them via video telephony or webcam to talk about the issue. Up to 50
people currently call the hotline every day to get help with problems
involving their DSL routers or find out more about special cell-phone
rate plans, for example.

Tablets for the blind
Online communication can pose a challenge for people who are blind
or visually impaired. We support the Green Vision project, which develops special tablets for these user groups. In 2014, the project received
first place in the sustainability award of the T-Mobile Environmental and
Sustainability Fund, which includes prize money of EUR 20,000. What is
special about the Green Vision tablets is its haptic, interactive interface
that provides content in Braille. The tablets literally make mobile online
content tangible. In line with the project’s name, Green Vision, production of the prototype is also intended to conserve natural resources.
First network operator in Germany to offer smartphone for seniors
Since October 2014, we have been offering a smartphone especially
developed for seniors – the Liberto 820. We are currently the only
German network operator to offer this type of device. With its simple
user interface, even inexperienced cell-phone users have no problem
using all the functions of a high-performance Android device. Users are
guided through the functions step by step and shown how to use of the
device. It can even be set up and administered remotely via an online
device manager. The Liberto 820 is compatible with hearing aids and
has an emergency button and two simple menu versions, making it
especially suitable for seniors.
Helping to search for missing persons
In 2014, T-Mobile Czech Republic has developed a one-of-a-kind
platform with the working title “SAR SMS ” (Search & Rescue SMS )
that allows mass text messages to be sent to a particular area where
there is a high risk or threat to health or life. Thanks to this unique
system, rescuers can promptly inform citizens about a search for a missing child, a fire, floods or other emergency situations. The motivation for
developing this app not only came from the alarming number of missing
children around the world but also from the need for an ultra-fast information channel in emergencies.

We have been conducting a campaign entitled "Accessible sales and
service for the hearing impaired" since 2013. Special sales channels for
people with hearing impairments are set up as part of the campaign.
Deutsche Telekom began featuring special offers in March 2014 for
our deaf and hearing-impaired customers on a website tailored to their
needs, for example. We plan to also provide detailed information on
these offers in video messages filmed in sign language. The website
also features Telekom support videos with subtitles providing information on our rate plans and products.

Consumer and youth protection

Consumer and youth protection

Protecting our customers is top priority at Deutsche Telekom. Whether
it be the privacy of personal data or banning Web content that is harmful
to minors, Deutsche Telekom stands for high standards when it comes
to consumer and youth protection. One example of how highly secure
our products are is De-Mail, our service for the legally secure identification of e-mail senders and recipients. We are also setting a new security
standard for sending private e-mails with the E-Mail made in Germany
industry initiative, which we co-founded. We want to teach children and
young people how to use digital media safely and effectively and protect
them from inappropriate content. Numerous projects throughout the
Group aim to improve their media skills, and we work with a variety of
initiatives and partners to create a child-friendly Internet. We have reinforced our stance with numerous national and international voluntary
commitments and internal codes of conduct. In doing so, we often
exceed the standards required by national regulations.
Management approach
Data privacy and data security are very important to us. In 2008, we
created a special Board of Management department for this topic and
introduced the Binding Corporate Rules on Privacy specifying how
personal data is to be collected, stored, and processed at the Deutsche
Telekom Group. Not only do we provide transparent information on
all of our activities and measures in our annual Data Privacy and Data
Security Report, we also take stock of the current situation: What has
Deutsche Telekom achieved? What do politicians consider to be the
areas needing the most improvement? And what do experts think about
the current state of data privacy and data security?
Our products and services have always provided a high degree of data
privacy and data security. Growing volumes of data require special
precautions to protect the privacy of citizens. That is why we introduced
eight mandatory guiding principles for handling big data, i.e., large
amounts of personal data, in 2013. In January 2015, we also approved
specific measures to protect data and infrastructure in our "Ten-point
program for increased cyber security". We also developed new protective products including our Mobile Encryption app, which fully encrypts
mobile communications.
Data privacy and security also play a key role in the development of
our other products and services. Our Privacy and Security Assessment
(PSA) procedure allows us to review the security of our systems in each
step of the development process. This procedure applies to newly
developed systems as well as existing systems that undergo changes
in technology or in the way data is processed. We use a standardized
procedure to document the data privacy and data security status of our
products throughout their entire life cycle. Youth protection aspects
are also taken into consideration in our product and service design.
In Germany we notify and involve the appointee for the protection of

minors in all issues involving the creation, planning and design of its
offerings. The appointee for the protection of minors is involved in the
planning of new projects at an early stage and can advise Deutsche
Telekom to implement restrictions or modifications.
In 2013, we also made it mandatory for every international subsidiary
within the EU to designate a child safety officer (CSO) to handle youthprotection related topics. During the reporting period, we appointed
a CSO in each of our European markets. The CSO acts as a central
contact for societal stakeholders in the respective EU countries. They
also play a key internal role in coordinating topics revolving around the
protection of minors. These measures increase the consistency and
transparency of Deutsche Telekom’s involvement in protecting minors.
Strategic approach to protecting minors from unsuitable media
content
Our strategy to protect children and young people from harm
when using digital media is based on three pillars. We
 provide attractive, age-appropriate offers for children and give
parents and guardians tools (filters) that they can use to restrict
the access minors have to harmful content
 help fight child abuse and images of child abuse and
 encourage the development of media skills to help people handle
online content securely and safely.
We also collaborate closely with prosecuting authorities and NGOs as
well as other partners from business, politics, and society to ban online
content that is harmful to children and young people.
We documented our commitment to protecting minors from unsuitable
media content in Germany in our basic principles and introduced
minimum standards.
In 2007, we committed ourselves to fighting online images of child
abuse throughout the European Union. At a global level, we have been
a member of the international association of mobile providers GSMA
since 2008, which pursues the same objectives. In order to better
coordinate our activities within the Group, we also approved a list of
general guidelines in October 2013 for our activities to help protect
minors from unsuitable media content and made these guidelines
mandatory at international level, thereby setting new standards in
our markets. In consideration of their particular cultural situation and
business model, each international subsidiary in the European Union
can further specify these measures, adopt additional measures, and
also determine their own strategic focal points.

Consumer and youth protection

Because protecting minors from unsuitable media content poses a
challenge that affects many industries, we cooperate with different
organizations for the protection of minors and participate in coalitions
that coordinate the involvement of companies and organizations from
the Internet and media sector. For example, we are a member of the
"CEO Coalition to make the Internet a better place for kids". We also
play a leading role in the ICT Coalition for the Safer Use of Connected
Devices and Online Services by Children and Young People in the EU.
In this coalition, we pursue a comprehensive cross-industry approach
based on six principles that expressly includes helping young people
learn media skills.

have medium-term plans to make the solution available to small and
medium-sized enterprises as well.

In January 2013, Deutsche Telekom announced within the scope of
both coalitions plans to implement an EU-wide set of measures based
on the principles of the ICT Coalition. The ICT Coalition published an
annual report in April 2014 on the implementation of corresponding
measures at all of the companies represented in the ICT Coalition.
The report, which was written by an independent expert from the
Dublin Institute of Technology, comes to the conclusion that Deutsche
Telekom’s approach to implementing the ICT Coalition’s principles is
exemplary.

The new remote privacy protection feature also gives users considerably
more control over their privacy. Unlike solutions used by all other operating systems, Firefox does not send the smartphone’s location data to a
central unit that the owner may contact if they lose their cell phone.
Instead, Firefox smartphone users create a localization password. When
you send a text message containing that password to the lost cell
phone, the cell phone sends you a text message back specifying its
location.

Data privacy
Deutsche Telekom has carried out numerous measures to guarantee a
high degree of data privacy and data security in the use of our products
and services. We document our activities in our annual Data Privacy and
Data Security Report. The following are just a few examples of our activities during the reporting period:
Bringing together defense expertise
We opened Deutsche Telekom’s new Cyber Defense Center in Bonn
on April 16, 2014. Background: The number of cyber attacks has continued to grow over the past several years. That is why we are working
hard to defend against these attacks and have brought together the
required expertise at our new defense center. And for our customers,
we continue to expand our security portfolio.
Legally valid electronic administration
The City of Dresden and Deutsche Telekom launched the De-Mail City
pilot project in June 2014. Since then citizens, companies and authorities in Dresden have been able to use De-Mail for secure, legally binding
communication. The offer initially includes submission of business
registration forms, tax forms, certificates of eligibility for public housing,
and electronic petitions. More uses are scheduled to follow.
Protecting privacy in mobile communications
With the Mobile Encryption app, we became one of the first providers
to launch a globally deployable mobile encryption solution for smartphones in mid-2014. In contrast to other solutions, the Mobile Encryption app for Android and iOS devices works in all phone networks, and
even without a SIM card via Wi-Fi or satellite link. When two users want
to communicate with this new solution, they only need to install the
Mobile Encryption app on their smartphones. No customer-specific
technical infrastructure is needed in the background. The communication partners do not even need to be customers of the same network
operator, because the encryption solution works with every provider.
The offer is initially aimed at large business customers. However, we

We collaborate closely with the non-profit organization Mozilla to
develop new functions for the Firefox OS cell-phone operating system
that will provide users with better protection of their personal data. The
location accuracy feature, for example, lets people decide how precisely
an app is allowed to calculate the current location of their smartphone.
Users can thus limit the GPS information sent to the navigation app, for
example. The weather app only gets the coordinates of the city in which
the cell-phone user is currently located.

Mozilla is planning to gradually introduce these data privacy features,
which we presented at the Mobile World Congress 2014 in Barcelona,
to the market in 2015. These will also include the permission history feature, which lets users know which apps are accessing which data and
services on their cell phone.
During the reporting period we also published online tips on digital
security. The tips were designed to improve people’s media skills
through target group-specific offers.
New security features for online billing
In order to prevent criminals from installing malware on our customers’
computers by sending them fake Telekom invoices, Telekom Deutschland GmbH has been including additional identifying information on its
invoices since February 20, 2015:
 The customer’s street and house number
 A forgery-proof seal (a blue @ symbol with a check mark inside it)
 A signature only recognizable to Internet providers to help us sift out
forged billing e-mails.
Education on the protection of minors from unsuitable media content
Safe use of digital media requires knowing about potential dangers.
That is why, within the scope of Teachtoday, we have created numerous
offers to encourage the development of media skills. The purpose of
these offers is to inform people who use the Internet frequently and,
especially, children and young people about the Internet’s opportunities
and risks.
An example of our involvement in teaching media skills is the non-profit
initiative Mobilsuli, which was launched by employees at Magyar
Telekom. The aim of the initiative is to teach children the basic principles of mobile communications as well as raise their awareness for

Deutsche Telekom - Corporate Responsibility Report 2014

Consumer and youth protection

security aspects like posting personal pictures and other content.
Magyar Telekom provides financial support to the initiative and gives its
employees time off to volunteer. The company expanded its involvement
in 2014 and gave time off to around 600 volunteers to teach children
how to use cell phones securely and safely. The volunteers visited 120
schools and held two presentations at each school using age-appropriate materials, reaching around 7,000 children with their efforts.
Child protection software and Surfgarten
As a leading ICT provider, we promote to the best of our ability a secure,
positive online experience for children and young people. With ageappropriate websites and content like the fragFINN.de search machine
and our Kids Portal, which has been up and running since 2004, we
provide children and young people in Germany and other countries with
exciting, attractive online content. There is, however, other, dangerous
online content out in the Net there aside from these secure offers.
That is why we provide filters that parents can use to make it hard for
their children to access dangerous content. One of the two programs
for the protection of children under ages 16 and 18 from dangerous
content recognized by the Commission for the Protection of Minors
from Unsuitable Media Content (KJM) was our child protection software.
Parents (or other legal guardians) can use the software to flexibly determine which content their children (or wards) can access.
We also developed the Surfgarten browser for the iPhone, iPad, and
iPod Touch for protecting minors in Germany. The number of Surfgarten
users doubled during the reporting period to around 6,000.
Both our German child protection software and Surfgarten contain a
technological solution that identifies the age-rating of websites.
Taking action against child pornography
Deutsche Telekom considers it its obligation to take rigorous action
against depictions of child abuse on the Internet. Deutsche Telekom has
been involved in an EU-wide fight against the depiction of child abuse
since 2007 in the European Framework for Safer Mobile Use by Younger
Teenagers and Children. Since 2008 we have also been involved in the
fight against the spread of such content initiated by the global association of mobile providers GSMA.
Since 2013 we have also been participating in two cross-industry
coalitions committed to fighting child abuse on the Internet, the “CEO
Coalition to make the Internet a better place for kids" and the "ICT Coalition forthe Safer Use of Connected Devices and Online Services by
Children and Young People in the EU". The ICT Coalition published its
first annual report in 2014. The report acknowledges our involvement
in this area. We continue to be active in both coalitions and remain fully
committed to their principles.
Working with the Center for Online Child Protection
During the reporting period we participated in two expert working
groups at the Center for Child Protection on the Internet (I-KiZ), a project
run by the German Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens,
Women, and Youth. The Network against the Abuse and Sexual Exploitation of Children, "No Grey Areas on the Internet," was initiated in
2014 within the scope of the project. The aim of the network, which is
under the patronage of Manuela Schwesig, Federal Minister of Family

72

Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth, is to effectively fight the
online depiction of children and young people in sexual poses and ban
it internationally. The network got started by setting up a competence
center to illuminate the gray areas of sexual exploitation on the Internet.
Encouraging the responsible use of mobiles
TM Netherlands carries out various activities under the auspices of the
Responsible Mobile Use Program in order to promote the responsible
use of mobile phones:
Guest lectures on debt prevention in schools
In 2014 T-Mobile Netherlands cooperated with the Dutch Ministry of
Finance and the program “wijzer in Geldzaken’’ to stage more than 30
guest lectures, which reached over 1,000 children. The aim was to protect young people against unnecessary telecom debt ties. The company’s employees held the guest lectures with materials provided by the
company.
Traffic safety
On 16 September 2014 the Dutch Transport Ministry and Safe Traffic
Netherlands launched a campaign about the safe use of mobile phones
in road vehicles: "Keep Your Eyes on the Road”. T-Mobile Netherlands
was the first company from the telecom sector to adopt the campaign
and support it through flyers in stores and especially in social media.
A similar campaign was launched to encourage safe cycling since 20%
of all cycling accidents in the Netherlands are caused by social media
use in traffic. The ‘fietsmodus-app’ activates a traffic mode, which works
similar to a flight mode.
Forced Subscriptions
Forced subscriptions are an increasing problem in the Netherlands.
Young people are being ‘encouraged’ to go for the most expensive subscriptions and mobile phones. An internal communication campaign
focusing on this issue and especially directed at our shop employees
is aiming to combat this problem. Moreover, T-Mobile Netherlands has
made this issue part of the programs its runs in schools. In 2014, 1000
children were informed. For 2015 the objective is to educate 3000 children.
Kill Switch
Every week more than 300 smartphones are stolen. The Dutch Ministry
of Security and Justice wanted to do something about this and asked
the telecom sector for help. The result was the so-called kill switch and
a brand new campaign entitled ‘Boef Proof’ (Thief Proof), which started
in 2014. The kill-switch phone enables users to find their smartphones
remotely, erase data and lock the device, thus making the stolen smartphone worthless.
De Kindertelefoon
Since 2010 T-Mobile has been sponsoring ‘De Kindertelefoon’, a helpline where children in particular can anonymously call for help. T-Mobile
enables children and young people to use their mobile phone to make
free calls to this ‘Kindertelefoon’.

Customer satisfaction

Customer satisfaction

As a service-oriented, responsible company, we feel obliged to respond
to our customers’ needs and expectations. That’s why we have set up
a comprehensive customer relationship management system. We
encourage dialog with our customers by giving them opportunities to
quickly and easily contact us at any time via the communication channel of their choice, e.g., by phone, e-mail or at a Telekom shop.
Management approach
Our ambition is to delight our customers. We have integrated this goal
into our Group-wide Guiding Principles. Even variable components of
our managers’ salaries are based on customer satisfaction. We use
a variety of tools to regularly gauge the satisfaction and loyalty of our
customers. One of these tools is the TRI*M customer loyalty study,
which is conducted several times a year by an independent external
service provider. The results are presented in the TRI*M index. We plan
to improve our TRI*M results from 2012 by around 10 percent by the
end of year 2015. All customer responses are taken into consideration
in product design and to improve our customer service.
Since 2013, all fixed-line and mobile communications customers are
able to reach us by phone around the clock at no charge. This applies to
all of our service numbers, even for questions regarding Internet and TV
services. Online communication is becoming more and more important.
More than 40 percent of all service inquiries at Telekom Deutschland
are solved by support provided by our cross-area online platforms. We
systematically evaluate our customers’ inquiries and complaints to identify the root of the problem and make improvements.
Tangible success with "K1 – Kunde zuerst."
One key tool for implementing the "best customer experience" area
of operation as part of our Group strategy is the "K1 – Kunde zuerst"
(customers first) program. The idea behind the program is to improve
customer satisfaction and give our customers a better experience.
Not only do we meet the expectations of our consumers and business
customers with this program, we try to surpass them. Thanks to the program we have been able to significantly improve customer satisfaction.
The number of complaints regarding fixed-network services, for example, decreased by 6 percent from 2012 to 2014. Customers who were
assisted intensively by a case manager within the scope of our Complaint Management 2.0 project expressed a particularly high degree
of satisfaction. Compared to general complaint management activities,
we saw fewer cases of customers contacting us multiple times with the
same problem within the scope of the project.
Another good example of effective K1 measures is our return channel.
When a customer signs a contract, we send a text message confirming
the contract and a number that they can call to speak directly with the
service center if they have any questions. Our service staff systema-

tically documents the customer’s questions and requests. This helps
us prevent repetitive problems and further optimize our processes.
We received special recognition for the DSL help app, which was
developed within the scope of K1 and which customers can use to
conduct their own error analysis if they experience problems with their
broadband line. In 2014, the internationally active market research and
consulting institute, YouGov, named the app the Best Service Innovation
in the Service and Assistance category.
Indicator shows progress in terms of customer retention
We use the TRI*M index to gauge customer retention and regularly
participate in benchmarkings. In 2014 we were able to improve our
prior-year results. The TRI*M index went up by around 1.8 percent
throughout the Group; we were also able to further improve our index
score at Telekom Deutschland. Our goal is to increase customer
retention in Germany by 10 percent in 2015 compared with 2012.
Deutsche Telekom: Lead in customer trust
Customer satisfaction with our service was assessed by the TÜV Rheinland inspection agency in the reporting period. The testers rated our
service hotline, the Telekom shops, and our technical service as "good"
for the second time in a row. During the assessment, they had asked
850 customers from each of the three areas how reliable, competent
and friendly the service employees they encountered were. Based on
the number of points determined by the testers, each individual area
also received a score of "good." This once again reflects improvement
compared to the previous year.
Connect hotline test
Our efforts to strengthen customer trust were praised by a third party
during the reporting period. 107 testers from the Connect trade journal
compared the customer service at mobile service providers in Germany
in a "hotline test" in 2014. The quality of the statements had top priority.
The testers were most impressed with Telekom’s customer service staff.
The Telekom hotline was found to be very accessible with a relatively
average short waiting time of not quite two minutes. The testers also
gave Telekom a score of "very good" in the category of friendliness/
social skills. The fact that the Telekom hotline 2202 is free of charge
was also rates positively. Our e-mail service also got the top score.
18 out of 20 inquiries were dealt with within an average of 26 hours,
with the majority of the information provided having been correct.
Telekom earned the highest score among all its competitors, putting
the company in first place. Connect also conducted a readers’ test
between March and May 2014 to assess quality, service, and customer
satisfaction. More than 99,600 readers participated in the test and
named Telekom the best provider for both fixed-network and mobile
communications services.

Promoting start-ups

Promoting start-ups

We encourage talented students and innovative business ideas both
within the Group and in society at large. The purpose of Deutsche
Telekom’s hub:raum start-up incubator, for example, is to help people
who are starting a business get their innovative ideas off the ground.
We are convinced that helping these start-ups get up and running will
ultimately benefit our company, since we will be able to work together
with them to bring new or improved products to market. That is why a
number of our international subsidiaries have also launched start-up
initiatives and offer grant programs that give financial support to
talented students.
The latest from start-up incubator hub:raum
We have been running our own start-up incubator in Berlin since 2012
under the name hub:raum. At hub:raum, start-up teams can develop
their ideas in an "incubator" environment and then introduce them to
the market. Experienced start-up entrepreneurs work with the teams
as mentors. We also provide teams with a maximum of EUR 300,000
in seed funding.
Interested start-ups can go to the hub:raum website and apply for
acceptance to the program. The following start-ups were among those
admitted to the program in 2013 and 2014:
 qLearning, a learning assistance start-up from Munich
 Contiamo, a business intelligence company from Berlin

Together with the existing start-ups Stylemarks, Salonmeister, Reputami
and Blinkist, we now have eight start-ups participating in hub:raum.
hub:raum also offers an ongoing accelerator program. Start-up teams
whose ideas complement Deutsche Telekom’s portfolio can join the
program to turn these ideas into business models that qualify for financing. We provide them with the hub:raum campus infrastructure at no
charge as well as hub:raum program offers, which vary from week to
week (e.g., mentor and expert consultations, workshops, and events).
More than 60 start-up teams have already taken advantage of this offer
in Berlin and Cracow.

Deutsche Telekom partners and put them in touch with investors. Teams
from all over the world are invited to present their solutions to us in
Berlin and/or Bonn. Boot camps were held in 2014 on the following
topics that are relevant to us: Internet of Things, cyber security and
wearables (computer systems you can wear). More than 30 start-ups
participated.
Telekom Innovation Contest
We held the first Telekom Innovation Contest in 2013 to bring young
innovators in contact with our company and tap the advantages of this
relationship for everyone involved.Following the successful launch of
the international ideas competition, we once again asked creative teams
to submit their ideas in 2014. Students, entrepreneurs with start-up
ideas, young IT start-ups and employee teams from the Group were
all invited to participate. More partners than ever before supported the
2014 competition, which was initiated by Telekom Innovation Laboratories in Berlin, T-Mobile Poland, and Magyar Telekom in Hungary. All
of Deutsche Telekom’s incubators – hub:raum in Berlin, Cracow and
Tel Aviv, along with Kitchen Budapest and UQBATE, a program for
employees, participated in the competition.
The Italian start-up Atooma got potential investors interested in investing
up to EUR150,000 at the competition held in Cracow on June 27.
Atooma is a platform that connects end devices, apps and sensors, and
helps users automate their processes. As soon as someone using the
app approaches their home, Atooma can automatically turn on the Wi-Fi
function and reduce the ring volume. Other finalists in addition to
Atooma won a four-day training program at hub:raum in Cracow as well
as hardware and software for their start-ups.
A total of 326 teams from 39 countries participated in the competition.
Participants could make submissions in six categories including smart
energy, cyber security, data management, and the Internet of Things.
The majority of participants (60 percent), however, decided to submit
concepts for the hot topics of cloud computing (“cloud-based productivity”) and the future of media and communication.

In 2014, hub:raum also introduced a new, topic-based event format
referred to as boot camps. At these events, start-ups are given the
chance to "boot" themselves (like booting an operating system), i.e.,
get noticed. We also use these events to present the start-ups as

Connecting the unconnected

Living in an increasingly digitized world requires certain skills. Only
people who know how to work with new media safely and with confidence can take full advantage of the opportunities presented by today’s
know-ledge and information society. As an international ICT corporation
we feel we carry a special responsibility in this. We want to be more than
just a company that provides society with infrastructure. As a reliable
partner in all walks of life, we promote equal opportunities, thereby
getting both society and our company ready for the future.

 In order to promote digital security, we commission studies on the
Internet usage patterns of different user groups, contribute the findings to political discussions and pass them on to the general public
in the form of information materials.

As a provider of telecommunications services, we live with and in a
society increasingly characterized by digitization and the opportunities
it brings. This particularly includes having constant access to information and global communication to an extent never seen before. That is
why our primary goal is to give more people the opportunity to use ICT
services and remove barriers. We provide offers for learning effectively,
safely and at an individual level in order to encourage the enjoyment
of communication and technology. Our efforts focus on all age groups,
from children in preschool and students to seniors.
Management approach
We support numerous digital education projects throughout the Group
in which we help young people develop their skills and realize their
potential. We contribute our digital technology expertise as an ICT
service provider to these projects.
 Through the Teachtoday initiative we help teachers, school administrators and school social workers as well as parents and students
use digital media to teach and learn by providing practical, everyday
tips and materials, thereby encouraging the development of media
skills.
 We offer schools throughout Germany free broadband connections
as part of our Telekom@School initiative to give children and young
people the opportunity to learn how to use digital media regardless
of their background.
 Our "Yes, I can!" initiative, which was launched in 2009 and is currently run by an organization founded by Deutsche Telekom employees, sponsors projects and facilities that build the abilities and basic
skills of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds in order to
promote equal opportunities.
 We support skills development in the STEM subjects (science,
technology, engineering and mathematics) from preschool to grant
programs, through our Deutsche Telekom Stiftung foundation.

Competent in the digital world

Competent in the digital world

The digital world is changing how we live and learn. Only people who
can use digital media safely and with confidence will be able to take
advantage of the opportunities that our modern knowledge society has
to offer, from online research and making reservations online to mobile
communications. But it is often difficult to keep up-to-date. That is why
Deutsche Telekom supports media skills in the context of numerous
projects for children and young people as well as seniors and people
with disabilities. We particularly focus on activities involving online
security, because crime is taking on other forms in the digital age.
A recent study (only available in German language) conducted by the
Deutsche Telekom Stiftung foundation shows how important it is to
integrate mandatory, comprehensive media education throughout the
educational chain. According to the study, the educational success of
individuals in areas involving digital media skills is particularly related
to that person’s background in Germany. Deutsche Telekom intends
to promote equal opportunities with its involvement.
Teachtoday – Learning with digital media
In 2014, Deutsche Telekom assumed responsibility for the Teachtoday
online platform, which was launched as part of an EU initiative. The platform was redone in November 2014 with topics and didactic elements
being revised and expanded. The new website addresses a larger target
group. On the platform, teachers, school administrators and school
social workers as well as parents and students will find practical, everyday tips and materials on how to use new information and communications media securely and responsibly.

Training in "simple language" in collaboration with
Lebenshilfe aid organization
Several times a year, Deutsche Telekom employees organize trainings
on a variety of topics including how to use cell phones and the Internet
for residents of Lebenshilfe facilities within the context of Deutsche
Telekom’s Social Days. Deutsche Telekom had the course materials
translated into simple language. A volunteer trainer conducted a live test
of the materials with a test audience on Volunteer Day 2013; the revised
format has been available since mid-September 2014. The course
materials were again successfully used at a workshop for Lebenshilfe
residents in Bonn during Community Volunteering Week in September
2014. Deutsche Telekom employees gave the 20 guests tips and
support in using state-of-the-art communications media, answering
their questions using simple language.
Digital security
Recent studies show that children and seniors often go online without
paying attention to security. The annual security report conducted by
the Allensbach Institute and commissioned by Deutsche Telekom in
2014 found that almost half of all parents don’t really keep track of
their children’s activity online. 40 percent of those parents also feel that
their children are not effectively aware of the risks associated with their
activities and feel that teachers in particular are under the obligation
to help.
Deutsche Telekom promotes online security at different levels with
a variety of activities and collaboration projects.

Within the scope of the Teachtoday platform, we conducted the
“Medien, aber sicher” competition in 2014 where public schools and
institutions that work with children and young people submit projects for
using media safely. In the winning project, "Now – online," submitted by
Uhland elementary school in Wurmlingen (Baden-Württemberg), fourth
graders addressed their personal experiences with the Internet. They
talked to experts and compared the results with those found in scientifc
studies to come up with the criteria for creating a good website.

 Online guide: "Security in the digital world."

Five winning projects – in which about 200 children and young people
were involved – were then invited to attend the first Cyber Security
Summit for Kids on November 4, 2014, at Deutsche Telekom Headquarters in Bonn. Together with Deutsche Telekom Board members, the
winners could try out a new jump and run obstacle course at the summit
that takes a fun approach to teaching media skills and digital knowledge. Schools and youth work facilities have been able to book the
obstacle course free-of-charge since February 2015. The course will
be visiting schools and educational facilities throughout Germany for
a whole year. Hausburg elementary school in the Berlin district of
Friedrichshain was the first on the list, opening the tour on Safer Internet
Day in February 2015.

 Data security guide as an app

Entertaining and practical – in September 2014 Deutsche Telekom
presented the multimedia online tool, "Security in the digital world" at
the international IFA consumer electronics trade show in Berlin. The tool
illustrates situations involving use of media by fictional user types
including young people, grown-ups or parents and freelancers and
discusses the challenges involved.

The third revised edition of Deutsche Telekom’s free online guide on
data security was released in 2014. In addition to the popular printed
version, the guide is now available as a download in the Telekom Shop
app and as a multimedia iBook.

 International expansion of helplines for children
The Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA)
and Deutsche Telekom joined forces with the Child Helpline International (CHI) child protection organization in 2014. The goal of the
collaboration is to provide better online protection for young people
and help them exercise their right to be heard. In a joint agreement,
GSMA and CHI laid the foundation stone for the funding of children’s
helplines all over the world.
 "Me and the cyber world" internal competition
In order to raise employee awareness regarding their children’s online
safety, we held a creative competition entitled "Me and the cyber world"
in October 2014 via our internal social network (TSN). Children were
asked to illustrate how they saw the IT world on a poster – colorful and
exciting, complex or simple. The posters were then compiled in a slideshow and posted on the TSN where our employees could vote for their
favorite.
Connected in the classroom of the future
With the Connected Kids project, we raise awareness among students,
parents and teachers regarding the numerous ways mobile Internet can
be used for learning and advance the use of digital media at schools.
T-Mobile Austria collaborated with Apple between November 2013
and March 2014 and has been doing so again since November 2014
to equip classes at Austrian schools with tablets and mobile online hotspots for 2 weeks each. Young teachers are available for the students
during this time as tutors to help the students get familiar with online
learning options. Long-term project goals include inspiring students
to pass on what they learn to people outside of traditional educational
institutions.
Record participant numbers at free programing
workshops
Free programing workshops were held under the patronage of CoderDojo North Bucharest and Telekom Romania in September 2014 for the
third year in a row. A total of 50 children participated in three workshops
conducted simultaneously by Telekom Romania in Bucharest. That is
the highest number of participants this event has seen to date. Telekom
Romania also provided logistical support and high-speed Internet.
The pinnacle of the event in 2014 was the Arduino workshop on computer-aided electronics teaching, which was offered to children ages
12 and up. The first workshop of its kind at a national level taught
children the basics of applied electronics on the basis of the Arduino
development platform. Participates got to know the hardware elements
as well as the programing language of the Arduino platform.
CoderDojo is an international initiative founded in Ireland in 2011
to teach interested children about programing basics in a relaxed
atmosphere outside their normal classroom setting.

Access to the Digital World initiative
The Access to the Digital World initiative was founded in 2012 with the
financial support of OTE and COSMOTE. Its aim is to teach people ages
50 and up who are unfamiliar with the digital world the basics of computer technology, giving them the chance to further their education and
engage in lifelong learning. People ages 50 and up with no computer
experience are taught the basics of digital technology and offered
courses on how to use the Internet free of charge. Participants learn
how to use the touchscreens in smartphones and tablets and become
familiar with social networks like Skype and Facebook in two to fourhour seminars.
Access to the Digital World seminars were held in the community of
Ilioupoli from September 30, 2013 until July 3, 2014. Up to 20 participants at each of the 24 courses learned how to use computers and the
Internet. Participants met two hours twice a week for six weeks. A total
of 76 hours of seminars were attended by 480 senior citizens; their
average age was 64. In 2014, Access to the Digital World expanded to
include the Agios Dimitrios community. In addition to providing financial
support, OTE and COSMOTE also provided the initiative with the
required hardware and technical support.
IT courses for seniors
AjTy (“you too”) Senior, a joint project launched by T-Systems Slovakia
and an electrical engineering school in Košice in 2013, offers IT
courses for senior citizens. In 2014 the courses focused on how to use
computers and the Internet. Among other things, instructors explained
to participants the many uses of the Internet, how to set up an e-mail
account, how to create documents using MS Word, how to participate
in an online chat, etc. There were more participants in 2014 compared
to the previous year; participant numbers increased from 16 to 20 and
the number of volunteer teachers from T-Systems Slovakia went from 8
to 22. The quality of the courses was also improved, e.g., with new ways
of communicating with the participants, and providing course content
after its completion.
Within the scope of a work-study training program, which is being conducted in collaboration with the same school for the second year in a
row, managers and IT experts from T-Systems Slovakia offer courses
to prepare participants to face the challenges of the ICT sector. The 11
volunteer teachers from the company taught classes of 20 seniors for
a total of 198 hours per semester.
More security for kids in the Internet (Sheeplive.eu)
The Sheeplive.eu (OVCE.sk) project was initiated in 2009 by the
eSlovensko civic action group to give children and young people
practical tools and solutions to using cell phones and the Internet safely.
The project was designed as a preventative measure for small children
(two to six) and to encourage young people to reflect their own behavior
on the Internet in a humorous way. Parents can also have fun and
enhance their skills using the program. There are two components
to the project: the Sheeplive comic strip and the Sheeplive.eu online
portal. The project was recognized as one of the most innovative
e-content products worldwide with the UN World Summit Award.

Sheeplive campaign at Slovak Telekom shops
Slovak Telekom has been working to keep children and young people
safe online and when using mobile communications for some time now.
Most of the company’s shops participated in a campaign to raise awareness of online security in June 2014. Posters and a TV ad informed
parents about offers that can help them keep their children safe from
online dangers. Children were given crayons, stickers with characters
from Sheeplive.eu and a small coloring book containing a lot of tips.
That helped parents and children pass the time spent waiting at the
shop while teaching them about effective protection measures to keep
kids safe online and when using mobile communications.
Sheeplive.eu on tour
In 2014 Sheeplive.eu visited day care centers, orphanages (200
children during the summer break), Magio beach (with workshops for
children at day camps) and a Roma settlement in Kosice, where the
authors of the Sheeplive.eu book gave 100 Roma children important
safety tips at a reading. According to the results of a study, children
from disadvantaged backgrounds are more at risk.
The final highlight of the campaign was the book launch of Sheeplive.eu
02 in November 2014. A version of Sheeplive.eu cartoons for children
with hearing and sight impairments is also available. The series is
becoming increasingly popular and is very successful outside of
Slovakia as well.

Connected in the digital world

Access to the digital world primarily depends on having access to technology. By providing technical infrastructure and special rates, e.g., for
disabled people, Deutsche Telekom helps create equal opportunities.
The Telekom@School infrastructure project
During the reporting period, we extended our offer of free Internet
access within our Telekom@School initiative. We now offer schools the
opportunity to upgrade all of their existing connections to up to 16 Mbits
wherever technically feasible. The goal is to make it possible to use
digital media in class, so that teachers and students can take advantage
of the opportunities and perspectives offered by new technology.
Since 2000 Deutsche Telekom has been providing all 34,000 general
and vocational schools throughout Germany with Internet access free of
charge as part of its Telekom@School initiative. 30,000 of these schools
have DSL broadband connections. Depending on availability, schools
can order a Telekom@School connection at VDSL speeds.

So far 600 customers have taken advantage of the following plans:
 hello holnap! voice and data (including 100 hours of free phone
calls in the Magyar Telekom network and 1 GB data)
 hello holnap! SMS and data (including 1,000 SMS and 1 GB data)
Prepaid plans featuring discounts are offered as well. So far 2,200
customers have taken advantage of these offers.
The complete offer package was presented at Equal Opportunity Day
on May 5, 2014, at a round table of representatives from government
and media as well as people with disabilities.

Supporting technology to encourage digital
inclusion
In January 2014, the e-Macedonia foundation and the Open the Windows charity organization launched a six-month project, Computer –
A Window to the World, to help give children and people with disabilities
the opportunity for equal participation in the information society. The
goal was to enable as many disabled people as possible to use computers and online services. People with disabilities are often unable to
use standard computer technology, which excludes them from geting
involved successfully in all areas of life. For that reason, the first step
was to purchase supporting technology. The e-Macedonia foundation
donated 14,000 euros for this purpose.
Subsidized rates for people with disabilities
In the scope of the "hello holnap!" initiative, customers with disabilities
are offered subsidized rates and usage options in line with their particular circumstances. People with hearing or sight impairments, for
example, can choose between different volume levels, font sizes and
data packages. The plans were developed in collaboration with experts
from different NGOs. Participants included the Hungarian Association
for the Deaf and Hearing-Impaired (SINOSZ), the Hungarian Disabled
Association (MEOSZ), the Hungarian Association for the Blind and
Sight-Impaired (MVGYOSZ), the Hungarian Association for People with
Mental Disabilities (ÉFOÉSZ) and the Hungarian Autism Association
(AOSZ).

Ready for the future

Deutsche Telekom is dedicated to getting young people ready for the
future and promoting equal opportunities. We take different approaches
in our efforts. With our "Yes, I can!" initiative, for example, we help young
people from disadvantaged backgrounds improve their skills and give
them the opportunity to participate in a vocational training program
through our "My chance to get going" project.

improve their STEM skills. One excellent example is the Junior Engineer
Academy (JIA), a program founded in 2005 in which Deutsche Telekom
Stiftung helps secondary schools throughout Germany developing a
classic STEM profile. 70 schools throughout Germany were involved
in the JIA network by the end of 2014. The project has reached around
3,500 students since it was first initiated.

Skills development and professional orientation among students is a
focus of many projects we conduct at schools and universities. We also
live up to our corporate responsibility by training far more young people
than we actually need. We encourage young people to get involved in
their communities within the scope of initiatives such as our Enactus
university collaboration, a coaching offer for student community projects, and as a partner of the "Go your own way" program run by the
Deutschlandstiftung Integration foundation.

 Be a math whiz

"Yes, I can!" initiative
The "Yes I can!" initiative celebrated its five-year anniversary from June
20-23, 2014, in Berlin. More than 600 children and young people as
well as teachers from all over Germany attended the event. The initiative,
which was selected by the UN to be part of the UN World Decade of
Education for Sustainable Development, sponsors projects that use
a variety of means to encourage the development of key skills for a
successful life within the context of open youth work. In 2014, 200 new
projects were supported under the slogan “Living strong” with a funding
volume of more than 750,000 euros. Over the past five years, the initiative has reached more than 60,000 children and young people through
more than 700 projects with a funding volume of currently around four
million euros (as of 2014).
The celebrations began with the annual "Yes, I can!" Cup, in which
around 400 children and young people played against each other in
a soccer competition. In addition to the number of goals scored, the
conduct of the players, coaches and fans plays a role in who wins the
"Yes, I can!" Cup (fairplay). At the "Yes, I can!" Day held afterwards at
Deutsche Telekom’s Representative Office in Bonn, Telekom offered
workshops and presented projects to give visitors insight into the variety
of projects being sponsored. Accompanied by band performances at
the marketplace, guests could admire a replica of the ship sailed by
Christopher Columbus, which children and young people from the
Munich district of Hasenbergl spent the last two years building for their
playground, watch a self-made solar cooker in action or try their hand at
activities such as capoeira and poetry slamming at different workshops.
Deutsche Telekom Stiftung promotes STEM subjects
The Deutsche Telekom Stiftung foundation supports numerous projects
focusing on STEM subjects throughout Germany in order to get young
people excited about a career in one of these fields and to help them

With the cooperative project, "Be a math whiz," the Deutsche Telekom
Stiftung foundation hopes to make mathematics more accessible to
poorly performing students. Under the coordination of TU Dortmund
University, the project team develops, tests and publishes special
course material for middle-grade students. The German Center for
Mathematics Teacher Education (DZLM) also offers continued education courses throughout Germany in connection with the project.
Deutsche Telekom Stiftung has worked with the states of Berlin,
Brandenburg, North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein in
the project. Materials are published in these states and their impact
on students is then evaluated.
 MINTeinander project
The MINTeinander project was initiated in 2013 with the goal of teaching STEM skills to students from preschool through school-age using
course material developed within the context of the project. Around
135 day care centers, elementary schools and secondary schools work
in 35 networks with the materials, which were developed by a group of
experts at the University of Münster. After successfully introducing the
topic of magnetism in 2014, the project team is currently developing
course materials on floating and sinking as well as mechanics.
 Junior Science Café
How much research is involved in a smartphone? How will we be
communicating with each other in 20 years? In the Junior Science Café
(JSC) project conducted by the Deutsche Telekom Stifung foundation
in collaboration with the Wissenschaft im Dialog business initiative,
students aged 14 through 18 organize discussion panels with experts
where they can talk about science-related topics in a relaxed atmosphere. The main focus of the project is to encourage students to act
independently. They choose the topic and the experts and plan and
moderate the panel discussions, which introduces them to different
scientific topics. A total of three Junior Science Cafés were conducted
during the pilot project in 2014, focusing on issues involving the digital
society. The project was opened to secondary schools throughout
Germany in 2015.

Coaching for student social-welfare projects:
Enactus
Deutsche Telekom’s Center for Strategic Projects (CSP) has been
actively supporting the international student network, Enactus, for
several years. We coach teams of students from our two focal universities, the University of Wuppertal and the WHU Otto Beisheim School
of Management, on how to conduct their own projects and implement
their own business ideas in social and environmental fields.
The team we coach at WHU Vallendar continued to work on the project
it started in 2013 during the reporting period. The team wants to give
people with disabilities better opportunities on the job market by helping a social welfare organization build a job placement company for
people with disabilities.
The Mumo Kidz project being conducted by the Enactus team at the
University of Wuppertal set up an online cloud to function as an internal
organizational tool for a school in Nairobi to ensure a seamless transition when new teachers take on classes as frequently happens at
the school. More than 40 students from the University of Wuppertal
developed technological concepts for long-term aid for people in need
under the slogan "Technology inspires" and in collaboration with CSP.
"The first five are most important"
The United Nation’s Children’s Fund, UNICEF, and the T-Mobile for
Macedonia foundation are continuing their "The first five are most
important" project within the scope of their partnership. The goal of
the program is to raise people’s awareness of the importance of early
education for children. Children develop particularly quickly during the
first five years. It has been proven that children who attend preschool
are generally more successful later at school and in life. For this reason,
the joint initiative plans to open as many centers for early child development as possible in order to give children from disadvantaged backgrounds the same advantages as other children their age who attend
day care centers. The first new early child development centers are
being set up in rural areas because there are fewer facilities there than
in the cities. Eight of these centers have already opened and another
eight are scheduled to follow in 2015/2016. In 2014, the T-Mobile for
Macedonia foundation made its first donation of US$ 50,000 to finance
the new centers, also donating part of its revenue from text messages
sent on New Year’s Eve.

Their community volunteer efforts make our employees the most effective representatives of our values. Through their efforts, our employees
express our relationship to the community in which we live and
strengthen the sense of community we share. In addition to contributing
to the community, this is also beneficial to Deutsche Telekom’s reputation. Volunteering is also very beneficial when it comes to internal HR
development. It strengthens identification with the company, expands
each person’s horizon and has a positive impact on social skills and
teamwork.
That is why we give our employees the opportunity to volunteer for
community projects, preferably ones that focus on teaching media
skills. This is just another way in which we help simplify and enrich
the lives of those around us.
Management approach
Our engagement@telekom volunteer platform is based on two pillars:
 Corporate volunteering (supporting our employees in their
volunteering activities) and corporate giving (our donation activities)
 Long-term partnerships with non-profit organizations

We collaborate closely throughout the Group when it comes to our
social involvement and share experiences and best practices across
country borders. The success of our activities is gauged using the
Social Commitment ESG KPI.
At numerous Social Days we give our employees a chance to get
involved in social-welfare projects or environmental protection efforts,
often within the scope of our longstanding partnerships with non-profit
organizations. One of our focal points are projects that promote digital
education in which our core areas of expertise can be particularly
effective. Corporate volunteering is also an important component of

our training and development activities. The volunteer efforts of our
apprentices are given special recognition in our Group competition,
"Responsibility wins!".
Our corporate giving concept includes donations for aid organizations
worldwide, preferably those with which we have longstanding partnerships, and fast disaster relief. Our 11-year collaboration with Aktion
Deutschland Hilft, Germany’s relief coalition, is an excellent example.
Our Group donation policy outlines the framework for our activities.
The policy is currently being implemented internationally and adjusted
based on applicable national conditions such as tax law.
"Responsibility wins" competition
Assuming responsibility for the community is a key aspect of being an
apprentice at Deutsche Telekom. We encourage and reward the efforts
of our apprentices and students on cooperative study programs in our
annual internal competition, "Responsibility wins." Once again, a number of them participated in 40 projects throughout Germany in 2014;
the most impressive projects were recognized at an award ceremony.
Aktion Deutschland Hilft – disaster relief
Deutsche Telekom provided emergency relief in two cases, each time
supported by donation campaigns conducted by our employees, in the
eleventh year of our successful collaboration with Aktion Deutschland
Hilft, Germany’s relief coalition. In October 2014 we donated 50,000
euros to fight the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, calling on our employees to follow our example. We donated another 50,000 euros to aid
flood victims in parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia and Croatia. In
May 2014, these regions experienced the strongest rainfall they had
seen in 120 years, causing devastation to the area; roughly 60 people
died and more than 100,000 houses were destroyed. Our Croatian
subsidiary T-HT Hrvatski Telekom collaborated with other network
providers to provide victims from the region with free phone service,
text messaging and Internet access. Other Eastern European subsidiaries like Crnogorski Telekom in Montenegro, Cosmote in Romania
and Makedonski Telekom in Macedonia, were also involved in donation
drives.
Aktion Deutschland Hilft focuses a significant portion of their funds on
disaster recovery programs, an area in which Deutsche Telekom has
become more involved since 2014. We sponsor training programs on
disaster preparedness for people in the Philippines and Indonesia. The
program is run by two Aktion Deutschland Hilft member organizations.
The program pays particular attention to high-risk groups such as children and people with disabilities and focuses on training teachers
and getting the subject taught in elementary school. The project being
conducted by the organization in Haiti, which Deutsche Telekom also
supported in 2014, is even more extensive. In addition to training

helped locals create gardens at their homes and schools to improve
their nutrition.

2014 was the year of the highest engagement yet, with around 1,000
employees involved, help provided to some 30,000 children, and a
record sum of nearly 500,000 euros raised for War Child.

20 years DKMS, 10,000 employees typed, 100 lives saved
2014 was a special year for Deutsche Telekom’s collaboration with
DKMS, the German Bone Marrow Donor Center. The 10,000th Deutsche
Telekom employee was typed just in time for the collaboration’s 20th
anniversary. More than 70 typing drives were run in 2014. Since the
collaboration began, more than 100 Deutsche Telekom employees have
been able to serve as stem cell donors thanks to a matching profile in
the DKMS donor database. By donating stem cells, each one of those
employees gave leukemia patients the chance at a new life.

Sudan and South Sudan
In two countries devastated by 38 years of civil war, mass migration or
displacement of families means children are too far away from a school
to receive any education. With the support of T-Mobile War Child provides children in Sudan and South Sudan with some schooling via
T-Mobile Connect, a teaching and e-learning project. In 2014, a second
pilot project was conducted in which 600 children were involved.
E-learning Sudan has been chosen as one of only 14 showcase projects
worldwide for the UNICEF Innovation for Education.

As in past years, employees who donated stem cells or bone marrow
in 2014 were honored in December 2014 at an official event. Sandra
Bothur, Managing Director of DKMS, and Dietmar Welslau, CHRO at
Telekom Deutschland GmbH, thanked a total of 20 Telekom employees
for their donations.

Lebanon and the war in Syria
About 1.5 million Syrian children have fled the civil war in Syria to
neighboring countries such as Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan. Ever since
the beginning of the conflict, Syrian children have been severely
affected by illegal detainment, sexual abuse, and exposure to hostilities.
War Child now has 20 Safe Spaces for Syrian refugee children, and
2014 War Child provided psychosocial relief to 80,000 Syrian children
there. Parents and carers are also involved. A lion’s share of the money
T-Mobile Netherlands raised in 2014 is going to Lebanon.

Together we are stronger
For the ninth year in a row, T-HT Hrvatski Telekom hosted the successful
"Together we are stronger" competition to support projects and charities
that work to enrich people’s lives and promote community development.
T-HT Hrvatski Telekom has already donated more than HRK 7 million
(around 910,000 euros) within the scope of this initiative to support
220 projects. The projects focus on education for children and young
people, the health sector, care for senior citizens and patients, humanitarian efforts and the environment.

War Child particularly supports children in the following areas:

Donations in 2014 came to HRK 495,000 (approx. 64,350 euros) and
again went to organizations and institutions that support important local
causes. The competition ran from June through November 2014 and
focused on the following categories:
 Technology and communication: projects involving the use of
modern technology in the private and professional spheres
 Education and digitization: projects to improve quality of life
and encourage inclusion and equal opportunities
 Environment and progress: projects to protect the environment
456 projects participated in the competition in 2014. In the end, nine
charities from a variety of areas received financial support. The results
of their work were reviewed and published. All phases of the competition and, of course, the winners received extensive media coverage.
Supporting War Child
T-Mobile Netherlands’ partnership with and main sponsorship of the
NGO War Child helps children in war areas to enjoy education. This is
made possible through a grant, the provision of free consultancy, and
raising money through employee initiatives.

Cultural and sports sponsorship

Culture and sports are a source of pleasure, inspiration and also innovative strength for society. An inspiration to many people, they create
a sense of community and enable understanding across cultural and
political borders. As an international corporation, we feel that sponsoring cultural activities and sports is another element of our corporate
responsibility.
Management approach
Deutsche Telekom encourages variety in cultural expression throughout
the Group. In Germany, it is one of the leading sponsors of culture and
sports. As well as providing financial support, we offer our experience
in communication and marketing activities to support artists, athletes,
organizers and clubs. Regional involvement at our locations also plays
a key role.
Sponsoring music is a long-standing tradition at Deutsche Telekom and
a vital element in the company’s brand communication activities. We
want to give as many people as possible access to cultural events, thus
encouraging them to share thoughts and ideas. Our main sponsorship
focus is placed on events like the Beethovenfest and the International
Telekom Beethoven Competition Bonn, which gives a stage to up-andcoming pianists from all over the world.
Deutsche Telekom supports competitive and recreational sports
equally. Our sports sponsorship activities focus on soccer partnerships
with the DFB German Football Association, FC Bayern Munich and
other German major league soccer teams. Deutsche Telekom also
lays emphasis on those aspects of sports that foster community life.
We sponsor athletes supported by Stiftung Deutsche Sporthilfe, recreational and school sports projects as well as athletes with disabilities.
As a Bonn-based company, we also sponsor the Telekom Baskets Bonn
basketball team and the Bonn Marathon. We also encourage our
employees to participate in the city’s traditional annual run and in the
"Staying in shape in the winter" running for health program.
Encouraging enthusiasm for sports with the Telekom
Baskets
Ticket sweepstakes for the Telekom Baskets’ Eurocup matches
German and international top league basketball with a young audience
– the German Bundesliga and Eurocup home games of the Telekom
Baskets were again a sporting event highlight during the 2014/2015
season. Before the season got underway, Deutsche Telekom launched
its seventh Tix for Kids ticket sweepstakes. Participation was open to all
schools in Bonn. We raffled off two sets of tickets (2 x 30) for each home
game. The Telekom Baskets Bonn also asked large, medium-sized and
small businesses to get involved in ticket sponsorship for the 2014/15
Eurocup for social welfare institutions, school classes, club teams, or
work centers for disabled people. Deutsche Telekom itself donated an

additional 60 tickets to the Maria im Walde children and youth center.
Training with the Telekom Baskets: Baskets@school
In our Baskets@school initiative, we gave students in fifth grade and up
the chance to experience a different kind of basketball training. For the
2014/15 school year, we invited classes from the Bonn area and the
Rhein-Sieg-Kreis district to apply. Six players and the trainer of the
Telekom Baskets Bonn visited the winning classes and gave the students an introduction to the world of basketball. Visits are planned for
a total of six classes. After completing the training, each student
receives a Telekom Baskets t-shirt and, if they want, an autograph.
ANSTOSS! soccer initiative
The goal of the ANSTOSS! Telekom soccer initiative is to make new
experiences possible and encourage young talent. In this broad-based
project, Deutsche Telekom promotes soccer in the areas of amateur and
recreational sports, developing young talent and disabled sports.
"New sports experience" initiative
One main focal point of the program is the "New sports experience"
initiative in collaboration with the German National Paralympic Committee, the German Football Association (DFB) and the Sepp Herberger
DFB foundation, which celebrated its five-year anniversary in 2014.
The "New sports experience" program gives young people the chance
to try blind soccer out for themselves, coached by players from the
German blind soccer league. This not only gives young people a feeling
for how people with disabilities live but also helps develop coordination,
spatial orientation, a feel for the ball and their sense of hearing.
Since its beginning, the initiative has reached more than 85,000 young
people at more than 500 educational and sports facilities throughout
Germany. More than 70 training sessions were held within the scope
of the "New sports experience" initiative in 2014 alone.
Deutsche Telekom and the German National Paralympic Committee
also collaborated in creating course material for secondary schools.
The materials have been available as a free download on the Deutsche
Telekom homepage since March 2014. The material, which is entitled
"High performers with a disability", provides an overview of how diverse
disabilities can be as well as insight into how people with disabilities live
their daily lives. The goal is to teach students to approach people with
disabilities and accept them as members of their community.
"Stollenstrolche" – Germany’s top goals by kids Deutsche Telekom
celebrated the one-year anniversary of its "Stollenstrolche – Germany’s
top goals by kids" initiative in September 2014. The initiative awards a
prize of EUR 1,000 each month for the most unusual goals in amateur
soccer. The prize money goes into the winning team’s pot. Parents,

fest festival." Each year, this project gives one group of students the
chance to gain new knowledge and experiences and make contacts
as part of a real-life challenge.

Deutsche Telekom has been hosting targeted professional soccer training camps since fall 2014 under the Stollenstrolche initiative. Amateur
soccer enthusiasts ages twelve and under can experience exciting
soccer training sessions coached by former professional soccer players
while the club’s children and youth coaches receive exclusive theoretical and practical training.

Jazzfest Bonn festival
Deutsche Telekom was also once again the main sponsor of the Bonn
Jazzfest festival in May 2014, emphasizing the company’s commitment
to the city and the region through its involvement in cultural activities
and the community. Deutsche Telekom presented two concerts as a
sponsor, one of which was the highlight of the festival. Legendary saxophonist Wayne Shorter and his quartet performed at the Telekom Forum
under the slogan, Jazzfest Bonn meets Electronic Beats.

New online video program
Deutsche Telekom initiated its new video offer "Frag den Buschi" under
the Stollenstrolche initiative in 2014. Children can submit questions on
the topic of the month such as "Brazil is looking for the next soccer
World Champion." The most serious, funniest and silliest questions
are answered at the end of the month in a video by the program’s host,
Buschi (Frank Buschmann) in an entertaining way that is easy for children to understand.
Staying in shape in the winter
Deutsche Telekom has been sponsoring the Bonn Marathon since 2005
and combines its involvement in the marathon with its Germany-wide
prevention campaign, "Staying in shape in the winter." The program
gives Deutsche Telekom employees with and without running experience the opportunity to get themselves ready to participate in the Bonn
Marathon in April or in any other public or company runs within the
scope of a professional training program that starts in November.
Groups of runners throughout Germany with different experience levels
train at least once a week; groups of 40 participants or more can be
supported by an external coach if desired. The program also features
individual training plans and related events. More than 2,000 employees
from all over Germany participated in the training program in 2014 and
around 700 ran in the Bonn Marathon. In addition to its own employees,
Deutsche Telekom again entered the Sporthilfe Telekom team in the
race in 2014, this time strengthened by Olympic medal winner and
world champion Eric Frenzel. The team is a symbol of the partnership
between Deutsche Telekom and the Stiftung Deutsche Sporthilfe
foundationathletes to enable them to more fully focus on preparing
for their competitions.
A unique concert experience at the Beethovenfest
and Jazzfest festivals
Beethovenfest Bonn festival
Deutsche Telekom was once again the main sponsor of Bonn’s Beethovenfest festival in September and October 2014. As part of its sponsorship activities, Telekom presented three unique concerts: one with
the dynamic brass septet Mnozil Brass, one with The Brandt Brauer
Frick Ensemble, which plays electronic music on classical instruments
like the violin, harp and piano, and, last but not least, a concert with one
of last year’s winners of the International Telekom Beethoven Competition, young Australian pianist Stefan Cassomenos. The experimental
concert with The Brandt Brauer Frick Ensemble was organized by Bonn
secondary level students as part of an initiative also sponsored by
Deutsche Telekom entitled "School students managing the Beethoven-

Successful partnership with Junges Theater Bonn
The collaboration between Deutsche Telekom and Junges Theater
Bonn, which has been ongoing since 2004, was extended for another
three years in 2014. Over the past ten years, the theater has become
the most-visited children and youth theater in Germany with more than
138,000 visitors in the 2014 season alone. A special reduced-price
category for all afternoon and evening performances, the Telekom
€ 4 Ticket was introduced for children, young people and families.
Deutsche Telekom also donates around 700 tickets a year for children
and young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. The Junges
Theater Bonn launched a media school project sponsored by Deutsche
Telekom and designed to teach children at elementary schools about
the Internet, cell phones, social networks and data security in a way that
is fun and creative.
Sponsoring an exhibition at the National
Archaeological Museum and underwater excavations
OTE and COSMOTE sponsored an exhibition at the National Archaeological Museum entitled "The Antikythera Shipwreck: Ship, Treasures
and Mechanism," which opened in 2012. This exhibition is the first to
present almost all of the finds removed from the shipwreck in 1900 by
sponge divers.
The primary goal of these cultural sponsorship activities is to provide
cultural institutions in Greece with state-of-the-art technological infrastructure, services and expertise to help them preserve and care for
the country’s famous cultural heritage.
The two companies also sponsored archaeological excavations in the
ocean off the coast of Antikythera, which took place in September and
October 2014. The excavations were conducted by a team of international scientists from the Greek Ministry of Culture and the U.S.-based
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. OTE and COSMOTE provided
uninterrupted communications services in and outside of Greece to
meet the team’s telecommunications and PR needs and equipped the
island of Antikythera with a state-of-the-art telecommunications infrastructure.

Pioneering concepts for the workplace

Pioneering concepts for
the workplace
In 2014, we dedicated our HR work to five principal themes that
translate our HR vision into more specific terms: the HR Big 5.
HR Big 1 – Continue business-driven total workforce management.
One of today’s most important topics, and one that will remain a focal
point in years to come, is the transformation of our company and
making adjustments in line with new business models, a process we
fundamentally support through our transformation programs. We help
us adjust our workforce in line with our medium-term business plans.
In growth areas where new jobs have been created, we have also effectively implemented our "internal over external" HR initiative in Germany
in which we favor internal candidates when staffing new positions.
HR Big 2 – Encourage leadership and performance development.
The skills of our managers and the performance development of our
staff are two key success factors for us in global competition. That is
why we have realigned our leadership model and established consistent, Group-wide leadership principles. These principles particularly
address topics such as collaboration, innovation and empowering our
employees to perform. These activities are combined in our HR initiative
„Lead to win“.
HR Big 3 – Foster employability of our workforce.
The following initiatives play a key role in helping us achieve this strategic cornerstone:
 Education 3.0 is focused on expanding the expertise of our employees and driving forward training in the direction of skills that will be
in high demand in the future.
 Our diversity initiatives support various aspects of diversity at the
Group, from increasing the number of women in management positions and encouraging internationality to our comprehensive demographics and work-life management approach.
HR Big 4 – Increase organizational effectiveness
Increasing workloads and more diversified content continue to up the
bar in terms of what is expected of our employees. We help our employees respond quickly to changing requirements. Modern workstations,
working-time models and job structures form the basis of our concept
of flexible work environments.
HR Big 5 – We make it lean and simple.
Our fifth focus is about further improving the efficiency of our HR units
and continuously aligning our HR products and services with the needs
of the business. We also want to continue the process of harmonizing,
simplifying and integrating the IT used for HR processes.

Future Work supports modern job structures
The purpose of our Future Work program is to create a pioneering
concept for the work environment that promotes communicative, performance-oriented work as well as innovative strength and agility. Our goal
is to transform our corporate culture from one based on being at the
office to one based on results. We support this goal by offering modern
workplace structures. Open-plan offices and flexible desk sharing
options encourage cross-departmental collaboration and make employees more flexible in how they organize their everyday work. Following
a pilot phase started in 2013, the Deutsche Telekom Board of Management decided in September 2014 to roll out the Future Work program
throughout the Group.
Future Work at T-Systems in Munich
A successful Future Work project was launched at T-Systems Munich
in June 2014. A modern office environment featuring around 100 desksharing workstations and a variety of special working spaces like creative islands and retreat spaces was created at the offices on Dachauer
Straße. Together, up to 180 employees tested different modern workplace structures. Project participants were pleased with the results and
confirmed the positive effects of more flexible working structures on
their work-life balance and motivation. The project considerably
exceeded our Group-wide desk-sharing target ratio of 1 to 1.3, or ten
workstations for every 13 employees, a good sign for more Future Work
projects to come.
More innovation and co-creation with modern
educational formats
Deutsche Telekom plans to promote cross-departmental and crosscountry collaboration in virtual teams, intensify knowledge sharing
among our employees and encourage their entrepreneurial spirit and
innovative strength. We invited employees to attend our Group-wide
massive open online course (MOOC) from April through June 2014.
More than 3,600 employees from 27 countries signed up for the course
entitled "Share your ntrepreneurial spirit," which we conducted in
collaboration with Leuphana University of Lüneburg. Ideas for new
products and services to meet future customer requirements in an
increasingly digitized world were developed by 140 interdisciplinary,
international teams; the participants and selected external parties
evaluated the prototypes by providing feedback and contributing to
discussions in the online forum. At the end of the course, participants
had come up with 100 innovative ideas – including transforming old
phone booths into charging stations for e-cars, e-bikes and smart
devices, an app and cloud translation service for people with hearing
and speech impairments and a digital fashion consultant.

The innovative educational offer not only promotes personal development but also intensifies a corporate culture that lives from collaboration
and participation. The measurable results were positive as well. 72 percent of participants successfully completed Deutsche Telekom’s first
corporate MOOC; almost all of them (98 percent) said they would participate in a MOOC again.

Responsible employer

Maintaining relationships with our employees based on cooperation,
co-creation and fairness are fundamental when it comes to motivation
and incentive and are a major factor behind our attractiveness as an
employer and the loyalty of our employees. These relationships are
decisive in guaranteeing the long-term competitiveness of our company.

change processes during a major re-branding effort. Workshops and
ambassador programs eased their doubts and got them ready for the
changes. The national business unit in the UK has improved its employees’ work-life balance considerably with more flexible working hours
and more opportunities to work from home.

Management approach
As a responsible employer, we maintain trusting relationships with our
employees throughout the Group as well as with trade unions and
employee representatives and engage in extensive dialog with them.
This involves the works councils, the Central Works Council, the Group
Works Council and the Group representative for the disabled within
the Group in Germany, and the European Works Council at a European
level. We maintain constructive relationships based on mutual trust with
these three employee representative bodies.

Personnel restructuring at Group-level
The Group’s 2014 headcount was slightly below the figure for the end
of 2013. We saw some offsetting effects in our Germany, U.S., Europe
and Systems Solutions segments: We increased our headcount in our
operative segment in Germany by 3 percent, particularly in the wake of
restructuring and expanding our "networks of the future" business area.
In our operative segment in the U.S. the number of employees rose by
7 percent due to a growing customer base. In contrast, we experienced
a drop in headcount of around 2 percent in our Europe segment compared to December 31, 2013. This can partially be attributed to the sale
of shares in Euronet Communications in the Netherlands. Measures to
improve efficiency also resulted in decreases in Romania, Croatia and
Hungary. However, this development was partially offset by an increase
in headcount following the inclusion of the GTS Central Europe group
on May 30, 2014 as well as by growth following the staff restructuring
in Greece. A decrease in the employee headcount by approx. 4 percent
in our Systems Solutions segment can particularly be attributed to
domestic staff restructuring measures. Employee numbers decreased
by around 11 percent at Group Headquarters and Group Services. This
can particularly be attributed to deconsolidation of the Scout24 group
and staff restructuring measures.

Fair pay and benefits
We give our employees fair pay in line with the standard wages typical
to that country’s employment market and guarantee equal pay for work
performed by men and women without discrimination. We pay Deutsche
Telekom managers in compliance with our Group-wide Global Compensation Guideline. We also offer our employees additional benefits such
as our company pension scheme. We assess the effectiveness of our
pay and benefits elements by conducting various measures such as
employee interviews.
Socially acceptable staff restructuring
Our Group restructuring activities, which will help us stay competitive
in the future, were a central topic this past year and will continue to be
in years to come. These activities include complex staff restructuring
measures. Deutsche Telekom is committed to socially responsible
staff restructuring with the extensive support of our employees. These
measures are based on our integrated planning and management process, which the Board of Management annually reviews and approves.
We document the progress of our socially responsible staff restructuring
activities in our monthly Group reports.
Reviewing implementation of our Employee Relations
Policy
To help us effectively implement our Group Employee Relations Policy
(„Employee Relations Policy“), we conduct special reviews to assess
labor relations at the different national companies as well as any human
rights-related risks resulting from our business activities. In 2014 we
reviewed and analyzed implementation of the Employee Relations
Policy on-site at our subsidiaries in Mexico, Romania and the UK. The
results will be published on our homepage. In Mexico, for example,
we found fair employment conditions for subcontractors in compliance
with all regulations. Employees in Romania were effectively involved in

Socially responsible staff restructuring at
T-Systems
The transformation at T-Systems, which has been ongoing since 2014,
involves a complex staff restructuring process. Within the scope of these
activities, we made socially responsible adjustments to the T-Systems
employee headcount during the reporting period. The Group offered
support to employees whose positions were cut through a variety of
measures. This meant that we were able to avoid compulsory redundancies and set up our new business areas with qualified IT experts in
2014. We focused on the following measures:
Opportunities for civil servants
Deutsche Telekom, the German Federal Ministry of Finance and
Telekom Placement Services launched the "Chancen Bund" initiative
in April 2014. The regulations for this initiative were specified under the
guidance of the German Federal Ministry of Finance with the successor
companies of the former Deutsche Bundespost. The goal of this initiative is to fill up to 600 permanent IT positions at federal government
level throughout Germany with civil servants from Deutsche Telekom
by the end of 2015. Over the course of the year we were able to second

Employees

or transfer Deutsche Telekom IT experts for almost 300 positions; the
German Federal Ministry of Finance will open up a maximum of 300
more positions in 2015. Through these measures, we are able to make
socially responsible adjustments to our staff headcount and offer our
highly qualified civil servants throughout Germany secure employment
perspectives while helping the government meet its needs for IT
experts.
Innovative change management with Job Service & Placement
Our active change management program, Job Service & Placement
(JSP) was launched in 2014. In the program, we prepare employees
whose positions are scheduled to be cut or have already been cut for
employment opportunities within and outside of our company. We assist
them with professional location analyses, perspectives consulting and
application assistance; they can also receive compensation payments
when switching to an internal or external position with less favorable pay
and benefits. First priority is given to employees who use the JSP service
to fill jobs that are being advertised internally, and we offer them appropriate additional training of up to six months if necessary. JSP started
its work in Q4/2014. We also provide support to anyone whose position
has been cut through transparent communication, e.g., through our
event series, "On-site consultations on staff restructuring during the
transformation process."
New remuneration instruments for managers
At the start of 2015, we introduced new and revised reward instruments
for our top-level managers throughout the Group within the scope of
our "Lead to win" initiative. In addition to recognizing individual performance and contributions to the company’s success, the purpose of
these instruments is to encourage our managers’ entrepreneurial mindset. The new remuneration system has three focal points. Employee
performance from the previous year is rewarded within the scope of
variable short-term incentives. Long-term incentives are used to reward
employees for their contribution to the Group’s success. Our sharematching plan encourages employee co-ownership of the Group.
The rewards are directly related to the results of our new performance
assessment system, Performance Dialog. The new system is being used
globally for the 2,700 top-level managers at the Group.
Intensive dialog with employee representatives
We successfully continued our intensive dialog with employee representatives and trade unions in 2014. The year was characterized by
measures of far-reaching strategic significance such as the technological transformation with all-IP and restructuring T-Systems, none of
which could have been done without the collaboration of employee
representatives. Our commitment to trusted cooperation, which is
anchored in our Employee Relations Policy, has been very successful.
We will continue this approach of close partnership in 2015.

Health and safety

Maintaining a healthy, high-performing staff is the foundation of our
company’s long-term success, whereas high illness rates are linked to
high risks. Deutsche Telekom therefore feels that it is its duty and
responsibility to maintain and promote the health of our employees.

 The accident rate is considerably below the industry average.
 According to health insurance providers, the number of our employees suffering from mental disorders and the length of treatment is
not rising unlike the industry trend.

Management approach
The main goal of Deutsche Telekom’s health management system is to
maintain the health and performance levels of our employees. We see
the legal occupational safety and health provisions as minimum requirements.

Our internal and external audits also attest to our high standards. In
November 2014 we received the Corporate Health Award presented by
the leading German quality initiative for occupational health and safety
management.

Incorporating health and safety management throughout the Group
Our corporate occupational health and safety measures are effectively
incorporated into our corporate structures via certified management
systems and appropriate policies and guidelines. These are based on
the internationally recognized OHSAS18001 standard, which we began
rolling out throughout the Group in 2010. All of the parties, tasks and
measures involved in the health and safety management system are
described in a handbook and procedural instructions and have been
signed by the executive management. The topic is monitored and
managed at Group-level; health managers at each location are also
responsible for structuring the measures.

Felix Burda Award recognizes exemplary colon
cancer checkup offer
According to the Robert Koch Institute, colon cancer is one of the most
common causes of death by cancer in Germany; early diagnosis, however, means patients have good chances of getting better. That’s why
Deutsche Telekom has been offering its employees in Germany an
annual colon cancer checkup. All 70,107 employees age 45 and up
were sent an e-mail between March and May 2014 encouraging them
to get a checkup. 774of the 12,908 samples taken tested positive.
Deutsche Telekom’s prevention program was awarded the Felix Burda
Award in the "corporate prevention" category in 2014.

We systematically assess the effectiveness of our measures. This
includes reviewing the results or our employee survey, competitor
analyses and performance indicators. The analysis of this data forms
the basis for annual targeted measures that by far exceed legal requirements. Some examples include colon cancer checkups, blood pressure
testing and health checks and an extensive psychosocial counseling
offer.

Prevention campaign with blood pressure testing and
health checks
Roughly 35 million people in Germany suffer from high blood pressure
but only one out of every two is aware of this risk factor. Early diagnosis
and treatment of high blood pressure can decrease the risk of a stroke
by up to 40 percent. That is why Deutsche Telekom offered blood pressure testing for its employees at 84 locations in Germany from June
2013 through June 2014 as a way to prevent illnesses such as heart
and circulatory disease. More than 5,000 employees participated. We
offered employees with positive results a comprehensive health check
conducted by a company doctor; this enabled us to convince more
employees to take advantage of the preventative health measures our
company offers. In 2015 we will be addressing the topic of diabetes
within the scope of similar prevention measures.

One focus of our corporate health promotion activities is encouraging
our employees to assume responsibility for their own health. Our
managers play a key role in promoting a corporate culture in line with
these goals and are obligated to take this responsibility seriously.
Healthy leadership is a core value at Deutsche Telekom and is assessed
based on department-specific targets derived from the results of our
employee survey.
Above-average results
Different performance indicators reflect the effectiveness of our
corporate health management activities.
 The employee health rate of 94.4 percent at Telekom Deutschland
is stable unlike the current industry trend.

Fit and mobile at work
In June 2014 we began offering our employees at locations in Germany
special fitness programs to help counteract the effects of a day spent
working at their desks. Qualified mobile fitness coaches teach easy-todo exercises particularly for the back and neck to small teams of
employees. A total of 135 courses were conducted in 2014. Due to high
demand, we decided to continue this offer in 2015 and recommissioned the fitness coaches.

Workshop makes promoting health top priority
A corporate culture that promotes health needs role models. That is
why we introduced workshops on promoting health to our management
development program in Germany in May 2014. At the two-day workshops, managers first learn more about their own health and are taught
how to improve their individual resources. They then learn the basic
principles involved in a managerial approach to promoting health. This
offer addresses executives and experienced top-level managers; almost
100 participants have completed the program so far. We will be offering
this module several times in 2015 as well.
We also offer workshops on health and leadership for our other managers such as team leaders.

is planning to raise employee awareness of behavior that promotes
health and strengthen its health-oriented corporate culture at all
locations in Germany with its call for submissions to participate in
the Customer Service Health Award competition.
This popular annual team competition was held in 2014 for the third
time. Health Award teams had to conduct health-promoting measures
from October through December and regularly document their progress
in a journal. They also had the opportunity to present and discuss their
activities on our internal Telekom Social Network (TSN). The participants came up with, planned and conducted all of the measures themselves.

 In collaboration with prevention service provider B.A.D., we offered
counseling days at 19 locations in Germany. A total of 88 employees
attended a one-hour counseling session at these events. Another 38
sessions were scheduled for 2014.
 We also met in small groups with a total of 770 employees whose
positions are scheduled to be cut at 13 locations in Germany to talk
about opportunities for change. They also had the chance to speak
face-to-face with contacts from our human resources department as
well as impartial external consultants about which staff restructuring
tools are available, what support they are entitled to in their job
search, financial planning options and counseling offers.
Extensive health promotion at Slovak Telekom
In 2014 Slovak Telekom organized numerous health offers for
employees including measuring blood pressure and cholesterol levels,
varicose vein check-ups, first-aid courses, massages, lymph drainage,
health seminars and informational events on eating healthy at work.
The offers were very popular. 2,017 employees had check-ups and
865 employees participated in the 15 health seminars and workshops
hosted by nutrition experts, doctors and other professionals. A special
health week was conducted from September 8 - 12, 2014.

Around 1,770 customer service employees, or 13 percent, participated
in the Telekom Health Award competition in 2014. 101teams submitted
at least one journal. That means that the number of participants who did
not submit journals has fallen from 28 to 16 percent within a period of
three years. The measures that participants conducted were judged
based on how effectively they could be integrated into everyday work
routines. The type of documentation was also taken into consideration.
60teams documented their results in a report in which they assessed
the success of the measures. 56 of them said they would participate in
the competition again and 55 continued to integrate the measures into
their everyday work routines even after the competition was over.
Psychosocial counseling to help employees deal with
change at the company
Pending changes at companies can cause deep-seated insecurity and
anxiety, particularly in cases where employees feel they are at the mercy
of those changes. If this state of affairs continues over a longer period of
time, there is a risk that a permanently increased stress level can have a
direct effect on a person’s physical health.
In order to prevent psychosocial crises over the course of the transformation at T-Systems, the company is offering its employees support in
every phase of the change process in the form of targeted counseling
offers. We visited a number of locations in 2014.

Education and development

Education and development

Our extensive training and continuing education offers do more than
just actively make sure we have access to plenty of skilled employees.
They also show that we take our corporate and social responsibility
seriously. The need for well-trained employees is going to increase
significantly in years to come. This particularly applies to our future
business areas such as big data, cyber security and Industry 4.0.

Our standardized, Group-wide leadership model, "Lead to win" also
helps improve the skills and performance of our managers. Essentially,
"Lead to win" focuses on a continuous exchange between managers
and their supervisors about performance and development issues,
a direct link between performance assessment and incentives, and
personal development paths.

Management approach
Our goal is to identify and get talented young people on board early
on in their careers. That is why we extensively support their training and
continued education. We specified a trainee ratio of 2.9 percent of our
employees in Germany each year until 2015. This made us one of the
largest vocational training providers in Germany. We currently offer
openings for ten vocational training programs and eight cooperative
degree programs. We also offer a large number of training and development opportunities for our experts and managers. With these offers,
Deutsche Telekom supports the concept of life-long learning.

Our Guiding Principles, Leadership Principles and Employee Relations
Policy are the cornerstones of these activities.

Our Education 3.0 initiative, which we launched in 2014, takes a look
at the entire educational chain to help us structure our offers according
to current skills requirements, from vocational training and continuing
education programs for professionals to expert development programs.
With these activities we make sure that our investments in education
generate the most added-value possible for both the company and
our employees. We never forget the Group’s strategic skills requirements when creating our training and continuing education offers,
as our training program for cyber security professionals, which we
launched in 2014, shows.

Deutsche Telekom’s in-house university encourages
interest in STEM subjects
The company’s own HfTL University of Applied Sciences in Leipzig is
involved in a variety of projects focused on educating experts to work
in the telecommunications market and on encouraging young people to
pursue careers in the STEM subjects. The university currently employs
27 professors and offers a current 1,032 students the opportunity to get
a degree in the area of information and communications technology.
HfTL offers full-time, cooperative and part-time degree programs
throughout Germany and boasts a unique program with specialization
in topics such as cloud computing, data privacy, connected life, app
development and machine-to-machine communication. The university is
also planning to add a cooperative degree program in applied computer
science to its portfolio in 2015.
In order to encourage students to focus on STEM subjects, HfTL
founded the Leipzig Academy for School Students in collaboration
with the Arnold Sommerfeld Society in 2010. The university supports
the academy by providing the university infrastructure and hosting
expert lectures. Students grades 9 and up can attend lectures on
natural sciences and technology and discuss these subjects with
experts. Topics in 2014 ranged from climate research to new materials
being used to make bicycles.
To promote STEM subjects HfTL also gives children and young people
an idea of what it is like to study these subjects and later work in a
related profession. This includes an opportunity for secondary school
graduates to attend the university for several days, a children’s university
where kids get the chance to conduct age-appropriate experiments and
the Junior Engineer Academy, a student project financed by the
Deutsche Telekom Stiftung foundation.

We systematically monitor and continually evaluate the effectiveness of
our training and development measures using tools such as our regular
employee surveys.

In 2015, HfTL will again participate in the computer science category
of the experiNat sciences competition held by the Leipzig public utilities
company. Around 300 school students will get to know Deutsche
Telekom’s university during the competition.

Encouraging young women professionals
Deutsche Telekom has taken many steps in Germany, such as systematically adjusting our hiring and staffing processes, to get more women
interested in technical careers. We optimized our most important channel for job applications, our careers website, to address female applicants, making the topic more visible and emphasizing its relevance.
Deutsche Telekom also advertises explicitly for female students and
graduates, represents the company at a number of women’s trade fairs
and offers application workshops especially for women. Exclusive workshops for female students and graduates at CeBIT and the Graduate
Conference complete our offer tailored especially to women. Growing
applicant numbers show that Deutsche Telekom is becoming increasingly attractive as an employer for both men and women.
Deutsche Telekom has also been presenting the annual Women’s STEM
Award since 2013 to get women interested in STEM subjects. In 2014,
we once again recognized six graduates for their excellent final papers
in STEM subjects. To qualify for the award, the papers had to address
one of Deutsche Telekom’s five growth areas. The winning paper on
"Cell Size Adaptation and Intercell Interference Coordination in LTE
Heterogeneous Networks" received a prize of 3,000 euros and an
additional paper in each of the five categories received 500 euros.
Start up!: Trainee program for young innovators
With our international trainee program, Start up!, we offer young people
with entrepreneurial spirit and the willingness to develop an excellent
opportunity to join our company in Germany. Not only does Start up!
help secure new talent, it also promotes a shift toward a more innovation-oriented corporate culture at Deutsche Telekom.
In 2014 we again accepted approx. 40 university graduates into our
trainee program, 40 percent of whom were women. During a period
of 15 to 18 months, the trainees got to know different areas of the
company in Germany and abroad and were put in charge of challenging
project activities in various business areas. Experienced mentors
encourage the trainees, and innovative training formats and events
complete the program.
Top employer ranking
Deutsche Telekom is one of Germany’s largest training openings
and once again was placed high in the ranks among the DAX-listed
companies in 2014. In training year 2014/2015, we had more than
8,900 apprentices and students in cooperative degree programs.

95

 Since 2011 the company has been collaborating with the German
Federal Employment Agency to offer single parents the opportunity
to complete a training program or cooperative degree program
part-time. Around 50 young people began their part-time training
in 2014.
 We provide opportunities to young people from migrant backgrounds who are faced with particular problems on the job and
vocational training market. Eight percent of our trainees and
students in cooperative degree programs have a nationality
other than German, representing a total of 69 other countries.
 "My chance to get going", our entry-level training project, gives
young people who got off to a difficult start, are unemployed or
come from families that rely on welfare pursuant to the German
Social Code and have limited career perspectives because of learning disabilities or because they do not qualify for training programs
an excellent chance for an apprenticeship at Deutsche Telekom. Of
the 458 interns who participated in the program between 2009 and
2013, 326 have already started a training program at our company;
76 of them started with the first training year and 250 were accepted
directly into the second year. Another approx. 100 interns started
the program in 2014.
 By supporting women in technical cooperative degree programs,
we promote talented young people for the future as well as diversity
at the Group. While in 2010 only 11 percent of the positions at our
company were held by women, today more than 23 percent of our
staff are women.
 Around one percent of young people with disabilities pursue their
training at our company. This is above-average in view of the total
number of disabled people in Germany.
Our Young IT Talents and Young Sales Talents programs support highperforming apprentices and students in cooperative degree programs
who are focusing on one of our growth areas. Participants of both programs have the opportunity to tackle challenging customer projects and
extend their skills at expert and training events, and in national and
international competitions.

We offer ten vocational training programs and eight cooperative degree
programs with eight partner universities and other educational institutions for young people interested in careers in these fields. Our apprentices are trained at 33 training centers throughout Germany.

Training program for cyber security professionals
Deutsche Telekom is closing a gap on the German vocational training
and job market with our training program for cyber security professionals, which was launched in 2014 within the scope of a pilot project.
According to a study by the BITKOM industry association, IT data
privacy experts are extremely hard to find on today’s market. The study
found that there were no vocational training programs and very few
degree programs that people could attend to learn the necessary skills
needed. That is why Deutsche Telekom decided to launch the first
round of this development program with 10 participants in September
2014.

Encouraging diversity among our trainees
Diversity is very significant to the Deutsche Telekom Group. That is why
we encourage diversity among our trainees in Germany by addressing
a variety of performance levels and needs.

The cyber security professional program runs for two-and-a-half years
and was created for apprentices and students in cooperative degree
programs at Deutsche Telekom who can apply after completing their
current training. The program combines classic further training with

 Over 7,400 are apprentices
 Around 1,400 are students on cooperative degree courses
 Roughly 100 are participants in our entry-level training scheme.

study modules and learning phases at the company. Those who complete the course receive a certificate for IT security professionals from
the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce. We put out a call for
applications for another ten positions in our cyber security professional
program in 2015.
Bologna@Telekom part-time degree course as
a success story
With its „Bologna@Telekom“ initiative, the Group offers grants to particularly high-performing employees to help them take a degree course
along with their work. The initiative has grown impressively in the six
years since it was launched. While the first semester in 2009 got underway with only 60 participants, Deutsche Telekom welcomed its 1,000 th
student in 2014. More than 90 percent of participants complete the
program.
The content of Bologna@Telekom is adjusted annually in line with the
Group’s requirements, therefore helping Deutsche Telekom cover its
need for skilled employees over the long term. IT security was recently
introduced to the program.
To qualify for the Bologna@Telekom program, applicants need to exhibit
particularly high performance and to have been with the Group for at
least two years. Deutsche Telekom pays half of the courses fees and
gives grant recipients ten extra days off a year. The results of Bologna@
Telekom are impressive: A survey of graduates conducted at the end
of 2014 showed that the program already had a positive impact on the
careers of around half of the graduates; 88 percent would decide to
participate in the program again.
Group-wide talent platform supports internal
careers
With our Group-wide talent management activities we help high-performing employees tackle new challenges. We added the pilot version
of a new online platform to these activities during the reporting period.
Since March 2014, talented people who are planning the next step in
their careers or want to gain experience working on strategic projects
have had the opportunity to increase their chances of getting noticed
on our Talents@Telekom platform. With the platform, we hope to
raise awareness of the talent available at the Group and improve their
development opportunities.
Talented employees interested in new opportunities can introduce themselves and post their resumes on the online platform, while human
resources employees throughout the Group can use the platform to
get in touch with them. A special section addresses female candidates
and provides them with information about their career opportunities.
Talents@Telekom has met with great response. More than 800 employee
profiles were created in only two months, 28 percent by women. More
than 300 employees from HR units throughout the Group are already
using the pilot version of the online platform.

Management development program expanded
We extensively advanced our Leadership Excellence and Development
(LEAD) program in 2014 and modified it in line with the challenges our
managers currently face. For the first time, all managers at the Group
have access to a standardized offer of business-based, strategically
relevant learning formats. The portfolio covers central topics that support managers in furthering business activities as well as in their roles
as leaders and team managers. The program is based on our leadership
principles "Collaborate," "Innovate" and "Empower to perform."
Information from interviews conducted with managers was taken into
account when designing the program. Manager training is conducted
using modern learning formats that combine attendance courses with
e-learning forums. Managers throughout the Group can use the Open
LEAD portal, which was launched in October 2014, to learn more about
the offer and sign up for the development measures that are right for
them.
New performance assessment tool for executives
In May 2014 we introduced a new tool for assessing the performance
of top-level managers, the Performance Dialog tool. This new tool has
replaced the Performance & Potential Review previously used for this
target group.
The Performance Dialog includes ongoing dialog between executives
and their superiors. Working together closely with their superiors and
reflecting intensively on their own leadership style is expected to
improve the performance of our executives and make the assessment
process more transparent. The Performance Dialog is based on our
Guiding and Leadership Principles. In addition to being reviewed
by their superiors, their colleagues and employees also assess the
#executives’ leadership style. These reviews have a direct impact on
#target achievement. The review within the scope of the Performance
Dialog forms the basis of our new Rewards system.
Around 500 top-level managers are currently being assessed using the
Performance Dialog tool. Our „Compass“ tool for assessing employees
covered by collective agreements and civil servants in Germany and our
„Performance & Potential Review“, which we rolled out internationally
#in 2014, continue to be used throughout the Group. Roughly 20,000
experts and managers from our national companies had already been
incorporated into the Performance & Potential Review process by the
end of 2014.

An analysis shows that Talents@Telekom considerably simplifies crossGroup staffing processes and particularly increases the chances of
talented female employees getting noticed. The platform contributes
significantly to diversity at the Group. The Group-wide rollout is scheduled for 2015.

Diversity and equal opportunities

Diversity and equal opportunities

People from 122 countries, women and men, young and old as well as
people with different abilities and cultural backgrounds work together
effectively at Deutsche Telekom. This diversity is key to helping us stay
competitive in the global competition for good ideas and the best
products.
Management approach
We are planning to advance our policies on improving diversity at our
company and are offering our employees a variety of opportunities
to grow both professionally and personally. Putting more women into
management positions plays a key role in our efforts. We are the first
DAX 30 company to commit to staffing 30 percent of our mid and upperlevel management positions worldwide with women. Our Fair Share
initiative is designed to help us achieve this goal. We promote diversity
among our staff from the very beginning with our extensive promotion
and training programs. This includes our entry-level training program for
young people from disadvantaged and weak educational backgrounds.
We help our employees create an effective work-life balance with our
extensive work-life portfolio. Many of our employees are also involved in
internal networks that address various aspects of diversity. Our managers encourage diversity at the Group by getting involved in multiplier
and mentor programs, for example.
These activities are based on Deutsche Telekom’s Diversity Policy,
Guiding Principles and Employee Relations Policy. We are also a founding member of the Diversity Charter.
We regularly review the effectiveness of our measures to promote diversity and publish the results in our Fair Share and Work-Life reports.
More than 25 percent of our managerial positions are currently held by
women. The number of managers working part-time and the number
of fathers taking advantage of parental leave continues to grow as well.
The number of disabled employees working throughout the Group puts
us well over the statutory quota of 5 percent.
Participating in the second German Diversity Day
In 2014 Deutsche Telekom again participated in the Germany-wide
activity day held by the Diversity Charter association, the second
German Diversity Day. With more than 600 initiatives and around 350
participating companies and organizations, the event again met with
tremendous response. One particularly successful initiative was coordinated by Deutsche Telekom trainees who organized a children’s
Olympics for a total of 50 children with and without disabilities ages 12
to 15. On the evening before the event, Chief Human Resources Officer,
Dr. Thomas Kremer, invited the representatives of Deutsche Telekom’s
internal employee networks to meet and discuss the topic of "Diversity
as a success factor – how diverse is Deutsche Telekom?".

Deutsche Telekom also called for submissions for an ideas competition.
Under the slogan "It’s normal to be different," employees were asked
to submit ideas for putting diversity into practice every day at work
and raising employee awareness of the topic. A total of 166 ideas were
submitted during the four-week submission period; ten could be
implemented right away. The winners were praised by Chief Human
Resources Officer, Dr. Thomas Kremer. Deutsche Telekom is planning
to participate in German Diversity Day again in 2015.
Call for more diversity in training programs
In November 2014, 19 major corporations, all members of the Diversity
Charter association, in collaboration with Federal Commissioner
for Immigration, Refugees and Integration, Aydan Özoğuz, called for
employers in Germany to see diversity as an opportunity and steer away
from choosing trainees based on stereotypes and prejudice. Deutsche
Telekom also signed the petition. With various programs, the company
has already made diversity a permanent feature in the support it provides for its apprentices. The call for more diversity is based on an evergrowing lack of apprentices, which, according to a current study by the
German Chamber of Industry and Commerce, affects more than every
second company in Germany.
Awards for diversity at T-Systems
T-Systems South Africa
T-Systems South Africa was recognized for the fifth time for its diversity
achievements in August 2014 with the „Gender Mainstreaming Awards“.
It received first place in the following categories: Women on Board,
Gender and Poverty Alleviation and Investing in Young Women. It won
second place for its efforts to improve the role of women. In addition
to its success in four of the five categories reviewed, T-Systems South
Africa also won the Gender Mainstreaming overall award.
We were particularly pleased to be recognized for T-Systems’ volunteer
efforts to get more women into management positions. Three of
T-Systems South Africa’s five-member Managing Board have been
women since February 1, 2014. Winning the Gender and Poverty
Alleviation Award is also a special achievement. The award recognizes
excellent efforts to fight poverty with particular emphasis on supporting
and encouraging women. By presenting the award to T-Systems South
Africa, the jury recognized the company’s participation in establishing
the Hazyview Digital Learning Centre (HDLC) in Mpumalanga. The
center is mostly visited and operated by women and teaches students
from the region key skills in areas such as IT, tourism and English.

T-Systems Singapore
T-Systems Singapore has been recognized for its diversity and inclusive
policies in the past. In March 2014, the national company and seven
other companies received the 2014 „Exemplary Employer Award 2014“
from the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices. To win the award, companies had to undergo a rigorous selection
process with interviews and on-site facility visits.
Equal opportunities for people with disabilities
With a wide range of offers to support people with disabilities, we help
create equal opportunities for them and get them involved in the community. For years we have been exceeding the statutory minimum ratio
of disabled employees of 5 percent, which puts us at the top of the DAX
30 companies; currently, 7 percent of our workforce in Germany are
people with disabilities. In 2014 we expanded our existing portfolio of
supporting measures: We included a videophone feature in our system
to make communication easier for employees with hearing impairments.
We also introduced a special service that makes assistive computer
technologies easier to use for our blind and visually-impaired employees.
Demographic change as an opportunity
In order to tap the potential of an employee age composition that s
pans several generations, we established a work group in 2013 that
specifically deals with the following demographic issues:






Encouraging lifelong learning and the exchange of know-how
Preserving and promoting health
Supporting an age-sensitive leadership culture
Developing a flexible working environment for all life phases
Forecasting age-specific headcount development

Our management culture plays a key role in introducing demographyrelated changes. In the scope of different development programs, we
inform our managers about the potential of older employees and about
collaboration across generations. We also adjust our continuing education offers to fit the preferred learning methods of different generations. The adjustments are made in accordance with the findings of a
study that was conducted by Telekom Training according to which an
employee’s history as a learner, which also indirectly relates to age,
plays a key role when it comes to acquiring knowledge (e.g., type of
learner, learning methods and learning preferences).
Initiative to boost the number of women in managerial positions
We were the first of the DAX 30 companies to introduce a quota for
women in managerial positions at our company. Since then, the share
of women in managerial positions at Deutsche Telekom increased from
19 percent (February 2010) to 25.6 percent (December 2014).
 On our supervisory boards, the share of women rose from 7.4 percent to 22.6 percent at an international level and from 17.7 percent
to 28.1 percent in Germany.
 The number of women on international management teams below
the Group Board of Management level rose from 2 to 8 out of a total
of 55.

98

 At T-Systems we were also able to increase the share of women in
middle and upper managerial positions within four years from 12.1
percent to 15 percent in 2014.
Our commitment to increasing the proportion of women is being consistently anchored throughout the Group. The most innovative measures
introduced this year included the launch of our Talents@Telekom platform, which improved the visibility of our up-and-coming female talent at
the Group, our program to get women ready for a position on the supervisory board and an initiative to launch an e-mentoring program that
enables nearly real-time mentoring.
Getting women ready for the supervisory board
We are the first DAX-listed company to introduce a program that gets
women ready for a position on the supervisory board. The program
was launched in November 2014. The goal of the three-tier training
program, which was developed in cooperation with the European
School of Management and Technology (ESMT), is to bring together
a pool of women who could potentially assume a position on the supervisory board at a Deutsche Telekom company in Germany and abroad.
The two-day training sessions were launched in December with 29
women from different countries and business segments. The program
will run through July 1st. In addition to traditional content, the training
also gives insight into practical experiences presented by supervisory
board members, case studies from the Group and simulated supervisory board meetings.
Currently, the share of women on the supervisory boards of our Group
companies in Germany and abroad comes to over 25 percent. Overall,
there is a total of almost 260 seats on supervisory boards throughout
the Group.
Mentoring program for experts and managers on
parental leave
We expanded our multi-faceted mentoring programs for different target
groups to include an additional special offer in 2013. In October 2014,
we launched the second round of our mentoring program, which was
initiated in 2012, targeted toward young talent in expert and managerial
positions who are planning to take or are currently on parental leave
or have just returned to work. During all of these phases, they have
the chance to get advice from a senior manager mentor. In 2014, 31
tandem teams, i.e., a total of 61 employees, took part in the program
(36 tandem teams participated in the last round). The program lasts
approx. 18 months.
The poll conducted upon completion of the first round found that
participants were very happy with the new model; almost 20 percent
were even able to advance their careers during parental leave.
Managers as messengers for flexible working
models
In order to further introduce flexible working models at the company,
Deutsche Telekom called upon all of its top-level managers in Germany
to participate in a pilot project dealing with flexible working models.
82 managers agreed to take advantage of one of the numerous flexible
working models offered, including part-time, home office and parental
leave.

Most participants were able to improve their own work-life balance
during the pilot project by significantly reducing conflicts between their
professional and private lives. On the basis of the managers’ experience, participants were able to improve current measures and come
up with recommendations. The University of Cologne provided the
academic support for this project. As messengers for flexible working
models, managers take on a key role in establishing a culture that is less
characterized by the physical presence of employees and more focused
on goal achievement.
Communication campaign regarding offers to improve
work-life balance
Within the scope of a communication campaign, we are trying to raise
awareness and acceptance of measures to improve work-life balance
and to initiate an open discussion about current challenges in this area.
Dr. Thomas Kremer, interim Chief Human Resources Officer, got the ball
rolling in September 2014 on Deutsche Telekom’s internal social network (TSN). The initiative met with great response. In February 2015,
a new intranet portal was launched featuring target group-specific
information about various offers. We also created an information leaflet
for employees and applicants and a movie on work-life balance. The
campaign will be expanded in 2015 with the goal of raising even more
awareness of our work-life balance offers.

Employee satisfaction and participation

Employee satisfaction and
participation
Deutsche Telekom’s goal is to become the leading telecommunications
provider in Europe. A key aspect in achieving this goal is to have a highperforming organization with dedicated, healthy employees. As a
responsible employer we take the concerns of our employees seriously.
We want them to fully realize their personal strengths at our Group.
Listening to our employees and their ideas is a key element for us in
strengthening our innovative culture and in consistently improving our
processes and services.
Management approach
We pursue open dialog and productive exchange with our employees.
A key element in this is our Telekom Social Network (TSN), which allows
our managerial staff to engage in direct dialog with our employees. Our
employee survey is an essential feature through which our employees
have the chance to provide feedback. It also helps to identify important
aspects for health and getting involved in organizations. We also
conduct bi-annual "pulse surveys" to capture up-to-date Group-wide
sentiment, and we work to consistently improve our group-wide ideas
management efforts. We also offer our employees many different ways
to get involved, e.g., in the form of corporate volunteering projects.
These projects are based on our Group-wide Guiding Principles and
our Employee Relations Policy.
Our employees have been showing an ever-increasing interest in getting involved in both our Group-wide employee survey and our ideas
management initiative. With a participation rate of 70 percent, the 2014
Group-wide pulse survey once again saw the number of participants
rise compared to the previous year, and so did the general satisfaction
level identified in the 2014 pulse survey. With a total of ten ideas per
100 employees, we also recorded the highest number of submitted
ideas. With these ideas we have been able to generate 107 million
euros in the form of cost reductions and increased revenues.
A finger on the company’s pulse: our employee
surveys
The opinions of our employees play a key role in the evolution and
transformation of our companyl. That’s why we regularly ask our employees questions about relevant issues that have an influence on motivation and health at organizations. Our most important instruments
include the regular, Group-wide employee surveys and bi-annual pulse
surveys that give us an idea of current sentiment. These surveys allow
us to monitor the effectiveness of the follow-up measures introduced in
the scope of the employee survey and to identify areas where there is
still room for improvement.

Both instruments have met with great response. Around 70 percent
of our employees participated in our latest pulse survey in November
2014. Overall, the results generated have been either positive or very
positive. They have improved year-on-year (November 2013 - November
2014) in particular when it comes to accepting change in the Group
and understanding the corporate strategy. The next Group-wide
employee survey will be conducted in April/May 2015.
High turnout for Group-wide ideas management
Ideas management plays a key role when it comes to pushing innovation efforts at our company. Many employees once again participated
in 2014. In Germany alone, one out of every ten employees submitted
an idea to the Group-wide ideas management program. This shows
our employees’ strong interest in actively playing a part in improving
our products and services. The economic benefit resulting from the
13,231 ideas submitted translated into a total of 107 million euros in
cost savings and tapping new business potential. We also promote
our ideas management program at special events, e.g., at the second
German Diversity Day held on June 3, 2014.
New program launched to involve former employees
With our "Future needs roots" program, Deutsche Telekom plans to
intensify its efforts to honor the contributions and loyalty of our more
than 130,000 former employees who are now retired. We want to keep
in touch with our former employees and benefit from their know-how
and ideas.
In July 2014, Timotheus Höttges, CEO, called on all former Deutsche
Telekom employees to sign up on a website where they can get involved
in different areas, including local events with managers, expanding the
online offer for former employees and participating in product launches
and tests. They are also given the opportunity to subscribe to a newsletter and the employee magazine. On the basis of the feedback provided, we will work together with the participants to further advance
the program and make it a perfect fit for the wishes and interests of
the target group.
With around 15,000 people signed up and more than 750 questions
and suggestions submitted, interest in the "Future needs roots" program
is very strong. We send out our newsletter and employee magazine on
a regular basis; first local networking meetings have been planned.

According to the robecosAm rating, deutsche telekom is an
industry leader in sustainable supply chain management.
iCt products are often produced in countries where employee rights
and environmental standards are not a given. as one of the largest
telecommunications providers worldwide, deutsche telekom works
systematically toward creating a sustainable iCt supply chain. the basis
for this are reliable, long-term relationships with our suppliers and a
series of tried-and-trusted instruments, methods and measures.
we make a point of involving our stakeholders in our processes. as
the basis for our sustainability management strategy, we therefore systematically collect the topics that are of material interest to our stakeholders and to us. you can view the results of our survey here (as of february

other iCt products. as one of the largest telecommunications service
providers worldwide with more than 30,000 suppliers in over 80 countries, we take this issue seriously. we use effective management tools to
make sure our suppliers and manufacturers provide humane working
conditions and are involved in effective environmental protection.

the telekom fraud policy,
the Coltan Statement,
the Statement on extractives and
the Cr clause in our general terms and Conditions for purchasing.

with our Social Charter, we have made a commitment to complying
with the fundamental principles and standards set forth by the international labour organization (ilo) and the organisation for economic
Cooperation and development (oeCd) as well as with the universal
declaration of human rights and the un global Compact.
Commitment to sustainable procurement
our strategy for realizing sustainable procurement practices is based
on our Cr strategy and has been effectively incorporated into our
procurement processes. the Sustainable procurement working group
(Spwg) develops recommendations on how to best implement our
sustainable procurement strategy and assists our employees in their
procurement decisions. the heads of the Cr and procurement divisions
together carry general responsibility for the implementation of sustainable procurement practices. they report directly to the board of
management member for human resources and finance, respectively.
our escalation process calls for decisions to be made at board of
management level in serious cases. we have also specified sustainable
procurement requirements for the Joint Venture buyin.
we have incorporated our sustainability principles into the group’s
global procurement policy to provide orientation for our buyers. the
accompanying procurement practices provide instructions on how to
conduct procurement transactions at deutsche telekom. an e-learning
tool is available to train our employees in this respect. an updated
version of the tool was released in 2014. our buyers can, for example,
use the tool to learn how to implement our sustainability principles in
their daily business activities.

mAnAgement ApproAch
one of telekom’s aims is to constantly improve the sustainability of its
value chain. we have laid the foundation for this with our sustainable
procurement strategy. we adhere to principles for socially and environmentally friendly procurement throughout the group and manage our
processes with the help of internal and external performance indicators
and management tools.
Fundamental norms and standards
telekom has created social and environmental minimum standards for
its corporate governance through its guiding principles and voluntary
commitments. we also require our suppliers to comply with these standards. we use the following documents to guarantee compliance:

promoting sustainability with the sustainable procurement esg kpi
we use the Sustainable procurement eSg key performance indicator
(eSg kpi) to measure and manage our sustainability performance in
procurement. this kpi measures the ratio between the procurement
volume we receive from suppliers whose compliance with social and
environmental criteria has been verified through self-assessments, the
ecoVadis information platform or social audits, and our total procurement volume. our goal is to cover 75 percent by the end of 2015. we
aim to further improve this value continually over the subsequent years.

Sustainability rankings rate supplier management activities
Each year, leading rating agencies rate the sustainability performance
of large companies. Deutsche Telekom scored 93 out of 100 points in
the supply chain management category of the 2014 RobecoSAM rating
(2013: 88 points), making Telekom an industry leader.
The Italian NGO, Acquisti & Sostenibilità, was also impressed by our
suppl chain management policies. We came in first place among
430 multinational companies from 30 industries in the "Sustainable
Supply Chain Review" study published by the NGO in 2014.
Sustainable Procurement Working Group
The Sustainable Procurement Working Group (SPWG) has served as
an instrument for the comprehensive implementation of social and
environmental standards in Procurement since 2007. In addition to
representatives from all of the functional Procurement areas (such
as Devices and IT) the SPWG also includes representation from the
national
companies and T-Systems International. The focus of our Sustainable
Procurement Working Group in 2014 was harmonizing sustainability
management at the procurement departments of all of our national
companies.
Participants once again discussed the basic elements of our sustainable procurement strategy at an event in March 2014. We have also
recently introduced monthly conference calls to encourage participants
to share their knowledge and experience, review progress and increase
their level of involvement in the supplier qualification process. In this
context, a large part of our strategic suppliers and those with higher
risk are assessed on the basis of sustainability criteria via the EcoVadis
platform or through audits. Since June 2014, we have been directly
addressing the individual needs of our national companies with a
Group-wide roadshow.
Dialog with suppliers and NGOs
The sixth Sustainable Procurement Dialog Day took place on March 26,
2014, at Deutsche Telekom’s Group headquarters in Bonn. A total of
108participants including selected international suppliers, NGO representatives, politicians, researchers and employees from different
Telekom departments participated in the dialog event. This year’s dialog
focused on how to better manage and implement ethical responsibility
along the global value chains. Three workgroups discussed human
rights due diligence, conflict resources and the basis for improved
collaboration between suppliers and their customers.
One of the three workgroups discussed how to structure an effective
human rights due diligence policy for Deutsche Telekom. Participants
stressed the fact that the due diligence practices needed to be adjusted
to meet the requirements in each country. They pointed out that this
included informing employees of their rights and teaching consumers
how to deal with digital risks. Workgroup participants also said that
good collaboration with governmental institutions, ICT companies,
suppliers and other stakeholders was key to creating effective sustainability management practices.

103

Dialog Day participants recommended developing common standards
and sustainability requirements that would apply to as many companies
in the ICT industry as possible in order to improve and simplify collaboration with suppliers. Doing this would prevent suppliers having to check
and comply with the varying requirements of their different customers.
As part of a project launched in 2014, Deutsche Telekom therefore aims
to further standardize supplier requirements between companies,
together with the French telecommunications service provider Orange
and the BuyIn joint venture. Dialog Day participants also emphasized
the importance of engaging in dialog with each supplier in order to
establish and maintain trust.
CR Stakeholder Dialog Day in China: Sustainability
as a competitive advantage
We hosted our seventh CR Stakeholder Dialog Day in November 2014
in the Chinese city of Shenzhen. At the event, Deutsche Telekom and
118 participants discussed what sustainable business might look like
in light of the global transformation. Suppliers and experts from politics,
business, science and civil society, including high-ranking representatives from the Chinese Environment Ministry, were invited to take part.
Birgit Klesper, Senior Vice President for Group Transformational Change
and Corporate Responsibility, made it clear in her opening speech that
"Corporate responsibility is not a question of charity. Doing business
responsibly also drives growth." The Together for Sustainability program
for sustainable supplier development was one of the measures
launched in order to maintain high environmental and social standards
along the supply chain. "Based on the considerably higher re-entry
rates of satisfied employees, the investment pays off within just a few
months," Eva Wimmers, Senior Vice President for Group Procurement
at Deutsche Telekom, emphasized.
Work conditions have to change due to the demographic shift alone.
Jungfeng Zhang, Deputy Director of the International Institute for Occupational Health and Safety at the Chinese Ministry of Human Resources
and Social Security, said, "The younger generation today has many
more opportunities and they use their own voice. Chinese employers
in particular will have to understand this in order to recruit and retain
qualified employees in the future."
The dialog in Shenzhen pointed out that the challenges of our time can
only be met with close cooperation among the ICT industry, politics and
NGOs.
Up-to-date thanks to e-learning
Our Global Procurement Policy clearly regulates sustainability in
our procurement practices. We offer the Procurement Sustainability
e-learning tool to Procurement employees at our national companies
to help them put the policy into practice effectively. During the training,
employees learn about and are tested on important CR measures and
processes. For example, the tool explains in detail the steps that need
to be followed to introduce countermeasures in cases of violations
(escalation process).
The tool was thoroughly revised and updated in 2014 during a severalweek process. A total of 490 employees successfully completed the
e-learning course between August and December 2014.

Supply chain management

Supply chain management

Deutsche Telekom maintains business relationships with more than
30,000 suppliers in over 80 countries. Our relationships with suppliers
are based on trust and dialog combined with monitoring and providing
concrete support for the implementation of sustainability standards. We
have a variety of instruments, methods and measures in place to help us
improve the sustainability of our supply chain. Our basic aim is to recognize the cause of any problems and to work closely together with our
suppliers to resolve them.

As the business relationship proceeds, we ask strategically relevant and
high-risk suppliers to enter extensive information about their practices in
the EcoVadis information system. Experts evaluate these statements on
the basis of additional background information and targeted research.
We take things a step further in our relationships to some suppliers that
exhibit a higher CR risk and conduct on-site social audits (level 2). In
doing so, we focus not only on direct suppliers of Deutsche Telekom but
also on downstream suppliers as far as possible.

Management approach
Depending on the development phase of the supplier relationship,
we use different tools to make our supply chain more sustainable. A tenpercent sustainability weighting factor has been included in all bids for
proposals since June 2013. This creates strong incentives for suppliers
to offer more sustainable products and services in the bidding process.

We also boost the effectiveness of our audits by collaborating with
a current nine other companies in the Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC).
Thanks to the increasing number of JAC members, we are able to
conduct a higher number of audits on joint suppliers.

We also use a four-level approach to minimize risks and encourage
our suppliers to improve their practices. The funnel chart illustrates
the process. Via our supply chain management system we initially ask
potential suppliers with an order volume of more than 100,000 euros
per year about 16 sustainability-related aspects (level 1). These 16
aspects relate to human rights and corruption as well as environmental
protection and occupational health and safety.

Based on the information obtained from suppliers and on audit results,
we classify and evaluate suppliers according to CR criteria – particularly
cross-functional suppliers (level 3). This is done using supplier scorecards, which let us assess a supplier’s sustainability performance and
compare them with other suppliers at a glance. The evaluation is also
based on press information and reports from non-governmental organizations (NGOs). We also collaborate closely with selected suppliers to
address acute issues and improve their sustainability performance in
the long term. Our supplier development program is particularly helpful
during this phase (level 4).
In cases of significant disregard of our requirements, we initiate an
escalation process to effect fast resolution in accordance with the
Deutsche Telekom sustainability standards. The results of the supplier
evaluations and the measures taken to solve the problems are recorded
centrally.
Supplier development program launched
We made another important step toward establishing sustainable
procurement practices in 2014. In June 2014 we launched a pioneering
project, the Together for Sustainability program, in which we are collaborating with three key suppliers from the device and network technology sectors. The goal is to find common solutions to issues such as
regulations for working hours and occupational health and safety and to
create competitive advantages in doing so. It is a clear win-win situation
for us as well as our suppliers because better working conditions have a
positive influence on employee loyalty and motivation, raise productivity
and improve the quality of products.
The first measurable successes were reported only a few months after
the project was launched. Overtime, for example, was reduced by 30
percent, while salaries increased 15 percent and employee satisfaction
improved by 6 percent. In 2015 another five suppliers will join the
project.

Anti-corruption training for suppliers
Our business is based on integrity, respect and compliance with laws
and regulations. In turn, we expect Deutsche Telekom’s partners to
comply with the principles of good, compliant business practices.
In many cases, however, small and medium-sized businesses do not
have the resources needed to effectively address compliance issues.
Deutsche Telekom has been offering compliance training to roughly
12,000 business partners in Germany since September 2014. This offer
encourages our partners even more to conduct their business ethically
and in compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
Focus on prevention
The seminars outline compliance-relevant topics such as corruption
prevention, antitrust law and sustainability, as well as Deutsche
Telekom’s compliance management system. We also offer free online
training to help us reach as many suppliers as possible. Participation is
not a mandatory requirement for a partnership with Deutsche Telekom,
but it is looked upon favorably. Target groups include members of the
executive management as well as employees from sales and contract
management departments.

2014 audit results

2014 audit results

a total of 45 social audits, 23 on direct and 22 on indirect suppliers
of deutsche telekom, were conducted in 2014 through the auditing
program set up and managed at group level. as in previous years, we
focused our audit activities on suppliers in asia and especially in China.
we also conducted social audits in latin america (e.g., mexico and
brazil) and eastern europe.
among the suppliers audited were vendors of devices, it services, it
hardware/software and network technology. the audits did not uncover
any cases of corruption.

detAiled results
we do not audit all of our suppliers (over 30,000) equally but instead
focus on strategically important and/or high-risk supplier groups. we
therefore audit around 150 suppliers at regular intervals of about three
years. the majority of these audits have been conducted within the
scope of the Joint audit Cooperation (JaC). we identified key weak
points and considerable need for improvement particularly in the following areas:
 occupational health and safety
 working hours
 environmental protection
we found violations against deutsche telekom supplier requirements in
a total of 350 cases, 100 of which must be considered critical. we were
able to address 282 violations (69 of which were critical) by the end of
2014. the remaining improvement measures are currently scheduled
for implementation. See below for some examples of key findings and
completed improvement measures.

Suppliers
Resource scarcity and raw materials sourcing

108

Resource scarcity and raw materials
sourcing
Production of electronic devices like smartphones is harmful to the environment and requires large amounts of water and energy. Because the
production facilities of suppliers and manufacturers are often located in
regions where water is scarce or the population does not have sufficient
access to electricity, the availability of resources plays a more significant
role there than it does in countries like Germany.
Moreover, valuable raw materials like metals are used in producing
smartphones and other ICT products. Some metals, including tantalum,
gold, tin and tungsten, are extracted from ores, some of which are
extracted in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo under
conditions that are inhumane and/or associated with civil war. The parties involved in conflict in the region use the profit for purposes such as
financing civil wars. Deutsche Telekom does not produce any ICT products itself. The Group purchases these products from inter-national
manufacturers and sells them at its stores, offers them in the context
of service provision or uses them in its network infrastructure. We require
our suppliers to refrain from using any of these conflict re-sources. We
also support industry initiatives, such as the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative, that work toward creating a more sustainable supply chain.
Management approach
Deutsche Telekom requires its suppliers to protect the environment and
use resources responsibly. These requirements are documented in our
Social Charter. They are also described in detail in our CR clause, which
has been a permanent feature of our General Terms and Conditions
for Purchasing since June 2013. We require our suppliers to provide
information on their activities as part of a self-assessment and conduct
supplier audits to emphasize the importance of these requirements. In
the scope of the audits, we check whether our suppliers use an environmental management system and how they manage their energy and
water consumption, as well as other factors. We also explicitly ask them
about their waste management system.
Handling critical raw materials
Deutsche Telekom collaborates with suppliers and industry initiatives
to effect responsible raw materials sourcing. We are particularly forceful
in making sure that no conflict resources are used in producing the
devices we sell or use in our network technology.
Deutsche Telekom published its Coltan Statement in 2005 and added
the Statement on Extractives to it in 2009. The use of conflict-free
resources has been a product requirement on our manufacturers since
2014. The purpose of this decision is to make sure that both our direct
suppliers as well as their sub-suppliers minimize the social risks that
come with extracting raw materials. We require our suppliers to comply
with Deutsche Telekom’s Statement on Extractives. Policies regarding
conflict resources and their use are also an integral aspect of our
supplier audits.

In cooperation with the Global e-Sustainability Initiative and the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition industry associations, we work to
advance the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI). This initiative helps
companies identify conflict resources and avoid trade and production
involving those resources.
Fighting the use of conflict resources: Participating
in the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative
Telekom has supported the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI)
ever since it was founded in 2008. CFSI is the largest business initiative
for responsible raw materials sourcing. Its objective is to identify conflict
resources and prevent their extraction and sale.
CFSI is based on a working group that was founded in 2008 by the
Global e-Sustainability Initiative and the Electronic Industry Citizenship
Coalition industry associations (Extractives Working Group) to address
sustainable raw materials extraction. Since then, the number of metal
processing companies and smelters participating in CFSI has continued to grow. 150 of these companies have been audited in compliance
with the standard audit protocol (as of March 2015). Another 48 have
committed themselves to completing the audit process.
Stakeholder involvement
We have been a sponsor of the wide-scale Clean Cell Phones campaign
run by the Catholic aid organization Missio since 2013. Missio calls
upon cell phone manufacturers to require their suppliers to provide
proof that they do not use conflict resources. In 2014 we also addressed
responsible resource procurement at several dialog events with different
stakeholders.
On May 31, 2014, for example, a Telekom Deutschland sustainability
expert met with representatives from the Democratic Republic of Congo
and experts from the Missio branch in Aachen to discuss the topic
of "Congo, war and our cell phones" at the Catholic Day event held in
Regensburg.
Conflict resources were also a key issue at our sixth Sustainable Procurement Stakeholder Dialog Day on March 26, 2014. Our discussions
with suppliers and NGOs like Missio have made it clear how important it
is to get the entire industry involved so that we can achieve far-reaching
improvements. Participants in these discussions feel that the European
transparency guideline is not enough to make this happen. As an initial
step, Deutsche Telekom is planning to raise awareness of OECD guidelines at other companies.

Climate and environment
Climate protection strategy

Climate protection strategy

According to the latest status report published by the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global CO2 emissions continue to rise;
their impact on people and the environment will be significant. We need
innovative solutions to lessen this impact and slow down global warming. There are a number of good examples of how ICT can reduce
emissions in many industries like transportation and agriculture. We
believe it is our responsibility to systematically expand our business
with solutions like these. The growing amounts of data in our networks
and at our data centers, however, require more energy. We tackle the
challenge of reducing our energy consumption despite this situation
by increasing the efficiency of our network infrastructure. Within the
scope of our Group-wide climate protection strategy, we also reduce
our carbon footprint through effective energy management at our buildings and climate-friendly policies for our vehicle fleet management.
Management approach
We assume responsibility for a low-carbon society" is one of the key
action areas of our CR strategy. We intend to keep this promise with the
help of our Group-wide climate protection target, which was adopted
in 2013: to reduce our CO2 emissions by 20percent by 2020 compared
with 2008. We have developed measures to help us meet this target as
well as instruments to gauge our progress. An annual status report
keeps the Board of Management informed regarding progress toward
achieving this target.
Measurable success in climate protection
We record the direct impact of our climate protection measures with
our Energy Consumption and CO2 Emissions key performance indicators (KPIs) in order to assess the effectiveness of those measures.
These KPIs also help us keep our stakeholders informed regarding
the progress we have made in achieving our climate target. In 2014 we
reviewed the effectiveness of our KPIs and made adjustments to our
CO2 Emissions KPI.
Measuring direct and indirect emissions
We measure our CO2 emissions on the basis of standards such as
the internationally recognized Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, which
distinguishes between three CO2 emissions categories: GHG Scope 1, 2
and 3. Over the past few years, we have introduced measurement of
GHG Scope 1 and 2 emissions throughout the Group. Our CO2 Emissions KPI is based on this data. We have been annually recording all
Scope 3 emissions generated by our business in Germany that are
relevant to the company since 2013. We published the values from
2012 and 2013 for the first time in 2014 within the context of the
Carbon Disclosure Project survey.

Collaborating for innovation and climate protection
Effective climate protection calls for joint efforts on the part of business,
politics, science and society. We are involved in a number of German
initiatives (2° foundation in Germany) and international associations to
help us effectively work to protect the climate. One of these is the Global
e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI). As an industry association, GeSI’s
vision is to help make society greener and more climate-friendly with
the help of ICT solutions.
Using electricity from renewable energy sources
Measures to improve the energy efficiency of our networks and infrastructures are at the heart of our climate protection strategy. To date,
we have not included renewable energy in our calculations regarding
our Group-wide climate protection target. Renewable energy, however,
can help reduce CO2 emissions. That is why we attach great value to
the use of renewable energy, which will play an important role in our
integrated climate strategy in the future. In 2014 we took stock throughout the Group in order to assess the potential of renewable energy in
terms of climate protection at the Group. The next step will be to come
up with specific targets to increase the share of green power in our
energy mix.
Developing an integrated climate strategy
In addition to approving our Group-wide climate protection target of
reducing our CO2 emissions by 20 percent between 2008 and 2020,
the Deutsche Telekom Board of Management decided in December
2013 to continue to enhance the tools that will help us achieve this
target. These include monitoring and, where necessary, realigning our
climate protection measures as well as identifying additional measures
to increase our efficiency and finding new ways to use renewable
energy. Our efforts to enhance our tools will also take into account the
analysis of CO2 emissions generated by T-Mobile USA, which have so
far not been included in our climate protection target.
Integrated climate strategy based on four pillars
In 2014, we worked together with all of the national companies participating in the climate protection target to identify additional ways to
reduce energy consumption including data centers, buildings, vehicle
fleets, IT and business trips. The discussion also made it clear that we
could reduce our Group-wide carbon footprint by using more renewable
energy. Increased inclusion of renewable energy in calculating Scope 2
emissions, an element of the new version of the Greenhouse Gas (GHG)
Protocol, will contribute to this as well. Measures in this area will therefore have a positive impact on our carbon footprint.

Deutsche Telekom - Corporate Responsibility Report 2014

Climate and environment
Climate protection strategy

The estimated CO2 emissions generated by T-Mobile USA pose a challenge to our climate protection efforts. Emissions there are expected to
increase between 2008 and 2020 due to heavy network expansion in
North America. That is why during the reporting period we discussed
how to make our climate protection activities more effective.
As a result, we decided to continue to make our climate protection
efforts more systematic and to develop a new, integrated climate
protection strategy in 2015. Based on the four pillars - CO2 emissions,
renewable energy, energy efficiency and green products - this integrated
strategy will include concrete targets and performance indicators and
will support our Group strategy of becoming the "leading telecommunications provider in Europe."
One step in this strategy will be to analyze the CO2 reduction potential
of our ICT products and services so that we can continue to expand
our business with customer solutions for climate protection. To make
this possible, we plan to measure the carbon footprint of our products
in a pilot project and gradually make CO2 reduction a fixed aspect of
our portfolio. Emission reductions have already been calculated for the
three pilot products Dynamic Workplace, Connected Carand Smart
Metering.
Measuring Scope 3 emissions along the value chain
In June 2014, we published all of Deutsche Telekom’s Scope 3
emissions in Germany for the first time within the context of the CDP
(formerly Carbon Disclosure Project). We included relevant data for
2012 and 2013 in this calculation. The two largest sources of Scope 3
emissions in 2013 were customer use of products purchased from us
and our supply chain. We calculated Scope 3 emissions for 2013 totaling at 3,730,091 metric tons of CO2 equivalents.
Our Scope 3 emissions for 2014 were up 6 percent year on year at
3,965,268metric tons of CO2 equivalents. This increase can primarily
be attributed to our rising purchase volume (e.g., smartphones and
tablets) as well as to the use of products (e.g., routers and receivers)

111

leased from us by our customers. We saw a drop in Scope 3 emissions
for fixed assets, e.g., the technology required to operate our fixed-line
and mobile communications networks.
In order to record the Scope 3 emissions along the supply chain more
efficiently, we invited around 100 of our suppliers to participate in the
CDP supply chain program. The program gives businesses and their
suppliers a standardized platform for recording and controlling emissions. We also tested a macroeconomic approach to measuring Scope
3 emissions. In this approach, the calculation of the emissions along the
supply chain are based on lump-sum amounts. We are currently looking
into the deviations between the results of both approaches in order to
improve the method we use.
We plan to measure Scope 3 emissions throughout the entire Group
by the end of 2016.
More green energy at European national companies
We aim to achieve a share of power from renewable sources at all of
Deutsche Telekom’s national companies in Europe that is 10 percent
higher than in the national energy mix by 2016 – if permitted by the
conditions of the national energy markets. To this end the national
companies can also purchase renewable energy certificates if needed,
a practice already in place in the Netherlands, Hungary and Greece.
By increasing our reliance on renewable energy, we hope to tap new
ways to reduce CO2 emissions and our energy consumption beyond
what we are already doing within the scope of our Group-wide climate
protection target. To help us in this, we worked together with our
national companies in 2014 to analyze other ways to use renewable
energy. The first step was to take stock of the present situation at each
company in order to give us a basis from which to start. The next step
will be to come up with measures that increase the share of renewable
energy being used throughout the Group and that help us meet customer demands and the provisions of international climate protection
agreements.

Another option: CO2 compensation
Preventing greenhouse gas emissions has top priority at our company.
This is followed by reducing these emissions. Investing in certified climate protection projects is one way to compensate for some of the CO2
emissions that we are unable to avoid generating or reduce.
From early March 2014 to late February 2015, Telekom compensated
for 12,517 metric tons of CO2 emissions. These included emissions
associated with our events (participant travel to and from the event,
room usage, etc.) and certain products and services (e.g., conference
calls or web conferences). Our Event Policy specifies the ways in which
we compensate for emissions generated by events.
In 2014 T-Systems Hungary also compensated for 14,285 metric tons
of CO2 resulting from energy consumption.

Climate proteCtion meaSureS

Climate proteCtion measures

with our group-wide climate protection target we have resolved to lower
energy consumption and, therefore, Co2 emissions in all areas. this
primarily impacts our network infrastructure (fixed-line, mobile communications and data centers). in germany, our network infrastructure is
responsible for around 70 percent of our national energy consumption.
use of our buildings and vehicle fleet (one of the largest in europe with
around 26,300 service vehicles and company cars) is another focal
point of our efforts. this use also contributes significantly to our energy
consumption in germany, making up around 15 percent and 10 percent, respectively, and therefore having considerable potential for improving our carbon footprint.

Energy efficiency in the network

Energy efficiency in the network

Using less electricity by making our network operations more energy
efficient is a central element of our climate protection target. We take
different approaches for the fixed network, mobile communications and
data centers. All of these approaches, however, include the use of innovative ICT solutions for load-based control of network performance and
energy consumption.
Management approach
Telekom operates its own fixed-line and mobile communications networks in Europe and the US. Much of our energy demand comes from
operating this network infrastructure. In the interest of our customers,
we continue to increase the capacity and performance of our networks
so that we can handle growing amounts of data and increasing
demands on the speed and quality of data transmission. This always
goes hand-in-hand with higher energy requirements. We pursue three
approaches to further reducing our energy needs:
 We update our network infrastructure through measures such
as switching over to IP technology and installing highly efficient
systems to guarantee the availability of electricity, systematically
removing technology we no longer need
 We optimize energy supply and energy conversion through
improved energy storage facilities
 We use more energy-efficient technology for lighting, monitoring
and cooling in our technical network facilities
Our internal energy service provider, Power & Air Solutions, who is
responsible for energy management at most of Telekom’s companies in
Germany, plays a key role in these activities. Power & Air Solutions has
been using an ISO50001-compliant energy management system since
2013.
Telekom was among the companies that signed the EU Broadband
Code of Conduct and the EU Data Centre Code of Conduct. By signing
these documents, Telekom has committed itself to continuing to effectively improve the energy efficiency of its products and services.
Measuring and controlling energy requirements
The PUE factor (Power Usage Effectiveness), which we record annually,
is an important indicator that we use to manage our climate protection
measures. Our goal for operation of our fixed-line network in Germany
is to reduce our PUE factor to 1.4 by 2020. By doing this, we will be able
to compensate for the increased energy requirements associated with
growing amounts of data and new service features.

More computing capacity – less energy consumption
There is a lot of room to reduce energy consumption at data centers.
We tap these possibilities systematically each time we build new data
centers or update old ones. In these activities, we focus on the following:





Optimizing heating, ventilation and cooling technology
Energy-efficient components
Optimizing stand-by features
More efficient archiving and storage

In 2014 we began operations at a new, large data center at the Biere
location in Magdeburg. We are setting the bar at this data center in all
of these areas with innovative technology.
Biere: Role model for energy efficiency
The new cloud data center in Biere is the largest of its kind in Germany
as well as one of the largest in Europe. It has room for 30,000 servers
and its PUE factor of 1.3 represents a significant milestone in the
achievement of our climate target. Its innovative cooling concept alone
cuts its total energy requirements by around one-third relative to
comparable data centers. We received the Gold LEED certification
(LEED: Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) for the building’s energy-efficient, environmental design. Only ten data centers in
the world have this certification.
We have fitted out an existing data center in Magdeburg, not far from
Biere, almost identically. The two data centers work together closely as
"twins." Data is stored at both data centers at all times so that is is always
available, even if there is a problem at one of the data centers. Outsourcing data to the cloud also requires the highest security standards.
That is why the building complexes are systematically partitioned; the
strictest security measures protect data from unauthorized access.
Optimizing and consolidating data centers:
Less is more
We are also making efforts to reduce CO2 emissions in the way we
operate and design our data centers. The approach taken by Group
subsidiary T-Systems basically falls into two phases: optimization
measures at the different data center sites and global optimization
spanning the entire data center landscape worldwide.
The first phase was conducted from 2008 to 2013 by thoroughly
optimizing current data center sites. Some examples include updating
the cooling systems and installing cold aisle containment to control the
flow of cooling air as needed and minimize cold air waste in the IT
areas. In this context, upgrading our IT systems and migrating the
application environments to this new technology helped us to improve
energy efficiency considerably.

Energy efficiency in the network

The PUE factor serves as an indicator for improvements in energy
efficiency. Between 2008 and 2014, we saw a positive change in the
average PUE factor of the T-Systems data centers from 1.85 to 1.64
thanks to the measures described above. Despite the overall positive
trend, we saw a slight increase in the PUE level in 2014 compared to
the previous year. This is due to the fact that, while energy consumption
by the servers declined, the energy required for non-ICT components
remained unchanged.

tested the L2 mode in live network operation, but without customer
participation. Depending on the results, we should be able to start
the field test in 2015. Once the field test has been completed, we are
planning to gradually put the new mode into live operation.

The diagram on the right shows the method with two switch levels,
which already allows a rough approximation to the curve representing
actual data traffic (depicted here in magenta). Analyses have shown
that the enhanced L2 mode will make it possible to avoid large amounts
of CO2 emissions and save operating costs.

The second phase began in 2013 and involved combining the physical
consolidation of data centers (i.e., reducing the amount of data center
space and the number of sites) with logical consolidation (i.e., virtualization). The DC11@2018 program is working to globally consolidate data
center sites with the latest IT technology to a few FMO (future mode of
operation) data centers. We expect these measures to massively reduce
CO2 emissions. Current program plans estimate a cumulated CO2
reduction of up to 51 percent by 2020 based on the 2012 figures.
Winning the Code of Conduct Data Centre Award 2014
We continue to improve the efficiency of our data centers to help us
achieve our climate protection target. In May 2014, T-Systems was
presented the European Union’s Data Centre Energy Efficiency Award
for its success with these measures in 2013. Our submission included
publishing the energy values of all of our data centers and submitting
a list of improvement measures.
Power-save mode: Smart and economical
Network control is a major lever when it comes to making broadband
services more environmentally friendly and efficient for our customers.
We collaborated with a network equipment manufacturer to develop
an innovative operating mode (L2 mode) for the fixed-line network. This
mode makes it possible to flexibly adjust transmission capacity to the
actual data volume in several switch levels. We can use this mode to
significantly reduce energy consumption in access networks during low
traffic periods. We planned to conduct a field test in 2014. The quality
controls at the lab, however, have not yet been completed. We have

Generating heat and power under a single roof
In addition to traditional power grids, we are also increasingly using
combined heat and power units (CHP) to provide power that we
generate ourselves to our network nodes (Internet distribution points)
in a way that is efficient and environmentally friendly.These units convert
around 90 percent of the energy into usable energy (electricity and
heat), whereas electricity generated via conventional means and
sourced from the German power grid only comprises round 40 percent
usable energy. Using CHP units has enabled us to significantly reduce
the CO2 emissions of our network operations. We added four new CHP
units with electrical power output ranging from 50 kW to 250 kW in
2014.
Technological and efficient ways to use CHP units
CPU units basically cover the electricity and heating needs of our network nodes via thermal energy. We have improved load distribution
by introducing a new control approach in order to tone down excessive
electricity needs (peak loads) during times of exceedingly high data
traffic volumes. However, the German Renewable Energy Act (EEG),
which was passed in 2014, made conditions for operators of environmentally friendly systems like these more challenging. Operators are
now subject to a 40 percent EEG fee on self-generated energy from
CHP units used in their own operations.
CO2 emissions reduced by 8,687 metric tons In
February 2015, Telekom Deutschland was operating its own CHPs at
a total of 27 network nodes. In 2014, these units generated around
33 GWh of electricity. Because the units are very efficient, they emitted
8,687 tons less CO2 compared to power taken from public grids.
Photovoltaics for mobile base stations
T-Mobile Austria is testing different solutions to support power supply
to base stations with photovoltaics and wind energy at five mobile base
stations in its Green Base Station project. The main focus of the tests is
whether and under which circumstances the systems are economically
viable.

Energy efficiency in the network

Photovoltaic modules with specially developed holders are attached
directly to the base station masts and small wind turbines are attached
to the tops of the masts. Any excess energy produced by the plants is
stored on-site in batteries to cover any power outages. With the help of
a new control system, the stored energy can also be used to power the
stations on days with little sunshine or wind. Test findings from 2014
show that up to 40 percent of the energy needed to power the base
stations can be produced by renewable sources. The use of renewable
energy generated by photovoltaics has successfully passed the functional tests.
Apart from functionality, the goal is to develop an efficient approach for
installing additional plants. There are still a few issues to be addressed.
Because we are now able to monitor the system over a longer period of
time, we can also use information regarding the behavior of the systems
to optimize them. Tests on the small wind turbine were not extended
due to heavy vibrations of the mast. We are analyzing the use of other
types of wind turbines for additional tests instead.

Energy-efficient buildings

Energy-efficient buildings

Within the scope of our climate target, we work diligently to continue
to reduce our energy consumption and the carbon footprint associated
with it. Efficient facility management plays a key role in these efforts.
Around 22 percent of our energy consumption throughout Germany
can be attributed to usage of our buildings, for example.

to use waste heat generated for IT to heat the buildings at four of our
data centers. The tests that followed proved the effectiveness of those
systems. We have also begun installing this technology at a fifth data
center location. We are planning to conduct cost-effectiveness analyses
for another 40 locations over the course of 2015.

Management approach
Our facility energy management activities can be broken down into
"heat energy" and "power consumption." We have defined sub-targets
for each of these areas to help us attain our climate target in Germany.
Progress is measured twice a year.

Electricity
Our employee workstations, lighting, IT and building technology, including pumps, ventilation, cooling and elevators, make up the greatest
share of power consumption in our buildings. We focus our energy
conservation measures on the following areas:

Two approaches are involved in achieving our sub-targets. One of these
is to reduce our office space. This is done through staff reduction as
well as optimizing space usage by introducing new office concepts.
Another focal point is increasing the energy efficiency of our processes.
For this we use an ISO 50001-compliant energy management system.
We identify need for improvement by using specific indicators such
as "kilowatt hours per square meter," "energy consumption around midnight" or "peak loads" to compare similar facilities. Power & Air Solutions
is responsible for the energy management system. We also conduct
research projects on energy-efficient network operation to help us
develop energy-efficient operation methods for our workstations.

 Using LED lighting and motion detectors in underground parking
structures and hallways

state-of-the-art pumps and fans


off building technology when the building is not in use


Heat and hot water We use approximately 600 GWh of heating energy
throughout Germany each year, primarily by using gas and fuel oil as
well as district heating. That is the same amount of energy needed to
provide around 100,000 modern apartments with heat and hot water.
To reduce consumption, we calculate the basic repairs needed at our
facilities, conduct efficiency analyses and focus on necessary and
particularly efficient measures within the scope of the available budget
such as:
 Optimizing heating systems
 Renewing heating systems and pumps with condensing boiler
technology
Recovery
of waste heat produced by data centers


Solar power: Sunny prospects for climate protection
In 2014 we decided to equip around 600 of our technology sites with
solar power systems. The idea came from Telekom Deutschland
employees who took a closer look at how we can work more simply,
more effectively and with better integration at our company by the year
2018. Our internal energy service provider, Power and Air Solutions,
installed photovoltaic systems on the roofs of around 300 offices. This
is expected to reduce our carbon footprint by 1,600 metric tons of CO2
a year, bringing us closer to achieving our climate target for 2020.
Energy efficiency initiatives in Hungary
Magyar Telekom’s 2014 energy-efficiency measures included introducing ventilation equipment to cool large technical facility rooms.
That allowed them to reduce their use of air conditioning units as well
as their electricity consumption. The company completed a pilot test
on smart cooling, which was targeted at optimum energy-efficient
operation of air conditioning units and reducing associated energy
consumption. Magyar Telekom has also begun projects to increase
room temperature and use residual heat. Thanks to initiatives to replace
furnaces, update heating systems and use residual heat generated in
certain technical facility rooms, the company was also able to reduce
its consumption of natural gas and district heating.

We use a standardized indicator system to assess all of our buildings
before introducing these measures. We use the data to identify buildings with particularly high consumption levels, analyze the weak points
and potential areas of optimization in those buildings via detailed microanalyses and then specify corresponding focal points for improvement.
Group Facility Management is responsible for measurements, analyses
and developing appropriate measures. During the reporting period and
under the direction of Group Facility Management, we installed systems

Climate-friendly mobility

Climate-friendly mobility

With around 26,300 vehicles in Germany alone, our corporate fleet is
one of the largest in Europe. Our fleet’s carbon footprint reflects approx.
12 percent of our direct and indirect emissions (Scope 1 and 2 according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol) in Germany. That is why we encourage our employees to take a climate-friendly approach to mobility.
We also focus on alternative and fuel-efficient engines - which of course
must also be financially viable - when purchasing new company cars
and service vehicles.
Management approach
We plan to keep average CO2 emissions levels of all of the new company cars and service vehicles we purchase below 110 g CO2/km by
the end of 2015. Compared to the EU requirement of 120 g CO2/km,
which we had already achieved in 2012, we are clearly pursuing an
ambitious goal. We came another step closer to our goal during the
reporting period with our average dropping from 118 g CO2/km (2013)
to 115 g CO2/km in 2014. Our internal mobility service provider, Telekom MobilitySolutions, is responsible for achieving this goal.
In order to tap the full potential of climate-friendly fleet management
Telekom MobilitySolutions pursues a strategy based on the following
three pillars:
 Rightsizing: selecting appropriately sized, energy-efficient, lowemissions cars. Through the introduction of our Green Car Policy
as well as incentives for drivers to select smaller, more fuel-efficient
cars, we continue to advance our fleet.
 Economizing: encouraging a fuel-efficient, low-emissions driving
style with driver training courses
 Substituting: piloting and testing alternative mobility concepts.
We intend to further reduce our fleet’s carbon footprint by purchasing
vehicles with alternative engines and fuel systems. We have been turning to natural gas and electric vehicles for some time now to help us
achieve this goal. In the medium term, we will keep tabs on developments in electric mobility and test out innovations.
Natural gas-powered vehicles still in testing phase
We still feel that low-emissions natural gas drives are the right approach
toward effective green mobility. This technology is an effective aid
in reducing pollution and the carbon footprint, particularly when
renewable resources are used, e.g., natural gas obtained from residual
materials and waste. However, long-range use of natural gas vehicles
is still very limited due to an insufficient number of natural gas filling
stations and sustainable natural gas options. We find the limited offer
of suitable vehicles available from manufacturers particularly restrictive.
Despite this, we continue to offer natural-gas powered cars to company

car users and to do so at especially favorable terms and conditions. For
example, employees choosing natural-gas powered company cars can
benefit from funds from our Green Car Policy penalty budget.
We also encourage our employees to actively protect the climate by
offering them discount season tickets for local and regional public
transportation.
On the go and green
We offer our employees driver training courses to teach them how to
drive safely in a way that conserves resources. A total of 111 of these
training courses were conducted in 2014. They were attended by a total
of 1,800 participants, roughly 300 of whom were trainees. The majority
of the driver training courses featured combined driver safety and green
driving training. Until June 2015, we are also offering our employees
5,500 subsidized spots in the ADAC basic driver training in collaboration with the Unfallkasse Post und Telekom accident insurance fund.
The main objective of the campaign is to keep Telekom employees
healthy and safe by teaching them how to avoid accidents using
defensive driving techniques.
We also assume responsibility for the carbon footprint left behind by
employee business trips. We offer different shuttle services as an alternative to driving one’s own car, including shuttles to the Cologne/Bonn
airport and the Siegburg ICE train station. Roughly 110,000 passengers
used this service in 2014. Employees can use an app or the intranet to
book a seat. In early April 2014, we set up the service to run between
Darmstadt and Bonn and Frankfurt and Bonn.
Testing the performance of electric cars
We continue to encounter hurdles when it comes to extensive use of
electric cars. Limited range, insufficient charging infrastructure and
high costs make these cars unattractive in many usage scenarios. To
date, our electric car projects have only been possible because the
charging stations at Telekom locations have been set up with the help of
project partners. We participate intensively in selected electric mobility
pilot projects to test the medium-term potential of electric mobility:
 Two new-generation electric rental cars have been available for
business trips since December 2014. Funds from the Green Car
Policy penalty budget were used to purchase a BMW i3 and a VW
eGolf to replace our two older Smart electric drives.
 We have been participating in an e-mobility funding project
("Wirtschaft am Strom") in Hamburg together with Deutsche
Telekom Technischer Service since April 2014. In this project, we
are using seven Renault Zoe and three Smart ed models as service
vehicles.

 In spring 2014 we added a Tesla electric car to our vehicle fleet for
Board of Management members as a chauffeured vehicle for trips in
the Cologne/Bonn area and to Darmstadt. Charging stations for the
car were set up on-site.
 A few selected hybrid cars have become available in our company
car segment since summer 2014. The offer only applies to the
upper vehicle classes as the high costs involved exceed the defined
budgets in the other categories. We have also begun offering
electric
cars as company cars for the first time in selected regions.

Climate-friendly substitute for cars
We continue to expand our bicycle offer for employees as a healthy,
green mobility solution. Bicycle pools featured a total of 167 bikes at
31 locations during the reporting period. We are planning to purchase
an additional 93 bicycles for a total of 16 locations in eight cities in
2015.
Employees from our Bonn offices tested 15 e-bikes as part of a pilot
project that was successfully completed in 2014. The project was wellreceived and we are currently planning to expand it to a number of
different locations.

Climate and environment
Resource efficiency and environmental protection

Resource efficiency and
environmental protection
We work diligently to improve the energy efficiency of our networks. In
our view, this is the most effective way to reduce our impact on the climate and environment. We also try to limit our use of scarce resources
and continue to work on reducing the amount of waste produced
throughout the Group. We also recycle the valuable materials found
in waste such as copper and lead from scrap cables.
Management approach
Deutsche Telekom uses a health, safety and environment system (HSE).
By using this system, we have made a commitment to constantly
improve our performance in this area.
Our goal is also to increase our resource efficiency by reducing the
amount of waste we produce and improving our recycling processes
based on our Group-wide International Waste Management Framework.
These guidelines do not, however, specify any quantitative requirements. Instead, our national companies use this framework as a basis
for identifying their own measurable targets and then monitor target
achievement. This approach makes it easier for us to flexibly deal with
the conditions specific to each country and company.
The workplace is another focal point in improving our resource efficiency. We encourage our employees to use recycled paper and energyefficient multifunction printers as well as to purchase environmentally
friendly office supplies, etc.
Reducing waste and recycling
Our national companies are responsible for conducting their waste
management system according to standard Group-wide principles.
They develop a waste strategy in compliance with our International
Framework for Waste Management, which was approved in 2013, or
update their current strategy and identify appropriate targets. The
reduction of hazardous waste has top priority.
We conducted an international survey on the status of these implementation processes during the reporting period. The survey showed that
very different amounts of progress have been made in the planning and
target identification processes at our national companies. Progress is
particularly slow in defining clear, measurable waste management targets.
When selecting and introducing new technology, which we then use
for many years, we make sure that the components of this technology
can later be disposed of responsibly without any unnecessarily high
costs. We are currently working on disposing of copper cables that for
decades were a main component of phone lines and some of which are
now being replaced within the scope of our fiber-optic expansion efforts
throughout Germany.

Group-wide copper-cable recycling requirements
The survey we conducted with our national companies clearly showed
that they need help in meeting our expectations regarding responsible
waste management practices when it comes to recycling and disposing
of waste cables. In response, our waste experts came up with a draft
of copper-cable recycling requirements and submitted it to the national
companies for approval. We plan to adopt a mandatory policy by the
end of 2015.
8,000 metric tons of copper cable recycled
In 2014, Telekom removed more than 8,000 metric tons of copper
cable from duct systems in Germany alone. The cable was processed
in accordance with environmental standards at certified waste disposal
facilities and up to 90 percent of the material was recycled.
Internal recycling program in Greece a success
In June 2013 we launched an internal program for recycling at our
buildings. Phase A of the program gave us the following impressive
results in 2014:
Paper: 67.36 tons
Plastic: 4.16 tons
Aluminum: 0.2 metric tons
Printer cartridges: 4,935 cartridges
Phase B of the project was launched in October 2014:
Expansion to another four buildings
Two training events for project managers
Internal information campaign with high employee participation
(78%)
Phases
A and B: 118 drop-off locations for recyclable material

So far, the program has reached roughly 6,500 employees; another

planned for 2015 (phase C).
Protecting biodiversity
Extinction continues to be a global problem. The consequences are
difficult to predict. One major cause of extinction is the fact that more
and more space is being taken up for industry, agriculture and transportation. In 2014, we conducted a study on the space used for our
business activities in Germany in order to help us more effectively
manage our activities to help protect biodiversity. We also included
worldwide upstream value chains in our analysis. The results of the
study confirmed our assumption that our use of space is not a major
factor in the way we directly impact the environment. The effects of our
business activities on biodiversity primarily involve the beginning of our
supply chain in geographically distant locations. Our influence on how

Deutsche Telekom - Corporate Responsibility Report 2014

Climate and environment
Resource efficiency and environmental protection

space is used in these regions and the consequences of that use is very
limited. The study identified use of space along the entire supply chain
at a total of 1,730 square kilometers per year. That is around twice the
size of Berlin. 14 percent of this is space characterized by highly aboveaverage biodiversity according to the criteria specified by the non-profit
organization, Conservation International.
We have more influence on protecting and improving species-rich
habitats near our offices than we do in areas where our supply chain
starts. That is why we collaborate with competent partners on nature
conser-vation efforts near us.

121

Resource efficiency and responsible waste disposal are other key topics
at Deutsche Telekom. By using resources more efficiently and sparingly,
we can reduce our costs and improve our earnings performance over
the long-term. To help us systematically take advantage of waste disposal savings potential and reduce the amount of waste we produce,
we introduced a Group-wide framework for waste management and
recycling in 2013. In 2014, we removed more than 8,000 metric tons
of copper cable from duct systems in Germany alone. It was processed
in accordance with environmental standards at certified waste disposal
facilities and up to 90 percent of the material was recycled.

Renaturalization of species-rich habitats
In 2000 we entered into a collaboration with the Deutsche Umwelthilfe
(DUH) environmental organization in Germany within the scope of which
we have been sponsoring the Living Forests nature conservation fund
for several years now. In 2014, for example, we sponsored construction
of an educational trail through moorland built by the Gesellschaft für
Naturschutz und Auenentwicklung e.V. (Society for nature conservation
and meadow land development). This association works to renaturalize
the Eschenkar wetlands in the Hessian Spessart region. The society’s
projects included creating a series of ponds in a spruce forest to create
new habitats for endangered amphibians. Building the educational trail
was the last phase of the project. Visitors can take the trail and learn
about the importance of moorland biotopes while enjoying the outdoors.
Resource efficiency in the workplace
By modifying our procurement processes, we were able to increase the
share of green office material in our total order volume from 27 percent
to 35 percent in 2014. By the end of 2014, 40 percent of the articles
available in our office supply catalog were in compliance with sustainability criteria as well. These criteria include paper bearing the Blue
Angel environmental label. Our central order system, eBest, encourages
employees to purchase green office supplies.
CR ratings: Environmental reporting – materiality
To our investors, the most important environmental topics at Telekom
are greenhouse gas emissions, resource efficiency and waste. Extensive
measures that reduce our impact on the environment and have a
positive effect on our company have been introduced at the Group
in all three of these areas.
We continually work on improving our energy efficiency. On the one
hand, we reduce our energy requirements and operating expenses
(OPEX) as well as the greenhouse gas emissions associated with our
business activities. We also help our customers save with our products
and services. Our model calculation for a company with 35,000 employees indicates the following: With Dynamic Workplace, a cloud-based
solution for business customers, customers can reduce CO2 emissions
by more than 16,000 metric tons per year and cut their costs by more
than 15 million euros per year. One reason this solution is so effective
is that Dynamic Workplace lets many employees work from home. That
prevents them from generating CO2 emissions and cuts back on office
space, which reduces heating and operating costs. Instead of using
their own IT structure, companies can use our energy-efficient network
and cloud services. Solutions like Dynamic Workplace significantly help
our customers to save energy and thereby protect the climate.

net vAlue Added
net value added increased year over year from 26.3 billion euros to 31.6
billion euros. this year-on-year increase in net value added is primarily
the result of increased payments to lenders, which can primarily be
attributed to a reduction in medium and long-term debt. please refer to
pages 90 and 215 of our current annual report for more information on
cash flow from financing activities as well as more information on financial liabilities.

reporting against standards
with this kpi, we fully cover the g4-eC1 (direct economic value
generated and distributed) gri indicator.

in contrast to the statement of income, the net value added only takes
account of real payment flows. that means that deferred tax expenses
and the accrual of provisions do not impact the net value added of the
reporting period. although these costs are deducted from net profit in
the statement of income, they are not linked to any current payments to
stakeholder groups, as is the case with net value added. outpayments
in this respect are scheduled for the future and will only be accounted
for in net value added in future years.

esg kpi “energy consumption" a)
deutsche telekom measures the energy Consumption eSg kpi as the
monetary power efficiency index (mpei) in which developments in
energy consumption (in thousands of mwh) are indicated in relation to
revenues (in billions of euros). development of the energy Consumption
eSg kpi exceeded the predictions made in our 2013 annual report.
instead of remaining stable, the energy Consumption eSg kpi
improved slightly. this is due to the fact that revenue grew more strongly
and energy consumption less strongly than anticipated. for detailed
comments on the figures for each national company, please refer to the
interactive benchmarking tool.
the group-wide energy Consumption eSg kpi is calculated based on
total electricity consumption at the national companies in relation to the
consolidated net revenue of these national companies. the revenue of
the group units included in the Cr report used for reference here is the
equivalent of 99 percent of group revenue.

over the next two years we expect our energy Consumption eSgkpi to
fall or fall slightly, i.e., a positive development. network migration to ip
technology and consolidation of the t-Systems data centers will be the
main factors helping us to achieve major energy savings. these savings
will be partly counterbalanced by the expansion of t-mobile uS and the
accompanying rise in energy consumption.

by reporting our electricity consumption in relation to our revenues for
the reporting period, we fully cover the g4-en5 (energy intensity) and

decoupling power consumption And co2 emissions
deutsche telekom was able to reduce the emissions generated by its
electricity consumption to zero from 2008 to 2012 by purchasing reCS
certificates (renewable energy Certificate System). however, we feel
that these certificates have not had as positive an impact on the environment as we had hoped. demand for certificates was generally limited.
as a result, reCS certificates do not make a noticeable contribution to
encouraging the expansion of renewable energy sources. that is why
we feel it makes more sense both in terms of ecological and economic
aspects to invest in reducing our energy consumption and increasing
our energy efficiency than to purchase reCS certificates.

Co2 emissions

esg kpi „co2 emissions“
the Co2 emissions eSg kpi indicates the development of absolute as
well as relative emissions compared to the base year 2008. the comparative value from the base year is 3,118,353 metric tons of Co2. the Co2
emissions eSg kpi recorded a slight year-on-year decrease of 1.8 percentage points. Since our Co2 emissions are largely driven by electricity
consumption, the year-on-year development is the result of the effects
described under the energy Consumption eSg kpi. the ratio between
actual emissions and our climate target base year 2008 also improved
as a result of extending the scope for the Co2 emissions eSg kpi to
include 10 more international t-Systems local business units (lbus).
for detailed comments on the figures for each individual company,
please refer to the interactive benchmarking tool.
we extensively reviewed the eSg kpis in terms of relevance for management practices and updated some of them. we adjusted the Co2
emissions eSg kpi to our international climate protection target. we
expanded the kpi to include all group entities that participate in helping
us realize our climate protection target. the extended scope affects the
current volume of Co2 emissions as well as the figure recorded in 2008,
on which our climate protection target is based.
we calculated our Co2 emission values based on different energy and
fuel consumption data. Calculation complied with the greenhouse gas
(ghg) protocol and was based on emission factors set forth by the international energy agency (iea) and/or the ghg protocol calculation tools.
the total value reflects direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) emissions.

Since our Co2 emissions are largely driven by our power consumption,
the resulting positive trend is similar to the development described for
the energy Consumption eSg kpi. we will also strive to achieve a slight
reduction in our Co2 emissions eSg kpi for the years 2015 and 2016.
our expectation for the group units participating in the climate protection target is that, in 2020, Co2 emissions will lie 20 percent below
the rate of the base year 2008 (excluding t-mobile uSa). the Co2
emissions eSg kpi figure will, however, also include emission figures
for t-mobile uS. Since strong business growth will continue to drive
power demand in the foreseeable future, the kpi will only improve
slightly in the period up to the year 2016.
reporting against standards
by measuring progress based on our Co2 emissions eSg kpi, we report
our Co2 emissions in accordance with the greenhouse gas protocol
together with our self-defined Co2 reduction goal, thereby complying
with criterion 13 of the german Sustainability Code (greenhouse gas
emissions). by reporting this data, we fully cover the g4-en15 (direct
ghg emissions), g4-en16 (energy indirect ghg emissions) and
g4-en17 (other indirect ghg emissions) gri indicators and partially
cover the e02-01 (Scope 1-3 greenhouse gas emissions) effaS indicator. this data is also relevant for criteria 7 (rules and processes), 11 and

totAl co2 emissions (scope 1 & 2 emissions)
because the majority our Co2 emissions are generated by electricity
consumption, the slight year-on-year increase in our emissions of
around 1 percent can be primarily attributed to the inclusion of additional national companies in our reporting processes. emissions would
have decreased by around 3 percent without inclusion of these companies. this decrease can primarily be attributed to reduction in electricity

Age structure deutsche telekom group in germAny
the age structure at deutsche telekom in germany remained unchanged for the most part in 2014 compared to the previous year. the
majority of our employees are between the ages of 46 and 55. we
experienced a clear decrease in the age group between the ages of
36 and 45 in the four-year trend. the percentage of employees in this
age group decreased from 31 to 28 and then, finally, to 25 percent.

to help us effectively conduct and manage our demographics management activities, we have intensified our monitoring of such hr indicators
as well as of qualitative indicators with a high relevance for demographics. we consider it important to take both objective hr indicators as
well as subjective assessments, e.g., from our employee survey, into
account.

Age structure At the deutsche telekom group

compAny pension schemes
the increase in fund assets can be attributed to the payments of the
increasing number of plan participants (as was the case in previous
years). because the majority of participants in the 2001 pension plan
are still active, i.e., still paying into their retirement plans, this increase
will remain steady over the next few years.

please refer to the strategy and management section for more information on our sustainable investment strategy for assets associated with
our company pension scheme and similar obligations in germany.

employees submitted 13,231 suggestions for improvement via the
genial@telekom idea platform in 2014. the savings generated by these
improvements came to 106,6 million euros. we registered 196 patents
in the reporting period as well.

reporting against standards
employee involvement is encouraged via the genial@telekom ideas
management platform. this data is relevant for criterion 14 (employee
rights) of the german Sustainability Code.

portfolio of intellectuAl property rights
196 patents were registered during the reporting period. by the end of
2014, we owned around 7,900 intellectual property rights (iprs), fewer
than in the previous year. we take a targeted approach to managing
these iprs in consideration of cost-benefit aspects. we regularly take
stock of our iprs and eliminate those that are no longer relevant.

we want to open the door to open innovation through cooperations and
partnerships. national and international iprs are vital for these types
of activity. we are strongly dedicated to generating our own property
rights. industrial property rights include inventions, patent applications,
patents, utility models and registered designs.

patents are gaining more and more significance in the telecommunications industry. market players and their areas of activity are changing,
with a knock-on effect on our ipr (intellectual property rights) agenda.
on the one hand, our group’s scope for action must be maintained. on
the other and alongside our own research and development activities,
