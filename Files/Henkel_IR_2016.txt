Sustainability milestones at Henkel
The focus on sustainability has evolved continuously at Henkel. When the
merchant Fritz Henkel founded his laundry detergent company in 1876,
he had the vision of making people’s lives easier, better and more beautiful.
From the beginning, the company assumed responsibility for its employees,
the communities it operates in, and society. Today, Henkel has set up
management systems worldwide for safety, health and the environment,
and has firmly anchored the mindset of sustainability in its corporate
­values.
All of our sustainability milestones

Henkel has been carrying out regular environmental quality checks for detergents and household ­cleaners since 1959. This picture shows a water quality
check of the river Rhine in 1961.

Our corporate value
We are committed to leadership in sustainability.

goal for 2030 in an integrated way across the whole company and
along the entire value chain. In pursuing this aim, we are focusing
on the most comprehensive data coverage, as well as data quality.
This will provide us with an increasingly clear picture of our footprint
and our performance – from raw materials and packaging development through to the use phase and disposal.
In 2016, we collected data from 171 sites, representing 100 percent
of our global production volume. To assess our footprint along the
entire value chain, we use representative

life cycle analyses that

cover around 70 percent of our sales across all product categories.

Ceresit – building insulation
We provide external thermal insulation
composite systems for facades for use in
the construction industry. The products are
mutually compatible and ensure
easy application, durability and reliable
­performance. The systems help to reduce
the energy used in buildings and save
energy costs. Last year, we contributed
toward saving around 90,000 metric tons
of CO2 emissions in Poland – one of our
key markets.

Dry shampoo
Dry shampoo can be used instead of washing hair. As it is only sprayed on the hair and
then combed out, no energy is needed for
heating water. This energy causes a much
greater CO2 footprint than the production
and use of the dry shampoo. The dry shampoos under the Syoss, Schauma, Taft, Got2b,
Gliss and Osis brands helped consumers save
around 8,500 metric tons of CO2 emissions
in 2016.

Somat dishwasher cleaner
Automatic dishwashers should be cleaned
regularly to keep them working properly. The
Somat dishwasher cleaner that was developed in 2016 helps to save time, water and
energy as it is the first of its kind that can be
used when the machine is fully loaded. The
amounts of energy saved by using Somat
dishwasher cleaner helped to save around
8,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions in our
markets in 2016.

Corporate Governance
The controlling company of Henkel is Henkel AG & Co. KGaA, headquartered
in Düsseldorf. Responsible corporate management and controlling, aimed at a
long-term increase in shareholder value, has always been a part of our identity. Taking into account the special aspects specific to its legal form and articles of association, Henkel AG & Co. KGaA complies with the main recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, with one exception.
So as to protect their legitimate interests and privacy, we do not list the individual shareholdings of members of the Henkel family on the Supervisory
Board or on the Shareholders’ Committee unless they exceed one percent of
Henkel shares. The remuneration of the Management Board also complies
with its guidelines. The full wording of the
declaration of compliance is

Development of the industrial site in Düsseldorf
We are continuously optimizing the existing infrastructure and processes
at Henkel’s Düsseldorf production site, the largest in the world, in order to
service our customers’ increasing delivery needs. In 2016, we doubled
truck capacity by means of extensive construction work and enabled faster
and more efficient throughput of delivery traffic via the use of advanced
logistics systems. The construction works produced a total of around
48,000 metric tons of construction waste. Of this, more than 90 percent
was taken for recycling via processing plants, while the remainder was disposed of properly. These measures evidence an important investment in
the development of our factory premises as an industrial and chemical park.

Danyang, China: intelligent wastewater recycling
The adhesive coatings production site has implemented a new wastewater recycling system based on advanced technologies that
create a “point-of-source” water recycle system. It individually identifies the contaminants in each water effluent stream and
selects the separation processes best able to handle those contaminants. As a result, all chemical wastewater in the coatings line
is treated by this system and the regenerated water will be used again, saving around 2,000 cubic meters per year.
Bogotá, Colombia: re-use of packaging waste with suppliers

Logistics and transport

The Beauty Care site worked with their packaging suppliers to install a “closed loop” reuse for the outer corrugated board boxes
in which the aluminum tubes and plastic bottles are delivered. Compared to the former boxes, the new ones are more robust and
when emptied not send for recycling anymore but returned to the supplier with the next packaging material delivery to be
directly reused. With this initiative, the site was able to save more than half its total waste.

Montornès, Spain; Ferentino and Lomazzo, Italy: more efficient thermal energy

Adhesive Technologies

The Laundry & Home Care business unit installed new generation boilers in its plants in Montornès (Spain), Ferentino and Lomazzo (Italy). In a thermal boiler, gas is burned to produce heat which is exchanged with water to generate hot water and steam. In
the new boilers, an economizer is installed downstream of the combustion process and allows to utilize the heat content of emitted fumes to preheat water fed into the boiler. This increases overall efficiency of the thermal boilers from previous 85 percent to
more than 92 percent, reducing thermal energy consumption in Spain and Italy by around 5 percent.

Düsseldorf, Germany: highly efficient on-site energy generation
Every year, the Henkel combined heat and power plant generates around 1.5 million tons of steam and 285 gigawatt hours of
electricity. Thanks to cogeneration the efficiency of converting gas, coal and oil into energy is at around 83 percent – compared
to 40 percent in conventional power plants. We use the generated electricity directly in the plant and, dependent on grid load,
feed any surpluses into the public grid or obtain additional electricity from it. In 2016, we have added two highly efficient block
heating stations together with BASF to expand our capacities. The generated electricity causes 60 percent less CO2 emissions
than compared to the public grid.

Integrating people with disabilities
At Henkel we foster a culture of inclusion which focuses on the skills and
individual talents of people with disabilities. Via targeted programs we want
to increase the number of employees with disabilities – including in our
emerging markets. In 2015, Henkel Brazil took a stronger stand in hiring
people with disabilities and, to this end, developed a special program in
cooperation with external partners and non-profit organizations, as well as
the government and the labor ministry. It includes training courses and
workshops both for employees and leaders, as well as a specific hiring process to identify people with disabilities for future positions. Since the start of
the program, around 20 people with disabilities have already been hired in
the areas of production, customer service, and logistics.

Semi-retirement at Henkel
At Henkel we want to use our TANDEMS concept (part-time work and

demographic change. The semi-retirement model enables our employees
involved in shift work and in the fire service at all German sites to move
gradually away from shift work, which increasingly takes its toll over the
years. At the same time, we encourage the targeted training of qualified
young people by having their experienced colleagues coach them in direct
preparation for a specific role. This ensures that we keep many years of
knowledge within Henkel and improves the company‘s future viability.

Childcare at Henkel
Good childcare is a decisive factor in striking a work-life balance, particularly for young parents. Henkel offers its employees support as soon as
they return to work after maternity or paternity leave. At the Düsseldorf
site there are 240 childcare places in three nurseries. In 2015, the first
Henkel company daycare center outside of Germany was opened in
Bratislava, Slovakia. Childcare places for 100 children from two years of
age were created here. Henkel also offers various forms of childcare support to its employees in other countries.

Global introduction of our strategic priorities “Henkel 2020+”
In November 2016, Henkel presented its new ambitions and strategic priorities which are to shape the company up to 2020 and beyond – “Henkel
2020+” for short. Right from the start of the year, we intensively involved
selected employees and our management team in order to mutually identify our ambitions and strategic priorities and to plan their communication
to all employees. At a global management meeting, which was broadcast
live to 200 sites, our Management Board presented the new strategic
­priorities for the first time. Shortly afterwards, around 170 top managers
enlarged upon the contents at an event lasting several days and thus
­prepared intensively for the worldwide introduction of “Henkel 2020+”. In
the following weeks, each Management Board member went on tour to
explain “Henkel 2020+” in person. Altogether they visited 22 sites in 20
key countries. Through live broadcasts, we ensured that the reach of their
message was increased to over 90 sites. At the other sites, the relevant
site manager presented our new ambitions and strategic priorities. In
order to actively involve our employees, they were able to put questions
directly to the Management Board or the site manager at all meetings, via
digital channels during the live broadcasts.

Demographic program to maintain health and working capacity
Against the background of the demographic change, the question arises as
to what Henkel and its employees can do to achieve long-term employability
up to the age of 67. Since 2013, at our corporate headquarters in
­Düsseldorf, we have been implementing a demography program after a
successful pilot phase. This holistic concept includes a combination of
preventive occupational healthcare with a general medical check-up, workability index, and employee interviews. From this we can derive profiles of
individual employees’ strengths and weaknesses as well as those of the relevant organizational unit. Employees can be informed of the individual
actions they need to take to improve and maintain their health and performance. Plant managers can see the need to take operational measures
with regard to workplace design, continuing education, and optimizing the
organization of work and the working atmosphere. This supports them in
developing their teams. Since last year the businesses have been repeating
the program, as a result of which they can evaluate the development and
success of the measures. There were distinctly positive effects in maintaining working capacity and developing a healthier lifestyle, as well as a
reduction in areas for improvement. Now the findings are being used to
identify particularly effective measures.

addition to posters, flyers, and emergency stickers, these also
included practice sessions and instructional and entertaining videos
that could be used individually by each site. The numerous events at
many locations and the high levels of participation and involvement
in the campaign demonstrate its success, as does the significant
increase in the number of first aiders worldwide. In 2017 we are continuing with the concept of the annual global health campaign, this
time on the topic of “Active Lifestyle”.

The number of projects supported was below the prior-year level. Employee
­projects gave rise to significantly more days off from work in 2016 than in the
prior year. This is due to the special commitment of employees in team volunteering projects. Generally speaking, employees may request up to five days
off from work per year for volunteer activities. Total donations were less versus
the prior year.

Since 2011, we have reported the percentage of the social projects with which Henkel supports each of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), as part of our
commitment to the United Nations Global Compact. The
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were introduced in September 2015 to replace the MDGs. We
have adapted our table to reflect the new goals while maintaining transparency about the development over time by also reflecting the previous goals. The SDGs do
not influence the type of projects proposed under our employee engagement program, but many of our corporate citizenship activities directly contribute to the SDGs.
