Deutsche Post DHL Group – Corporate Responsibility Report 2016

SEEING THE BIGGER PICTURE
At Deutsche Post DHL Group, corporate responsibility is far more than the sum of our sustainability
activities. It’s about action based on a big-picture approach. To be truly impactful, ideas and measures
must not only be aligned with the requirements of both the business and the needs of the stakeholders. They must also play into a larger, global strategy.
Responsibility transcends geographic and organizational boundaries. That’s why we – as a company
and as a part of society – take the long view, developing visions that go beyond our day-to-day
business needs. Given the social and economic challenges we face now and into the future, bigpicture thinking and actions to match are what’s needed from all of us.
To do this we need to connect the dots on a grander scale while never losing sight of the details.

ORGANIZATION & STRATEGY – The Group – A word from the CEO

A word from the CEO
Dear Readers,

We look back on a turbulent 2016, with geopolitical ten­
sions and events posing major challenges for the global
community. As the international order undergoes change,
both political leaders and financial markets orient themselves increasingly on fluctuating moods and trends. A
sensible and sustainable way to address these challenges is
through greater cooperation. As a global logistics company we know the importance of global connectedness and
global networks, and cooperation has never been more
important than it is today. In this time of change, ensur­
ing stability, continuity and opportunity requires both
concerted action and a strong sense of responsibility among
political leaders, society and the business community.
Corporate responsibility is a core component of this joint
endeavor. With its Strategy 2020, Deutsche Post DHL
Group established its goal to become a benchmark company for responsible business and, in the reporting year,
we once again demonstrated our focus and commitment
to achieving this. Our approach here is to focus our attention on the issues considered most relevant for us and our
stakeholders. We reached important milestones in several
areas and further solidified our role as a leader in sustainable logistics in 2016, especially in the area of environmental protection.
We want to support the global community in achieving the
United Nations’ two-degree climate target. After achieving
our own climate protection target well ahead of schedule in
2016, we have now articulated a new, ambitious vision for
the future. By the year 2050 we want to be the first logistics
company to make emissions-neutral transport a reality.
This will require us to further reduce our dependency on
fossil fuels and continue to improve our carbon efficiency.
Four interim goals for 2025 will help pave the way towards
our 2050 vision. First, we plan to improve our carbon efficiency by 50% over the 2007 baseline. Second, we want
70% of deliveries to be made with clean, green solutions
such as electric vehicles. Third, we want over 50% of our
sales to incorporate Green Solutions. And fourth, we
want 80% of our employees to participate in sustainability
training measures and get actively involved in environmental and climate protection projects. We also plan to

help protect the world’s forests by planting one million
trees each year together with our partners.
The Group’s commitment to the environment and to society is in line with our mission of “Connecting People, Improving Lives”. This becomes real and tangible on the local
level, where our employees engage in a diverse range of vol­
unteer activities. One example is our Group-wide Global
Volunteer Day (GVD). Once again in the reporting year
over 100,000 employees gave more than 365,000 hours of
their time to social and environmental projects as part of
GVD. In addition, some 15,000 employees in Germany
took part in our refugee initiative, making a significant
contribution to language training and workforce integration for those who have sought refuge in our country. Our
employees, of course, are crucial not only to the progress
and achievements made in the area of corporate responsibility, but also to our business performance. Their dedication, expertise and customer focus are the keys to our company’s success over the long term, which, in turn, provides
employees with both stability and opportunity into the
future. I am proud to report that we once again increased
our workforce by some 10,000 employees in 2016. We also
continued to move forward with our Group-wide Certified
initiative, which we believe will develop our people into

8

the industry’s best. As part of the Certified initiative, over
230,000 employees have already been successfully certified
and trained as specialists in their respective divisions.
Commitment and common values are also the foundation
for our strategic partnerships. I am very pleased to have
established a partnership with the global vaccine alliance
Gavi to collaborate on improving delivery of life-saving
vaccines in developing countries. In the reporting year
we also renewed our longstanding partnerships with the
Teach For All global educational network and the United
Nations, whose global sustainable development goals we
expressly support. And as a signatory of the UN Global
Compact we remain steadfast in our adherence to its ten
principles.
We look to the future with optimism without closing our
eyes to possible risks. Our efforts in the area of resilience
management have resulted in extensive and highly effective
processes to ensure the stability of the Group even in times

Deutsche Post DHL Group – Corporate Responsibility Report 2016

of change. With these in place, we can focus our attention
on future opportunities. We see tremendous potential, for
example, in today’s digital transformation. In logistics in
particular, digitization brings with it numerous opportunities to improve not only our productivity and service, but
also our performance in the area of sustainability.
We will seize upon these opportunities over the short and
long term so that we build on our strength as a business
while solidifying our role as a leader in corporate responsibility. As mentioned earlier, this will depend a great deal
on the strength of our networks and partnerships. Only
by working together can we build a future that combines
so­
cial and environmental responsibility with business
success.
Sincerely,
Dr. Frank Appel

ORGANIZATION & STRATEGY – A word from the CEO – Customers & innovation

Customers & innovation
Becoming Provider of Choice is one of the three core
objectives of our Group strategy. We regularly conduct
customer satisfaction surveys, quantify satisfaction
levels using key performance indicators (KPIs), and pursue
clearly defined targets.
Our First Choice methodology – based on Six Sigma
and Lean – provides us with an effective tool for increas­
ing customer satisfaction and loyalty. Using First Choice
we systematically and continuously improve our own
processes, services and products, and work together with
customers to further optimize solutions. Since introducing
the methodology in 2006, we have implemented well over
25,000 improvement initia­
tives, trained more than 29,000
executives and employees in
First Choice initiatives
applying the methodology,
and involved over 100,000
employees in the program through dialogue formats. The
dialogue formats convey not only knowledge of the First
Choice method, but also help employees become more
aware of improvement potential with regard to processes
and quality standards in their immediate working environments. This promotes a culture of continuous improvement
and lays the foundation for effective innovation management that responds to the real needs of our customers.
We use systematic surveys to measure satisfaction
levels among our customers. Since launching the First
Choice program, we have already commissioned and analyzed over 170 customer satisfaction studies. Customer
complaints also provide us with valuable input when analyzing optimization needs and improvement potential.

days. This puts us above the statutory requirements. The
external measuring system is audited and certified each
year by TÜV Rheinland for compliance with EN 13850
requirements. Transit times for international letters are determined by the International Post Corporation. Here, we
rank among the top postal companies. As a rule, parcels
sent within Germany reach their recipients the next work­
ing day. Our internal system for measuring parcel transit
times has been certified by TÜV Rheinland since 2008.

Global Forwarding, Freight

In the Global Forwarding business unit, we apply a sys­
tematic customer feedback approach to further improve
our offering. Once again the steady stream of customer
feedback gained through our surveys provided us with
valuable input and recommendations. In 2016, we
expanded the content of our survey and implemented the
approach in over 50 countries.
With the goal of providing the industry’s best cus­
tomer experience, we piloted our Freight website, focusing
especially on its accessibility for customers and partners,
especially with regard to mobile devices.
Supply Chain

We aim to be the quality leader in contract logistics.
Through the use of standardized processes and solutions,
and with the support of quality experts at every site, we
make sure we meet or exceed the expectations of our
customers.
In the reporting year we replaced our yearly telephonebased customer satisfaction surveys with shorter and
more frequent online surveys. In addition, our Operations
Excellence program defined uniform operational standards

and introduced a performance indicator for service quality
which regularly measures whether our sites and facilities
are fulfilling our service level commitments.
Please refer to the 2016 Annual Report for more detailed information.

INNOVATIONS
Innovation is what drives our industry forward. As the
world’s leading mail and logistics company, we see ourselves as a key driver in the transportation sector when it
comes to developing and deploying innovative technologies and processes. Taking the lead in innovation enhances not only our competitiveness and future success, but
creates added value for our customers – in the area of
logistics process automation, for example.
While each of our divisions follows its own innova­
tion agenda from an operational perspective, we also have
a dedicated Customer Solutions & Innovation unit in
place to centrally drive innovation and thought leader­
ship cross-divisionally. With their approach of customercentric innovation, our logistics and innovation experts
work collaboratively with divisions and their customers,
and also with partners in science, technology, and research
to put innovation into practice and develop tailored
solutions and services.
Close collaboration with stakeholders

One way we drive innovation is by developing more
energy-efficient and robust logistics solutions based on
technologies already available today. At the same time,
we are also committed to developing new, alternative
technologies. Here we seek collaborative partnerships
with relevant stakeholders, including customers, suppliers,
logistics initiatives and the academic community.

In the reporting year, we launched a number of new initiatives and reached important milestones in ongoing
projects.

 Big potential for improving the efficiency in warehousing operations

Augmented reality program
with smart glasses

 Augmented reality technology was expanded across different industry sectors following the

Promoting a culture of innovation

A vibrant and creative corporate culture is a key driver of
innovation. It enables new ideas to develop and take hold
and ultimately translate into innovative new products and
services.
Prime examples of this are the two innovation chal­
lenges that we organized in the reporting year. The “Fair
and Responsible Challenge” called upon inventors, universities and start-ups from around the world to develop innovative and sustainable business ideas. First prize, which
includes a joint pilot program with Deutsche Post DHL
Group, was awarded to an innovative packaging solution.
The second competition, the “Robotics Challenge,” involved the development of a self-driving delivery vehicle de­
signed to make work easier for mail carriers. Winners of
this second competition were also offered the chance to
further develop their prototype together with Deutsche
Post DHL Group. The best ideas from both competitions
were presented and officially honored on the occasion of
DHL Innovation Day on November 17, 2016 in the pre­s­
ence of 180 supply chain experts.
At the IAA 2016 we showcased our work towards
emissions-free mobility with the new long version of our
internally developed StreetScooter, which features double
the load capacity of the original StreetScooter, as well as
greater range. We also took advantage of this opportunity to
present additional StreetScooter models and applications.

Our Group initiatives First Choice and Certified also promote a working environment that encourages innovation,
creativity and entrepreneurial spirit. We provide employ­
ees with opportunities to take part in training measures
and workshops to motivate them to apply their creativity
and expertise.
Driving innovation through trend research

Deutsche Post DHL Group published a series of white papers and trend reports in the reporting year, demonstrating our thought leadership in the industry:

a s a catalyst for global trade with its world-spanning logistics networks, which make it possible for companies
and people to participate in international trade, and
a s an indirect economic factor, with our sites, employ­
ees and suppliers contributing to economic growth and
development in their respective regions.

The Group’s economic performance is presented in detail
in our 2016 Annual Report. Our solid financial position
is evidence of the trust our customers place in us as a so­
cially responsible company. At the same time, this position
allows us to expand our activity in the area of corporate
responsibility.

CONSERVATIVE TAX STRATEGY ✔ PwC
By paying taxes and other duties to federal, state and local
authorities in many different countries, the Group also
helps finance the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure. This responsibility is the basis for our conservative tax
strategy. As a global company, we also have subsidiaries in
so-called “low-tax” countries; we do not regard these as tax
optimization opportunities, but as companies that support
our business activity.
With the help of our global team of tax experts, we ensure that taxation risks can be recognized and counteract­
ed, that national and international tax-related compliance
requirements are met and, as a result, that the commercial
activities of the Group are properly taxed in the respective
countries. Please refer to our 2016 Annual Report for details on our tax expenses.

REWARDING INVESTOR TRUST ✔ PwC
We reward the trust placed in us by our investors with a
stable share price. In the reporting year, we paid out €1,027
million in dividends for fiscal year 2015, pumping this
money back into the economy. Information on dividends
for fiscal year 2016 can be found in our 2016 Annual
Report.

STAFF COSTS AT PRIOR-YEAR LEVEL ✔ PwC
With approximately 510,000 employees we are one of the
world’s largest employers. In the reporting year staff costs
amounted to €20 billion – more than one-third of Group
revenues. These costs include wages,
salaries and compensation as well as all
€
billion
other benefits paid to Group employ­
staff costs
ees for their work during the fiscal
year, including social contributions.
We also offer defined benefit and/or defined contributionbased pension plans, which accounted for approximately
€600 million of total staff costs in 2016. More detailed information on pension plans is available in the 2016 Annual
Report.
Remuneration paid to the Board of Management
and the Supervisory Board represents 0.08% of total staff
costs. In 2016 the total remuneration paid to active Board
of Management members amounted to €12.3 million;
for the Supervisory Board, that total was €2.6 million.
These figures include share-based remuneration. Please
refer to the Group Management Report for additional
details on Board of Management and Supervisory Board
remuneration.

INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ✔ PwC
We continually invest in the renewal and modernization
of our hubs, networks, and road and air fleets. One focus
of our investment policy is technological advancement,
which has helped to further our pioneering role in the area
of electric-powered delivery vehicles, for example. Please
see our chapter on “Environment & Solutions” for details.
In the reporting year, our investment expenditures
amoun­ted to more than €2 billion. A detailed report on
Group investments can be found in our 2016 Annual
Report.

With this commitment to responsible business practice we

Responsible business is an integral component of our
corporate culture and a central theme in our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct is guided by the principles of
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN
Global Compact, and takes into account widely recognized
legal standards including applicable anti-corruption laws
and conventions.
Deutsche Post DHL Group is also committed to the
United Nation’s Global Goals for Sustainable Development
(Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs). In the reporting
year the Group took a close look at each of the SDGs and
engaged in dialogue with its stakeholders to determine
how the Group can contribute most effectively to achiev­
ing the SDGs. As a result, we have decided to leverage
our existing Group-wide programs in order to focus
on the following SDGs: Quality Education (#4), Decent
Work and Economic Growth (#8), Sustainable Cities and
Communities (#11), Climate Action (#13) and Partner­
ships for the Goals (#17). We have also created a tool
that clearly outlines how our portfolio of products and
services is al­
ready addressing sustainable development
issues worldwide. Please see our corporate website for
details.
Combining profitability and corporate responsibility
is one of the fundamental objectives of the Group and its
stakeholders. In 2015, we conducted a materiality analysis
together with our various stakeholders to define priority
action areas (material issues) for our company; these material issues remain unchanged. We are planning to review
the materiality matrix and the expectations of our stakeholders in 2017.

ORGANIZATION & STRATEGY – Strategy

FOCUS AREAS ✔ PwC
Our Group-wide activities and objectives in the area of
sustainability are focused on five main areas:
 rganization & strategy
O
	As part of an ongoing CR man­agement process, we
identify relevant issues for our sustainability agenda
and make sure we are on track to achieve our strategic
goal of becoming a benchmark company for responsible business. Through continuous dialogue with our
stakeholders and feedback from internal and external
CR committees, we ensure that the company remains
mindful of stakeholder expectations in the area of society and environment.
n
 mployees & workplace
E
	Our goal is to create a corporate culture of openness,
trust, non-discrimination and long-term loyalty based
on mutual appreciation and respect. Recruiting the
right people to fill open positions and continuously motivating and developing our existing workforce
worldwide are among the most important functions of
our human resources management. These are the key
factors for our success.
n
 rinciples & guidelines
P
	Through responsible business practice, which is firmly embedded in our corporate strategy, we ensure that
our business operates in accordance with applicable
laws, ethical standards and international guidelines. In
this way, we make a contribution to society and create
business opportunities while minimizing business and
investment risk for us, our customers and our investors.
At the same time we continuously enhance our reputation as a company and employer.
n
S ociety & engagement
	We mobilize our core strengths and competencies as
the world’s leading mail and logistics company for the

(Shared Value). We have set our sights on an ambitious
goal: By 2050 we want to achieve net zero transportrelated emissions and contribute to the two-degree
goal established at the 2015 UN Paris Climate Con­
ference (COP 21).

MANAGEMENT PROCESS ✔ PwC
Deutsche Post DHL Group has set ambitious goals for
combining sustainability with business success. Reaching
these goals requires that we understand and honor the
expectations of our stakeholders – especially employees,
customers and investors – and continuously improve our
performance in the area of corporate responsibility. Our
CR management process provides the framework for a systematic approach to CR activities that allows for transpar­
ency and measurability. Structure and openness serve as
two guiding principles:
n

n

 ny information we receive from our stakeholder diaA
logues, initiatives and partnerships, or CR ratings, for
example, is carefully considered and assessed for its rel­
evance to our business (openness).
 e apply a management process to systematically
W
identify material issues and define specific actions,
goals and KPIs (structure).

We report to our stakeholders on progress made and take
this opportunity to gather additional input from them. In
addition, we consider the recommendations of the independent experts who make up the Sustainability Advisory
Council.

Stakeholder engagement
We maintain a constructive and critical dialogue with our
stakeholders and consider this an important prerequisite
for responsible business. This open exchange, which takes
place on a regular basis with all of our stakeholders, is of
strategic importance for the Group and an integral part of
our approach to CR management. We also view the ongoing dialogue with our stakeholders as an important facilitator of collaboration with stakeholders, helping us to
understand and effectively address the social and business
challenges considered most relevant for our company.
We engage in a range of different dialogue formats with
our stakeholders to continuously improve our understand­
ing of their views and expectations. Among other acti­­vities,
we participate in national and international forums where
we collaborate with stakeholders to develop solutions and
establish our position on specific issues. Priority is given
here to forums and other formats that allow us to actively
participate in shaping the dialogue on overarching issues.
Examples include the World Economic Forum, the UN
Global Compact and Econsense, as well as more targeted
initiatives, such as Green Freight Asia, which focuses on
specific environmental issues.
As a longtime strategic partner of the World Econom­
ic Forum, Deutsche Post DHL Group takes part in the
dialogue between global leaders in business, politics
and society. In the reporting year we met with decisionmakers and leading logistics industry experts at the
World Econom­ic Forum in Davos as well as at regional
summits in Africa and India to share best practices and
discuss strategies for addressing transport industry
challenges. Discussions focused on issues such as digital
trans­formation, sustainable business and the complexity of
transnational supply chains. These sessions also generated
valuable stakeholder feedback, which will help us identify
and plan for both regional and global requirements and
challenges facing the logistics sector in the 21st century.
The dialogue with our stakeholders is standardized
across the Group in accordance with our Stakeholder Engagement Guideline (SE Guideline), which is based on the
international AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement Standard
(AA1000SES). We provide our employees with internal
exchange platforms and various trainings to further improve their knowledge of the SE Guideline and their overall
stakeholder orientation. In addition, our two DHL Innovation Centers in Troisdorf, Germany, and Singapore provide

STAKEHOLDER DIALOGUE FORMATS
A key component of our CR management approach is
the dialogue with our major stakeholder groups; this is a
continuous process that provides a steady stream of infor­
mation and insight to guide our actions. As an example,
we consider the recommendations issued by the UN High
Level Advisory Group on Sustainable Transport, in which

Deutsche Post DHL Group also participated, as our
guide­line for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fuel
consumption. We also support the climate goal established
at the 2015 UN Paris Climate Conference (COP 21) and
have oriented our activities accordingly.

MANAGING CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY ✔ PwC
The standards for responsible corporate governance are set
in the Corporate Center and in Global Business Services.
These include, first and foremost, the company’s strategic
direction, systematic dialogue with stakeholder groups,
Group policies that are central to corporate responsibility, such as the Code of Conduct, but also cross-divisional
functions such as compliance and supplier management.
Standards are also set for remuneration in the Group,
health management and occupational safety.
The divisions are responsible for aligning customer requirements with the strategic and ethical principles of corporate responsibility and for anchoring the Code of Conduct for Suppliers in their contractual relationships.

Deutsche Post DHL Group – Corporate Responsibility Report 2016

With clear governance structures, management systems,
KPIs and targets along with regular reporting we man­age
the issues and create a high degree of transparency. At the

External recognition
Our performance as a company is evaluated independently against economic, ecological, social and ethical standards by rating agencies and other institutions according
to their own autonomous principles. We also utilize select
rating platforms to have our performance capability as a
service provider externally evaluated according to similar
standards.
Key ratings from rating agencies in 2016

Deutsche Post DHL Group – Corporate Responsibility Report 2016

Major achievements in the reporting year included our
relisting in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI
World, DJSI Europe) and the RobecoSam Bronze Class
sustainability award. Of special significance was the “AAA”
rating from MSCI in the transport sector – Deutsche Post
DHL Group remains the only logistics company with this
top score, an honor we have received for three consecu­
tive years now. Also noteworthy: CDP awarded the Group
a grade of “A-” for its environmental performance,
making Deutsche Post DHL Group a “Sector Leader” for
the DACH region (Germany, Austria and Switzerland) in
the category “Transportation”.
Rating results 2016

Rating management

More and more investment decisions are based on nonfinancial KPIs and the rankings of CR rating agencies.
Today more than 40% of our share capital is held by signatories of the Principles for Responsible Investment initiative, whose aims include advocating for more transpar­
ency in the reporting of non-financial key performance
indicators. Customers also increasingly view a company’s
presence on an ESG (Environment, Social, Gover­nance)
index as a factor when deciding to purchase services,
award contracts, etc.
These ratings are of strategic significance to our company. We consult them when we review the direction of
our CR activities and use them as a benchmark compar­
ison. Rating agencies are among the stakeholder groups
surveyed as part of our materiality analysis.
A leader in corporate responsibility

Our strong ratings were confirmed by a variety of ratings
agencies and the ESG performance platforms in the report­
ing year. We also received awards for our performance in
the areas of HR, corporate citizenship and environmental
protection.

“Right now, the year 2050 seems a long way off – 33 years to be exact. Over this time we’ll see countless new generations of vehicles, but only a few new generations of aircraft. And container ships being
launched today are built to operate for 20 years or more. So we have to use these three decades to
convert our business to zero emissions technologies.”

Deutsche Post DHL Group – Corporate Responsibility Report 2016

EMPLOYEES & WORKPLACE
Management approach & targets

✔ PwC

Our market position as a leader in the postal and logistics
industry and the innovative power of Deutsche Post DHL
Group are largely founded on the commitment shown
by our workforce of approximately 510,000 employees
and their readiness to continually further their personal
and professional development. Becoming and remaining
Employer of Choice is a core objective of our corporate
strategy. We are therefore committed to excellence when
it comes to human resources management, leveraging the
potential of our employees worldwide, giving them the
opportunity to develop and grow, and recruiting the right
candidates to fill open positions.
We offer a supportive, respectful work environment in
which our employees can develop their creative potential
and commitment to the full. We believe that open, constructively led employer-employee dialogue is just as important as fair, reasonable and competitive remuneration.
Our Code of Conduct provides the foundation for a corporate culture characterized by mutual respect and sets the
benchmark for our actions as individuals and as a company. We see great strength in the diversity of our workforce
and the potential in each and every one of our employees.
The objective of our diversity management approach is to
create an understanding of the various facets of diversity, heighten awareness of all forms of discrimination and

assist both managers and employees in ensuring a culture
of acceptance and respect.
Great importance is placed on open and direct communication between managers and their employees at
Deutsche Post DHL Group. It not only demonstrates a culture of mutual respect. It also plays a key role in employee
satisfaction. We use our annual Employee Opinion Survey
to assess employee engagement and satisfaction. Survey
results are used to make continuous improvements in the
workplace the organization. They are also used to derive
our “Active Leadership” indicator; performance in this area
is a variable remuneration component for our executives.
The survey has also shown us that personal development
and further training and education are important factors
in promoting employee engagement. In this spirit, we are
using the Group-wide Certified initiative to make our employees the best in the business.
As a responsible employer, the health and safety of our
employees are number-one priorities for us. We want to
provide our employees with a workplace that promotes
health, provides access to a healthcare system and fosters a
workplace culture that places safety first.
We measure the success of our human resources man­
agement measures with the help of various KPIs, which
we track and evaluate with the help of the HR Scorecard;
results are reported to management on a regular basis.
For the HR themes of relevance for our stakeholders, we
have defined the following management parameters and
targets:

Employees

Developing our future workforce ✔ PwC

At the end of 2016, our global workforce numbered some
510,000 employees, making us one of the biggest employ­
ers in both Germany and the world. The vast majority of
our workforce is made up of employees who work in the
operative side of the business and are responsible for processing and distributing shipments and goods. We also
employ experts in a range of specialist disciplines. These
include logistics experts, IT and finance specialists, and
managers.

WORKFORCE STRUCTURE ✔ PwC
Given our position as the leading postal and logistics services provider, we were able to employ some 10,000 more
employees in the reporting year as compared to 2015. Our
global workforce, which now totals 508,036 employees,
comprises 65% men and 35% women. The average age is
41. We have some 330,000 employees in Europe, making
it the Group’s largest region in terms of employment numbers. Of these, around 211,000 employees are based in
Germany, where our headquarters are located.

We consider several factors when calculating and man­
aging our future workforce structure – these include not
only our operative requirements but the projected effects
of fluctuation rates. Close and particular attention is paid
to unplanned turnover, which includes the short-notice
departure of employees due to changes in personal circumstances, for example.
Workforce fluctuation opens up opportunities for
other employees, allowing them to assume new responsi­
bilities and further their development. Internal hiring
helps us retain expertise while new hires bring fresh ideas
and new insights.
In 2016, average employee turnover Group-wide was
around 15%, on par with the annual average in the transport and logistics sector. Over the course of the reporting
year, approximately 8% of employees left the Group unplanned. Analyses show strong regional differences in our
unplanned turnover figures. It is lowest in Europe (4%),
where we employ the majority of our workforce. In the
Americas and in Asia Pacific, it reaches into the double
digits, an effect of the dynamic market environment.
Detailed data on fluctuation can be found in the Annex
to this report.

We offer men and women the same opportunities and
career perspectives. In upper and middle management, the
share of women in executive positions is 21.1%. We also
strive to make the jobs and working models we offer more
attractive to women, and to prepare suitable women employees for leadership roles.
One reason we are able to attract employees all over
the world is that both our business and our workforce are
international. In our Bonn headquarters alone, we employ
people from approximately 50 different countries.

NEW HIRES – INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL
RECRUITMENT
Instead of filling vacant positions or newly-created jobs
primarily through the recruitment of external candidates,
whenever appropriate, we make it a point to assign employ­
ees new responsibilities
or give them opportunities for job
Wert 2016 508,036
advancement. Developing our training methods and HR
development measures is therefore important for us and
something we do as part of an ongoing process. Over 70%
of vacant management positions in 2016 were filled with
internal candidates
Job applicants use our global online recruiting platform to learn about and apply for training and career
opportunities within the Group. The platform is an effective way for finding the most suitable candidate for the job
and filling open positions quickly and efficiently. We offer
equal opportunities for both internal and external hires, as
laid down in our Code of Conduct and the Deutsche Post
DHL Group Diversity and Inclusion Statement. Applicants
are judged on the basis of merit alone, and hiring decisions
are based on the qualifications of each individual applicant.

30

Recruiting young employees

We offer a wide range of employment opportunities for job
starters and recent graduates. There are, however, significant differences between the vocational training systems in
different countries and regions. In many regions, apprenticeship training takes the form of on-the-job training.
In Europe, training is mainly through vocational schools
and colleges. Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland have special dual systems which combine on-the-job
training at a company or organization with classroom
learn­ing at a state vocational school. We train our young
employees according to the applicable norms, standards
and guidelines in the respective countries and pre­pare
them for their future role in professional life. In 2016,
we received some 28,000 applications for apprenticeship
positions in Germany.
We have established numerous trainee and college
recruiting programs. The trainee program Graduate
Opportunities Worldwide (GROW), for instance, develops
outstanding recent graduates with Bachelor or Master’s
degrees to become specialists and managers within our
company. For the duration of the 18-month program,
GROW trainees are supported by a mentor who provides
them with regular feedback and career planning support.
In 2016, 38 participants were selected from a pool of over
4,000 applicants.
We have also collaborated with the international student organization AIESEC since 1996 to provide more
than 100 internships Group-wide each year for qualified

Deutsche Post DHL Group – Corporate Responsibility Report 2016

university students. This helps strengthen our competitive
position in the war for talent.
Vocational occupations and integrated degree programs in
Germany

Deutsche Post DHL Group is one of the biggest voca­tional
training companies in Germany. In 2016, we hired some
2,500 new apprentices and students. This brought the
total number of apprentices to around 4,000. Of these,
76% were hired into full-time positions – or part-time
work if requested – after they had completed their train­
ing. We aim to continue with our vocational training pol­
icy and plan to offer 2,472 new apprenticeship and study
positions in 2017.
We offer a wide range of vocational occupations. Depending on their level of education and individual interests,
at our company in Germany, secondary school graduates
can choose from over 15 different officially recog­nized
apprenticeships and twelve inte­
grated degree programs which combine university studies with fixed
trainees
periods of work practice. Given
that we receive 11.3 app­licants for
each apprenticeship position, we are able to fill vacant
positions with highly qualified and ambitious candi­dates.
Graduates who have completed one of the integrated
study programs are in demand within our company and have
the opportunity to take on management responsibility in a
relatively short amount of time.

EMPLOYEE OPINION SURVEY: GIVING EMPLOYEES
A VOICE ✔ PwC
Our annual Employee Opinion Survey (EOS), which
we introduced in 2009, is our central tool for assessing
employee engagement. The EOS aims to do the following:
n
n

n

S trengthen our corporate and leadership culture
 auge employee awareness of and identification with
G
our values and the Group’s corporate strategy
I dentify success factors and action areas for contin­
uously improving the workplace and to compare our
results with those of other companies

At 74% in 2016, the EOS participation rate reflects the high
level of acceptance the survey enjoys among our employ­
ees. We expressly encourage our employees to give their
honest opinion in the survey, which is purely voluntary.
Employees’ data is completely anonymized and assessed
by an external, independent company. The same question­
naire is used throughout the Group, ensuring comparability of results for all categories and questions across the
divisions. The questionnaire comprises 41 questions across
ten different key performance indicators (KPIs) and the
Performance Enablement Index.

One of the survey’s central KPIs, Employee Engagement,
helps us gauge the extent to which employees feel motivat­
ed to make our company successful and go the extra mile
for our customers. The Performance Enablement Index
helps us to establish not only whether our employees feel
motivated to give their very best to our customers. Employee Engagement achieved a result of 75% in 2016, two
percentage points above the external reference value. For
Performance Enablement, we achieved a rating of 81%, five
percentage points higher than the external reference value.
Our managers influence employee engagement and
motivation through their personal management styles.
They also serve as role models in implementing our
corporate values and goals. The results from the
Active Lead­ership section of the survey are used as a central
non-financial performance indicator for the Group. Performance in this area is also a variable remuneration component for our executives. In 2016, the Group-wide result
for this KPI rose by one percentage point compared with
2015, thus meeting our 74% target for the reporting year.
Positive survey outcome and outlook ✔ PwC

The positive results for 2016 strengthen us in our business approach. Given the challenges we face, not least the
digital transformation of our company, we take encouragement from the survey to strive for further improvement.
For 2017, we have set ourselves the goal of improving the
approval for the Active Leadership KPI by another percent­
age point.
Detailed results from the Employee Opinion Survey
can be found in the Annex to this report.

that are subject to local and position-specific requirements
and regulations. In some countries, compensation also
covers retirement plan contributions as well as health insurance costs.
In Germany wages or salaries are generally regulated
through either industry-level or company-level collect­ive
wage agreements. In many of our companies through­
out Germany, our wage-scale employees also receive a
performance-based bonus in addition to their wage or
salary. At our principal company Deutsche Post AG in
Germany, wage-scale employees generally receive a bonus
of between 5% and 17.5% of their annual base salary.
Non-managerial, non-pay-scale employees are entitled to
a bonus of between 17.5% and 40% of their annual base
salary.
Job evaluation system ensures reasonable pay

We apply a systematic job evaluation approach to ensure
reasonable and equitable compensation within the company. Positions are graded based on job category and job
content alone and in line with our corporate values.

COMPENSATION
A system of performance-based, market-standard remu­
neration combined with long-term incentives plays a
key role in making us an attractive employer. Along with
monetary compensation, we also provide a wide range of
non-financial incentives intended to motivate our employ­
ees to go the extra mile for our customers and to retain
them for the long term.
Over 70% of all Group employees are employed
under contracts governed by collective labor agreements,
works agreements or legally binding statutory increases.
Monetary compensation includes a base salary plus vari­
a­ble remuneration components such as bonus payments

As a responsible employer, our pay structures take into account not only national minimum wage requirements and
the needs of our divisions, but local market demands as
well. We strive to offer reasonable and competitive compensation packages in all of the markets we serve.
In many countries Deutsche Post DHL Group also provides employees with access to defined benefit and defined
contribution retirement plans, and assumes the costs of
health insurance and treatment for employees and their
family members.

Additional benefits

In addition to monthly monetary compensation, we also
offer employees attractive non-financial benefits.
Flexible work models
	We offer flexible working models which vary according
to operational needs and requirements. These meas­
ures help our employees to better combine and balance
family and career, and can also enable them to remain
in employment for a longer period. In response to the
aging workforce in Germany, in 2011 a Generations
Pact was signed between Deutsche Post AG and the
trade unions, which largely comprises a partial retirement program and working-time accounts. Compar­
able provisions also apply as of 2016 for civil servants
employed by our parent company in Germany,
Deutsche Post AG.

	We work together with a Germany-wide service provider to support employees in their work-life balance
choices such as finding suitable childcare service or care
for family members. These family-friendly services,
which include advice, emergency care and vacation
programs, are available to all employees. In some locations, we invest in the creation of company-supported
childcare facilities. We also offer a relocation service
to facilitate work-related moves and get employees
settled in their new environment quickly and easily.
	The Recreation Service (ErholungsWerk), which re­
ceives financial support from Deutsche Post DHL
Group, enables current and former employees and
their families to take advantage of affordable vacation
offers. Under certain income-related circumstances,
children of employees can also receive vacation grants.
Such grants were approved for approximately 2,500
children in the reporting year.
n
S cholarships for employee children
	Our Group-wide Upstairs program provides scholar­
ships for children of our employees. Since launching
the program, we have provided over 2,000 scholarships
to employees’ children in more than 120 countries
around the world, thus helping them to pursue higher
levels of education. In addition, more than 400 em­
ployee children have received pre-vocational support
in the form of applica­tion writing workshops, summer
school courses and work placements.

DEVELOPMENT AS A DRIVER OF MOTIVATION
A key prerequisite in motivating and retaining talented
employees is their professional and per­sonal development.
Discovering and promoting the potential of our ap­
prox­
imately 510,000 employees is thus an important
function of our human resources management work.
Against the backdrop of demographic change and given
the differing educational levels in developing and
emerging markets, this brings a number of challenges.
Group-wide Certified initiative: Turning employees into
experts ✔ PwC

We want to deliver first-class service and be our cus­tomers’
Provider of Choice. We also want to be the Employer of
Choice for our employees. But we can only achieve both
these goals by making our employees the best in the
business and by giving them
the opportunity to exploit
their potential to the full. As
employees certified
part of the Group-wide Certified initiative, we want to
turn 80% of our employees into experts in their respective
divisions by 2020. More than 230,000 have already been
certified.
The broad-based, modular program gives employees
an insight into the business model, strategy and culture
of their own division and enables them to acquire specific
knowledge about the Group and the role they play within
it. The Certified modules are conducted by company man­
agers and employees whom we train as facilitators. These
“home-grown” facilitators are key to the success of the program as they embody the values of our corporate culture
and, since participating employees see them as being
partic­ularly credible, lend them special weight. Through­
out the Group, 4,045 managers and employees have al­
ready been trained to facilitate Certified program modules.

developed especially for employees in local-level business units. Many of these courses are available as online
seminars, while some involve presence events or video
conferencing.
 ife-long learning: with our life-long learning, career
L
development and preventive health programs, we se­
cure the performance and motivation of employees in
all age groups.
 ersonal development plans: development plans with
P
appropriate measures and training are developed in
conversations that take place regularly between employ­
ees and their managers. Wherever possible and practicable, training is conducted online using our eLearning
platform. To aid decision-making for key career paths
within the Group, we provide so-called Learning &
Development Planning Guides.

One of our most important leadership principles for our
managers is commitment to their own continual personal
and professional development, and to the continued development of their employees. It also involves developing
an awareness for the principles of our Code of Conduct so
that managers can lead by example and better communi­
cate the requirements of the Code.
To advance the Group strategy and further develop the
company’s leadership culture, higher-level executives take
part in a range of different programs with a view to devel­
oping their leadership skills and helping their employees to
give their best every day:
n

n

 roup-wide programs: modular development proG
grams based on training methods such as reflection,

tion in these programs, the members of the Board of
Management play a central role by sharing their own
management experience.
S pecialized and customized training: leadership seminars and development programs specially tailored to
individual needs.

4.6 million hours

In 2016, 76% of our workforce
spent more than 4.6 million
hours in various online training courses and classroom
educa­tion measures. This is equivalent to an average of 1.5
training days per year for each of our employees. Further
of education and
training

education and training programs are available without restriction to all employees provided that they have an indefinite employment contract, and subject to operational
needs.

DIALOGUE WITH OUR EMPLOYEES
We use our Group-wide internal communications channels to promote a corporate culture of openness and shape
opinion within the company. Internal communications is
designed not only to inform employees, but to give them
direction, encourage them to support our company’s goals,
and strengthen their identification with the Group. Our internal communication measures focus on communicating
corporate messages and values, details of current issues
and developments, and the exchange of information across
our divisions and regions.
We foster dialogue through the use of new, interact­
ive offerings and we support collaboration and networking
with innovative applications in our Group-wide corporate
intranet. Using a broad range of communications channels, such as the Extranet, newsletters, digital wall displays,
print media, posters and flyer-based campaigns, we ensure
that all employees, both those with access to a computer
workstation and those without, always receive information
that is of particular relevance to them.
Our employees at all levels of our organization receive
timely information about key developments and organizational changes that could impact their work. In addition to
event-type formats, such as staff meetings and video conferences, we place great importance on one-to-one talks.
Our managers are therefore committed to seeking and
maintaining trust-based dialogue with their employees.

EMPLOYEES & WORKPLACE – Diversity management

Diversity management
All Different – Together Successful: this is the motto under
which people from different cultures with diverse backgrounds, world-views and talents come together as a team
at Deutsche Post DHL Group. Working as one, they find
innovative solutions, develop new markets and win new
customers. We consider this diversity a source of tremendous potential – a driver of continued business growth and
a key to attracting and retaining talent in our company.

Diversity management brings responsibility and opportunity

“Our success is derived from the knowledge, skills
and perceptions of our approximately 510,000
employees worldwide. We thus place great importance on greeting the diversity and individuality of
our workforce by showing tolerance and respect.“
MELANIE KREIS
MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT FINANCE, HR

Our commitment to diversity is also reflected in our contribution to refugee aid in Germany. Please see the Society & Engagement chapter for additional details. Deutsche
Post DHL Group was recognized several times in 2016 for
its exemplary social engagement.
In the reporting year, we enhanced our diversity KPI
monitoring system; performance against the KPIs is
regularly reported to Management and discussed. This
brings greater transparency to this topic, helps identify
action areas and promotes exchange between our business
divisions.

«

This international structure and multicultural teamwork
increases our attractiveness as a potential employer. In
Germany, we employ people from more than 150 countries
– people from about 50 countries work at our headquarters
in Bonn alone. Diversity is simply a part of who we are at
Deutsche Post DHL Group.
As a global enterprise, we also believe it is important
to align with local and cultural conditions in the diverse
countries and markets in which we operate. We thus rely
on local managers, whom we train and develop so they can
grow our business by putting their local knowledge to use.
Diversity and mutual respect are core corporate values
and are embraced across the Group. In addition to everyday examples of respectful and valued collaboration in the
workplace, these values are confirmed in the results of our
annual Employee Opinion Survey, to which we added a diversity component in 2015. The results show how the many
facets of diversity are both accepted and integrated into
our everyday dealings with one another, and serve to highlight areas for improvement. We are expressly committed
to equal opportunity and emphasize this both in our Code
of Conduct and the Deutsche Post DHL Group Corporate
Diversity & Inclusion Statement. We encourage employees
to report violations of the Code of Conduct through various channels, including our Compliance Hotline.

Managers and executives play a key role in putting diversity management into practice on a daily basis. We therefore
offer management-level staff special diversity training.
The Diversity Council, an internal committee chaired
by the Board Member for Human Resources that includes
executives from the central functions and the div­isions,
advises on diversity management strategy. It convened
three times in the reporting year and placed particular
focus on the diversity within our man­
agement teams.
Items on the agenda included processes for increasing
the number of women in management as well as the diversity of nationalities in management positions. Diversity
Council members also function as advocates for diver­
sity within their respective divisions. In addition to the
Diversity Council, the company also has diversity management experts in place at the regional and country levels as
well as at headquarters.
For the fourth time in succession, we took the opport­u­­nity to extend Diversity Day, a Germany-wide event organized around the Diversity Charter on June 7, 2016, by
holding an entire Diversity Week. At over 200 locations,
some 40,000 employees took part in activities and events
on various diversity-related topics. In cooperation with the
Diversity Charter, the DHL hub in Leipzig held a series of
diversity workshops and expert talks from June 7 - 9, 2016.
The kick-off event, arranged as a podium discussion with
managers and our Board Member for Human Resources,
focused on the significance of our diverse workforce for
Deutsche Post DHL Group. In a subsequent open forum,
topics included dealing with diversity in society as a whole
and its significance for Leipzig as a business location.

Deutsche Post DHL Group – Corporate Responsibility Report 2016

WOMEN IN EXECUTIVE POSITIONS

LIVING DIVERSITY

The share of women in upper and middle management in
the reporting year was 21.1%. Measures implemented in
2016 resulted in a slight increase compared with 2015.
We report at regular intervals to the HR Board and
the Board of Management on the status of women in
lead­
ership positions, and
ad­
vise on ways to effect
further improvement. In
2016, the HR Board decid­
women in management
ed to review and enhance
positions
the Group’s HR processes.
A succession action plan was prepared to ensure that all
candidates with equal qualifications and suitability receive
the same consideration regardless of gender.
As part of our annual succession planning process, we
take an equitable, gender-neutral approach when review­
ing employee profiles for suitability and readiness to take
on management roles. We then prepare the employees we
select for their next career step and provide them with
targeted development support.
We also have a number of Group-wide programs in
place which are designed to achieve a continual and last­
ing increase in the share of women in management roles.
These include career planning and work-life balance workshops, career coaching, mentoring programs and networks
for women. In Germany, we provide flexible working mod­
els as well as childcare-related services. We also use our
internal media to report regularly on the topic of women
in management positions, how they reconcile work and
family life, and showcase mixed leadership teams that are
helping to drive business success.
A key area of focus in 2016 involved the implementation of the German Act on Equal Participation of Women
and Men in Leadership Positions in the Private and Public
Sectors. In accordance with this legislation, we committed
to increasing the share of women in the first management
level to 19% and to 23% in the second management level
at our principal company, Deutsche Post AG in Germany,
by the end of 2016. With the share of women in the first
management level at 18.4% in 2016, we came close to
our target of 19% for the reporting year. We significantly
exceeded our 23% target for the second management level,
achieving 28.4%.
More detailed information on this subject is included
in our Corporate Governance Report 2016.

We create a working environment that enables people with
disabilities to take an active part in working life. In 2016,
we employed a total of 15,456 persons with disabilities at
our principal company in Germany, Deutsche Post AG.
This represents an average annual employment rate of
9.9% and was once again well above the national average
in Germany’s private sector (4.1% in 2014; source: German
Federal Employment Agency).
We make it a point to approach people with disabilities and offer them the opportunity to learn a trade. At
the end of 2016, 16
youths with disabilities were enrolled in
employees with disabilities
apprentice­ships at our
principal

LGBTI diversity

We embrace and respect gender and sexual diversity, and
as a globally active enterprise we believe we have special
responsibility in this regard. Eight years ago, we estab­lished
our Group-wide RAINBOWNET network for LGBTI
employees. Founded in Germany, the network has contact
with employees in several other European countries as well
as in Malaysia, Singapore and the US.
At the invitation of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), in September 2016
we participated in a regional Europe Workshop in Brussels

and the trade unions. The aim was to discuss recommendations to help transnational corporations combat discrimination against homosexuals, bisexuals and transsexuals.
Deutsche Post DHL Group is also one of the founding
members of the PROUT AT WORK Foundation. Established in January 2014, the organization is committed to
greater recognition and equal opportunity for LGBTI employees in the workplace. With a seat on the PROUT AT
WORK advisory board, Deutsche Post DHL Group has
the opportunity to shape the foundation’s work and send
a clear message in favor of diversity. Over the course of the
reporting year, Deutsche Post DHL Group took part in the
PROUT EMPLOYER program and enabled our employees
to attend various PROUT events. These included a workshop for lesbians, a seminar for homosexual and bisexual
employees on the topic of Coming Out at Work, and the
PROUT AT WORK conference.

Employee relations

✔ PwC

Respect and fairness in the workplace are values we live by
at Deutsche Post DHL Group. They are also embedded in
our Code of Conduct. The Code serves as an ethical compass to guide us in how we treat one another within the
Group. We expect our managers to lead by example in both
behavior and values, fostering the corporate culture and
the principles of Deutsche Post DHL Group in everything
they do. The Code of Conduct is therefore an integral component of employment contracts with our managers.
As a signatory to the UN Global Compact, we are
committed to respecting human rights in our employee
relations and, as laid down in our Supplier Code of Conduct, require that our suppliers do the same when dealing
with their own employees. To demonstrate our respect for
human rights, we worked with our entities in the UK to
prepare a Modern Slavery Statement pursuant to the UK
Modern Slavery Act. The Statement outlines our approach
for detecting and preventing modern slavery in our supply
chain operations.
We believe that a corporate culture that is free from
discrimination and in which the performance and engagement of each and every employee are honored will help
us to become Employer of Choice. By putting sustainable
employee relations structures in place, we have created the
framework necessary for achieving this goal. We aim to:
n

S trengthen the engagement and motivation of our
employees
 mpower our executives and managers to interact with
E
their teams openly, appropriately and responsibly
 nticipate future trends and respond accordingly with

Our approach to employee relations has been well re­
ceived and officially recognized by internal and external
stakeholders.

EMPLOYEE RELATIONS FORUM EXPANDS
ITS SCOPE ✔ PwC
The Employee Relations Forum (ER Forum) address­
es employee relations issues worldwide that could have
cross-divisional or Group-wide impact. The ER Forum is a
governance body consisting of employee relations experts

from all divisions and from Group headquarters. Action
recommendations made by the ER Forum are discussed
and approved by the HR Board. Additional ER Forum
action areas include:
n

n
n

n

S haring best-practice solutions and processes from the
regions and divisions
 eveloping training courses tailored to local needs
D
 acilitating exchange at regional and country level
F
among the divisions
 eepening our understanding of stakeholder requireD
ments and expectations with regard to employee relations and human rights issues

In the course of the reporting year, the ER Forum intensified its collaboration with internal departments such as
Corporate Procurement, the Global Compliance Office
and the CR experts in Corporate Communications and
Responsibility, and reinforced existing processes. Members of the ER Forum work in various parts of the world,
ensuring that local and regional experiences and insights
are shared. In addition to these monthly meetings, a workshop was held with the Board Member for HR to discuss
trends and set priorities for 2016. We also publish a biweekly newsletter for employees in HR and provide summaries for managers as a way to raise awareness for em­
ployee relations issues within the Group.
Training and awareness ✔ PwC

Another way we raise awareness about employee relations
and human rights issues and how they impact our company is through training modules included in our Groupwide Certified initiative. The module “Building Great
Employee Relations” targets managers and was introduced
over the course of the reporting year. During this time, a
total of 700 employees completed the course. The module
is available in key languages across the Group and will be
translated into additional languages in the near future.
We also developed a module for HR experts to enable
them to help local managers in applying the Code of Conduct on-site and support in efforts to improve employee relations. We conducted three pilot trainings in the reporting
year and plan to roll out the module Group-wide in 2017.

LOCAL EMPLOYEE RELATIONS DUE DILIGENCE

EXCHANGE WITH EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES

✔ PwC

✔ PwC

We conduct regular country-level Employee Relations
Assessments as part of our ER due diligence process. These
help us to:

In addition to dialogues with their supervisors and other
members of management, the majority of our workforce
makes use of bodies such as employee committees, works
councils or unions to represent their interests. Over 70%
of all Group employees are employed under contracts
governed by collective labor agreements, works agreements or legally binding statutory increases. In Germany,
where 42% of our workforce is employed, we cooperate
with employee representatives in all divisions where works
councils have been formed. In fact, half of our Supervisory
Board consists of elected employee representatives.
The primary responsibility for managing local em­
ployee representatives and trade unions rests with the
divisions at a country and local site level. At the global
level we engage in regular dialogues with the Global Union
Federations such as the UNI Global Union (UNI) and the
International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF).
As part of our collaborative dialogue, in March and
June, 2016, we were able to officially conclude the matters
which had led to the Joint Statement issued in 2014 by
the German National Contact Point (NCP) of the OECD,
Deutsche Post DHL Group, UNI and ITF. The issues
concerning Latin America, including alleged violations
of employee rights and improper employee opinion survey practices, were resolved by mutual agreement in August, 2016. It was agreed that dialogue with the Global
Union Federations would take place on a quarterly basis.
Having held two meetings in the reporting year, the talks will
continue with four meetings already scheduled for 2017.

 ain insight into employee relations in the respective

I dentify challenges in this area and help local management address them with the right tools and processes

The experience gathered since introducing the ER due
diligence process in 2013 has helped us to sharpen our
focus and place greater emphasis on issues such as freedom
of association, working hours and employment conditions.
ER due diligence includes round-table sessions with
randomly selected employees from various operating
areas. Conducted according to our core value of respect,
the round-tables allow employees to voice their opinions.
Feedback from these sessions is provided anonymously
to management, which is accountable for developing and
implementing appropriate actions.
Integral to the due diligence process is crossdivisional exchange between HR experts and business
managers as well as the Certified module “Building Great
Employee Relations”. These measures enable our man­
agers throughout the Group to carry out their daily duties
in a way that supports the Group’s aspiration of becoming
Employer of Choice.
ER due diligence is conducted by HR experts from
Group headquarters to ensure the necessary levels of competence and objectivity. Countries are selected according
to a set of criteria aligned with the divisions. In dialogue
with Group headquarters, members of local management
develop action plans based on due diligence results. Three
ER due diligences were carried out in Asia in the reporting
year. Additional due diligence procedures are planned for
Latin America and Asia in 2017.
We seek to bring our ER due diligence process into
closer alignment with internationally recognized
standards and plan to achieve external certification.

Initiatives within Europe ✔ PwC

Together with our social partners, we participate in an
array of initiatives and activities at the European level.
The Deutsche Post DHL Forum, a European works
council by agreement comprising employee representatives and management representatives from 30 European
countries, and its committees address key issues and how
they impact the Group’s business growth. Digital transformation will be a topic addressed by the Deutsche Post DHL
Forum in 2017.
Following scheduled elections, the Deutsche Post DHL
Forum met on November 24, 2016 for its constituent meet­
ing for the next four years. Over the course of the meeting,
the Forum members were instructed both in the duties

40

of the Deutsche Post DHL Forum and in their associated
rights and obligations. The Forum and its subcommittees
met a total of 27 times in the reporting year. The
Global Union Federations UNI and the European Transport Work­
ers’ Federation are each entitled to send a
represen­tative to participate in the Deutsche Post DHL
Forum plenary sessions.
Partners of the European Social Dialogue Committee
for the Postal Sector conducted a joint project in Brussels
on the subject of “Mobilising social partners in a new context”. The project focused on two specific issues: a seminar
on E-Commerce & New Services and the study on collective bargaining agreements in the changing postal sector
(CLA Study). In the course of the reporting year, and
build­ing on the previous “E-Commerce & New Services”
seminar held in November 2015, an innovative Massive
Open Online Course (MOOC) was developed. In May
2016, a conference was held in Bucharest to discuss the
results of the CLA study. An associated Joint Statement
was subsequently issued in December 2016. A final project
report has since been released.
In addition, in 2016 Europe’s biggest postal service provider Deutsche Post DHL Group was appointed the new
Chair of the European Social Dialogue Committee for the
Post Sector.

CREATING HEALTHY WORK ENVIRONMENTS
We take a holistic approach to health management at Deutsche Post DHL Group, meaning that we do more than provide healthy work environments – we also encourage and
help our employees and their families to pursue healthy
lifestyles, avoid risk factors and prevent chronic disease.
We understand that as members of a global logistics company and, by extension, its supply chains, each and every
one of our employees should be protected from epidemics
and other external health risks. For this reason, we system­
atically monitor global health threats and their relevance to
both our people and our operations.

Our Four Pillars of Health – Education & Awareness, Prevention & Screening, Disease & Condition Management
(DMP), Behavioral Change – provide a framework for
managing health holistically. Each pillar addresses a different phase in health promotion – from building aware­
ness, prevention and mitigation, to driving behavioral
change. This model, along with the identification of future
potential trends, helps us design actionable measures that
are tailored to the specific circumstances and needs of our
employees in each country. We do this through our Global
Health & Well-being Program.
Our approach aims to minimize occupational dis­eases
and work-related illnesses and to reduce sickness rates

»
“We regard health as a state of comprehensive physical, mental and social well-being and not merely as the absence
of illness. Health encompasses the capability and the motivation to lead an economically and socially active life. In this
sense, work can be a fundamental source of satisfaction and, accordingly, of health.”

awareness of this responsibility and to strengthen their
commitment to health management. Well aware of our
responsibility for both the physical and mental health of
our employees, our executive education program includes
a web-based training module called “Leadership and Mental Health”. The training, which is available to all managers
across the Group, provides basic knowledge on mental
health, stress, and the correlation between leadership and
health, and provides managers with solutions for streng­
thening their own personal resources and protecting their
employees from harmful stress. It has already been recog­
nized as best practice in managing mental health risks.

Managing our health management activities

While Group divisions are responsible for the local implementation of health management within their organizations, cross-divisional health-related issues are discussed
and agreed centrally by the Board of Management. The
Board of Management is kept informed of and is advised
on these matters by the Chief Medical Officer (CMO), who
is in direct dialogue with key health institutions and organizations. The CMO also provides guidance regarding
potential crisis scenarios, such as epidemics and pandem­
ics. At the same time, the CMO also consults at the local,
operational level, advising the business on new workplace trends, such as new technologies designed to prevent
occupational or work-related disease or make jobs easier
to perform.
The CMO also heads the Group’s ISO 9001 certified
occupational health services in Germany, which includes
a staff of some 90 occupational health physicians nationwide. Our health promotion system in Germany is
managed by the Central Health Working Group, which is
chaired by the Board Member for HR.
Health as a management responsibility

Our managers play an important role in establishing a cul­
ture of health and well-being across the Group. We offer
them training and other targeted measures to sharpen their

Approximately 300,000 of our employees – more than half
of our workforce – work outside of Germany. Many of
these employees live and work in countries that do not offer sufficient social health coverage. Because we believe that
every one of our employees should have access to quality,
affordable healthcare, we have established a Group-wide
Employee Benefits Program that provides insurance coverage to numerous employees and their dependents where
there is a need to supplement social healthcare or where no
statutory health insurance exists. Our ability to maximize
and control funding efficiencies around the provisions of
our insurance program allows our employees and their
families access to affordable healthcare coverage.
Global program, local solutions

Our Global Health & Well-being Program offers a global
strategy with tailored local solutions, meaning that our
health and well-being initiatives and campaigns are specifically designed to address country health concerns. We
do this by systematically monitoring health risk indicators
around the world, which are then used to develop tailored
measures to mitigate the underlying drivers by country.
Based on this data, for example, we have increased the focus of our health initiatives in Mexico on combatting hypertension, which is widespread in the region. By contrast,
in China our measures focus more on respiratory ailments.
Special attention is given to preventing chronic illness­
es that according to the World Health Organization are
the cause of 60-80% of deaths worldwide. The WHO has
also identified mental illness, especially depression, as a
leading cause of disability and a major contributor to the
overall global burden of disease. In response, we have increased our efforts in the area of health management to

risk assessments, instructing employees on potential risks
and hazards in the workplace, implementing prevention
measures to protect workers and others from injury, as well
as regular safety training.

Global IT platform rolled out

Accident rate remains stable ✔ PwC

Central to our Global Health & Well-being Program is the
exchange of best practice initiatives and measures across
the Group. Our new dedicated Health & Well-being platform, which was rolled out in the reporting year, pro­vides
a standardized mechanism for collecting, monitoring
and measuring the impact of the various activities being
undertaken by our entities around the world. The system
is also used to rank measures, which are categorized and
awarded points based on our Four Pillars of Health. Business units can accumulate points across the pillars to qual­
ify for discounts on Group-sponsored insurance coverage,
freeing resources to be used to further benefit our people
and their families locally.
The platform also serves as a go-to reference for information on current health issues and trends, providing access to the most up-to-date articles, studies and research
in the areas of health and well-being. This system enables
HR managers not only to track the progress of their initia­
tives and measures but also to see what is being done to
deliver health and well-being to our employees in other
areas of the Group.

We began publishing comprehensive accident statistics
in 2015. While temporary workers are covered in these
figures, subcontractors are not. Since this time, data is
collected and analyzed centrally and submitted at regular
intervals to the Operations Board for discussion. These
discussions in the reporting year led to an agreement on a
new Group-wide goal – to achieve above industry-average
performance in the area of occupational safety. As part of
this vision, we intend to improve our accident rate (LTIFR)
to 3.8 in 2017.

HIGH STANDARDS IN OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY
✔ PwC

Workplace safety for our employees is a number-one priority at Deutsche Post DHL Group. Our occupational safety
efforts focus on prevention. We systematically assess the
working conditions of our employees for risks and poten­
tial dangers and provide our workforce with the equipment
they need to carry out their jobs safely. We also conduct
classroom-based and online safety training to heighten the
awareness of employees and their managers on the subject
of safety and possible workplace hazards. Additional information in the form of posters and other materials are used
to reinforce a “Safety First” culture within Deutsche Post
DHL Group.
Our Supplier Code of Conduct obligates our suppliers
under contract to adhere to our values and standards as
well. This includes conducting risk analyses and workplace

Our activities and measures in the area of occupational
safety are already making a positive impact on our numbers.
At 4.0 workplace accidents per 200,000 hours worked, the
Group-wide accident rate for 2016 remained unchanged
from the previous year. The working days lost per accident
decreased by 0.8 to 14.8. The diversity of the jobs per­for­
med by our people from across our divisions is reflected
in these figures. Employees from the Post - eCommerce
- Parcel division are at a higher risk of accident or injury
from slips, trips and falls, for example, than employees
who work in the logistics divisions and are not involved in
delivery operations.
Our measures also helped us reduce the number of fatal workplace accidents in 2016 compared to the previous
year. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families
of the four members of our staff who, despite all our efforts
in the reporting year to ensure workplace safety, lost their

accident black spots, develops appropriate prevention
measures, and lays the groundwork for decisions made by
the Operations Board.

Managing occupational safety measures

Each Group division has its own organizational and
management structure dedicated to occupational safety.
Cross-functional topics are discussed by the Operations
Board, a committee made up of division executives under
the leadership of the CEO. The Operations Board is also
responsible for managing and developing occupational
safety KPIs. The Operations Board met five times in the
reporting year to discuss and approve the following measures in the area of occupational safety:

In early 2016, a strategic workshop was conducted to identify major challenges and projects in the area of OHS for
the coming years. Key topics included the transparency
and reliability of OHS data, the definition and comparison
of Group-wide terms, and the drafting of an occupational
safety mission statement for the Group.
We also continued assessing the implementation of the
OHSAS 18001 standard within the Group. OHSAS 18001
provides us with a framework for establishing the policies,
procedures and controls needed to achieve the best possi­ble
workplace health and safety conditions. This also en­sures
alignment to internationally recognized best practice. We
continued to roll out the standard in the reporting year,
with compliance confirmed either through external certification or self-assessment. The external certification rate
depends largely on the specific customer requirements and
business models within our divisions. In 2016, we began
training staff in Germany to undertake the role as on-site
multipliers for the OHSAS 18001 methodology.

International occupational safety week

In our ongoing effort to embed a Safety First culture
across our business, we conducted a week-long aware­
ness-raising campaign from April 27-30, 2016 as part
of the Interna­
tional Labour Organization’s annual
World Day for Safety and Health at Work. The activities, which varied from division to division, drew
attention to workplace hazards and informed employ­ees
on how to eliminate risks.
The Post - eCommerce - Parcel division, for example
focused on seatbelt safety and dogs, two known risk areas
for its delivery staff. Alongside seatbelt inspections and
presentations on seatbelt laws and legal implications of
non-compliance, employees had the chance to climb into a
seatbelt simulator and experience what it is like to “crash”
at low speed. Other employees had the chance to take
part in a training course that taught them how best to deescalate aggressive canine behavior.
With zero accidents as its goal, the Express division held a Safe Driving Rodeo for its couriers in the
US. Express drivers participated in both practical and
written tests to demonstrate defensive driving skills and
their knowledge of the safety rules, which are part of a
five-point ap­proach proven to effectively reduce accidents
on highways and roads.
In Spain, Supply Chain tackled warehouse safety by
hanging giant balloons over sites of previous accidents
or injuries. Designed to keep workplace hazards topof-mind, the balloons are marked with signs indicat­
ing the kind of incident that occurred, for example
“I tripped while stepping over pallets”. Since its launch in
2014, this so-called SLAM (Stop, Look, Assess, Manage)
initiative has helped reduce the number of accidents from
six to zero.

Despite the Group’s high standards and extensive experi­

GUIDELINES AND POLICIES
Our Corporate Health Policy lays out our goals and
action measures for promoting workplace health within
the Group. Our occupational safety requirements are defined in our Occupational Health & Safety Policy Statement. Road safety is also important for a transport and
logistics company like Deutsche Post DHL Group. That is
why we have laid out seven safety rules in our Road Safety
Code.
Health management and occupational safety are integrated into the Group’s quality management system.
Group-wide, we apply OHSAS 18001, the internationally
recognized standard for occupational health and safety.

MELANIE KREIS
MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT FINANCE, HR

Interview with Melanie Kreis
“A holistic approach is the basis for everything I do.”

Europe. We will also continue to rely on innovation, at national and international level. With digitization playing an
increasingly important role, we want to chart a meaningful
course for the Group.

As the Board Member for Finance and HR, what would you say
were the key developments in these departments in the course

The transport sector is in a state of constant flux. Using innova-

of 2016?

tive technologies and expanding the service portfolio calls for
specialist skills, a willingness to learn and the ability to adapt.

I’d say 2016 was a good year for Deutsche Post DHL Group.
Not because of any specific events or results, but be­cause
of the outcome for the year as a whole. Our business
divi­sions continue to benefit not only from our growing
e-commerce business, but from the quality of our services
and from new business wins. The past year was also a good
year thanks to the excellent HR work done in dialogue with
our social partners, both nationally and internationally.
One of the key issues in 2016 involved the development
of new, future-focused leadership attributes for managers
across the Group. Another equally important HR task was
to improve employee engagement. The outcome of our
efforts can be seen in the two percentage point rise in the
results for the respective Employee Opinion Survey KPI.
And as we forged ahead with our Refugee Aid Initiative,
we expanded our program of activities and gave hundreds
of refugees a new perspective, either by offering them an
internship or hiring them into a job.

This increases the need for training and gives rise to new types
of jobs. How does Deutsche Post DHL Group use its training
programs to respond to these growing needs?

The Group has extremely broad-based training offerings
which our employees can access in a variety of ways. In
addition to traditional, job-oriented training, we also offer
online seminars and personal coaching. These are contin­
ually developed and enhanced by our HR experts, who also
adapt them to current needs. Our Group-wide Certified
initiative, which we introduced more than a year ago, is
designed to promote employee engagement and improve
service quality. More than 230,000 employees have completed the program so far.
An adaptable, multinational workforce plays a prominent role
at Deutsche Post DHL Group. People from many different origins, cultures and professions work within a culture of common
values and interests to achieve the company’s strategic goals.

Despite the financial challenges faced, Deutsche Post DHL

Has diversity become a matter of routine?

Group plans to create up to 100,000 new jobs. Which markets
would you say offer the greatest opportunities for growth?

We will continue to exploit the growth seen in our
e-commerce business and grow organically as a result.
I’d say the greatest growth potential lies in Asia and

Yes, it has. In a globally active company like ours, employees from many different countries and cultures work
closely together on complex business processes to meet
high quality demands. It is part of our policy to promote
employee mobility between our functions and regions. In

EMPLOYEES & WORKPLACE – Interview with Melanie Kreis

our parcel and mail centers, which have long been micro­
cosms of our globalized world, colleagues from countries
like Afghanistan, Turkey and Spain testify to the diversity
that runs across Deutsche Post DHL Group. This multinational approach is embedded in our Code of Conduct. We
want to promote a corporate culture built on the principles
of tolerance and respect.
What does “Seeing the Bigger Picture”, the title of this report,
require you to focus on in 2017?

A holistic approach is the basis for everything I do. I’m often asked if my two departments, Finance and Personnel,
are not a contradiction in terms. You have figures and finance on the one hand, and people and soft skills on the
other. But for me, this assumed conflict of interests is simply the wrong approach. The key to sustainable business
management is not to see finance and personnel in oppo­­si­
tion, but as a collective task. To offer quality products and
services, a company must not only retain its employees, it
must motivate them as well. That is the only way to secure
long-term financial success.

VALUES & GUIDELINES
Responsible business practice
As an internationally operating logistics company, our
busi­
ness is subject to a wide range of influences and
impacts, and with them to opportunity and risk. We see
change as an incentive to develop sustainable solutions to
strengthen our business now and in the future.
Our Code of Conduct forms the basis of and sets out
the expectations for the ethically, socially and legally correct behavior of the Group and our staff. Our Supplier
Code of Conduct forms the basis for supplier relations. As
an integral component of our contracts with suppliers, it
places our suppliers under obligation to observe the strategic goals and values of Deutsche Post DHL Group and to
ensure that their own business partners and subcontractors adhere to our standards as well.
The long-term business success of Deutsche Post DHL
Group is built upon responsible business practice. By
making it a central component of our corporate strategy,
we ensure that our business dealings are in line with prevailing law and meet ethical standards and international
guidelines, and we require our suppliers to do the same.
Another important aspect of responsible business practice
is building and maintaining strong relationships with
our stakeholders, who have grown to expect responsible,
values-driven business practices when choosing Deutsche
Post DHL Group as their provider, employer or investment
of choice.
Responsible business practice also means adopting innovative measures and increasing the efficiency of existing
structures. This helps us not only to identify business opportunities at an early stage and effectively mitigate risk,
but to strengthen the reputation of the Group as well. In
this way, we generate and secure business potential, contributing directly to our long-term business success.
Ensuring the stability and robustness of our business
operations and supply chains around the world is of utmost
importance. The Group’s resilience management activities
address many of our material issues and are performed by
the Global Business Services function.

an ongoing dialogue with our stakeholders to ensure their

VALUES & GUIDELINES – Responsible business practice – Our Code of Conduct

Our Code of Conduct

✔ PwC

Our Code of Conduct guides us in our actions as individuals and as a company; it is the foundation for all business
practices within the Group and establishes the expectations for the responsible and ethically, legally and socially
correct behavior of our staff. The Code was developed together with the business divisions to ensure that region­
al requirements are considered and lays down the jointly
approved principles of our corporate culture and business
practices. Our managers serve as role models. We expect
them to lead by example in both behavior and values, foster the corporate culture and the principles of Deutsche
Post DHL Group in everything they do, and communicate
these values to our employees. The Code of Conduct is an
integral component of our employment contracts with our
managers.
The Supplier Code of Conduct is an integral part of our
supplier management system and of the contracts we enter
into with suppliers. It ensures that our values and principles are embedded in our supply chains, and obligates our
suppliers to ensure that their own business partners and
subcontractors adhere to our standards as well.

Guided by the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UN Global
Compact, the International Labour Organization(ILO) Declaration on the Fundament
Principles and Rights at Work from 1998 and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational
Enterprises; 2 The term suppliers also refers to our transportation subcontractors

Our Supplier Code of Conduct is guided by the principles
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and those
of the UN Global Compact, and takes into account widely

recognized legal standards including prevailing anticorruption laws and conventions.
All other Group policies, such as the Anti-Corruption
Policy and regionally applicable policies and guidelines,
are either based on or derived from the Code of Conduct.
Some of these policies are intended exclusively for internal
use. Compliance with the Code of Conduct is monitored
by the Compliance organization. Violations of the Code
can be reported via various channels, including the Compliance Hotline.
Leveraging external expertise ✔ PwC

Against the backdrop of changing political and social demands, we seek the advice of the Sustainability Advisory
Council (SAC) in the implementation and development of
our Code of Conduct. The SAC is an external group of international experts that includes stakeholders from a range
of professions and standpoints. In 2016, the former Integ­
rity Board was merged with the SAC to consolidate the
expertise of both bodies into a single advisory council.
Employee training ✔ PwC

As a multinational enterprise, we have made our Code of
Conduct available in many different language versions.
Via online seminars, which we also use in the induction
processes for new employees, we familiarize our workforce
with the contents of the Code and their application in the
workplace. Training is mandatory for managers – in communicating our principles and values, they serve as role
models and facilitators. Suppliers and employees who have
contact with suppliers are given special Supplier Code of
Conduct training. We also provide training on other
special­ized topics, such as anti-corruption and competi­
tion law.

Opportunity & risk management

✔ PwC

Customers expect their logistics services provider to en­sure
that their goods and shipments reach their destinations
reliably within the agreed period of time. Our comprehensive opportunity and risk management system enables us
to respond to disruptions and unforeseeable events quickly
and effectively. We also use this comprehensive management approach for early detection of business opportunities, thus strengthening our competitive position.

Strategic issue management ✔ PwC

We gain valuable insights through a strategic issues man­
agement process that involves intelligent, real-time monitoring to track relevant topics in more than 20,000 online
media and social media sources. The insights gained flow
into our business and communications strategies and are
also used in planning and managing our corporate responsibility activities.
Solutions for mitigating health risks ✔ PwC

Our Insurance & Risk Management (IRM) organization
develops and deploys high-quality insurance programs
and advises on contract risks, claims management and
operational risks. These offerings include tailored health
insurance packages for countries where social healthcare
coverage is either insufficient or does not exist. We systematically analyze the main drivers of insurance claims
and use this data to develop customized, local health and
well-being programs. To identify areas of focus, our global
health benefits program works closely with local insurance

providers or makes use of the country health risk profiles
published by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Accounting for financial opportunities and risks ✔ PwC

The anticipated impacts of potential incidents, developments and trends are considered in our business planning.
Opportunities and risks are defined as potential deviations
from projected earnings. Our Group-wide opportunity and risk management system helps us achieve these
goals. The first step of the process also records and mea­­
sures CR-related opportunities and risks from areas such
as litigation and personnel.
Each quarter, managers estimate the impact of future
scenarios, evaluate the opportunities and risks for their divisions and departments, and present both planned measures and those already implemented. Queries are made
and approvals are given on a hierarchical basis to ensure
that different managerial levels are involved in the process.
Opportunities and risks can also be reported at any time
on an ad hoc basis.
The early identification and assessment of opportunities and risks follow uniform Group-wide reporting standards. We continuously improve the IT application used
for this purpose. The opportunity and risk report for the
reporting year is part of the Group’s 2016 Annual Report.

VALUES & GUIDELINES – Opportunity & risk management – Supplier management

Supplier management
MANAGEMENT APPROACH & TARGETS ✔ PwC
The Supplier Code of Conduct forms the basis for supplier
relations and is an integral component of our contracts with
suppliers. The Code places our suppliers under obligation
to observe the strategic goals and values of Deutsche Post
DHL Group and to ensure that their own business partners
and subcontractors adhere to our standards as well.
We select our suppliers and transport service providers
by way of a multi-step evaluation system. To improve both
the quality and the objectivity of this process, we also look
at external supplier evaluations and define appropriate
thresholds.
We focus on strengthening existing contractual rela­
tions­
hips with our suppliers. Our aim is to heighten
their awareness of our standards, enabling us to main­tain a
lasting partner­ship with them. The most important informational mate­­r­ial is provided to the suppliers in their own
languages.

We also instruct and inform our employees, taking every
opportunity to sensitize them to the risks that can arise in
the procurement process. We regularly revise our training
offerings and review our procurement policy as part of an
ongoing process to ensure that our employees have access
to the latest information. To ensure that they are familiar
with our expectations for policy-compliant deal­ings regarding corruption and anti-competitive behav­ior, compliance training is mandatory for all our procurement staff.
KPIs & targets ✔ PwC

A rigorous and sustainable supplier management system
also plays a vital role in the business success of Deutsche
Post DHL Group. We have thus defined requirements and
targets for the key areas shown below. We do not disclose
internal management parameters as this is sensitive business information.

CENTRALIZED PROCUREMENT AND SUPPLIER
MANAGEMENT ENSURE HIGHEST STANDARDS ✔ PwC
At the operational level, the Corporate Procurement organization supports the divisions in purchasing high quality
goods and services, reducing spending and making costeffective investments in a way that is both in line with our
Group policies and regardful of environmental and social
aspects. Annual procurement expenses in 2016 amounted
to €10 billion. This includes the costs involved in upgrad­
ing our fleets and sites.
Corporate Procurement is also responsible for centralized supplier management, which starts right at the
beginning of the value creation chain. This ensures that
our standards are applied and adhered to along the entire
supply chain, increases supply security and creates value
through trust-based collaboration and long-term business
relationships with our suppliers. And because we see our
suppliers as more than just transport service providers or
external agents who deliver the goods we need, we also enable them to bring innovative ideas to Deutsche Post DHL
Group.
We support our suppliers with our knowledge and expertise, and we offer them an interactive training module
on our Supplier Code of Conduct and environmental and
social standards. We also give our road freight subcon­
tractors access to our procurement contacts to assist them,
for example, in the procurement of new, more efficient
vehicles.
Procurement platform for greater transparency ✔ PwC

We strive to make our procurement processes more efficient and more transparent. In the reporting year, we integrated additional procurement processes into the existing
purchasing platform and simplified their use. The platform, to which our supplier management system is linked,
enables Group-wide strategic management of procurement processes and supports the company’s standardized
supplier monitoring and evaluation process.
Supplier evaluations include a third-party due dili­
gence screening for suppliers who meet certain risk
criteria contained in our Anti-corruption Policy. By taking
this approach, we ensure that they meet the Group’s supplier selection requirements and support us in reaching our
environmental goals and maintaining our social standards.

Deutsche Post DHL Group – Corporate Responsibility Report 2016

In the “Environment & Solutions” chapter, we report in
detail on the environmental aspects of various procurement activities, including the global procurement of electricity from renewable energy sources.
Raising employee awareness ✔ PwC

Following the successful rollout of our Security and Compliance Awareness Workshop (SCAW) in the reporting
year, we will integrate the workshop into our training offer­
ings for our procurement employees in the coming year.
The workshop will also become part of our Group-wide
Certified initiative training for this target group.
The workshop, which was jointly developed by Corporate Procurement, Corporate Security and Corporate
Compliance, is designed to sensitize procurement staff
to certain risks, such as corruption and anti-competitive
practices, so they can identify and resolve conflicts quickly
and in a policy-compliant way. The workshop and subsequent refresher courses are mandatory for all procurement
staff.
Ensuring ethical supply chain standards ✔ PwC

The Supplier Code of Conduct is an integral part of our
supplier management system and of the contracts we enter into with suppliers. It applies to suppliers as well as to
transportation subcontractors and other services pro­
viders. The Code explicitly calls on suppliers to ensure that
their own business partners and subcontractors adhere to
our standards as well.
We are developing and enhancing our Supplier Code
of Conduct as part of an ongoing process. In the report­
ing year, we revised the Supplier Code of Conduct, honing
its treatment of human rights protection and fair working
conditions. New compliance-related topics were added to
the Code, including trade regulations and the handling of
conflicts of interest. These changes have been integrated
into the interactive training module which our suppliers
can use to familiarize themselves with our standards be­fore
entering into contract negotiations. Suppliers can access
both the training module and our Code of Conduct in the
most frequently used languages.
Tendering process standardized Group-wide ✔ PwC

We select our suppliers and transport service providers
by way of a multi-step tendering process. In addition to

59

VALUES & GUIDELINES – Supplier management

our own evaluation process, we also look at independent,
external supplier reviews. As a result, we work solely with
suppliers with whom we have gained positive experi­ence
in evaluating our own sustainability performance and
whose processes we believe to be credible and trustworthy.
We want to use our findings to further enhance the supplier evaluation process by, for example, taking account
of factors specific to the countries in which our suppliers
operate.
Entering into dialogue with our suppliers ✔ PwC

Some of our suppliers possess competencies that are of
strategic importance for our current or future business.
These include innovators from the fields of green technologies and IT. We confer regularly with these partners,
ex­changing ideas and information about current developments, and collaborate on projects focused on driving
innovation and developing new business models.
Responding to non-compliance ✔ PwC

We trust our suppliers and business partners to comply
with the terms of our contractual agreements, and conduct
compliance tests on a random basis. Suppliers are selected
on the basis of their economic significance and the results
of a risk assessment. To enable informed decisions, key
Group departments such as HR and Compliance are involved in the process.
If a violation of our Supplier Code of Conduct is
suspected, the matter is investigated and if confirmed, the
supplier in question must bindingly commit to address
and remedy noncompliant behavior as quickly as possible.
Follow-up evaluations are conducted. If the supplier fails
to meet our requirements, either in part or in full, further
action is taken; in some cases, this can mean the termina­
tion of a business relationship.

SUBCONTRACTOR MANAGEMENT
For the most part, transport services are procured decentrally by our divisions. The Supplier Code of Conduct is
also used as a binding component of contracts awarded in
decentralized procurement.
We include our subcontractors in our decisions and
activities right from the outset, such as when calculating
carbon emissions. Harmonizing emissions calculation
methodologies worldwide is a key component of our environmental program GoGreen. We thus participate in a
number of related global initiatives, among them Green
Freight Asia, Green Freight Europe and the Global Logis­
tics Emissions Council.
Air and ocean freight

Unlike our express business, in our air freight operations
we have no Group-owned aircraft. We operate solely as
an agent between customer and freight forwarder. When
selecting subcontractors, we consider environmental criteria and take three key factors into account:
n

n
n


Th
e company’s efficiency, which we monitor on a
monthly basis
Transparency in fleet composition

Th
e company’s participation in industry-led initiatives
such as the Airfreight Carbon Initiative and projects
to reduce fuel consumption and noise pollution when
approaching Leipzig/Halle airport, with which we are
pushing the topic of sustainable aviation

To ensure that we can track and verify a subcontractor’s
environmental performance, the outcomes of the above
checks are entered into the Carrier Scorecard, which is
then used in the overall evaluation.
Our entire ocean freight operations are also carried
out by transportation subcontractors. We have no Groupowned container ships. One of our most important tools
in selecting a shipping company is the Green Carrier
Scorecard.
Companies are evaluated based on the following
criteria:
n

 ooperation: The provision of carbon efficiency and
C
environmental performance data via the Clean Cargo
Working Group (CCWG)

60

 ngagement: The company’s participation in industryE
led initiatives and notable involvement in environment­
al projects and initiatives

Each year shipping companies are issued a GoGreen Carrier Certificate that summarizes the results of the evaluation.
Road freight

In our road freight operations, subcontractor management poses a far greater challenge than with air and ocean
freight. This is largely due to the fact that the supplier market is much more fragmented. In the reporting year, the
road freight market in Europe amassed sales of some €193
billion. With a market share of 2.2%, Deutsche Post DHL
Group is the second largest provider in the road freight
sector.
To improve subcontractors’ greenhouse gas emission
efficiency, we have joined a number of industry-led initiatives whose work focuses on determining the environment­al
performance of road freight companies and developing a
standardized method for calculating the emissions of road
freight operations. We are also able to influence the efficiency of our road transport subcontractors by support­
ing them in their efforts to improve their efficiency and,
among other things, by giving them access to our procurement contacts to assist them in the purchase of new, more
efficient vehicles.

61

VALUES & GUIDELINES – Supplier management – Compliance

Compliance

✔ PwC

MANAGEMENT APPROACH & TARGETS ✔ PwC
Ethically and legally correct conduct – which we believe
includes preventing corruption and anti-competitive
practice – is the principle which guides how we treat one
another within the Group. It also governs how we deal
with our business partners, investors and the public sector. Compliant behavior plays a key role in ensuring lasting
success at Deutsche Post DHL Group.
As a globally active logistics provider, we operate in
countries with very different political systems, laws, and
cultural values. We thus observe prevailing national laws
and regulations. These include:
n

n

I nternationally accepted anti-corruption standards
and principles, such as those laid down in the UN
Global Compact
 pplicable anti-corruption and bribery laws, such as
A
the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the
UK Bribery Act

We also adhere to the principles laid down in the World
Economic Forum’s Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI).
In addition to our corporate Code of Conduct, our
Anti-Corruption and Business Ethics Policy helps us to
avoid situations which could call the integrity of our conduct toward our customers, suppliers, authorities and
other important third-parties into question. With our Supplier Code of Conduct, we expect our business partners to
adhere to these same high standards and values. The Supplier Code of Conduct is an integral part of all contracts we
enter into with suppliers. In order to detect compliancerelated risks at an early stage and identify their causes, we
conduct regular risk assessments in all our business divi­
sions and regions.
Our managers serve as role models. We expect them to
lead by example in both behavior and values, foster both
the corporate culture and the principles of Deutsche Post
DHL Group in everything they do, and communicate these
values to our business partners. Through targeted communication and regular training, we help our employees and
business partners to both understand and adhere to our
compliance policy and rules. We also encourage our employees to be alert to compliance violations and to report

them through various internal channels, including our
dedicated Compliance Hotline. Compliance is thus an
integral part of our corporate culture and is lived out at all
levels of the Group.
KPIs & targets ✔ PwC

We see compliance as a prerequisite for business success
worldwide. This perception is shared by our various stake­
holder groups. Thus, as a material issue, compliance is
managed according to predefined indicators. As this information involves sensitive data, we do not disclose this data
externally.

GOVERNANCE & RISK ASSESSMENT ✔ PwC
A comprehensive compliance management system with
clear lines of responsibility and reporting structures as
well as effective monitoring mechanisms provides us with
the necessary framework to ensure adherence to both our
Group-wide Code of Conduct and the rules laid down in
our various other policies.
Responsibility and reporting ✔ PwC

Compliance is a management responsibility and is thus
overseen by all management bodies within the Group.
Responsibility for designing the compliance management
system lies with the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO), who
reports directly to the Chief Financial Officer. The CCO
is assisted by the Global Compliance Office, which establishes Group-wide standards for compliance management
and supports the corresponding activities of the divisions.
Each of the four operating divisions has a Compli­ance
Officer who can draw on additional local resources and
regularly presents a report to the divisional Board of Man­
agement. The activities and the content of the reports drawn up by both the divisional Compliance Officers and the
Global Compliance Office are incorporated into the quarterly update reports to the Board of Management as well as
the annual report to the Finance and Audit Committee of
the Supervisory Board.
In addition to the measures conducted by the compliance organization, Corporate Audit includes compliancerelated issues in its independent, objective audits commissioned by the Management Board.

Deutsche Post DHL Group – Corporate Responsibility Report 2016

The focus of these audits lies in analysis and evaluation of
the efficiency and effectiveness of the Group’s internal monitoring system, its risk management system, and its organizational security measures and controls in the divisions
and corporate departments.
Compliance Management System ✔ PwC

Our Compliance Management System (CMS) uses a
seven-component approach to ensure adherence to our
compliance policy, rules and principles.
One of the most important functions of our compli­ance
management system is the prevention and early detection
of potential compliance risks. Analysis of the company’s
current risk profile is thus of fundamental importance in
adjusting and improving the system. The findings of these
analyses are used within the compliance program to establish suitable measures to prevent violations of compliance
policy and rules.
Key components of the compliance program include:

Instilling a compliance culture ✔ PwC

To improve the compliance culture and increase awareness
for potential compliance violations, we have made regular compliance training for managers and employees a key
component of our compliance management system. Compliance training is mandatory for managers and for certain
employee groups. Training content is regularly revised to
ensure that it serves current needs.
Compliance violations: Reporting and confidentiality ✔ PwC

Employees can report potential compliance violations
through a special 24-hour web application or by calling
our Compliance Hotline, which is available in 150 countries and in 30 different languages. Compliance violations
can be reported anonymously (where legally permitted) or
by providing contact information. Reported compliance
violations are handled professionally and confidentially.
Internal media are used to ensure that employees know
about the reporting systems available to them as well as
whom to contact within the local compliance organization.
Information regarding relevant violations form part of the
reports to the Board of Management and the Supervisory
Board’s Finance and Audit Committee.
Independent monitoring through Corporate Audit ✔ PwC

The subject of compliance is a fundamental part of the
audits which Corporate Audit performs in all business
divisions and departments. Corporate Audit also inspects
the management processes within the compliance organization on a routine basis. The results of these inspections
are documented and reported regularly to the Board of
Man­agement together with recommendations for improve­
ment. In 2016, recommendations included revising the
Group’s competition policy and reviewing the compliance
training program.
In the reporting year, some 246 regular audits which
were either directly or indirectly related to compliance
were conducted across the Group. A
number of ad hoc audits were also performed for specific reasons. The audits
regular audits
supplement the Group-wide moni­
toring system and support ongoing
compliance activities as well as the identification of compliance risks. They provide the basis for ongoing enhancement of our Group-wide compliance program.
The findings of the various audits also result in a
review of existing monitoring and control criteria for their
currentness and completeness. Thus, in this reporting year,
we have updated and added further compliance aspects to

TRANSPARENCY IN PURSUING COMPANY
INTERESTS ✔ PwC
We build trust through openness and transparency in our
dealings with the public sector. We maintain correct and
lawful relations with all governmental and supervisory authorities, operating at all times in a straightforward, transparent manner and in accordance with applicable laws and
regulations. Our Group-wide Anti-corruption and Business Ethics Policy lays down the rules on how we deal with

donations and gifts to political parties and governmental
institutions. This policy thus applies for all regions and
countries in which Deutsche Post DHL Group operates.
We are aware that the idea of transparency can be interpreted differently in countries around the world. Wherever a transparency register exists, such as in the EU, we
report voluntarily on the type, scope and financing of the
activities we conduct in pursuing our company interests.
This does not, however, prevent our employees from acting
within applicable law, such as that in the US, to organize
and manage so-called political actions committees (PACs),
and pay contributions on a personal, voluntary basis.

“Employees are not authorized to make contributions to political parties and their affiliated organizations, to
governmental authorities or to any other public institution on behalf of the Group. Such contributions include financial
donations and other gifts of monetary value.”

Data protection & security

Deutsche Post DHL Group – Corporate Responsibility Report 2016

✔ PwC

MANAGEMENT APPROACH & TARGETS ✔ PwC
At Deutsche Post DHL Group, data are some of our most
sensitive and valuable assets. How we use technology both
to protect our data and ensure the integrity and availability
of our IT systems is outlined in the “Data security” section.
Group-wide implementation of our standards to safeguard
personal data is covered in the “Data protection” section.
For a multinational company, the international flow
of data poses a particular challenge, especially when it
comes to protecting personal data. Given the many countries in which we operate, we must observe what can often
be very different data protection rules and regulations. In
our growth market e-commerce as well as in international
logistics, customers place great value on data protection
compliance.
We have thus adopted our own standards which are
laid down in our Data Privacy Policy and apply through­
out the Group. In countries where there are no prevailing
data protection rules or regulations, our policy serves as
the basis for setting the binding minimum standard for
protecting data. With the support of legal counsel, we ensure that we comply with our own Data Privacy Policy as
well as with prevailing national data protection rules or
regulations.
With high security standards and a comprehensive IT
security management approach, we protect business and
personal data against unauthorized access, transmission or
manipulation. We also ensure that our systems can operate
in the event of failure or disruption.

DATA SECURITY ✔ PwC
Our work and business processes are largely based on IT
solutions. The security of our information systems is thus
a top priority, because we know that inadequately protected data harbors the risk of growing vulnerability and economic harm. We aim to provide reliable systems for the
Group and for our partners at all times in order to ensure
that we can all continue to operate undisturbed.
When securing our IT systems, we focus on the three
underlying principles of information security:
n

n

n

To ensure that our IT systems are secure, the Information
Security Committee, a sub-committee of the IT Board, has
defined guidelines and procedures based on ISO 27002. In
addition, Group Risk Management, IT Audit, Data protection and Corporate Security monitor and assess IT risk on
an ongoing basis.
Examples of security measures:
n

n

KPIs & targets ✔ PwC

High data protection standards are integral to the Deutsche Post DHL Group brand, and IT security is of critical
importance to our business operations. Our stakeholder
groups see both of these issues as major factors of our
business success. Given the sensitive nature of our data protection indicators, we do not disclose this data externally.

 onfidentiality: business and personal data are pro­
C
tected against unauthorized access.
I ntegrity: when data are processed electronically,
business and personal data can neither be changed
(either by unauthorized persons or unintentionally)
nor falsified.
 vailability: IT systems are available in accordance
A
with agreed specifications.

n

 mployees are granted access to our systems and data

only to the extent to which it is required to perform
specific tasks.
I T systems and data are backed up on a regular basis,
and critical data are replicated in the data centers.
 o ensure that our IT systems are constantly available,

we design them to protect against complete system fail­
ures and operate data centers at different geographical
locations around the world. All of our software is updated regularly to address bugs and close potential gaps
in security.

VALUES & GUIDELINES – Data protection & security

DATA PROTECTION ✔ PwC
Many people use digital products and services, and trust
that their data will be secure. As a globally active company
whose business model is based on connecting people and
exchanging sensitive data, we believe we have a special responsibility in this regard. In our Data Privacy Policy, we
have laid down standards which we apply Group wide. We
also use those standards as a guideline in countries where
no data protection rules or regulations exist. Through the
further development of our standards and with training for
employees and managers, we ensure that we comply with
prevailing data protection law. Combined with an effective
data protection management system, high data protection
standards are effective in securing customer, employee and
investor loyalty.
Our data protection management system includes
web-based training on a variety of data protection issues
to sensitize our managers and employees to the importance of data protection and to ensure compliance with our
Data Privacy Policy. With online seminars on a range of
data protection issues, such as secure handling of personal
and customer data, existing knowledge is deepened. In
addi­tion, employees received training on the new requirements under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation

issued in 2016. Data Privacy Policy training is mandatory
for our managers, and we also intend to include a training
module on data protection in the Group-wide Certified
initiative.
Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) was also a central
focus of our data protection management system in the reporting year. More than 300 of these assessments were carried out in accordance with national laws and regulations
for global IT applications in 2016.
Data Privacy Policy implementation confirmed ✔ PwC

Our corporate Data Privacy Policy lays out uniform,
appropriate and globally applicable data privacy and protection standards for safeguarding personal data. We also
have other data protection rules in place which, based on
our corporate Data Privacy Policy, focus on specific areas
such as the processing of personal data, direct marketing
and e-commerce activities.
The implementation of our Data Privacy Policy is sub­ject to regular external third-party review. Evaluations per­formed by Corporate Audit in the reporting year yielded
recommendations concerning data management practices
outside Germany, such as the expansion of auditing activi­
ties. We will therefore develop an international audit plan
for 2017 based on our existing auditing process.

Security management

Deutsche Post DHL Group – Corporate Responsibility Report 2016

✔ PwC

For a globally operating logistics company like Deutsche
Post DHL Group, success hinges on a stable and secure
business environment as well as on security within its
various modes of transport, be it by air, road or sea. Globally integrated supply chains are exposed to any number of
risks and are often the target of criminal activity, including
organized crime, terrorism, piracy and internet crime.
In our efforts to protect our employees and sites, and
to secure business continuity, including supply chain oper­
ations, Deutsche Post DHL Group operates a comprehensive risk-based security management system. Continuous
monitoring and improvement of our security measures
make for efficient and effective processes, enabling us to
make our global supply chains more resilient to a wide
range of criminal activities and increase the level of trust
that customers and employees place in our products and
services. In this way, we improve our performance as
provider of choice, thus contributing significantly to the
corporate strategy and the business success of Deutsche
Post DHL Group.
We identify potential security risks for the Group
worldwide, analyze them with regard to their potential
impact and, after careful evaluation, take appropriate steps
to mitigate them. We also inform our suppliers of securityrelated issues to safeguard their supply chains against potential risk. Our security management system is embedded
in the Group’s comprehensive management approach and
is compliant with legal and regulatory provisions as well as
international standards. Our team of security analysts at
the Global Security Situation Center (GSSC) identifies and
assesses strategically relevant risks and trends worldwide,
and uses specially defined security indicators to analyze
potential threats. The GSSC Trend Reports are regularly
submitted to Group management for further discussion.

Sensitizing employees to security-related risk ✔ PwC

With special training programs, we ensure that our em­
ploy­­ees are aware of the security risks involved in their area
of work and are able to respond in an appropriate way. For
example, we instruct them on the applicable standards for
their place of work and on the Group’s compliance policy
with regard to corruption and anti-competitive practice.
We intend to integrate relevant training modules into our
Group-wide Certified program. Our security policies expressly include the protection of personal rights and adherence to legal requirements. This promotes a security
culture which is both accepted throughout the Group and
complies with prevailing law.

GLOBAL IT PLATFORM ✔ PwC
Our global IT security platform – Resilience360 – has
proven to be an efficient security management tool which
we also make available to our customers. The particular
strength of our Resilience360 platform lies in the fact that
it provides visibility regarding our global supply chain
routes and links up the sites involved, allowing information on security-related incidents from both internal
and external sources to be processed in near real time.
Where security-related disruptions occur, the tool serves
as a communication platform, allowing us to contact and
share information with the respective parties along the

VALUES & GUIDELINES – Security management

entire supply chain. This gives customers a competitive advantage in that they can also use Resilience360 to monitor
their own supply chains and make them more secure.
Customers can integrate Resilience360 into their own
supply chains because we can adapt the platform to meet
their specifications.
Broad-based exchange ✔ PwC

Deutsche Post DHL Group also maintains close and collab­
orative dialogue with security authorities and represents
the Group’s interests in national and international bodies
and institutions that deal with security issues. We use our
vast experience to help develop security policy solutions.
By implementing Group-wide crime prevention measures
and investigating security-related incidents, we safeguard
our employees, the assets entrusted to us by our customers,
as well as the Group’s tangible and intangible assets.

JOHN GILBERT
MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT SUPPLY CHAIN

Interview with John Gilbert
“People love working for an innovative company.”
Mr. Gilbert, change is a constant in the logistics business. The
Supply Chain division has tested many innovations, such as
augmented reality, robots and IoT solutions. What’s going to
make its mark in the coming years?

I think all of them are going to have an impact. Advances
are being made every day. Augmented reality, for exam­
ple, seems to only make headlines when it’s about gaming,
but the technology harbors a lot of potential for logistics.
Right now we’re using it for order picking in some of our
warehouses and our staff is really impressed – it significantly reduces errors, increases productivity and makes
onboarding new employees much faster and easier. They
wear smart glasses equipped with software customized
for the picking process. All the information they need is
displayed on the tiny screen inside the glasses – they see
the next shelf, the amount of product needed and where it
should go. It’s hands-free and reduces the time and energy
needed to fulfill an order. The technology is very promising
– for other applications as well.
The same applies to robotics. Robots are becoming
more and more autonomous and intelligent, which means
they are now better able to handle specific tasks within our
logistics operations. Although the initial capital investment
is still relatively high, we’ve been testing a variety of collab­
orative robots in our warehouses and we think it’s worth
it. Two of them – “Baxter” and “Sawyer” – can do things
like wrap or assemble products. “Effi-BOT” is another collaborative robot we are testing – an automated cart specifically designed for multi-order picking. It follows the picker

around the warehouse, who loads it up and sends it to a
drop-off location. After the cart is unloaded, it automatically rolls to the next picker who needs one. Warehouse
work is demanding – this system reduces the physical burden on our employees since they no longer have to carry
heavy loads, push heavy carts and put unnecessary mileage
on their feet. So the added efficiency of automation also
means improved working conditions, something we are
always striving for.
3D printing is another promising technology that will
see its importance grow in the near future. DHL has been
testing a variety of 3D printers and techniques for sever­
al years and we certainly see potential for it to redefine
manufacturing and supply chain strategies. But it won’t
replace mass production. Instead, it will complement it by
simplifying the production of highly complex and custom­
izable products and spare parts. This will bring manufacturing and logistics closer together than ever before. A
“spare parts on demand” model cuts inventory costs and
“product postponement services” increase customization
while reducing lead times to the customer. This divides
manufacturing and assembly into different stages and final
production could be completed by 3D printers locally or
in the region. Whatever road manufacturers choose to go
down, they’ll need to completely rethink their supply chain
strategies.
Data will also play a key role in the future of warehousing
and logistics. We’ll be able to plan better through intelligent prediction and route optimization based on advanced
algorithms, artificial intelligence and software robots. And
I expect these tools will open doors to new and disruptive
logistics innovations in the future.
Overall, I think businesses will need technologies like
these to be sustainable – ones that increase efficiency and

Deutsche Post DHL Group aspires to be the benchmark for re­
sponsible business by 2020. One of the most important aspects

Making sure your people are on board is just as important
as investing in research and development. I think we all
agree it is crucial to develop new solutions that improve
working conditions, and it’s a thrill to see these technol­
ogies in action. But involving our staff at an early stage is
also crucial for acceptance and ultimately success. That’s
why we keep them and our social partners up to date, ask­
ing them to participate in the development and to test the
outcome. Our vision picking and collaborative robot pilots
are two examples. Both were well accepted and we received
very positive and detailed feedback. People love working
for an innovative company, but you’ll only be able to put
theory into practice if you involve everyone in the process.
The traditional portfolio of contract logistics services such as
planning, sourcing and supplier management now includes
packaging, repairs, returns and recycling. How have increas­
ingly eco-minded customers impacted the development of
these services? How do you plan to expand them?

Customers are certainly more environmentally conscious,
which has sped up the development of related services in
the industry. The Group’s GoGreen program put sustainability at the center of our customer solutions a long time
ago, and we’ve never stopped evolving, adapting and expanding them, not to mention adding new and innovative
solutions to our portfolio.
We offer a full range of eco-friendly logistics solutions
to reduce our customers’ impact on the environment. Our
portfolio of Envirosolutions covers waste management,
extended producer responsibility as well as consulting services and support as a lead environmental partner. Our
tailored, end-to-end waste management solutions help
reduce, recycle and re-use waste to help companies reach
zero landfill objectives. Our solution to convert waste into
energy at Gatwick Airport is the first of its kind in the
world. Producer responsibility is all about helping local
governments, charities and businesses with the issue of
compliance, regardless of the geography or product. We
put our extensive business, product and legal knowledge

of this is building the resilience of global supply chains as risks
continue to grow. What is your division doing to ensure supply
and value chain security?

Supply chains today are more global and complex than
ever before, which makes risk assessment and management more and more important. This complexity and current threats such as terrorism, piracy or political instability
make transparency crucial. That’s why we use our global
risk management platform Resilience360 to monitor incidents, generate a risk assessment and support preparation
for and prevention of any adverse effects. It allows us to intervene quickly and minimize any impact on our custom­
er’s value chain. We also launched the Resilience360
Transparency Portal this year. In certain industries – such
as food or textile – some companies still struggle to identify and visualize their entire supply chain, especially when
it involves multiple layers of suppliers and sub-suppliers.
The online tool allows customers to easily assess those lev­
els and ensure compliance is fully met along every link in
the value chain.
“Seeing the bigger picture” is the tagline of this year’s Corporate Responsibility Report. How does that apply to your own
responsibilities and goals for Supply Chain in 2017?

Seeing the bigger picture is definitely a part of Supply
Chain’s strategy in 2017 and beyond. Our business strat­
egy is based on the Group’s Strategy 2020, which was introduced in 2014 and rests on the three pillars of Focus,
Connect and Grow. Basically, we want to focus on driving
global standardization in order to improve our operations,
better connect our organization across the globe to make
it more effective, and grow in sectors and markets we consider promising to tap into opportunities and achieve sustainable growth. The Life Sciences and Healthcare sector
and building up our capabilities in the Asia Pacific region
are some examples of where we’d like to grow. You certainly
have to see the big picture to do all that. Our course is set
and we’re already reaping the rewards.

SOCIETY & ENGAGEMENT
Management approach & targets
Corporate citizenship at Deutsche Post DHL Group is
about giving back to the communities in which we live,
work and conduct business. This is an integral part of our
corporate responsibility strategy. As the world’s leading
transport and logistics company, we want to leverage our
core competencies and the know-how of our employees in
a way that makes a positive contribution to society and the
environment. We collaborate closely with established partner organizations to ensure the maximum positive impact
of our programs and activities. In the area of corporate
citizenship such activities focus primarily on:
n

S upporting local environmental and community service projects initiated by our employees, and

n

 romoting workplace integration and language acquiP
sition for refugees in Germany.

Our corporate citizenship activities are systematically captured and measured according to the globally recognized
LBG model. The percentage of long-term strategic involve­
ment, i.e. investments in local communities, increased to
62%. The percentage of charitable contributions reached
12% and the percentage of commercial initiatives was
roughly 26%. These developments reflect our strategy of
investing primarily in long-term local community projects.
Corporate citizenship is one of the key drivers of employee engagement across the Group. All of our corporate
citizenship programs, along with our refugee aid activities,
are highly regarded by both employees and external stakeholders. We were recognized for our corporate citizenship
activities several times over the course of 2016.
In the reporting year we laid out our approach to corporate citizenship in a new Group-wide guideline, which
was also published on our corporate website.
We have defined the following requirements and focus

DISASTER PREPAREDNESS: GET AIRPORTS READY
FOR DISASTER
We developed the Get Airports Ready for Disaster (GARD)
program based on our longstanding experience in disaster management. In cooperation with the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP), GARD helps prepare
personnel at airports and relevant organizations such as
airlines, aid organizations, disaster management authorities and other local authorities for the logistical challenges
associated with disaster relief efforts. In this way, GARD
helps improve and professionalize the processing of large
volumes of relief supplies and passengers.
The GARD program consists of multi-day workshops
in which participants evaluate airport capacity, conduct
risk assessments and develop individualized emergency response plans under the guidance of our air freight experts.
The follow-up module “GARD plus” includes a test run of
recommended measures six to twelve months after the initial GARD training. This ensures that emergency response
plans remain up-to-date and can be deployed immediately.
GARD trainers and GARD materials are provided by
Deutsche Post DHL Group free of charge. UNDP is responsible for project implementation as well as coordination with the government agencies. It also handles organization of the GARD workshops and covers logistics costs.
Funding from Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic
Cooperation and Development (BMZ) helps support the
work of the UNDP.
So far GARD workshops have been conducted at 38
airports in disaster-prone regions in Armenia, Bangladesh,
the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, India, Indonesia,
Jordan, Lebanon, Mauritius, Macedonia, Nepal, Panama,
Peru, the Philippines, the Seychelles, Sri Lanka and Turkey. Five of these workshops took place in 2016: in India,
Indonesia, Jordan, Mauritius and the Seychelles. In all,
more than 800 participants received training in disaster
management.

Improving educational opportunity and
employability – GoTeach

In cooperation with the United Nations Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), we have
established a network of over 400 trained DHL employees
who serve in our Disaster Response Teams (DRT) on a
volunteer basis. We have three regional DRTs located in
Dubai (for deployment in the Middle East and Africa),
Panama (Americas) and Singapore (Asia Pacific). When
called upon by the UN, DRTs can be deployed to disaster
areas within a maximum of 72 hours and provide free and
immediate logistics support at main relief airports. DRT
volunteers lend their logistics expertise to coordi­nating
incoming relief supplies, preparing goods for further
transport and ensuring delivery to the responsible relief
organizations.
Since the launch of the partnership with UNOCHA,
DRTs have been deployed over 39 times around the world
– most recently to Haiti in the wake of Hurricane Matthew
in October, after the severe earthquake in Ecuador in April
and after Cyclone Winston struck Fiji in February 2016.
We provide regular follow-up training to make sure
our DRT volunteers are prepared for the extraordinary demands of such deployments. In 2016 over 100 employees
took part in these training events, and in 2017, we plan
to conduct at least one training in each of the three DRT
deployment regions.

With our Group-wide GoTeach program we improve
educational opportunity and employability for young people, especially those from disadvantaged socio-economic
backgrounds. We have good reasons for doing this. As
one of the world’s largest employers, we rely on access to
highly qualified employees around the world. Education
is fundamental to Deutsche Post DHL Group’s innovative
capacity and productivity. It is the basis for greater sta­bility
and prosperity – for individuals, for markets and for societies as a whole. GoTeach supports one of our primary
goals as a company: to become Employer of Choice. At
the same time, it helps build and maintain a stable market
environment.
For all of our GoTeach activities, our employees
share not only their time but their own individual skills
and experiences. Our strategic, global partners are SOS
Children’s Villages and the educational network Teach For

In 2016 the United Nations requested that we take on an
additional role in the area of disaster relief. DHL volunteers who are not members of a DRT will provide support
to the UN’s Reception and Departure Desk which man­
ages in­coming relief workers at airports. The job of our
volunteers will be to supply incoming relief workers with
the information they need most so that they can exit the
terminal and reach their deployment sites as quickly as
possible. We have developed a training concept for this
new role and have already used it to train the first group
of DHL employees in Asia.

PARTNERSHIP WITH SOS CHILDREN’S VILLAGES
Deutsche Post DHL Group’s global collaboration with
SOS Children’s Villages dates back to 2010 and today
includes partnerships in 26 countries. The main focus of
the Group’s involvement is to provide support to young
people between the ages of 15 and 25 as they make the
transition to working life. Along with financial support
for educational programs and youth facilities, our activities focus on career guidance, teaching basic professional
skills, providing young peo­ple with their first exposure
to the work environment, and supporting them in their
own start-up ventures. The goal is to enhance their employability and increase their chances of becoming independent, self-supporting young adults. In 2016, more than
1,000 employees devoted over 22,000 hours of their time to
our partnership with SOS Children’s Villages. Some 2,000
young people received assistance, over 44 completed internships within the Group, and at least 28 were offered
employment contracts.
In the reporting year, we worked together with SOS
Children’s Villages on a system that allows us to share experiences gained from the partnership with all country-level
SOS Children’s Villages organizations around the world.

SOCIETY & ENGAGEMENT – Disaster management – Educational opportunity and employability

The goal here is to enable SOS Children’s Villages to work
with other companies around the world, i.e. independently
from Deutsche Post DHL Group, on additional programs
that support young people in their transition from school
to working life.

PARTNERSHIP WITH TEACH FOR ALL
Teach For All is a global network whose mission is to
improve educational opportunity around the world.
Deutsche Post DHL Group has partnered with Teach For
All in pursuit of a common goal: to give all children and
youths access to an excellent education, regardless of their
socio-economic backgrounds. In the reporting year the
partnership was extended an additional three years.
The worldwide Teach For All network consists of 40 independent, locally managed and financed partner organ­
izations working to improve educational opportunity in
their respective countries. The partner organizations’ core
focus is to recruit and train exceptional university graduates to take on two-year assignments as teachers in highneed schools. In doing so, they not only support children
and young people in their academic development, but
often inspire teachers participating in the program to remain active advocates of educational opportunity in their
local communities. Since the founding of Teach For All in
2007, the network has already deployed over 75,000
teachers in schools around the world and reached over
nine million school-aged children. After completing
their teaching assignment, some 60% of the nearly 50,000
alumni continue their work on behalf of educational
opportunity – both inside and outside the classroom.
As part of the partnership, Deutsche Post DHL Group
supports the global organization Teach For All as well as
ten national-level partner organizations within the Teach
For All network. In November 2016 the first Teach For All
regional conference was held in Latin America, providing
partner organizations and DHL employees in Argentina,
Chile, Ecuador and Peru with an excellent platform for
dialogue and exchange.
The Group supports the Teach For All network finan­
cially and through the involvement of our employees.
In 2016 more than 2,300 employees contributed their
ex­
perience and professional know-how to over 169
partner­ship activities. The funding provided by Deutsche
Post DHL Group to Teach For All is designed to support

75

the further expansion of the Teach For All network
globally, and to support the selected partner organizations
in their work on the local level. Since 2009, Deutsche Post
DHL Group has been the main sponsor of the Teach First
Deutschland initiative, with which we also collaborate on
refugee aid.

SOCIETY & ENGAGEMENT – Refugee aid

Integrating refugees into the jobs market

Manpower support for government authorities

In the reporting year Deutsche Post DHL Group
offered internships to 457 refugees. A total of 292 refugees –
including individuals from Eritrea, Rwanda, Syria and
Togo – received employment contracts from us over the
course of the reporting year; 134 of these were offered
after successfully completing an internship with us.
Eighteen refugees began apprenticeships with us after
completing an internship or other entry-level qualification.
The Group remains committed to its work in the area
of refugee aid. With targeted measures to promote language learning it helps refugees build a foundation for the
transition to working life and successful integration into
society. The Group will also continue providing financial
support for refugee aid.

In the reporting year 199 of our employees volunteered
to support the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees
(BAMF) in their efforts to organize volunteer activities and
establish a pool of potential volunteers.

Infrastructure for employee engagement

In the reporting year we established infrastructure to
further facilitate employee engagement on behalf of refugees. As part of this, a nationwide network of 100 volunteer
coordinators was mobilized to facilitate the efforts between
employees, aid organizations, government authorities/
agencies, and local communities. We also used our internal communications channels to establish platforms for
dia­­logue and exchange among active employee volunteers.
Employees have responded positively to our refugee aid
initiative. Around 15,000 employees participated in more
than 1,000 different activities, including donation drives,
language learning, recreational activities or support­
ing
refugees in dealings with the authorities. We provided
additional support to our employee volunteers by conduct­
ing informational events for integration guides and read­
ing/language “buddies”, who also received special reading
materials.

Space for refugee housing

In the reporting year there was a significant decrease in
the demand for space for refugee housing. Of the roughly
100,000 square meters of property made available by the
Group for refugee aid/housing, some 26,000 square meters
– including properties in Euskirchen, Stuttgart, Hamburg,
Bonn, Oschatz and Elmshorn – were used for this purpose.

Employee community involvement
Deutsche Post DHL Group expressly supports community
involvement on the part of employees, which is re­garded as
a fundamental principle of our corporate culture. Though
their volunteer work, employees come into contact with
worlds beyond their own, broaden their horizons and
improve social competencies – all of which translates into
greater engagement and motivation in the workplace.

diversity of projects supported. As in 2015, we once again
used the LBG model for measuring GVD participation
levels in 2016.

FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR EMPLOYEE PROJECTS

Since its inception in 2011, Global Volunteer Day
(GVD) has become a major component and driver of employee volunteer work across the Group. GVD provides a
platform for employees to realize community projects in
close collaboration with independent local organizations
and charities. Volunteer work in the context of GVD is not
limited to a single day or single project, but is designed to
promote lasting ties between our employees and the many
local non-profits and charities in which they are involved.
As part of our Group-wide “Certified” initiative, executives
and managers are also made aware of the important part
they play in supporting GVD activities.
In the reporting year once again more than 100,000
employees got involved in charitable projects in their communities as part of GVD, with some 76,000 of these employees actively participating in projects. In all, employee
volunteers gave approximately 365,000 hours of their time
to over 2,490 projects around the world, which means a

We also use our Living Responsibility Fund to provide
financial support to outstanding volunteer projects in­
volving our employees. Drawing from Group funds, we
provide grants to a diverse range of partner organizations
and their local projects around the world each year. In
order to qualify for financial support, at least two Group
employees must volunteer a total of more than 50 hours
of their time to the given partner organization over the
course of one year. Projects in which employees invest
more than 400 hours are eligible to receive a maximum of
€4,000. The exact amount of funding awarded is based on
the total number of volunteer hours over the course of the
application year. Our goal is to support employees who demonstrate lasting commitment to social or environmental
causes and serve as models for their fellow colleagues.
The LR Fund jury, which selects projects to receive
funding, includes representation from all Group board
departments. In 2016 funding was awarded to 114 employee projects in 38 different countries. More than 5,500
em­ployees volunteered approx. 50,000 hours of their time
to these projects – the equivalent of over 6,200 eight-hour
work days. In the reporting year the LR Fund provided a
total of €220,000 in financial support.

on employee engagement. How do you motivate employees to
which you are particularly proud?

In the past year Deutsche Post has been actively involved in
refugee aid activities in Germany and received, among other
accolades, the German CSR Award. The Group intends to
continue efforts to promote integration and offer voca­tional
support for refugees. What will you be focusing on in the
coming year?

All of our social engagement projects are of a long-term
nature. We want to achieve lasting results and that naturally applies to refugee aid. That is why we will continue to
focus on language acquisition and vocational preparation
– the two areas we felt were of particular importance from
the start. The fact that at our company alone, more than
450 refugees have been given internships to help them integrate into the German employment market and nearly
300 have been given jobs testifies to our success. We intend to continue along these lines. That includes extending
our close cooperation with organizations like the German
Reading Foundation (Stiftung Lesen) and working even
more intensively with the Federal Employment Agency
and other DAX companies like ourselves. We need to provide more and better support for refugees who received no
formal training in their home countries and now face the
tremendous challenge of starting a new life.

To be honest, we really don’t need to motivate our employees. Right from the outset, staff at every single branch
and at almost every one of our sites in Germany – a total
of over 15,000 employees – took the initiative to become
actively involved. Here at Deutsche Post, people from
many dif­ferent backgrounds and cultures have long
worked together in an exemplary way – they help one
another and see each other as equals, as colleagues. It is with
that matter-of-fact attitude that many employees are now
coming forward to help refugees. So one of the things
I am particularly proud of is our team of over 100
coordinators. In addition to performing their everyday
work, they do a fantastic job of promoting more than 1,000
refugee aid projects and activities. Their work makes an
important difference!
Apart from social engagement, your division also focuses on
environmental protection – a topic of both social and business
relevance. In 2016, Deutsche Post achieved a success story with
the introduction of the StreetScooter and carbon-neutral de­
liveries. Can we expect to see more smart innovations made
by Post - eCommerce - Parcel and will employees be involved
in their making?

81

SOCIETY & ENGAGEMENT – Interview with Jürgen Gerdes

Yes, of course. Innovation is part of our DNA and we have
found it fruitful to involve employees, many of whom
played an active role in the StreetScooter’s development
and design. Putting the environmental aspect aside, the
StreetScooter is essentially a tool that is designed to optimize the support we provide to our employees as they
perform their work each day. And it works so well, not
least in terms of its ergonomic design, because during the
development process a large number of couriers provided
input on their needs and ideas. This is also the case with
our other innovations and enhancements in the area of
environmentally-friendly delivery. Thousands of our employees make their deliveries either on foot or by bicycle
and a growing number now do so using electric delivery
carts, e-bikes and e-trikes designed and built by us. Before
these and other newly-developed items like rainwear are
approved for mass production, they are tried and tested by
the people who will actually use them. What this all comes
down to is our ambition to provide innovative customer
services, develop innovative working tools and lead the logistics sector in both of these fields.

not when final-mile delivery involves battery-operated
vehicles. Our parcel logistics approach has long been both
innovative and forward-looking. Take our Pack­stations.
We have around 3,000 located throughout Germany
and customers find them both practical and convenient.
But looking at them from a different angle, they are also
extremely environment friendly. If a recipient asks us
to place a parcel in a Packstation, that’s a parcel that no
longer needs to be delivered to their front door. Nor does
it have to be taken back to a retail outlet for the recipient to
collect at a later date because they were not at home when the
courier called. Other offerings such as the Paketkasten
parcel box, preferred location and preferred time delivery
are all part of that same innovative approach. They make
customers’ lives much easier and ensure that parcels arrive
at their destination in the most environmentally friendly
way.

Deutsche Post benefits especially from the growth in online

Looking at the big picture, I naturally have our corpo­
rate strategy in mind and particularly the GROW component. Our e-commerce and parcel business is seeing
strong and sustainable growth. That was particularly evident in the record figures seen around Christmas. So I’ll
be concentrating on continuing to create the conditions
needed to foster that growth in a responsible way. For in­
stance, by equipping more and more sites in Germany with
StreetScooters and other modern electric vehicles – and by
further optimizing our sorting logistics. This is something
we have done at our new parcel center in Obertshausen –
it’s truly a benchmark site in environmental terms.

trade. Does this have a proven, positive impact on the environment? In other words, how environmentally friendly is shopping online?

Linking this to the StreetScooter, I repeatedly stress the
environmental aspects in many of my talks. I say, yes,
we’re seeing growth in online shopping and that means
growth in parcel volumes and in the logistics network
needed to cope with it all. If you approach this pro­perly
and keep coming up with new ideas the way we do at

Management approach & targets

✔ PwC

As a leading logistics company we connect people around
the world and are a significant driver of global trade. This
generates opportunity and prosperity, but also impacts the
environment through greenhouse gas emissions, local air
pollutants and noise. We play a leading role in environmentally sustainable logistics and have gained worldwide
recognition for our efforts in this area. Our CEO Frank
Appel represents Deutsche Post DHL Group as a member of the UN High-Level Advisory Group on Sustainable
Transport, which has issued recommendations for sustainable logistics. Our involvement has helped contribute to
today’s debate on sustainability and drive innovation in the
area of sustainable transport.
In 2008 we became the first global player in the logistics industry to establish a climate protection target. This
goal – to improve our carbon efficiency by 30% over the
2007 baseline by the year 2020 – was achieved in 2016,
four years earlier than planned. Looking to the future, we
have now set our sights on
another ambitious goal:
By 2050 we want to recarbon efficiency achieved
duce all transport-related
emissions to net zero and
contribute to the two-degree goal established at the 2015
UN Paris Climate Conference (COP 21). Our plan to turn
this vision into reality includes four interim targets for

This includes joining partners to plant one million
trees each year as part of our commitment to forest

In line with these objectives we continue to develop measures to reduce our own emissions, and we support our
customers and subcontractors in reducing the impact of
their business on the environment. We develop innovative
efficiency measures tailored to specific regions and areas of
activity; these measures are then implemented to improve
fuel efficiency, optimize our networks and routes, and improve the energy efficiency of our buildings.
We are also involved in a number of initiatives to a­­
chieve greater transparency and comparability in the area
of greenhouse gas emissions data collection and reporting.
Our efforts in the area of environmental protection are
guided by the concept of “Shared Value” – the idea that
we can create business value by contributing to society
and the environment. One component of the Shared Value

proach is the development of new environmentallyfriendly logistics solutions, our GoGreen Solutions, with
which we not only fulfill our customers’ expectations and
needs, but also contribute to the success of our own business.
Due to their importance, our environmental protection
activities are anchored in our corporate strategy.

Deutsche Post DHL Group – Corporate Responsibility Report 2016

✔ PwC

GoGreen, our Group-wide environmental protection program, showcases our innovative strength in the area of sustainability. The GoGreen program includes a diverse range
of innovative measures that make lasting contributions to
improving our carbon efficiency and reducing air pol­lution
and noise. In 2016 we achieved our efficiency goal set back
in 2008. We have now begun working towards a new longterm aspiration: to reduce all transport-related emissions
to net zero by 2050. Based on our 2050 aspiration, we have
defined four strategic interim goals to be achieved by the
year 2025. These interim goals cover four main aspects:
global emissions, local emissions, green solutions and employee engagement.
When considering greenhouse gas emissions, we include not only the direct emissions generated by our own
fleet and buildings, but also the indirect emissions from
our transportation subcontractors, which account for the
largest share of the Group’s overall emissions. The focus
areas of our GoGreen program are identified together
with our stakeholders and defined in our Group-wide
Environmental and Energy Policy; our environmental
management system, in turn, ensures implementation of
this policy. These focus areas include fuel and energy
efficiency, the Group’s environmentally-friendly products
as well as raising awareness and training employees in the
area of energy and environment.
We consider natural resource consumption and
biodiversity to be lower-priority focus areas. Our
business activity does not involve intensive use of
water or wood, nor does it generate significant waste.
Furthermore, our sites and activities do not have a significant
impact on biodiversity. Independent of our environmental
protection priorities and main action areas, we of course
always act in accordance with existing environmental laws
and regulations.
Our activities in the area of environmental protection
have received top ratings from leading supplier evaluation
platforms as well as from the largest and most influential
CR rating agencies.

Improving fuel and energy efficiency ✔ PwC

Our aspiration is to achieve net zero emissions in our trans­
port operations by the year 2050. This means im­proving

Greenhouse gas emissions

2016

A comparison of the various modes of transport –
including air, road, rail and ocean – reveals that air
transport produces the greatest share of both greenhouse gas emissions and the local air pollutant sulfur
dioxide (SO2). In the case of road transport, greenhouse gas
emissions and particulate matter (PM10) emerge as the
most relevant factors. As part of our efforts to reduce
local air pollutant emissions, one of our interim goals is to
operate 70% of our own first and last mile services with
clean pick-up and delivery solutions, including bicycles
and e-mobility.

Environmental issues anchored in Group policies ✔ PwC

In addition to our Environmental and Energy Policy,
we have also included environmental issues in other key
Group policies. This puts us in position to achieve the ambitious goals set by our environmental protection program.

environmentally-friendly transportation services or award
their business to providers who have environmental
management systems and measures in place.
In line with our vision for net zero transport-related
emissions by 2050, we want more than 50% of our
sales to incorporate Green Solutions by 2025, making our
customers’ supply chains greener.
Turning employees into multipliers ✔ PwC

Our employees play a critical role in realizing our environmental goals, which is why one of our new interim goals
focuses on training 80% of our workforce to become certified GoGreen specialists and actively involving them in
our environmental and climate protection activities. This
includes joining partners to plant one million trees each
year as part of our commitment to forest conservation.
Standardized energy and environmental management processes

✔ PwC
We maintain over 12,000 sites worldwide – including
office buildings, mail and parcel centers and logistics
warehouses, as well as Packstations and drop-off points.
Awareness with regard to the environment and climate is
integral to all operational processes at our sites. As part
of the Group’s own internal environmental management
process – the 6-Step Approach – we are engaged in a continuous improvement process, constantly developing and
implementing improvement measures to help us achieve
our environmental targets. The process steps are based on
the ISO 14001 standard.
Of the 10,307 sites suitable for external certification,
some 4,990 were certified according to ISO 14001 in the
reporting year. This represents approximately 48% of our
sites, eight percentage points fewer than in the previous
year. This decrease is attributable to an 11% increase in
the number of our sites, which were included in the year’s
calculations. An additional effect was our increased focus
on the ISO 50001 energy management standard in Europe
– in the reporting year we were able to certify 4,975 of our
sites according to ISO 50001.

Efficiency management
As a global logistics provider we maintain our own fleets
and buildings and rely on additional capacity provided
by subcontractors. In the area of ocean and rail freight,
we work together with subcontracted shipping and rail
companies.
We continuously improve the efficiency of our own
fleets and buildings with the help of a comprehensive efKlimaschutz
ficiency management system which includes the use of
innovative technologies. The Group’s Investment Pol­
icy requires verification that any new acquisitions offer

greater carbon efficiency or be more environmentally
friendly than existing assets, which is why advanced
efficiency technologies are already standard equipment in
many of our fleets and buildings.
All of our efficiency measures are guided by two basic
principles: “burn less” and “burn clean”. “Burn less” mea­
sures help us reduce the energy and fuel consumption of
our operations while “burn clean” measures allow us to
tap additional potential for emissions reductions. This ap­
proach also has a positive impact on local air pollution and
noise.

OPTIMIZING AIR TRANSPORT EFFICIENCY
Deutsche Post DHL Group is one of the world’s leading
providers of international express services. With our fleet
of over 250 dedicated aircraft comprised of 190 cargo
planes and a number of smaller feeder aircraft, we serve
approximately 500 airports worldwide via 19 main
regional hubs and three global hubs in Leipzig, Cincinnati
and Hong Kong.
In the reporting year we again recorded growth in
transport volumes; this resulted in increased kerosene
consumption within our own fleet despite continued
progress in route and network optimization. At 1,333

million kilograms, kerosene consumption in 2016 was
slightly high­er than the previous year. The greenhouse gas
emissions from our air transport operations amounted to
4.23 tonnes of CO2e in 2016, accounting for approximately
70% of our direct greenhouse gas emissions (GHG
Protocol, scopes 1 and 2). Air transport is also a significant
source of the local air pollutant sulfur dioxide (SO2).
Modernizing aircraft

Air transport poses special challenges due to comparably
high fuel consumption and emissions. We respond to these
challenges with our “burn less” approach, which means
continually investing in quieter and more efficient aircraft.

Classification issued by the Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP).
The higher the CAEP class, the more stringent the requirements.

In the reporting year we added additional Boeing 757
aircraft to our fleet after deploying the first tranche in 2015.
These offer increased loading capacity, improved technology and are significantly more efficient than previous
models. These aircraft are not only more environmentallyfriendly, but also require fewer repairs and provide im­
proved working conditions for flight personnel.
In the reporting year we also signed an agreement to
convert four Airbus A330-300 from passenger to cargo
aircraft. The converted aircraft will feature cargo capacity
in the mid to high range, offering extra flexibility and increased fuel efficiency per kilo of air cargo.
In keeping with our “burn clean” approach, we also
support the use of alternative aviation fuels. However, at
present not enough is known about how these fuels impact air operations and the environment, ruling out their
large-scale deployment. We are currently working together
with other companies as part of the Aviation Initiative for
Renewable Energy in Germany e.V. (aireg) to improve the
viability of such alternative aviation fuels. In the reporting
year, as part of the research partnership project airegEM,
we measured alternative fuel emissions through a series
of ground-based engine tests and then simulated emis­
sions for our fleet using representative flight profiles. This
allowed us to gain additional insight into biofuels and how
they would impact the environmental performance of our
air fleet.
Reducing noise pollution is another goal of our air fleet
modernization efforts. Today, more than two-thirds of our
fleet already meets the highest noise standards prescribed
by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

combining the Point Merge procedure and the Continuous
Descent Approach as a possible measure for reducing local
noise pollution.

MORE EFFICIENT ROAD TRANSPORT
With a fleet of more than 92,000 vehicles worldwide, we
offer the full spectrum of transportation services – from
short-range and medium-range delivery, to regional and
long haul transport with heavy trucks. For more efficient
and environmentally friendly transport we need to apply
operationally suitable solutions that are tailored to the
varying demands and requirements of our vehicles. We
therefore depend on a diverse range of measures based on
factors such as vehicle type, utilization and route to maximize potential efficiency gains.

Despite a continued increase in transport volumes, at 1.15
million tonnes, the greenhouse gas emissions generated by
our vehicle fleets in 2016 remained stable at the previous
year’s level. This positive development can be attributed to
our efficiency measures. The consumption of liquid fuels
totaled 449.8 million liters, remaining at the previous year’s
level; the consumption of gaseous fuels totaled 1.9 million
kilograms.
For this reason we continuously upgrade and renew
our fleet in accordance with the latest emission standards.
Today, more than 48,000 of our road vehicles in Europe already meet Euro 5 or Euro 6 standards. Our use of electric

vehicles, natural-gas powered vehicles and fuel efficiency
technologies also has a positive impact on the emission of
local air pollutants.

Efficiency projects for the road vehicle fleet

We implement a wide range of measures to improve the
carbon efficiency of our road fleet – measures which also
help reduce fuel consumption. Solutions here focus mainly
on aerodynamics, eco-chiptuning technologies and lightweight vehicle design, but also include measures such as
low-rolling resistance tires and telematics. All measures
are first tested for their effectiveness before being rolled
out on a larger scale.
Along with technical modifications made to conventional fuel vehicles, we have also increased our efforts to
deploy alternative drive technologies and alternative fuels
as a way to further reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.

We achieve additional efficiency gains by optimizing our
route and network planning, switching to other modes of
transport and optimizing capacity usage. Here’s a look at
some of the projects implemented in the reporting year:
n

n

 lternative modes of transportation: We expanded the
A
use of bicycle couriers for express deliveries in the reporting year, with bike couriers now on the streets in
58 cities in twelve different European countries. The
second generation DHL Cubicyle, a special cargo
bicycle, was also rolled out in the Netherlands. The new
model features electronic locks, a lighter cargo box,
and a faster loading system.
 etwork optimization: In Japan our Supply Chain
N
division introduced a new transport solution
which integrates all modes of transport and can be
adjusted to suit the individual needs of customers. The
centerpiece of this solution is a control tower housing
more than 20 employees who centrally administer and
optimize incoming orders. DHL’s proprietary solution
“ConnectedTransport” ensures not only maximum
transparency for customers regarding their order
status, but also helps optimize fuel consumption with
improved capacity utilization and combined use of
different modes of transport.

INCREASING THE EMISSIONS AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY AT OUR SITES
To improve the efficiency of our buildings, we inspect and
assess each and every site and, as part of our environment­
al and energy management system, develop appropriate
efficiency strategies:

are just one element in our efforts to improve the efficiency
of our buildings. The employees working at our sites also
play a key role.
Energy consumption in our buildings and facilities in
2016 was 3,489 kWh – a 12% increase over the previous
year. The share of electricity from renewable sources remains at over 60%. In Belgium, Germany, France, Ireland,
Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the UK, and the
US, we refrain almost entirely from using electricity from
conventional energy sources and obtain over 90% of our
energy needs from renewable sources. Through our use of
renewable energy we were able to save 0.44 million tonnes
of greenhouse gas emissions in 2016.

In addition to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions
and improving energy efficiency, we are also intent on reducing noise pollution. At sites located in or near residential areas, our local management works closely together
with residents and other stakeholders to ensure that noise
pollution caused by our business activity is reduced to an
acceptable minimum.

L
	We conducted lighting analyses at 158 of our sites in
Europe and Asia in the reporting year. As a result, more
efficient solutions were rolled out or initiated at 55 of
these sites. We continued to refit our mail sorting centers in Germany with more efficient and cost-effective
LED technology as planned. Seventeen mail sorting
centers were refitted with LED technology in 2016,
which means that to date 28 out of a total of 86 mail
sorting centers have already been equipped with LED
lighting. We plan to upgrade an additional 22 mail
sorting centers in 2017. The project will be completed
in 2019.

	Twenty parcel centers in Germany were fitted with
combined heating and power units – 25% of the electricity requirement at these sites is now generated by
the combined heat and power systems. In addition, the

the hot water needed at the respective sites. In 2017 we
plan to convert the remaining seven parcel centers to
combined heat and power.

I n the reporting year we also conducted feasibil­
ity tests on new technologies for use in our sites. The
first phase of our pilot project in Australia, which
involved testing heat reflective paint at a logistics facility,
was brought to a successful close in the reporting year.
Applied to the roof, the special paint reflects a significant portion of incoming sunlight, reducing air conditioning costs as a result. The three-month pilot test cut
cooling requirements by more than 20% and kept indoor
temperatures from rising above 25°C. The second
stage of the pilot will measure the paint’s impact over
the course of an entire year.

✔ PwC

In the reporting year we met our climate target of im­
proving our carbon efficiency by 30% over 2007 levels –
this target was originally set for 2020. We have now set our
sights on another ambitious goal: We want to reduce all
transport-related emissions to net zero by 2050 and make
an important contribution
to the two-degree goal established at the 2015 UN
carbon efficiency achieved Paris Climate Conference
(COP 21). We have established four strategic interim goals to help turn this vision
into reality – two of these goals have a direct impact on our
emissions. By 2025 we want to have increased our carbon
efficiency over 2007 levels by 50%. We also want to reduce
local air pollutant emissions by operating 70% of our own
first and last mile services with clean pick-up and delivery
solutions.
Our environmental reporting covers greenhouse gas
emissions as well as local air pollutants. The reporting of
both our emissions and efficiency improvements ad­here

In 2016 we were once again recognized for our strategic approach to sustainability and transparency regarding
greenhouse gas emissions.

CARBON EFFICIENCY TARGET MET AHEAD OF
SCHEDULE ✔ PwC
In 2016 we met our goal to improve our carbon efficiency index (CEX) by an additional index point. Each of the
Group’s division contributed differently to our increased
carbon efficiency. Improvements were driven primarily
by continuous efficiency gains in the Global For­warding,
Freight division’s ocean freight operations, achieved
through slow steaming and the use of ships with greater
load capacity. Gains were also seen in our Express di­vision,
which used less fuel to transport more shipments in its
pick-up and delivery operations.

Previous years adjusted; new weighting based on absolute carbon emissions adjusted for
efficiency gains

In the reporting year, we adjusted the weighting of the respective divisional carbon efficiencies that are included in
the CEX calculation. As before, the weighting is calculated
using absolute carbon emissions, but emissions figures are
now adjusted to reflect efficiency gains. In the past, because
of these weightings, positive developments in the divisions
were not appropriately reflected in the carbon ef­fi ciency
performance indicator. As an example, over the past
years the Global Forwarding, Freight division has been
able to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of its
ocean freight business. This development, however, reduced the division’s weighting in the carbon efficiency calculation. The figures from the base year 2007 until 2015
have been uniformly adjusted accordingly. For this period,
the cumulative effect was four index points.

95

ENVIRONMENT & SOLUTIONS – Emissions

In 2016 our overall CEX value reached 30%. We have thus
achieved our original climate protection goal ahead of
schedule. Because our networks already operate at a high
level of efficiency and our fleets and buildings already use
state-of-the-art technologies, achieving significant efficiency gains year on year will be increasingly difficult. We
nevertheless expect to improve carbon efficiency by one
index point in 2017. As part of our vision for 2050, our
goal is to increase our carbon efficiency by 50% compared
to 2007 levels by 2025.

LOCAL AIR POLLUTANTS AND NOISE ✔ PwC
Our transport-related activities in particular involve
fuel combustion that generates not only greenhouse gas
emissions but other local air pollutants as well, including
mono-nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and
particulate matter (PM10). We reduce these emissions by
modernizing our fleet of aircraft and road vehicles and
updating the heating systems in our buildings. In cities,
the growing percentage of electric-powered vehicles used
in our operations – as well as increased delivery by foot
or bicycle – also contributes to lower levels of local air
pollutants and noise.
Our vision of reducing transport-related emissions to
net zero by the year 2050 also includes a strategic interim
goal of operating 70% of our own first and last mile services with clean pick-up and delivery solutions, such as
bicycles and e-mobility.
The local air pollutants from our own fleet are calculat­
ed using methodologies from the European Environment
Agency (EEA) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and are based on national and international fleet averages.

Deutsche Post DHL Group – Corporate Responsibility Report 2016

Emissions of all local air pollutants ✔ PwC

Our total local air pollutant emissions in 2016 were nearly the same as in the previous year. While emissions in­
creased slightly in the area of air transport, due primarily
to the increased use of our own aircraft, road transport
em­is­sions continued to decrease slightly in 2016. This trend
is re­flected in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions
across the road transport business, which is largely a result
of our ongoing efforts to modernize and upgrade our vehicle fleet based on the most current emissions standards.

In the reporting year already more than 48,000 of our
road vehicles in Europe met Euro 5 or Euro 6 standards.
Moreover, many of the efficiency measures for reducing
greenhouse gas emissions – including the use of electric
vehicles, natural-gas powered vehicles and fuel efficiency
technologies – also have a positive impact on the emission
of local air pollutants.
A multi-year overview as well as a detailed presen­
tation of the data can be found in the Annex of this report.

ENVIRONMENT & SOLUTIONS – Emissions – Natural resources

Natural resources
Issues such as resource consumption, waste management
and biodiversity are not among the focus areas of our environmental protection program. We do not consume a significant amount of resources, generate significant amounts
of waste or significantly impact biodiversity, which is why
these factors are not a high priority for our business and
stakeholders. We nevertheless consider these issues to be
socially relevant and choose to include them in this report.
Wood and water

In accordance with our Group Paper Policy, we make sure
that only recycled paper products are procured and used
within the Group. Exceptions are permitted only if recycled paper does not meet certain technical requirements or
cannot be procured on the local market.
We are also working to reduce the amount of paper we
use, which helps lower demand for wood. This, in turn,
helps reduce the consumption of energy and water associated with paper production and helps prevent the de­
forestation of tropical rainforests, primeval forests and ancient forests under protection. We also strive to reduce the
amount of packaging materials used in our operations and
are working closely with experts and our own customers to
achieve this.
Due to the nature of our core business, we do not
consume significant quantities of water. Water is mostly
used for drinking and sanitation at our facilities; it is obtained primarily from municipal suppliers and dis­charged
into public sewage systems. Water consumption and
waste water disposal are therefore not considered
significant environmental factors for the Group, which is
why we do not record and report global water use data.
However, we have included data on water consumption at our
facilities in Germany, as provided to the Carbon Disclo­
sure Project (CDP), in the Annex of this report. Never­
theless, sites with environmental management systems do
work to implement measures to minimize water consumption. When constructing new buildings, we also look to
install water recovery systems and water-efficient sanitary
in­stallations where possible.
Packaging, waste and recycling

As a logistics provider, we use packaging such as pallets
and other packing materials. Our offices also produce
paper waste which can often be reduced or avoided all

together. Increasingly digitized processes are helping us
do this. We are also committed to recycling used materials
wherever possible, thereby making our own contribution
to the circular economy.
Our aircraft, road vehicles and IT equipment must
be maintained and ultimately disposed of. Since we lease
most of our vehicles and aircraft, most of the time their
maintenance and decommissioning or scrapping is han­
dled by the manufacturer or other third-party providers.
A similar approach is also applied to the maintenance and
disposal of our IT equipment. Our maintenance and disposal contracts include explicit instructions for our partners to ensure compliance with responsible environmental
practices and processes.
Waste is not a priority issue for the Group and is therefore not managed centrally. Waste separation, is standard
procedure at many of our sites, however. Data on waste is
collated and audited locally by the environmental management systems on site, allowing for a more effective tracking
of measures and their savings effects.

BIODIVERSITY
Because our sites are located mostly in urban areas or
designated industrial/commercial zones, it is unlikely that
our business operations would negatively impact pro­
tected areas or endanger protected plant or animal species.
Nevertheless, our operations do have an impact on
ecosystems – through our greenhouse gas emissions and
local air pollutants, the use of natural resources or other
operations-related factors. For this reason, our environmental management system accounts for biodiversity
impacts when designing measures and initiatives. One
such example is our Policy on the Usage of Liquid Biofuels,
which considers biodiversity in the countries where biofuels are produced.
Another example is our terms and conditions,
which expressly prohibits the use of our network to
transport protected, threatened or endangered plant and
animal species – a major issue around the world. We are a
member of the United for Wildlife task force backed by
Prince William, and in 2016 we joined with other logistics companies to sign a Buckingham Palace initiative
against the trade in protected species of wildlife. Our joint
objective is to shut down transportation channels used for
illegal trade of protected animals. In the reporting year we

98

conducted an extensive range of activities in pursuit of this
goal. We conducted a communications campaign to raise
awareness among our employees and conducted trainings
on the topic so that employees are able to recognize suspicious cargo and know which steps to take if they suspect
illegal wildlife trafficking. Our employees also take part in
workshops on the topic and volunteer their time to international animal-protection initiatives.
In the reporting year we handled the transport of a
black rhinoceros from its place of birth in the Czech
Republic to its natural habitat in Tanzania. The reintro­
duction of animals into a nature preserve is part of an
ongoing project of the George Adamson Wildlife
Preservation Trust, which champions the preservation
and propagation of endangered species in their natural
habitats.

 arbon Reports: We help customers gain a deeper
C
understanding of the environmental impact of their
transport and logistics-related activities. Customer
emissions are measured using the same carbon accounting standards applied to our own emissions calculations. The calculation methods regularly undergo a
third-party verification process.
 limate neutral products: Customers can offset their
C
transport and logistics-related greenhouse gas emissions with our climate neutral products. Customer

emissions are measured using the same carbon accounting standards applied to our own emissions calculations. Methods used for calculating and offsetting
emissions in relation to our climate neutral products
are also subject to a regular third-party verification
process.
Our portfolio of Green Optimization products complements our standardized products by providing individualized logistics solutions that help our customers reduce
greenhouse gas emissions as well as other environmental
impacts.

STANDARDIZED PRODUCTS
Carbon Reports for transparency on carbon footprint

Our Carbon Report products provide customers with
detailed information about their transport and logisticsrelated greenhouse gas emissions. These calculations are
based on the GHG Product Standard and verified annually
by the external auditor SGS. In addition to standardized
report formats, customers from our Express and Global
Forwarding, Freight divisions also have the option of using
the Carbon Dashboard, an interactive reporting tool that
also allows customers to simulate efficiency scenarios.
In 2016 our Carbon Report products recorded a total
of 4.4 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. The
greatest demand for these products is among customers in
our Global Forwarding, Freight division, which showed a
slight decrease in reported emissions in the reporting year.
The amount of emissions reported in the Express division,
on the other hand, increased.
In the reporting year we developed and verified a
new product in line with our calculation standards and
re­
quirements. The DHL Carbon Calculator is a free
online application that allows customers in the Global
Forwarding, Freight and Supply Chain divisions to cal­­cu­
late transport-related emissions for almost all shipment
sizes and modes of transport using real data.
Climate neutral products offset emissions

With our climate neutral GoGreen products, customers
can offset their transport and logistics-related greenhouse
gas emissions. The methods used for calculating and
offsetting emissions are also based on the GHG Product
Standard and verified annually by the external auditor
SGS.

We offset the emissions through external climate protection projects in the area of energy efficiency, renewable
energy and reforestation – the majority of which are Gold
Standard certified. This also includes our own climate protection project in Lesotho, which involves the distribution
and use of efficient stoves that use up to 80% less firewood.
In the reporting year our project was the first to be certified
under the new Fairtrade Climate Standard. This additional
certification also recognizes the social value of the project
and includes an additional Fairtrade Premium of €1 per
carbon credit, which is paid directly to the village communities to be invested in local climate adaptation initiatives.
In the reporting year we were able to verify 4,000 cookstove users, successfully certifying 10,076 carbon credits
under the Fairtrade Climate Standard.
We transported close to two billion climate-neutral
shipments in the reporting year. The amount of emissions
offset through climate neutral shipments and logistics services remained at the prior-year level of more than 253,000
tonnes of CO2e. The greatest demand for climate neutral
products is among customers in our Post - eCommerce Parcel and Express divisions.

TAILOR-MADE SOLUTIONS
Green Optimization for customized solutions

With Green Optimization we offer customized logistics
solutions by analyzing every link of the customer’s supply chain. We uncover opportunities for optimization that
help reduce greenhouse gas emissions or minimize the environmental impacts of their logistics processes, enabling
a circular economy.
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions

We review the customer’s entire logistics supply chain
to identify potential environmental and economic efficiency levers – from network design and road freight to
warehousing and subcontractor management. This results
in tailored strategies for more efficient and environmentally sustainable logistics, which consider both green efficiency gains as well as savings potentials.

Enabling the circular economy

The circular economy can play a decisive role in breaking
the link between economic growth and resource use. We
are developing our own solutions to help support the transition from a linear economy to a circular economy. In the
reporting year we joined forces with the Ellen MacArthur

ENVIRONMENT & SOLUTIONS – Green products

Foundation’s CE100 initiative and Cranfield University to
publish a study on the significance of reverse logistics.
We develop solutions for reverse logistics, waste

MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT EXPRESS

Interview with Ken Allen

To reach the Group’s long-term environmental targets there is a

of delivery and reliability of service. On top you’ve got rising

The Express division operates one of the largest air fleets in the

demand from the vast majority of players along the value chain

world – what is your division doing to tackle the environmental

for eco-efficient products and services. The goal, of course, is

dimension in the transport and aviation sectors? Which of these

to provide time-definite delivery using efficient route planning

measures are most important for your business?

and a fleet of energy-efficient, low-noise delivery vehicles –
operated by a staff practiced in “green driving” techniques.
What does the reality check say – are you close?

We are well on our way. We have sophisticated ca­
pacity and route planning systems in place that en­
sure we take the shortest and quickest aggregate route
to our customers. We provide guidance to couriers on
employing driving techniques that are safer and more
environmentally-friendly, in a number of markets with
the help of telematics systems. And we have accelerated
our program to deploy greener delivery vehicles – including electric vans and cargo bicycles – as well as walking
couriers, particularly in urban areas. These measures have
contributed positively to the overall carbon efficiency improvements every year in our global network, despite the
fact that the rapid growth of online retail is changing the
pattern of last-mile deliveries – with more individual deliveries (and therefore more driver stops) over greater dis­
tances to private addresses. We recognize that there is of
course still plenty that we can do to improve our efficiency
in our ground operations, and we will therefore continue
to renew our fleet, refresh our driver training approaches

We need aviation in order to deliver the speed and global
connectivity that is at the heart of our service offering. At
the same time, it is the single biggest contributor to our
emissions, so it is an area of intense focus for our network
operations team as we work to minimize our environ­mental
footprint. Until someone develops an emissions-free
aircraft – which would require a dramatic leap forward in
technology from where we are today – the greatest impact
we can achieve in reducing emissions will be through
greater efficiency. For Express, this means a combination of
using more modern aircraft with lower fuel burn per kilo
carried, achieving better capacity utilization of our aircraft
fleet and planning routes efficiently. Where we can achieve
the same connectivity and service levels by using slower,
cleaner modes of transport, we also take advantage of this.
Employee engagement is a critical success factor in a business
that has millions of customer contacts a day. The Certified
initiative, the Group’s new employee development and engagement program, was rolled out not too long ago. Are you
starting to see positive results at DHL Express? What does the
cultural change look like?

ENVIRONMENT & SOLUTIONS – Interview with Ken Allen

The Express division actually pioneered the Certified
approach. The initiative has been built on the back of
our hugely successful Certified International Specialist
program, which we launched globally in 2010. We have
seen positive impact on our business every year since its
roll-out – from increased engagement and active leader­
ship scores in our Employee Opinion Survey results and
higher cus­tomer satisfaction scores to the productivity
improvements that have contributed to our earnings
performance over the last seven years. Despite the
multi-billion Euro transportation and technology in­
frastructure that we operate, people are still one of our core
assets, as they directly deliver the customer experi­ence.
I’m incredibly proud about how the Certified approach
has shaped the ‘can do’ culture of DHL Express and to see
the program expand into a Group-wide initiative within
Strategy 2020. I’m also absolutely convinced that it will
drive the Connect pillar of Strategy 2020 and allow our
em­ployees to harness the incredible power they have to
further deliver great service and value as a team.
Express employees often talk about the importance of team
spirit in their daily work. How do you foster this sense of belonging and how does your management team keep in touch
with its people on the ground?

Our success depends on everyone in our organization
having a ‘network mentality’. One of my personal mantras
is that a senior manager should be “in the field and on the
ground” as much as possible. I encourage our managers
around the world to spend the majority of their time in
front of customers and walking the floor engaging with
employees. This is the only effective way of ensuring that
we can stay on top of the things that motivate our em­
ployees and build customer loyalty. The same applies to my
senior executive team. We each spend more than 70% of
our time visiting our country organizations, meeting cus­
tomers and employees, conducting facility visits to identify
improvement opportunities and reviewing performance
from the ground up. Formally, we have embedded these
leadership values within our culture through the Certified International Manager program. Our global management board personally facilitates CIM and CIS sessions,
which underlines our commitment to the values. It also
helps us to have a regular open exchange with people at all
levels within the business about how we can strengthen our
teamwork and improve performance.

103

This year’s Corporate Responsibility Report focuses on “Seeing
the bigger picture”. In your opinion, which innovations and
trends will make the biggest waves in the express business in
the years to come – and what will you be focusing on in 2017?

The international express sector is well-established and
highly competitive. The main players all have expansive
infrastructure and the base level of service quality is rel­
atively high across the overall industry. However, there
are still plenty of inefficiencies to be found within global
supply chains and international trade regulations, which
means that we can deliver dramatic service improvements
with the help of what I would call incremental innovation
– relatively small changes within our networks and pro­
cess­es that have a big impact on our global service offering.
For example, in 2016, we introduced a new automated
sorting technology for heavier shipments at our European
Hub in Leipzig, Germany. This significantly reduced processing times (as well as costs and the risk of handling errors) for these shipments, which translates into more value
for customers. Over the longer-term, I am excited by the
potential that automation has, for example, to make our
network even more efficient and support growth. I also
anticipate that we will take advantages of developments in
electric vehicle and aircraft fuel technologies to make our
global transport fleet even greener.

Deutsche Post DHL Group – Corporate Responsibility Report 2016

ANNEX
About this report
The 2016 Corporate Responsibility Report (CR Report) was prepared in accordance with the international G4 Guidelines (Core
Option) issued by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). The material issues selected for the report are based on the results of our
2015 materiality analysis. The CR Report also serves as an Ad­
vanced Level Communication on Progress (COP) on our commitment to the ten principles of the UN Global Compact (UNGC).
The linkages to the UNGC’s ten principles are based on the UNCI/
GRI publication “Making the Connection”. The UNGC principles
have been integrated and noted accordingly in the GRI Index.
Publication

The CR Report is published annually and appears concurrently with
the Group’s Annual Report. The 2016 CR Report was pub­lished
March 8, 2017 online as well as in PDF format in both German
and English. The 2015 report was published March 9, 2016. The
Group has been reporting on the environment, HR matters and
corporate responsibility since 2003. All of these reports can be
found in the download area of the Deutsche Post DHL Group
website.

Data measurement techniques, bases of calculations

Unless otherwise noted, “headcount” is used to refer to our employees in quantitative terms; this data is as of year-end (December 31, 2016). Data measurement techniques are accounted for
at the appropriate sections herein. The bases of calculations for
data, including assumptions and techniques underlying estimations, are also duly noted. This also applies to any changes made
in the calculation bases over the previous year. Adjustments to
prior-year figures are marked accordingly. In accordance with
the Greenhouse Gas Protocol standard, Scope 2 greenhouse gas
emissions are reported as gross CO2e volumes using both the sitebased and market-based methods. Unless explicitly stated
otherwise, reported data is based on the market-based method.
Our calculation methodologies meet the requirements of the
European Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) as well as the EN
16258 and ISO 14064 standards.

ANNEX – About this report – Materiality analysis 2015

Materiality analysis 2015

✔ PwC

Deutsche Post DHL Group conducted a materiality analysis in
2015 as a way to identify focus issues within three main areas:
Employees, the Environment and Governance. Focus issues were
identified and concrete goals and KPIs were defined for each issue.

 In the area of Employees, we will focus on the issues of

employee engagement, learning and development, and
occupational health and safety.

 In the area of Environment, we will concentrate on issues of
energy efficiency, as well as air pollution and noise.

 In the area of Governance, our focus is on compliance, data
protection and security, as well as standards in the value chain
(especially environmental and social standards in the supply
chain).

We do not report KPIs for compliance, data protection and data
security, or environmental and social standards in the supply
chain since these figures contain sensitive information pertaining
to our business.
Methodology behind the materiality analysis

Identifying those issues considered material by Deutsche Post
DHL Group involved a four-step process.
First, 500 different stakeholder representatives participated in an
international, anonymous online survey and shared with us their
input on the importance of sustainability issues for the Group,
as well as their feedback on the Group’s performance in the
respective areas. Participants in the survey included employees,
cus­tomers, investors, non-governmental organizations (NGOs),
policymakers, suppliers, journalists, academic institutions,
associations and councils, as well as CR experts from other
companies.
The survey questions were based on the following five thematic
areas: ethical governance and sustainable business strategy, product responsibility and business practices, working conditions
and the safeguarding of human rights, environmental protection
and corporate citizenship. The list of issues was established according to today’s most important sustainability initiatives and
standards (including the Global Reporting Initiative – GRI, UN
Global Compact, OECD), and also based on the requirements of
customers, CR rating agencies and internal evaluation methods.
The issues identified in 2015 were largely the same as those identified for our company in 2013.
As a second step, the results of the stakeholder surveys were combined with insights gained from other relevant sources of information. These sources included:

 Information from interviews with selected stakeholders
 Analysis of customer requirements
 Insights gained from external evaluations by CR rating
agencies

 Evaluation of global trends and issues (Issues Monitoring), as
well as

 The impact of the logistics industry on environment and society based on the Green Transformation Lab’s impact study
“Responsibility to act”.

The third stage of the process involved interviews with
members of our internal Responsible Business Practice Council as
well as with members of the Deutsche Post DHL Group Board of
Management, who were asked to provide their input on possible
focus issues and their relevance. In addition, an evaluation was
performed by the Sustainability Advisory Council, which is made
up of independent external CR specialists.
In the final step, issues identified as material by internal and
external evaluations were reviewed and confirmed by the Board
of Management, and then assigned individual KPIs and target
objectives.
The material issues along with their KPIs and targets form the
basis for the continuous performance improvement process and
the associated reporting, both internally and externally.

ANNEX – Corporate citizenship data – Economic data – Assurance Report

Assurance Report
INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONER’S LIMITED
ASSURANCE REPORT
To Deutsche Post AG, Bonn

We have been engaged to perform a limited assurance engagement
on the sustainability information marked with ✔ PwC in the online version of the Corporate Responsibility Report of Deutsche
Post AG, (hereafter the “CR Report”), Bonn, (hereafter the “Company”) for the period 1 January to 31 December 2016.1
Management’s Responsibility

Company’s Management is responsible for the preparation and
presentation of the CR Report in accordance with the criteria as
set out in the G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of the Global
Reporting Initiative (GRI) (hereafter the “GRI Criteria”) and for
the selection of the information to be assessed.
This responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the CR Report as well as the use of assumptions and estimates for individual sustainability disclosures
which are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, the responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining
systems and processes relevant for the preparation of the CR Report, which is free of material misstatements due to intentional or
unintentional errors.
Audit Firm’s Independence and Quality Control

We have complied with the German professional provisions regarding independence as well as other ethical requirements.
The audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional standards – in particular the Professional Code for German
Public Auditors and German Chartered Auditors (“Berufssatzung
für Wirtschaftsprüfer und vereidigte Buchprüfer“: “BS WP/vBP”)
as well as the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public
Auditors in Germany; IDW): Requirements to quality control for
audit firms (Entwurf eines IDW Qualitätssicherungsstandards 1
“Anforderungen an die Qualitätssicherung in der Wirtschaftsprüferpraxis“; IDW EQS 1) – and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies
and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements,
professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory
requirements

Practitioner’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the sustainability
information marked with ✔ PwC in the CR Report based on our
work performed.

Within the scope of our engagement we did not perform an audit
on external sources of information or expert opinions, referred to
in the CR Report.
We conducted our work in accordance with the International
Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical
Financial Information” published by IAASB. This Standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain
limited assurance whether any matters have come to our attention
that cause us to believe that the sustainability information marked
with ✔ PwC in the CR Report has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the GRI Criteria.
In a limited assurance engagement the evidence-gathering procedures are more limited than for a reasonable assurance engagement and therefore significantly less assurance is obtained than
in a reasonable assurance engagement. The procedures selected
depend on the practitioner’s judgement. This includes the assessment of the risks of material misstatements of the sustainability
information marked with ✔ PwC in the CR Report with regard to
the GRI Criteria.
Within the scope of our work we performed amongst others the
following procedures:

 Obtaining an understanding of the structure of the sustainability organization and of the stakeholder engagement;

 Inquiries of personnel involved in the preparation of the CR

Report regarding the preparation process, the underlying internal control system and selected sustainability information;

 Analytical procedures on selected sustainability information
of the CR Report;

 Comparison of selected sustainability information with corre-

sponding data in the consolidated financial statements and in
the Group management report;

 Assessment of the presentation of selected sustainability informa-

tion in the CR Report regarding the sustainability performance.

1 Our engagement applied to the German online version of the CR Report (http://cr-report2016.dpdhl.com), which describes the sustainability performance of the Company.
This text is a translation of the Independent Assurance Report issued in German - the German text is authoritative. Statements as well as expert opinions in the report were
not in scope of our engagement.

Deutsche Post DHL Group – Corporate Responsibility Report 2016

Emphasis of Matter – Recommendations

Without qualifying our conclusion above, we make the following
recommendations for the further development of the Company’s
sustainability management and sustainability reporting:

 In the reporting year the Company has further focused its

material sustainability aspects and implemented corresponding key performance indicators. We recommend to the
Company to define key performance indicators for external reporting for those material sustainability aspects, for
which currently no key performance indicators are reported.

Restriction on Use and Distribution

We issue this report on the basis of the engagement agreed with
Deutsche Post AG. The audit has been performed for purposes of
Deutsche Post AG and is solely intended to inform Deutsche Post
AG about the results of the audit. The report is not intended for any
third parties to base any (financial) decision thereon. We do not
assume any responsibility towards third parties.
