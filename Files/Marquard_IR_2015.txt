Sustainability Report 2015

Foreword by
the executive Board

Executive Board (from left): Claus-Georg Nette, Julio Tellechea, Anke Schouten, Christian Flach

Dear Readers,
The global energy markets are going through a turbulent phase. After years of rising oil prices,
we experienced a sharp fall in prices in 2015. Oversupply and low prices had a positive impact on

G4-1,
G4-2

demand, which benefitted many of our subsidiaries – especially in the end consumer business –
and led to an excellent operating result.
Despite this positive performance, we must face up to the matter of sustainable use of our fossil
resources more than ever. The Paris Climate Agreement has the goal of producing no more
greenhouse gases in the second half of the century than the ecosystem can reabsorb. This by no
means heralds the end for fossil fuels, though some people are interpreting it as such. However,
it does give the development of renewable energy sources a major boost.
As a company that does business sustainably, we are following the discussions attentively. A
long-view energy policy should strike the right balance between security of supply, an efficient
energy mix, competitiveness, and environmental sustainability. Energy policy targets must not
ignore the reality of the markets: Oil is the most important energy source. It makes up about
30 percent of the global energy mix and will continue to play a key role in the coming decades.
All future steps should therefore be taken with foresight, transparency and economic common
sense.

05

Developments around the world encourage us to continue doing business in the trade and
logistics of petroleum products as well as in the field of renewable energy, albeit our focus is very
clearly on fossil fuels given our nearly 70 years of expertise here.
With this in mind, we feel it is more important than ever to provide our services in a manner that
shows responsibility – to our employees, contractors, the people who live close to our facilities,
as well as towards the environment. To protect the environment, we are committed to limiting
harmful influences as far as possible, by using energy and raw materials prudently and avoiding
pollution. We will remain true to this course in the future.
We achieved last year’s goal of further analyzing our value chain and advancing our stakeholder
management by conducting a global stakeholder survey on matters of sustainability. We have
continued developing our sustainability strategy and plan to roll it out later this year. This report
gives an overview of what we achieved and did not achieve in 2015.
We wish you an enjoyable read and welcome your feedback – please write to us at

Besides the U.S. and Canada, the company is currently active in Peru and India. In 2015, Newsco
directionally drilled a total distance of 2,049,477 meters.

Renewable Energies > Mabagas
Mabagas is active in the biogas business and aims to realize biogas projects that generate
energy from organic residuals and waste to avoid competing with food production. The
services offered by Mabagas range from project planning and construction to the operation
of biogas plants. In the renewable energy business, increasing market concentration and tight
regulation impeded activities in Germany. Mabagas therefore divested from its biogas plant in
Bardowick, Germany, acquired in 2012. The biogas plant in Namakkal, India, which went into
operation at the end of 2012, is still operational and the development of further projects is being
evaluated.

Ecological and Social Challenges
along the Oil & Gas Value Chain
Many of our subsidiaries are active along the oil and gas value chain. We are
aware of the risks to our employees, the environment, and society. Therefore, it is our goal to identify risks at an early stage and to minimize the
negative impacts of our business activities in the areas we can influence
along our value chain. In the following, we give an overview of the potential
environmental and social challenges of the oil and gas value chain, and show
the areas where we are involved through our subsidiaries.

> Exploration & Production
Exploration & production includes the search for deposits, the development of oil and gas fields,
and the extraction of crude oil and natural gas. Exploration and production activities generally
impact nature and therefore represent a potential threat to ecosystems. In addition, technical
defects, human error, and natural disasters can lead to serious accidents such as fires. Deepwater drilling represents a particular challenge, because it is associated with considerable
technical effort and requires elaborate safety measures due to the serious environmental
consequences of oil spills and difficult extraction conditions. Terrorism and military conflicts also
involve high risks, e.g. when oil fields are deliberately set on fire. Crude oil is mainly transported
from the fields to the refineries by pipeline and seagoing vessel. The main risks here are from
potential transport accidents, which may lead to oil spills from pipelines or tanker accidents. The
greenhouse gases emitted during extraction and maritime transport also contribute to global
warming.

>

We are only involved as a service provider in this sector through our subsidiary Newsco,
which offers horizontal directional drilling and develops drilling technology for exploration
companies. Our new location in Açu Port, Brazil, offers crude oil transshipping facilities, and
our two tank terminal sites in Argentina provide crude oil logistics.

16

Marquard & Bahls

/

Sustainability Report 2015

> Refining
In refinery plants, oil is distilled, purified and refined to produce fuels, lubricants, or chemical
feedstocks for the plastics industry. Handling hazardous materials and work processes at high
pressure and temperature ranges at refineries involves the risk of spills and fires, which can
have negative effects on the environment, the health and safety of employees and the surrounding communities. Besides, the processes are very energy intensive, which contributes to global
warming. In politically unstable countries, there are risks from small illegal refineries, where
gasoline, kerosene and diesel for the black market are produced from drawn-off oil, and which
pose a threat to people and nature e.g. due to disregard for occupational health and safety
standards. Transport to and from the refinery is usually conducted by pipeline, seagoing ships
or tankers. In addition to the potential risk of accidents, in some countries there are risks from
drilling into pipelines, which can result in environmental pollution through product releases or
emissions.

>

Marquard & Bahls does not own or operate any refineries or petrochemical plants. However,
residues from refineries, such as petcoke, are stored and handled at our two United Bulk
Terminals dry-bulk storage facilities in the U.S.

> Trade
The trade in petroleum products involves the physical trading business as well as speculative
trading with currency or securities on petroleum exchanges. The trading business is closely
linked with the transport of goods and hence carries transport-related environmental risks.

>

Our subsidiaries under the Mabanaft umbrella are independent suppliers that concentrate
on the physical trading of oil products such as heating oil, diesel, gasoline, jet fuel, marine
fuels and biofuels. One core activity is regional retail and wholesale in Singapore and Northwest Europe. Mabanaft charters ships and contracts tank trucks and railcars for its product
transports. To avoid petroleum products being transported by ships that do not meet our
standards, we have specified detailed minimum acceptance criteria in a Ship Charter Policy
for Mabanaft. To evaluate our own impact on climate change, each year we calculate our
carbon footprint, including commissioned transport, in accordance with the Greenhouse
Gas Protocol.

> Product Storage
Storage plays an important role as petroleum products move from oilfields around the world to
consumers. The main risk here arises from working with highly flammable substances, as well as
environmentally hazardous, and sometimes toxic products. Preventing accidents, spills and fires

is therefore a special focus in tank storage. Tank terminals receive the products to be stored
from seagoing vessels, barges, pipelines, railcars and tank truck. The transport-related risks are
the same as those already mentioned in the other areas.

>

Our subsidiary Oiltanking is especially active in the area of storage. Skytanking also operates
airport tank terminals for storing jet fuel. In-house standards, which often far exceed the
statutory requirements, are part of our HSSE management system. To ensure professional
support in the event of major oil spills, Marquard & Bahls is a shareholder in Oil Spill
Response Limited, the world’s largest oil spill response company. To evaluate the
environmental impact of construction projects in advance, extensive environmental impact
assessments are carried out.

> Distribution & End-consumer Business
The distribution & end-consumer business involves supplying customers with fuels to produce
heat and motion, as well as lubricants. The fuelling and consumer business that is part of this
area is closely linked with the transport of the products, and therefore involves transport-related risks. Moreover, the process of fuelling ships, tank cars and aircraft e.g. involves the risk of
accidents and spills.

>

We are active in the areas of ship fuelling, service stations, and the end-consumer business
with heating oil through our Mabanaft subsidiaries in particular. Skytanking also is active in
aviation fuelling. In order to reduce the ecological footprint of filling stations, for example,
OIL! Tankstellen is switching its service stations to LED lighting. To reduce the emissions of
company-owned vehicle fleets at the Petronord companies, investments are being made in
late-model vehicles with more efficient engines, and tutorials for fuel-efficient driving are
given.

> Downstream Value Creation
At the various steps along the value chain, waste and wastewater are produced, which must be
properly disposed of. And downstream of this, products are usually consumed or combusted,
which contributes to global warming by releasing greenhouse gases.

>

Because waste is generated in our activities, our subsidiaries are indirectly involved. Waste
requiring monitoring, e.g. from oil-water separators and tank-cleaning residues, is treated by
us or by licensed contractors. However, our aim is to prevent waste, and we are continuously
working on this. Emissions from the combustion of petroleum products can be offset with
emission certificates from our subsidiary Carbonbay’s carbon-offsetting projects.

Strategy & Sustainability
The repercussions of our activities can have environmental as well as social
relevance. We take this fact into account by focusing on sustainable
development in our activities.
We have formally anchored the topic of sustainability in our values at the holding company level
and have integrated it into our strategic approach.

Strategic Approach

Marquard & Bahls has seen rapid growth in recent years. Not only has its portfolio changed and
expanded significantly, the market environment has undergone a dramatic transformation. Due
to these developments we revised our business strategy three years ago. Our Vision & Mission
determines the long-term policy for Marquard & Bahls. Together with our philosophy, priorities
and values they form our strategic approach, which applies for the entire group. Due to its
comprehensive significance our Vision & Mission has been included in our revised Code of
Conduct.

The results of our stakeholder survey also highlighted the importance of our company values,
especially for our employees. Therefore, last year we set ourselves the goal to design and host
tailor-made employee workshops to further illustrate our values and bring them to life using
examples from the daily business. In 2015, five value workshops were hosted in Germany, and
another 18 around the world. The senior management will conduct further workshops in 2016
and the following years.

Organizational Structure
Marquard & Bahls is governed by an Executive Board, which is supported by a Supervisory Board
as an advisory and monitoring body. The Executive Board determines the company’s strategy and
regularly updates the Supervisory Board on the company’s situation and performance. A lively,
consultative exchange on all the major matters at hand takes place between the two bodies. The

G4-5,
G4-6,
G4-7,
G4-13,
G4-34

Supervisory Board also approves key corporate decisions, such as major investments. The Group
Management Committee (GMC) is a further body that supports the Executive Board in an advisory
capacity in selected areas. Besides the members of the Executive Board, the Managing Directors
of Oiltanking, the Directors of the three Mabanaft Divisions, and the Managing Directors of
Skytanking, UBT and Newsco sit on the GMC, as do the heads of important departments of
Marquard & Bahls.
The Executive Board was expanded from three to four members with effect from February 1, 2016.
In addition to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO; Christian Flach), the Chief Financial Officer (CFO;
Claus-Georg Nette) and Chief Operating Officer (COO; Julio Tellechea), Anke Schouten has joined
the Executive Board as Chief Change Officer (CCO). Anke Schouten has 26 years of experience in HR
and change management and has worked for Marquard & Bahls since June 2012.

Responsible Leadership
G4-DMA

Good corporate governance has a direct influence on our reputation. Safeguarding it is a high
priority for us, so we have developed various guidelines and procedures to preserve it and
prevent noncompliant actions. They include our Code of Conduct and the group-wide internal
whistleblowing system, along with a Code of Conduct team and e.g. procurement guidelines.
As part of the reorganization at Marquard & Bahls, there will be a separate Compliance
department in future, whose task will be to identify compliance risks, develop appropriate
compliance programs, and implement them through practical measures such as training.
The focus is here on prevention of corruption and bribery, money laundering and fraud, as
well as on competition law and sanction-related topics. Compliance topics have already been
covered by various departments – on group level – for years. The Compliance department
will coordinate closely with these departments on all compliance-related topics and define
interfaces.

> Code of Conduct
Our Code of Conduct covers 16 topics, divided into four chapters:

Code of Conduct
Business & Finance

Safeguards

Integrity

People

Legal Compliance

Health, Safety, Security &
Environment

Corruption & Bribery

Discrimination

Fair Competition

Product Responsibility

Gifts & Entertainment

Equal Opportunity

Fig. 4: The 16 topics of the Code of Conduct

24

Marquard & Bahls

/

Sustainability Report 2015

The principles of the Code of Conduct provide a uniform set of values, along with guidance for
how individuals are expected to behave in the context of the Marquard & Bahls philosophy.

G4-LA16,
G4-SO5

In 2014, the Code of Conduct was amended to include the strategic approach of Marquard &
Bahls, and made accessible to all employees worldwide. It can be downloaded from our website
(www.marquard-bahls.com) in 20 languages.
Our group-wide internal whistleblowing system intervenes in cases of non-compliance with the
code. This central system, which is administered by a Code of Conduct team, gives all employees
worldwide a tool for reporting violations of the Code of Conduct, while allowing them to remain
anonymous if they wish. Every reported incident is investigated thoroughly. The Executive Board
is informed of the nature of reported incidents and the status of the investigation, but is not
given any personal data. In 2015, five whistleblowing cases were reported.

>

In the first case, a recruitment procedure and lack of compliance with internal guidelines as
part of procurement and contractor management were criticized. An employee suspected
that there might be irregularities in these two areas. An internal audit of the issues in question has not yet been completed; so far, however, the allegations have not been confirmed
for the most part.

>

A whistleblower voiced criticism of an executive’s leadership style. The manager was spoken
to about the accusation and a workshop was conducted with the staff of the site, on issues
such as fairness and respect. In this context, the corporate values of Marquard & Bahls were
again explained and discussed in detail.

>

Residents complained about the planned construction of a new fuel oil distribution site.
The objections to the location were taken seriously, and in this connection it was found
that the official approval process had been complied with. Unrelated to the whistleblower’s
complaint, a decision was later made against the site.

>

An employee complained that legally required health and safety training courses were not
carried out in a timely manner. The training was provided as planned after an operational
delay.

>

At the end of December 2015, another case was reported in which an anonymous whistleblower reported the alleged personal advantage and enrichment of three employees in
purchasing and procurement. The Internal Audit department was involved in this case as
well. Investigations are still ongoing, but so far there is no evidence for any wrongdoing.

Strategy & Sustainability

25

> Behavioral Guidelines
In addition to the Code of Conduct, there are other specific guidelines. For instance, our social
media guidelines help employees to communicate on social media effectively and in line with
legal requirements.
We want to ensure fair competition, even in very competitive markets, by defining basic values,
codes of behavior and responsibilities. Procurement plays an important role especially at
Oiltanking and Skytanking, where materials are needed for the construction or expansion
of terminals as well as for technical equipment. In accordance with our formal procurement
guidelines, staff is obliged to promote fair and transparent competition, avoid any kind of
personal obligations to vendors, act honestly, and report all forms of malpractice to their
supervisors and/or the company management. Our standards are asserted by imposing sanctions on suppliers who violate our Code of Conduct. As a further tool to ensure fair competition,
an international procurement and contracting training program has been carried out with
the relevant employees for many years.

Legal Compliance
G4-DMA,
G4-EN29,
G4-EN34,
G4-SO8,
G4-PR9

We see compliance with the law as a matter of course. Both national and international laws and
regulations are important in this connection. Legal developments are monitored and reviewed
for their relevance for Marquard & Bahls. One important indicator of regulatory compliance
is the number of fines and penalties, with fines over 1,000 euros defined as material. In 2015,
we were fined a worldwide total of 175,728 euros (2014: 308,906 euros) for non-compliance
with laws and regulations. Eight cases, which accounted for 99 percent of the fines, were in
connection with environmental infringements. Of this, 168,358 euros were from a single lawsuit
against UBT by three local environmental organizations, who complained that coal and petcoke
were spilled into the Mississippi during loading and unloading. UBT has invested over 64 million

43 %

euros in recent years to improve the environmental standards of the plant acquired in 2012 and

reduction
in fines

reduce the release of coal and petcoke. UBT continues to work on reducing its environmental
impact.
So in 2015 we did not reach the interim target of reducing the fines compared to the base year
of 2011 (18,100 euros), but we were able to reduce fines by 43 percent fines year-on-year. Our
new target for the coming year is to reduce fines by half.
The products traded, transported, handled, and stored by our group are subject to national and
international or European legislation, and must therefore comply with hazard communication
provisions, including accurate product labeling and the provision of safety data sheets at
Mabanaft. Most of the products traded by Mabanaft are classified as hazardous and are therefore subject to strict product information requirements. In addition, Oiltanking maintains a central
database for product information, which now contains data for more than 1,000 products.

Sustainability Report 2015

Anti-Corruption
Marquard & Bahls does not tolerate corruption and bribery. In our Code of Conduct, we
inform employees about our principles in this matter and call on them to report specific cases
of – or concerns about – possible corruption to our Code of Conduct team. To further increase

G4-DMA,
G4-SO3,
G4-SO4

our employees’ awareness of corruption, we have carried out customized training programs for
years.
To preclude corruption from the outset, we subject our sites to an annual risk analysis in
accordance with the classifications of the Transparency International Corruption Perception
Index. In countries with a high risk of corruption, we are stepping up our activities against
corruption, although our revenues are largely generated in low-risk countries. In 2015, no cases
of corruption were reported or revealed beyond the whistleblowing cases described earlier.

Transparency
The comprehensive disclosure of relevant information to our employees and other stakeholders is a high priority. At group level, this task is the responsibility of our HSSE and Corporate
Communication departments, in close coordination with the Executive Board and the respective
Directors or Managing Directors. New developments and important company information are
regularly communicated through the “Logbook,” a monthly newsletter for employees, as well
as emailings and notices posted on our bulletin boards. Beyond this, we communicate with
our employees through in-house magazines like COMPASS (Marquard & Bahls), connections
(Oiltanking), Skytanking Life (Skytanking), and OIL! INSIDE (OIL! Tankstellen), and on digital
employee portals. Press releases and other publications can be found on the company websites
that are also accessible to external users.
Another important area where transparency represents a basic principle is privacy and data
protection. At Marquard & Bahls, this topic is the responsibility of the HSSE department. Important measures in Germany in this area include providing an extensive Data Protection Manual,
and carrying out staff training, topical consultation and audits. In addition, the latest legislative initiatives are continually monitored to ensure present and future compliance with data
protection laws.
At an international level, the data protection laws of all countries where Marquard & Bahls is
active are analyzed. Extensive IT security systems ensure high-grade protection of employee,
customer, supplier, and other business data.

Sustainability Management
G4-34,
G4-DMA

We are aware of the potential impact of our business activities on people and the environment,
and therefore try to integrate the principle of sustainable development in all our activities and
to promote the welfare of our employees, the environment, and the surrounding communities.
Our sustainability management focuses on Health, Safety, Security & Environment (HSSE),
and is therefore based on the activities coordinated by the HSSE department. All of the larger
Marquard & Bahls companies, especially Oiltanking and Skytanking, have a designated local
HSSE manager to supervise all HSSE-related topics and questions. A separate Sustainability
team within the HSSE department pools all related activities and further develops them in close
coordination with local HSSE managers.

we survey our stakeholders about what issues are important to them. In a materiality analysis,
we periodically evaluate the significance of the aspects identified with our own assessment of
their importance, in order to determine the issues we focus on. Apart from identifying significant
expectations and requirements, the future opportunities and risks for our business and the
affected stakeholders are an important focus.

138 of our 320 randomly selected stakeholders participated in the anonymous online survey,
representing a response rate of 43 percent. Stakeholders of Oiltanking, Mabanaft and
Marquard & Bahls were most strongly represented, with close to 30 percent each. Most of the
participants came from Germany and Europe, followed by Asia Pacific with nearly 17 percent and
Latin America with just over 7 percent. Over half of the respondents were employees, followed
by business partners at around 19 percent, and customers at just under 14 percent. Other
stakeholders were only represented to a very minor extent.
The results of the survey are presented in our materiality matrix (Fig. 8). As all issues identified
as being of particular significance are on average within the range of “relatively important” to
“very important” – no issue was rated as unimportant – the x- and y-axes are shown adjusted.
The survey results will be incorporated into our ongoing strategy process. In the years ahead,
other qualitatively surveyed data will be added into the analysis. Our goal is to carry out a new
online stakeholder survey in 2017.
In 2015, the company reevaluated the materiality of the listed sustainability topics and updated
its materiality analysis. In a next step, we checked the topics we had identified against the GRI
G4 aspects, and created a selection of the indicators that are material for us and thus to be
included in the reporting.

Sustainability Issues
G4-19

From the materiality analysis, we derived six overarching action areas that are crucial to
our success as a company in the fields of energy supply, trading and logistics:

Responsible Corporate Governance
We preserve our corporate culture and take responsibility for our actions.
We are transparent to all our stakeholders and committed to fair competition.
We work towards ruling out corruption and bribery from the outset.

Sustainable Growth
We believe in controlled growth and long-term partnerships. We safeguard
our long-term success with a healthy mix of risks across the business areas,
without neglecting ecological and social aspects. We strive to steadily improve
our services and offer the highest-quality products and services.

32

Marquard & Bahls

/

Sustainability Report 2015

Environmental Protection
We always strive to prevent product releases, minimize our environmental footprint, and use resources efficiently. At the same time, we aim to reduce our
relative energy and water consumption, reduce our greenhouse gas emissions
and further optimize our waste and wastewater management.

Occupational Health & Safety
We give priority to health & safety, identify potential risks and take measures to
monitor, limit and prevent hazards. We promote a proactive safety culture, and
optimize all subsidiaries’ activities with regard to technical, organizational and
behavioral safety.

Our Employees
We promote equal opportunities and diversity, and invest in the professional
development of our employees. We want to attract skilled and talented employees
and keep them in the company long-term.

Corporate Citizenship
We also take responsibility beyond our core business, and support the
surrounding communities in our five focus areas of environment, education,
health, culture & sports, and humanitarian aid. We encourage and support our
employees in their volunteer work.

In the further strategy process, we will derive targets and measures in the defined action areas
and develop programs from them to continuously improve our sustainability performance in the
areas that are material for us.

Strategy & Sustainability

33

Other Instruments & Measures
G4-14

We use various instruments and measures to anchor the aforementioned action areas in our
global activities.

> HSSE Policy
To firmly establish responsibility for environmental and social concerns at the highest level, the
relevant principles are reflected in our HSSE Policy, which was ratified by the Marquard & Bahls
Executive Board. The managements of all subsidiaries worldwide have also signed corresponding corporate HSSE policies and displayed them on the premises.

> Guidelines and Standards
We develop our internal policies and standards based on internationally recognized principles
of responsible entrepreneurship. The basis for this is our Code of Conduct, which is binding for
all employees. Furthermore, we respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the eight
core labor standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO). We will further embed the
ten principles of the UN Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises as
well as the principles of the German Corporate Governance Code in our processes, even if we
are not yet an active signatory. Since 2011, we have reported in accordance with the guidelines
of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), which have become established internationally as the
standard for sustainability reporting. In 2015, we also issued a Declaration of Conformity in
accordance with the German Sustainability Code (DNK).

> Audits
We use internal HSSE audits to continually improve our performance and review our progress in
the areas of Health, Safety, Security & Environment. On behalf of the Executive Board, the HSSE
department monitors Oiltanking, Skytanking and UBT locations worldwide for their compliance
with company standards. In 2015, Oiltanking and Skytanking, underwent a total of 62 internal
and 262 external audits – the latter included audits by authorities, customers, and insurance
companies.

> Key Performance Indicators
Key performance indicators (KPIs) are another tool used to audit and improve the system.
Detailed HSSE statistics with “leading” (forward-looking) and “lagging” (retrospective) indicators
are prepared for the group and for many units. Furthermore, indicators such as near misses,
accident rate, and product spills are a bonus-related element of management remuneration at
Oiltanking.

> Certified Management Systems
In 2015, a total of 42 of the 73 operative Oiltanking locations worldwide (58 percent) have been
certified for quality management (ISO 9001), 18 locations (25 percent) for environmental management (ISO 14001), and 20 locations (27 percent) for health and safety management (OHSAS
18001). In total 17 locations and our Indian subsidiary IOT Infrastructure & Energy Services Ltd.
have triple certification. The remaining locations have not had any of their quality, environmental
or occupational health and safety management systems certified. At Skytanking too, seven of the
48 locations have now been certified in accordance with ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 (15 percent);
five of these have also had their management systems certified to OHSAS 18001. These
management systems have been developed to continuously increase the effectiveness and
efficiency of the business processes. Several other Marquard & Bahls companies have organized
their management processes in a very similar way.

Involvement in Associations & Politics
G4-16

In the work done by our Hamburg-based Public Affairs department, we use existing networks to
campaign for the development and implementation of industry-wide sustainability standards in
various national and international associations and organizations. They include:

FPe > Förderkreis Preiswert-Energie e.V.
(Society for the Promotion of Inexpensive Energy)

The Public Affairs department therefore focuses on association work and energy policy. In this

G4-16

connection, we actively participate in debates with decision makers, and work closely with the
relevant associations. Furthermore, the department communicates the role of oil as an energy
source, and the position of small and medium-sized oil companies, to the outside. There is a
particularly great need for information about oil logistics, which is met among other things by
organizing visits to tank terminals for representatives from government and ministries. The
implementation of the EU Energy Efficiency Directive into German law – and the resulting
obligations for our company to establish management systems for energy efficiency or carry out
audits – was an important topic also in 2015. In addition to the office in Hamburg, Marquard &
Bahls maintains a representative office in Berlin.

Sustainability Targets
To better assess current and future challenges and risks and identify opportunities, the process
of analyzing our value chain was continued in 2015. The following table gives a detailed overview
of our targets for the strategic issues in our sustainability activities, including information about
the current level of target achievement.

Management for Long-term Success
To achieve long-term success and controlled growth, we rely on a healthy
mix of risk between the divisions. While they act as independent business
units, they are strategically linked.
G4-DMA

We publish our key financials in our Annual Report, which is available in both German and
English. By additionally publishing economic indicators in accordance with GRI requirements in
this document, we present a comprehensive picture of Marquard & Bahls’ contribution to the
sustainability of a larger economic system. We pay taxes, create jobs, and invest in infrastructure
in Hamburg and many other places around the world.

Financial Performance
We continued our successful development during the past year, made significant investments,
and expanded our core business areas. Our success stands on solid pillars: competent and
dynamic employees, loyal customers and business partners, a market environment that offers
us many opportunities for our business activities, and a sound financial structure. In addition,
we have a balanced risk mix between long-term investment – mainly the tank terminal business
– and the more short-term oriented trading business.
Mabanaft returned to profitability, ending the year with a strong result despite a highly
competitive market. In addition to the companies in Germany and the U.K., the end-user sector
was particularly successful. The bunker business also showed a positive overall development.
Oiltanking had a very successful year. In addition to new sites in Brazil, Finland and Mozambique,
projects were launched in Singapore and South Africa among other places. The sale of minority
shareholdings in two tank terminals in the Benelux region led to a further strengthening of
equity. The Indian EPC business, where restructuring is taking longer than expected, did not meet
expectations.
Skytanking ended the year with a significantly better result year-on-year. In spring 2015, the
company acquired a majority stake in the tank terminal and hydrant facilities at Brussels Airport,
strengthening its position locally. In India, one of the fastest-growing markets worldwide,
business developed promisingly and was expanded by another four sites.
United Bulk Terminals labored under the difficulties seen worldwide in the coal market.
The hoped-for market recovery of U.S. coal exports failed to materialize and the business in
Davant remains tense. However, transshipment volume of petcoke developed positively. After a
thorough analysis, its management structure and infrastructure are currently being optimized
and costs further reduced.
The business of Newsco remained difficult even after its successful organizational realignment,
due to the sharp fall in the price of crude oil. Positive impetus came solely from the Rocky
Mountains, where Newsco managed to grow against the trend; at all other locations in

42

Marquard & Bahls

/

Sustainability Report 2015

North America, drilling activity was drastically reduced. This led to a loss at year-end. Further
cost-reduction programs were initiated.
In the renewable energy business, increasing market concentration and tight regulation impeded
activities in Germany. Mabagas therefore divested from its biogas activities in Germany, but
remains active in India. The emissions trading business of Carbonbay performed well, selling
its first few UN Gold Standard certificates. Amongst these were certificates from the Mabagas
biogas plant in Namakkal.
GMA also had a good year. As in previous years, in 2015 natGAS successfully pursued its growth
path. The provider of gas and electricity services and supplies expanded its market position in
Germany and Europe, while continuously developing its portfolio management solutions for
corporate customers in the industrial and energy sector.

Risk Management
G4-2

One of the greatest challenges as we pursue our strategy of controlled, long-term growth is
to limit the manifold financial, operational and HSSE risks. That is why we work based on a
permanent and thorough risk management scheme that individually rates all risks and defines
tailor-made mandates, tasks, and responsibilities. To further ensure a healthy mix of risk, all
risks – including social and environmental ones – are evaluated in the context of the entire
group of companies. We take a decentralized approach whereby risks are broken out to the
individual companies and responsibility is assigned at divisional level. The principal risks that
may affect future business performance include:

>
>
>
>
>
>
>

Currency turbulences
Another international financial crisis flare-up and/or sustained economic downturn
Political conflict in oil-producing countries and the resultant tensions in oil
Rising prices for natural resources and purchased energy
Environmental and natural disasters as well as effects of the climate change
Higher risks in countries we are active in
Unreasonably stricter environmental laws

> Trading Risks
For Mabanaft, the relevant trading risks are those caused by the high level of volatility in
commodity prices, currency exchange rates, and interest rates. In 2015, for instance, the oil
market was characterized by a crude oil surplus that resulted in an extreme price collapse,
which in turn led to increased demand and greater volatility, from which Mabanaft was able
to profit based on its strict risk management. Trading risks are hedged by the systematic use
of financial instruments such as derivatives and forward transactions. Mabanaft protects itself
against bad debt through credit insurance, banking securities, and the settlement of commodity
futures transactions via segregated brokerage accounts. Our controlling ensures that the rules
laid down are adhered to.

> HSSE Risks
The main risks to which the storage logistics and aviation fuelling businesses as well as the
service station and end-consumer businesses are exposed stand in connection with the
handling of flammable, environmentally hazardous and sometimes toxic products. Prevention
of any hazards resulting from this, such as accident, leakage and fire hazards, is therefore a
special focus of risk management at Marquard & Bahls. This falls within the remit of the HSSE
department. Based on detailed regulations, site-specific operating instructions for which regular
training is carried out, clear communications, and detailed reporting, the HSSE teams ensure a
proactive safety culture to avoid HSSE hazards. The central HSSE team therefore works closely
with the local HSSE managers.

Marquard & Bahls

Sustainability Report 2015

Synergies
Good cooperation – especially between the individual companies – and the leveraging of
synergies while maintaining an adequate segregation of duties between the different lines
of businesses are very important for our business success. The combination of its different
lines of business makes Marquard & Bahls what it is – more than the sum of its divisions. This
aspect is one of five priorities in our business strategy. The Corporate Development department
substantially carries out the strategic planning process, leverages synergies and provides
soundly researched support to the Executive Board in making decisions about new business
opportunities.

Supplier Relations
We treat our suppliers with respect, maintain an honest relationship with everyone involved
in the business processes, and strive to establish a long-term cooperative partnership. For us,
this means not only acting responsibly on our own premises, but along the entire supply chain.
The diversity of our businesses is reflected in the spectrum of our suppliers, which range from
vendors of technical equipment for our tank terminals to office equipment suppliers. Internal
supplier lists increase transparency regarding the quality and performance of our business
partners, with the ultimate goal of giving our customers excellent services and products. At our
sites we also place great importance on safe working procedures for employees from third-party
contractors. Measures currently employed range from HSSE guidelines and detailed work
instructions to safety briefings at our sites. An integrated contractor management program was
developed for Oiltanking in 2014, which is described in detail in the “Health & Safety” section.

Customer Satisfaction
Building long-term cooperative partnerships with our customers is one of our key strategic
priorities. Our employees play a central role in ensuring the satisfaction of our customers.
Responsible and dedicated teams guarantee excellent services, which in turn lead to customer
loyalty. We therefore feel it is important that our employees can make decisions autonomously,
enabling them to respond flexibly to customer requests. This belief is deeply rooted in our
philosophy.

Management for
Environmental Protection
Our activities impact the environment both directly and indirectly. Our sites
use energy, water, various raw materials and building materials, and generate
airborne emissions, waste and wastewater. In addition, the storage and
transportation of petroleum products and chemicals carry a risk of spillage.
G4-2,
G4-14,
G4-DMA

We are committed to minimizing our environmental footprint. Environmental issues are therefore an integral part of the HSSE management system across Marquard & Bahls. According to
the HSSE Policy signed by the Marquard & Bahls Executive Board and the management of all
subsidiaries worldwide, we are committed to making efficient use of energy and resources, avoiding pollution, and promoting the environmental awareness of employees in order to minimize
harmful effects. By increasing the number of staff at the corporate HSSE department, the number
of internal HSSE audits has been increased worldwide. This permits a faster implementation of
company standards, which in many areas are well above statutory requirements, at new sites
as well. At Oiltanking, we have for many years recorded the amount of energy and water used,
the frequency of product releases and their volume, as well as the waste produced, and have
established appropriate indicators for each of these. In recent years, we have included these
indicators in our other subsidiaries’ reporting as well.

Spill Prevention
> Spills
G4-EN24

Preventing spills is a challenge for any company that handles petroleum, gas and chemical
products. Modern facilities and efficient workflows, combined with preventive maintenance
programs, serve to minimize the risk of spills. In 2015, the number of incidents involving more
than 100 liters of product released per million tons of throughput was 0.32, a 60 percent
increase compared to the previous year (2014: 0.20). Across the group, despite all our efforts,
there were 60 – mostly minor – product releases of more than 100 liters.

The total volume of product released on our collective premises increased from 229 m³ in

G4-EN24

2014 to 371 m³ in 2015, of which 279 m³ of product could not be recovered. The rise is mainly
due to an incident on the premises of our Tirex subsidiary in Moldova in November 2015 – a
technical defect of a railcar valve caused 254 m³ of product to be released. At our Oiltanking tank
terminals, the volume of product released was reduced from 218 m³ in 2014 to 91 m³ in 2015.
Therefore, we did not achieve our goal of reducing the product releases by another 10 percent
by 2015, but remain committed to this goal for 2016.

> Precautions in Case of Spills in Water
To ensure professional support in the event of major oil spills, Marquard & Bahls is a shareholder

G4-15

in Oil Spill Response Limited, the world’s largest oil spill response company. Oil Spill Response
Limited was founded in 1984 and is wholly owned by international oil companies. At Oiltanking,
scenario-specific contingency plans were developed for all relevant sites, and practical training
and drills were carried out. Marquard & Bahls is also an active member of the Oil Companies
International Marine Forum (OCIMF), a voluntary association of oil companies that works to
ensure a safe and ecologically responsible operation of oil tankers and tank terminals.

> Ship Charter Policy
To avoid petroleum products being transported by ships that do not meet our standards,
Mabanaft has a Ship Charter Policy that defines detailed minimum requirements for the clearance of chartered or accepted ships (C-term purchases). Its overriding goal is to ensure safe
transport of the products at all times, and strict adherence to the changing requirements and
rules of international tanker shipping – e.g. the requirements of the International Maritime
Organization (IMO). The policy includes evaluations of the flag state organizations. To enable a
quick and up-to-date assessment of ships in accordance with this policy, we have commissioned
a customized web-based information system which has already been used for many years.

Energy Saving & Climate Protection
> Energy Consumption
G4-EN3,
G4-EN5,
G4-EN6,
G4-EN7

Marquard & Bahls uses direct and indirect energy sources to operate its facilities, sites, and
vehicles. In 2015, direct energy consumption totaled 1,117,389 gigajoules (GJ). This includes
natural gas, heating oil and fuel for the operation of our pumps, boilers, owned bunker ships,
operational vehicles, and road tankers (2014: 1,379,712 GJ). Indirect energy – mainly electricity
– is used among other things for product pumps and lighting at our tank terminals and for the
hydrant systems at our aviation fuelling sites. The computers in our offices are also constant
consumers of energy. Other indirect sources of energy that we use include district heating and,
to a lesser extent, imported steam. In 2015, indirect energy consumption totaled 851,413 GJ
(2014: 853,199 GJ), bringing the total amount of direct and indirect energy to 1,968,801 GJ (2014:
2,232,911 GJ). Due to the diversity of our group, our consumption figures are only partly comparable with those of other companies. Because of this, for purposes of comparison we show the
figures of our tank storage activities as consumption per 1 million tons of throughput. Fig. 13
shows that the megajoules (MJ) required to transship a ton of product have fallen year-on-year
to 8.4 MJ. This 8.7 percent reduction means we nearly achieved our goal of reducing our relative
energy consumption in the field of tank terminalling by 10 percent by the end of 2015. We have
set ourselves a new target of reducing it by another 10 percent (compared to 2015) by 2018.

Fig. 13: Energy consumption in tank storage activities
per throughput (MJ/t) by type

To date, only a small number of our sites buy green electricity: Eight sites and 41 OIL! service
stations reported a proportion of more than 20 percent of green energy in their energy mix.
On-site power generation takes place only in a few cases, e.g. at our tank terminal in Colombia,
where the loading rack for road tankers was equipped with solar panels, as well as at the
Mabagas biogas plant. The biogas plant in Namakkal in India is a single-stage wet fermentation
plant consisting of four fermenters with a total volume of 16,000 m³. During regular operation,
about eight million m³ (40 million kWh) of biogas can be generated per year with the existing
capacity, and then converted into electricity using two cogeneration plants of 1.2 MW (el) each.

8.7 % reduction
in relative energy
consumption at the
tank terminals

This equals the electricity needs of about 5,000 Indian households.
The total energy consumption contains the consumptions of all Marquard & Bahls subsidiaries
with the exception of natGAS and solely twelve tank terminals in India, where Oiltanking
is responsible for their operation and maintenance, but only has a limited influence on the infrastructure and processes. Furthermore, the round 220 automated service stations of Petronord
subsidiaries and 20 Skytanking locations in the U.K. are not or only partially included because in
most cases, their energy consumption cannot be measured separately as they share sites with
other owners, or the energy costs are covered in the rental agreement. In case of missing information on energy consumption, these are included as estimates. In order to show a complete
picture, we have also included all of our joint ventures.
Outside the organization, fuel is mainly used for product transports. Usually, we do not get

G4-EN4

absolute consumption figures from external service providers, but calculate the CO2 emissions
as stated in the “product transport emissions” section, based on the quantities and distances
transported.

> Reducing Energy Consumption
G4-DMA,

The most energy-consuming activity at Marquard & Bahls is the pumping that takes place at
the Oiltanking tank terminals. To detect potential savings and take measures to improve energy
efficiency, the sites can refer to a detailed Energy Saving Guideline with background information
and practical recommendations. While putting it into action at various sites, further potential
for savings was identified and general recommendations were derived also in 2015. We want
to continue advancing our goal of taking advantage of internal synergies and using knowledge
transfer to improve our consumption profile. We will continue to document our energy-saving
measures and support our subsidiaries in establishing energy-saving programs.

Local Energy-Saving Measures
>

The tank terminal in Amsterdam was able to recover 5,139,089 liters of petroleum products
with its vapor recovery plant.

>

By switching off the fuelling vehicle’s engines during aircraft fuelling and other measures,
the Italian Skytanking sites consumed about 27,000 liters less fuel in 2015.

>

By participating in the Clean Texas program, an important aspect of which is to train
employees in the careful use of energy and natural resources, Oiltanking Texas City
saved 359,651 kWh of electricity.

>

Also in 2015, the tank terminal in Varna, Bulgaria continued its energy efficiency project
and saved 38,400 kWh by converting the street lighting at the tank terminals to LED
and equipping a pump with a new frequency converter.

>

In 2015, OIL! Tankstellen continued to upgrade further service stations to LED lighting
and energy-saving cooling technology, thereby saving 211,000 kWh in total.

> Carbon Footprint and Emissions
Climate change is one of the greatest environmental challenges we face as a society. Companies
contribute to climate change by emitting greenhouse gases. In order to evaluate our own impact
on climate change, we have calculated the carbon footprint for the entire group.
In accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol), we define our carbon footprint
as the total amount of the six greenhouse gases listed in the Kyoto Protocol, measured in tons
of CO2 equivalent (CO2e), caused directly or indirectly by our company. The relevant greenhouse
gases resulting from our operations are CO2, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Other air
pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2) emitted by third-party shipping,
or volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from our tank terminals, are recorded separately.

emissions arising from the transport of fuel by third-party logistics companies, and from business trips by air. We have not included emissions generated during the production of building
materials (e.g. steel for our storage tanks), the construction of facilities, or the energy required
for waste disposal (Fig. 14), as these should be reported by the respective suppliers and service
providers.

The greenhouse gas emissions were calculated using the latest Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) emission factors and the GHG Protocol. In the case of emission factors
for electricity, the energy mix of various countries was also taken into consideration. As the
data collection and calculation of emissions from product transports turned out to be the most
difficult part, we address this topic in a separate section.
In 2015, direct and indirect CO2e emissions totaled 341,642 tons (2014: 384,305 tons),
representing a reduction of 11 percent. Scope 1 emissions decreased due to the reduced gas
consumption as the result of the sale of two major North American sites. Scope 3 emissions fell
slightly due to fewer commissioned transports in the trading sector. Our goal is to continue to
reduce our emissions as far as possible, albeit bearing our company’s growth in mind.

> Emissions Related to Product Transport
Marquard & Bahls subsidiaries use tank trucks, rail cars, barges and seagoing vessels to trans-

G4-DMA

port their products. We try to identify and use the types of transport with the least impact on
the climate and continue to place a strong focus on transportation by water, since this is the
most efficient option. We include emissions from our own fleet of ships and road tankers under
Scope 1, and emissions from service providers who transport our products under Scope 3. To
reduce emissions from our own road-tanker fleets at Petronord subsidiaries and Thomas Silvey,
our logistics policy is to invest in latest-model vehicles with energy-efficient engines and to carry
out training programs for fuel-efficient driving. At OIL! Tankstellen, road tankers from reputable
third-party companies with fuel-efficient fleets are contracted to deliver fuel to the service
stations in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.
With regard to marine transport at Mabanaft, we have included emissions from chartered

G4-EN30

vessels, but not from vessels that were chartered by third parties, as these are beyond our
scope of influence. In 2015, Mabanaft chartered 60 seagoing vessels (2014: 59), 1,873 barges
(2014: 1,462), 13,388 tank trucks (2014: 9,034), and 266 rail cars (2014: 230). When chartering
seagoing vessels, the energy efficiency of the ships is taken into account.

Fig. 18: Transport-related CO 2e emissions by mode
of transport in tons (2015)

The annual CO2e emissions arising from the transport of our products are shown in Fig. 18. To
calculate the CO2e emissions, emission factors were used wherever data on total consumption
was available. For transport using third parties, we chose the Ecological Transport Information
Tool (EcoTransIT) as the most informative and detailed procedure. The tool allows for quick
calculation based on the cargo volume and the loading and unloading ports. EcoTransIT was
developed by the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research (IFEU) in Heidelberg, the
Öko-Institut (Institute for Applied Ecology) in Berlin, and the Ingenieurgesellschaft für Verkehr
und Eisenbahntechnik (IVE mbH, a consulting company for traffic and railway engineering) in
Hannover.

> Emissions from Business Travel
Due to the international nature of our business, many of our employees travel by air. Our goal
is to plan the safest and fastest possible routes and to keep air travel to a minimum. In 2015,
G4-EN19

employees of Marquard & Bahls and its subsidiaries circumnagivated the earth 744 times by
airplane (2014: 892 times).

G4-33,
G4-EN13,
G4-EN30

CO2 emissions from air travel were calculated by Atmosfair gGmbH based on data provided
by Marquard & Bahls. This comprehensive method takes into account the effects of different
air pollutants at high altitudes, as well as the aircraft, engine types, and booking class. In 2015,
group-wide emissions from air travel amounted to 9,886 tons of CO2e (2014: 10,958). This is a
reduction of 9.8 percent compared to 2014.

Sustainability Report 2015

We have not generally included company cars in our calculations, as they are mainly used
privately. Only the company cars used by OIL! Tankstellen field staff are included in Scope 1, as
these are used primarily for business purposes. The vast majority of our employees use public
transport or private cars for their commute. Another measure to reduce travel-related CO2e
emissions is the increased use of video-conferencing systems. This is being taken into account
in the construction of the new Marquard & Bahls headquarters.

> Other Emissions
Aside from volatile organic compounds (VOCs), our activities do not cause significant emissions

G4-EN20

of nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides or ozone-depleting substances, which are mainly emitted
upstream in the value chain during cooling or flaring processes. VOCs at our tank terminals
are mainly produced through evaporations from tanks (tank breathing) and during loading and
unloading. VOC emissions should be minimized because of their adverse effects on health and
the environment. For this reason, internal floating roofs have been installed on the vast majority
of tanks containing volatile products. The floating roofs prevent evaporation by covering the
surface of the liquid. Other techniques used by Oiltanking to reduce emissions are vapor
balancing, vapor treatment, and vapor recovery systems, which have been installed at many
sites.
The emission of VOCs is currently calculated at 22 Oiltanking sites and in 2015 showed a
year-on-year decrease to a total of 1,503 tons (2014: 2,074 tons). The data is based on complex
calculations, as the emissions are highly dependent on various factors such as the vapor
pressure of the product, the size, paint, and insulation of tanks, the average ambient temperature, and the efficiency of the vapor recovery system. A special infrared gas detection camera
has been purchased by the central HSSE department, and can be used by the European tank
terminals to detect escaping VOCs. In this way, even the smallest gas leaks can be identified and
repaired, further minimizing emissions.
Ships are often the most environmentally friendly mode of transport. Nevertheless, since

G4-EN21

ships often use sulfurous bunker fuel, transport generates significant volumes of nitrogen
oxides (NOX) and sulfur oxides (SOX). NOX and SOX can significantly contribute to environmental
problems such as acidification, eutrophication (nutrient enrichment) and summer smog, and
are among the substances that are toxic for humans. In 2015, the ships we chartered emitted
2,050 tons of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) (2014: 1,618 tons) and 1,110 tons of Sulphur dioxide (SO2)
(2014: 891 tons). In addition, 114 tons of non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) (2014: 190 tons)
and 132 tons of particulate matter (PM) (2014: 82 tons) were emitted during the marine transport of products. These figures are based on the IFEU Ecotransit method, which was also used
to calculate the CO2e emissions caused by third-party transport.

> Climate Initiatives
B.W.O.C.
G4-EN27

We are aware that petroleum products can have a negative impact on the environment, and
therefore work to develop alternatives and to improve energy efficiency. We have introduced an
option for customers who are willing to contribute to the protection of the environment through
carbon capture. Our subsidiary B.W.O.C. has set up a program that offers customers with a fuel
card the ability to capture emissions from fuels they have purchased by making a contribution to
reforestation projects. In any case, 10 percent of the emissions bought with a B.W.O.C. fuel card
are captured in carbon capture projects, paid for by B.W.O.C. Customers can decide whether
they want to pay extra to capture an additional 40 percent or 90 percent of the CO2.
Since 2010, B.W.O.C. has reforested a total of 155 hectares of land with 200,000 trees, thereby
compensating 43,000 tons of CO2. In 2015, the B.W.O.C. project in Harperrig, which involved the
planting of 10,700 trees five years earlier, was recertified under the Woodland Carbon Code.
This recertification after five years is a new process in the Woodland Carbon Code’s certification
process, and Harperrig became the first project ever to achieve this recertification.

Initiative Pro Klima
G4-EN27

In 2008, Mabanaft, Petronord, and OIL! Tankstellen launched the Initiative Pro Klima. Its
efforts focus on three areas: offering energy-efficient products; providing consultation
on environmental and energy issues; and promoting projects to protect the climate. Its
projects concentrate on two activities – climate research and reforestation. In collaboration
with the Schleswig-Holstein State Forestry and the Schutzgemeinschaft Deutscher Wald e. V.
(German Forest Protection Association), more than 142,000 trees have already been planted
in recent years. Besides producing oxygen and capturing CO2, forests improve the water

and animals. The sustainable cultivation of the areas is ensured by the German Federal
Forest Act and by participation in the leading forest certification systems of the Program for
Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes (PEFC) and the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC).

> Renewable Energy
Biogas
Mabagas’ business objective is to realize biogas projects to produce energy from organic
waste and residual substances. The German market for organic waste fermentation and biogas
production did not develop as expected in 2015. In particular, stricter laws for agricultural use
of the fertilizer that arises as a byproduct during biogas production led to unexpected expenses
in operating the waste-biogas plant in Bardowick, Lower Saxony. Against this background, the
growth strategy for Germany could not be executed as planned. As a result, Mabagas sold its
biogas plant in Bardowick in October 2015, thus withdrawing from the German biogas market.
The company will continue to operate the biogas plant in Namakkal, Tamil Nadu, India. This plant
only uses organic waste material such as dry poultry manure and agricultural waste. The fermentation residues produced in the process are separated, dried in the sun and then marketed as
fertilizer under the brand AYSWARYAM.

Biofuels
In Germany, the introduction of Bio-CNG is being advanced at selected service stations. The
Bio-CNG is made from 100 percent residual and waste materials and was available at eleven
service stations, thereof ten OIL! stations, in 2015.

Wood Pellets
The Mabanaft Deutschland and Petronord portfolio includes wood pellets. Burning wood for
energy is CO2-neutral and therefore has less impact on climate change than fossil fuels, as it
only emits the CO2 that was previously stored in the tree. Also, small amounts of emissions
are caused by its production and transport. The offered products meet the highest quality
standards of their respective sales markets, such as DINplus/ENplus certification.

Carbon Trading
Mabanaft’s portfolio of carbon-offsetting projects, developed as part of emissions trading, was
pooled in the newly founded Carbonbay at the end of 2013. The portfolio currently includes
19 programs with 49 individual projects in ten countries around the world, including Honduras,
Peru, Brazil, Costa Rica, Tanzania, India and Vietnam. CO2 emissions from unavoidable air
travel by Marquard & Bahls employees totaled 1,221 tons in 2015, which we offset for the
first time using Gold Standard Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) from the Los Santos wind

Water is a precious resource. Essentially, our activities do not require a high level of water
consumption. At our tank terminals, we use fresh water for cleaning tanks, hydrostatic tank
testing, heating products, and the sanitary facilities in the offices. In 2015, the group’s water
consumption totaled 800,432 m³ (2014: 788,649 m³), which corresponds to a year-on-year

In 2015, the relative water consumption per m³ of storage capacity (Fig. 19) for our tank
terminalling activities was 22.1 l/m³, an increase of 30.8 percent compared to the previous year
(16.9 l/m³). The reason for this is an increase in industrial water due to the hydrostatic testing
of new tanks at some tank terminals. While this does not lead to further pollution, as the water
can still be reused as industrial water after completion of the test, unfortunately it prevented

60

Marquard & Bahls

/

Sustainability Report 2015

a continuation of the steady reduction in relative water consumption over the past few years.
Industrial water continues to represent the largest share of water consumption (43 percent).
We maintain our goal of reducing water consumption in the future, and have integrated water management into Oiltanking’s Energy Saving Program. Areas where water consumption
can be minimized include tank cleaning, vapor production in boiler operations, and sanitary
facilities. We are also examining the possibility of replacing the drinking water currently used for
industrial activities with rainwater, and recycling our cleaning or cooling water. At OIL! Tankstellen
service stations, older car-washing facilities – usually owned by the station operator – are

successively being replaced by water-saving models. The following section on “Waste & Wastewater
Management” contains information about the disposal of wastewater.

Rainwater Utilization
A water retention basin at the IOT construction
site in Raipur ensures the water supply even
during the dry season

Skytanking in Bangalore was able to significantly reduce its drinking water consumption by
capturing and using rainwater in a water retention basin. The EPC division of IOT has also
used collected rainwater in recent years to ensure water during the dry season as well as to
save precious drinking water at its construction site in Raipur, Chhattisgarh.

Waste & Wastewater Management
We encourage our employees around the world to produce as little waste and wastewater as
possible. Our basic principle of waste and wastewater management is based on the “4 Rs”:
reduce, reuse, recycle and recover.

In 2015, the total waste generated by the group came to 39,761 tons. Compared to the
previous year (2014: 39,462 tons), this is a 0.8-percent increase (Fig. 20). Total waste in 2015

An increase was also seen in the ratio of hazardous waste in the ratio of total storage capacity
in our tank storage activities, from 2014 (0.69 kg/m³) to 2015 (0.98 kg/m³). This increase is
explained by the fact that the tank cleaning described above primarily affects the amount of
hazardous waste generated. The number of tank cleanings can vary widely from year to year,
which is reflected in fluctuating annual values.

> Handling and Disposal of Waste
We record industrial waste (e.g. metals, packaging) as well as hazardous waste (e.g. product
remnants, separator residues), which requires special treatment and must be disposed of separately. Most of the hazardous waste at our plants consists of contaminated water from oil-water
separators, and residues from tank cleaning. It is collected and processed by us or by licensed

> Wastewater Production
The total amount of industrial wastewater discharged in 2015 was 589,549 m³ (2014: 474,022 m³).

G4-EN22

Like the increase in water consumption, this increase is due to the greater number of
hydrostatic tests performed on new tanks and pipelines at some tank terminals, as well as
tank cleanings. This figure includes the rainwater collected from the tank pits, so there are
meteorological fluctuations. Residues from wastewater processing are classified as hazardous
waste, and are pumped out by vacuum trucks, treated by external companies, and usually
recycled.
At our dry bulk terminal in Davant, where coal and petcoke is stored, large quantities of rainwater are collected and discharged into public drainage channels after their pH is automatically monitored, and improved as needed. These quantities of water are not included in our
statistics.

> Wastewater Treatment and Disposal
All of our service stations and approx. 75 percent of our tank terminals use oil-water separators

G4-DMA

or complex wastewater treatment systems to process wastewater. Samples are regularly
taken to monitor the functioning of the wastewater systems and to ensure that safety values are
adhered to. At some tank terminals, gravity oil-water separators are combined with coalescing
filters, skimmers, activated charcoal filters, or strippers to fulfill all requirements. After treatment
and testing, the water at Oiltanking is mostly disposed of in the surface water, and discharged
into the public sewage system at OIL! Tankstellen.

Biodiversity
Biodiversity – or biological diversity – encompasses the diversity of species as well as genetic
diversity and the diversity of ecosystems. Humankind threatens biodiversity in a variety of ways.

G4-DMA,
G4-EN11

Habitat destruction, over-exploitation, introduction of alien species, and climate change are just
some of the reasons for the decline in the diversity of species and genes. Industrial usage can
also inﬂuence or diminish biodiversity in many ways. In our core business, we potentially impact
it mainly through the construction of new tank terminals.
Our HSSE management system requires a site-specific environmental assessment before the
start of construction of new tank terminals or major expansions. The environmental impact
assessments, which are required by law in most countries, include a thorough assessment of the
direct and indirect impact on biodiversity. As a preventive measure, the groundwater is checked
monthly with corresponding measurement technology at all relevant Oiltanking tank terminals.
The data obtained in this way is analyzed centrally by environmental experts.
We currently have no operations in regions designated as protected areas by the International
Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

the foundation of our success and our corporate culture. We want to offer
them a working environment in which they feel valued, supported and fairly
treated.
G4-10,
G4-DMA

We also take a long-term view when it comes to our employees. And so, on the one hand, our HR
work includes the careful selection of suitable candidates and the continuous development and
training of our employees and managers. On the other hand, the wellbeing of our employees and
contractors is a top priority. We address this topic in the “Health & Safety” section.
Given our company’s strong growth in recent years, forward-looking, active human resources
(HR) work plays an important role. Ten years ago Marquard & Bahls employed about

230 %

2,600 people worldwide; in 2015, it employed more than 8,600 people. This exponential growth

more employees
since 2005

in headcount has made processes more complex.
The overarching goal of the HR department is to partner with the operating companies as well as
the departments of our holding company to deliver efficient solutions that give our employees
the framework for best contributing to the success of the company. Roles and responsibilities
are divided between the regional and the three central HR teams. In 2015, the HR Processes &
Systems team continued to roll out the global Talent Management System (peopleWeb). The
system allows for a more effective and efficient production of complex analyses of the global
workforce, which among other things serve as a decision-making tool for strategic development.

> Headcount
In 2015 – including employees from all non-consolidated and affiliated companies – Marquard &
Bahls employed 8,668 people at year-end, and 8,417 employees on average (2014: 8,809).

> Employee Turnover
G4-LA1

In accordance with the requirements of the GRI, we define the turnover rate as the number of
employees who left the company voluntarily, were dismissed, or retired, in proportion to the
average number of employees during the reporting period.
Employee turnover needs to be seen in context. In view of retirement or other changes in
employees’ personal lives, it is easy to see fluctuation as a natural process to a certain extent.
The key is to achieve a balance of continuity and change. As a tradition-conscious family-owned

+2,070
-1,748

business we greatly value continuity and long-term relationships. This fact is also reflected in
our efforts to retain our employees long-term whenever possible. Continuous education and
training has therefore been an integral part of our HR work for many years. We use various HR

Employee
turnover

management tools for this. The growth of recent years and natural fluctuations also require a
systematic recruitment of new employees from the labor market.
In 2015, 1,748 employees left the company, representing a turnover rate of 20.8 percent (2014:
15.6 percent). 2,070 employees were hired during 2015. Broken down by company (Fig. 23), in
2015 the highest turnover was again seen at Newsco (43.6 percent), which is due to the high

In regional terms (Fig. 24), Europe had the highest turnover rate in 2015. As in previous years,
the main driver of employee churn in Europe is the service station segment in Moldova, which
is subject to high fluctuation and special labor regulations. In India the high churn rate was due
to restructuring in the EPC sector.

> Employee satisfaction
Local-level assessments and surveys are performed to regularly review employee satisfaction.

G4-LA6

In 2015, many of our sites conducted employee surveys on paper, electronically, or via formal
staff talks. We encourage all companies to carry out employee surveys as they are a good tool
for measuring job satisfaction.
Some employees used the Stakeholder Survey on Sustainability Issues to give general feedback
about the company. We see this as a sign for the need to introduce a tool that gives employees
a way to provide fast, easy and anonymous feedback to the company, in addition to established
channels such as the reporting/whistleblowing system for non-compliance with the Code of
Conduct. Therefore, our goal is to introduce appropriate instruments, such as a feedback box,
in 2016.

> Absentee Rate
The absentee rate reflects the days of absence in proportion to the absolute number of days staff
should have worked. For 2015, the overall absentee rate was 1.6 percent (2014: 1.9 percent),
a slight decrease vs. 2014. Since we regard this value as an indicator of our employees’ health
and satisfaction, we will continue to monitor it closely and derive measures, if necessary.

Education & Training
G4-2,
G4-DMA,
G4-LA10

The education and training of our employees is an important pillar of our success. Due to demographic change and our company’s rapid growth, it is becoming more and more challenging to
find qualified staff. To ensure that the right people are available at the right places at the right
time, promoting the expertise and talent of our employees is a high priority. Therefore our aim
is to further expand and systematize our advanced training programs.

> Staff Development
We see it as our responsibility to support and advise our employees in their development, and
address their individual needs with on-the-job training, external training, and coaching. Our
supervisors are offered group-wide management development programs. Here, knowledge
exchange and networking at group level as well as change management are priorities. More
than 80 one-on-one interviews with senior executives since 2014, followed by detailed
feedback, formed the basis for designing new leadership programs. In 2015, the programs for
senior management and First Line Leaders designed in the previous year were rolled out. In
total, 79 leaders participated in the three different programs – GMC, GLUE und PILOT.

>

GMC: 15 participants completed three modules in a single group
The GMC program is aimed at members of the Group Management Committee.

>

GLUE: 35 participants completed two modules in two groups
The management level below the GMC across the group participates in the GLUE program.

>

PILOT: 29 participants completed four modules in a single group
PILOT is for executives worldwide who have responsibility for employees and whose
duties go beyond a local role or who are new to a management position (First Line Leaders).

All three programs include an introduction to management tools for strategic orientation,
organizational development and change management; exercises to deepen a common understanding of leadership and values; and measures to support a feedback culture.

> Young Talent
Our company has three different forms of training young talent: The classic dual-training
program is aimed at school leavers who subsequently want to join the profession directly as
office professionals in office management, wholesale and foreign trade, or as port logistics
specialists.

The dual-study degree program offers high-school graduates the opportunity to pursue a
degree in industrial engineering and business administration while also getting to know our
company in detail. In Germany we offer dual-study degree programs in Business Administration
and Industrial Engineering in cooperation with the Nordakademie in Elmshorn and, since 2014,
with the Hamburg School of Business Administration (HSBA) as well. Students receive a sound
education in alternating theoretical and practical phases.
Our international, centrally coordinated trainee program represents the third pillar in the
recruitment and development of young talent at our company. We rolled it out in 2014 under
the name of FUEL – my FUture in Energy & Logistics. All of our divisions can be integrated in
the FUEL program – across departmental and national boundaries. The first eleven participants
started the two-year program in July 2014, five of them in Germany. In 2015, six FUEL trainees
started worldwide, two of them in Germany.
Because we want to offer all graduates of our training programs a place in our company, we

G4-LA10

provide places in accordance with our own personnel needs, rather than having a fixed quota.
During 2015, in addition to the FUEL trainees, at Marquard & Bahls there were three HSBA
students, 15 apprentices and nine Nordakademie students in Germany, and another 94 trainees
at subsidiaries, 53 of which were on a local trainee program at our subsidiary IOT (2014: eleven
Nordakademie students, 138 trainees and twelve apprentices).

staff in training

> Career-long Learnings
In addition to these tailored programs and training opportunities, we also support the professional and personal development and continuous learning of our employees by offering training
in the form of in-house and external seminars and conferences. These range from specialist
topics, to IT seminars and language lessons, to workshops on subjects such as intercultural
communication and time management.

Labor Standards
We abide by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations (UN)
protocols, protecting human rights within our sphere of influence. Compliance with the stan-

G4-11,
G4-DMA

dards of the International Labor Organization (ILO) is laid down in our Code of Conduct.
We respect employee rights and ensure our employees both freedom of association and
the right to collective bargaining. Our employees are organized in trade unions in various
countries, including Argentina, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Malta. In the event of
changes in our operations, we work closely with the relevant social partners.

Social Responsibility

71

> Working Hours
As an international company, our working hours reflect local requirements and best practices.
Most of our employees have permanent working contracts.

> Remuneration Policy
As employing the best people is one of our most fundamental interests, Marquard & Bahls
pays its staff fair remuneration as a matter of course. This remuneration practice applies to all
employees, whether they are employed full-time or on a temporary basis. We also operate in
low-wage countries such as China or India. As in other countries, we do not set any rules for
minimum wages at regional level, but our salaries are generally higher than the industry average.
We pay competitive salaries combining fixed and variable components. The Marquard &
Bahls Code of Conduct specifies that salaries shall be regulated based solely on qualifications,
performance, and other work-related factors such as responsibility, skill, and experience. Factors
such as gender, age, race, religion, marital status, or disability have no influence on salaries. In
addition to the base salary, we voluntarily offer comprehensive supplementary benefits, which
are calculated on the basis of the basic salary. These supplementary benefits are partly dependent on performance. Employees of various subsidiaries participate directly in the company’s
success through performance-based bonus payments.

> Pension Schemes
The state pension is one of the main pillars of people’s retirement arrangements, but it rarely
fully covers their financial needs in old age at this point. Our employees’ future is very important
to us, so at many subsidiaries and in many countries, we offer a voluntary, additional employerfinanced company pension.

Equal Opportunity
We see diversity as a key to success, both in our lines of business and among our employees.
We aim to further increase diversity within our company by employing both male and female
employees from many different cultures. Employees from 55 nations work for us around the
world – as in the previous year, 1.8 percent of them are people living with disabilities.

The oil and energy sector is still largely dominated by men, though more and more women are
choosing careers in our industry. In 2015, the proportion of female employees was 14.3 percent,
which represents a slight increase compared to the previous year (2014: 14.2 percent). More

All employees can anonymously report cases of discrimination, harassment or other violations
of the Code of Conduct to the Code of Conduct team at any time. In 2015, no whistleblowing
Equal
opportunity

cases were reported that related to discrimination or harassment.

Work-Life Balance
We are convinced that a good work-life balance contributes to the wellbeing and performance of
our employees. We are aware that this balance can sometimes be difficult to achieve.

> Working-time Models
To make work arrangements more flexible and promote a healthy work-life balance, in

G4-LA3

some countries various models such as part-time, working-time accounts and trust-based
working time are used in conjunction with an individual, case-by-case assessment. For example
in Germany, part-time contracts accounted for 10 percent of all working time in 2015 (2014:
15 percent). There are also working-time models to encourage employees to return to work
after parental leave. On average, a total of 47 employees at the German sites were on parental
or maternity leave in 2015 (2014: 40); 45 percent of them were men.

> Employee Assistance Program
As part of our commitment to offer employees support in various life situations, Marquard &
Bahls has signed a contract for an external Employee Assistance Program (EAP). This program
supports employees and their family members in Germany on a wide range of issues – from
work-related and emotional problems to practical and legal issues. All matters are treated in
strict compliance with privacy protection regulations.
Overall, at 11.8 percent, utilization of the employee assistance program increased compared
to 2014 (7.7 percent), and is still slightly higher than the national average of clients. The
proportion of work-related topics was 13 percent (2014: 14 percent); the remaining requests
related to personal matters. The rate of emotional topics among the work-related questions
is slightly higher than the national average of clients. We will consider this information when
planning measures for our employees. In our view the continued good response to this offer
confirms the usefulness of this support measure.

Professional Paint Job
Minor maintenance work at the
tank terminal in Panama is carried
out by local women

Some of our worldwide sites are located in regions characterized by high unemployment and
crime. To address this problem, the tank terminal in Panama launched an employment program for local women in the province of Colón in 2015. The aim of the program is to provide
a source of income for socially disadvantaged households living near the tank terminal and to
improve acceptance of the company and therefore security in the region. So far, 15 women
have been included in the program, which teaches basic maintenance such as cleaning, cutting
grass and minor paint work in a rotating working-hours model. Of course they are also trained
in HSSE issues like every other tank terminal employee.

Health & Safety
G4-14,
G4-DMA

Health and safety are important values at our company. We continually optimize all of our
subsidiaries’ activities with a view to technical, organizational and behavioral safety, and
promote a proactive safety culture. One important measure is the creation of comprehensive
HSSE manuals that are specifically tailored to the respective divisions – and based on which
the sites develop appropriate local management systems. An important tool for learning from
incidents is our global incident database. To prevent incidents and their reoccurrence, all
accidents, incidents, near misses and unsafe acts and conditions are carefully analyzed. If
necessary, this results in HSSE alerts being distributed worldwide and discussed with employees.
To monitor compliance with our internal standards, we regularly perform internal HSSE
audits, especially at Oiltanking, Skytanking and UBT. Detailed HSSE statistics with “leading”
(forward-looking) and “lagging” (retrospective) KPIs are also prepared for each Oiltanking and
Skytanking site. To promote a constructive HSSE discourse, once a year HSSE managers from
Oiltanking locations worldwide convene for a week to discuss current matters, exchange ideas
and experiences, and create synergies. Skytanking also holds international HSSE meetings as
part of its annual global management meetings.

Annual HSSE Meetings
In September, the global HSSE managers
met for a week in Antwerp to discuss
HSSE issues. A visit to the local tank terminal
was also on the agenda.

An HSSE award has been given out at Oiltanking since 2008 to honor our staff’s efforts to work
in a safe and environmentally friendly way. The indicators taken into account are accidents, fires
& explosions, product spills, product contaminations, material damages and reporting (quality,
timeliness, and near misses). Each year, one profit center receives an award for “Best HSSE
Performance,” and another is presented with the “Best HSSE Improvement” award. In 2015, the
Golden Lighthouse award for Best HSSE Performance went to Oiltanking Helios in Singapore,
and the White Lighthouse for Best Improvement to Oiltanking Terneuzen in the Netherlands.
Since 2012, Skytanking has also presented HSSE awards for Best Performance and Greatest
Improvement. In 2015, these awards went to Skytanking in Italy and Skytanking Calulo in South
Africa, respectively.

> HSSE Training
Our company HSSE Policy requires that all employees receive job-related training and tutorials.
This includes tutorials on the risks inherent in dealing with the products that are stored and
handled at our sites. New employees as well as contractors are instructed in matters of HSSE
before taking up their work. Any persons who have to perform potentially dangerous tasks
receive specific training. OIL! Tankstellen has produced a comprehensive training video that
covers all aspects of HSSE at service stations and provides practical guidelines for meeting the
requirements. The video is made available to all station partners.
At Oiltanking and Skytanking, a total of 327,871 HSSE training hours were completed in 2015
(2014: 230,880 hours). For example, at Oiltanking in 2015, each employee on the operations
side received an average of 71 hours of HSSE training (2014: 63 hours).

Oiltanking Safety Day
A useful complement to HSSE training – The tank terminal
in Cape Town organized a Safety Day for its employees, including
HSSE-related games, followed by an awards ceremony

> Workplace Accidents
G4-LA6

In 2015, across the group there were 85 accidents resulting in lost workdays that involved our
own employees (2014: 68). These accidents resulted in a total of 2,118 lost workdays (2014:
1,699). Absences due to commuting accidents or non-work-related illnesses are not included
in these figures. Another 34 accidents involved employees of contracted external companies
(2014: 35).
The relative frequency of accidents that resulted in days lost could not be further reduced last
year as in previous years, and the global average was 4.7 hours per 1 million hours worked
(2014: 3.3; Fig. 25). The rise is due to several tripping and stumbling accidents in the field of
tank storage, as well as several incidents involving absences of many days in aircraft fueling.
We will therefore once again set the goal of reducing, by year-end 2016, the relative frequency
of accidents that result in absences by 10 percent compared to 2013. To this end, we will carry
out additional intensive audits and derive specific short- and long-term measures at sites whose

We define the severity of accidents based on the average number of lost workdays per incident.
Across the group, the average severity of accidents in 2015 was 25.0 lost workdays per accident
(2014: 25.0). So the severity of workplace accidents was not reduced in 2015, but remained

static.

A good development is that the increased efforts in the area of contractor safety at Oiltanking
are showing results and the number of accidents has decreased year-on-year. These positive
development were overshadowed by two fatal accidents that occurred on construction sites of
lOT’s EPC division in India. In one case, an employee of an external company had a fatal accident
on a construction site in Cuddalore after falling from a ladder. The second accident occurred at
a construction site in Raipur, where a contractor’s employee suffered a fatal electric shock away
from his workplace when he accessed a pump shaft without authorization. We deeply regret

76

Marquard & Bahls

/

Sustainability Report 2015

these tragic accidents. To further improve safety on the construction sites of the EPC division,
the HSSE processes were critically reviewed and restructured, both centrally and locally. At IOT
head office, an additional HSSE department was established that focuses exclusively on the
EPC division. An extensive catalog of measures has also since been drawn up. With the aim of
more effectively supporting the sites in improving safety standards, the Marquard & Bahls HSSE
department has considerably expanded its global audit program. The extensive HSSE Manual
drawn up for Oiltanking was also fundamentally revised.

> Fire & Explosions
Past incidents in our industry have shown that technical measures, organizational processes,
and rules of conduct are not always sufficient to prevent fires. Oiltanking has prepared a
mandatory Fire Protection Standard consisting of 72 specifications that often go beyond legal
requirements, to ensure adequate protection against fire and its escalation.
In 2015, there were 31 small fires but again neither explosions nor deflagrations (2014: 23 fires,
0 deflagrations). So the absolute frequency of cases of fire has increased, but most of these
occurred on construction sites and not at our tank terminal operations, and remained closely
confined to the local area. Although almost all of these were very small-scale fires that were
quickly extinguished, this means we have only partially achieved our goal of preventing fires and
explosions. It goes without saying that we will continue to pursue this goal in the years ahead.

31

smaller fires
in 2015

Altogether these incidents resulted in 29,924 euros of damage (2014: 10,240 euros).

> Noise
Noise can have a negative impact on the working environment, local residents, and wildlife,
so our goal is to minimize noise production wherever possible. Potential sources of noise are
pumps, generators, and industrial vehicles. We reduce noise through better maintenance and
shielding, but also by replacing aging equipment. Apart from this, noise protection is part of the
mandatory personal protective equipment wherever speciﬁed noise limits are exceeded.

> Safety on Business Trips
Many of our employees travel frequently as part of their work for Marquard & Bahls. Travel
safety is therefore an important issue on our HSSE agenda. In order to provide the best medical
advice and services for employees on their travels, as well as for expats, Marquard & Bahls has
signed a service contract with International SOS, the leading provider of medical assistance,
international healthcare, and security services.
To support our employees in planning international business trips, there is also a group-wide
manual on travel safety and a web-based airline-vetting database that is updated daily.

Involvement in Charitable Projects
In line with our values, we strive to make a contribution to the welfare of the
communities in which we operate. We show our commitment in the form of
financial contributions and in-kind donations, as well as volunteer work by
our employees.
In 2015, a total of 438,121 euros was donated (2014: 480,465 euros). Our employees also
volunteered more than 3,939 hours (2014: 6,240 hours) of time for various initiatives and
projects – long-term projects involving employees, as well as action days and one-off donations.
Marquard & Bahls’ efforts are decentralized and are reported to the Hamburg headquarters
annually by the individual sites, as well as shared on an internal web-based knowledge-sharing
platform. An exception to this is Marquard & Bahls’ annual corporate donation to international
aid projects. An overall concept for our community involvement has been developed. It both
supports the local efforts of the sites and promotes centrally initiated projects, and will be rolled
out in the year ahead.

In a breakdown by companies, Oiltanking was once again the group’s biggest donor in 2015,
which is explained partly by the nature of its operations and its closeness to the surrounding
communities. Oiltanking also accounts for the highest number of employees in the Marquard &
Bahls group (51.2 percent), which is reflected in its 55.8 percent share of donations. At group
level, Marquard & Bahls’s corporate citizenship activities can be broken out into five fields:
environment, education, health, culture & sports and humanitarian aid projects.
Below is a cross-section of the initiatives that reflects the spectrum of different activities.

Environment
> Clean-up Actions to Mark World Environment Day
Like most Oiltanking terminals, Oiltanking in Cartagena, Colombia is located right by the sea
and recognizes marine pollution as a local problem. On World Environment Day 2015, the tank
terminal therefore organized a beach clean-up, with 20 Oiltanking employees and contractors
teaming up to clean garbage and filth from a stretch of beach in Cartagena.

> Drawing Contest and Presentations at Schools on World Water Day
World Water Day has been held on March 22 every year since 1993. It was proposed in Agenda
21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de
Janeiro, and adopted by the UN General Assembly in a resolution on December 22, 1992. Since
then it has been used to build public awareness of the critical water issues of our time. As in
recent years, Oiltanking Colombia, located in the city of Cartagena, again participated in World
Water Day and organized a drawing contest and presentations on the topic of “Water and
Sustainable Development” at two elementary schools. More than a hundred sixth-, seventh-and
eighth-grade children participated in the activities and learned the
importance of water as a resource and of using it responsibly.

> University of Hamburg Cluster of Excellence
Another aspect of our non-profit environmental efforts is our support for the Pro Klima Initiative
research project co-financed by the OIL! KlimaCard. The aim of this research project is to better
understand the impact of climate change, and derive conclusions for environmentally friendly
action. As part of the climate protection project, the OceanRAIN project (Ocean Rainfall And
Ice-phase precipitation measurement Network for surface validation) is sponsored at the
University of Hamburg’s CliSAP. The idea is to investigate the relationship between climate
change and precipitation by taking long-term measurements of precipitation on the world’s
oceans. To collect the data, a total of nine research vessels from various countries are equipped
with precipitation gauges called disdrometers. Disdrometers optically record each individual
drop of rain or each snowflake and from this separately calculate the amount of rain or snowfall per square meter. In 2015, further milestones were again achieved in the research project.
A new international collaboration allows for long-term installations in previously unexplored
waters: Since January 2015, the new German research vessel “Sonne” has been systematically
covering the entire Pacific Ocean from the tropics to mid-latitudes
with equipment co-funded by the initiative.

In keeping with tradition, in 2015 instead of giving holiday season presents Marquard & Bahls

G4-15

supported an international aid project: 100,000 euros were given to the SOS Children’s Village
in Puerto Escondido in Panama, not far from the port city of Colon, where Oiltanking has
operated a tank terminal since 2011. The SOS Children’s Village, which was completed in 2009,
provides a permanent and loving home for some 90 children who receive food, toys, clothes,
medical care and the opportunity to go to school. The holiday season donation will be used to
cover running costs in the year ahead, ensuring that the children will continue to have a home
in 2016. For its engagement, to support the running costs of a children´s village for the second
time in a row, Marquard & Bahls received a special award in 2015 – the Children’s Village Cup
in silver.

> “I Love Chemistry” Open House
On May 10, 2015, the tank terminal in Antwerp, Belgium, held an open house for visitors young
and old under the heading “I Love Chemistry”. Children and adults were invited to take a look
behind the scenes of the chemical tank terminal and gain an impression of the overall logistics
performance of the tank terminal, which is an important hub in
global product flows of chemical liquids and gases. In addition
to the tank terminal tour, chemistry-related games and activities
rounded off the open house.

> Tutoring and Creativity Lessons for Children
Poor grades or lack of motivation are often a big reason for kids to stop going to school. However, dropping out of school can have serious consequences for young people, such as poverty
and unemployment. For this reason, the tank terminal in Panama organized and sponsored a
special tutoring program with specialized teachers who support students with poor grades in
subjects like math, English and Spanish. The tank terminal also made its premises available once
a month for tutoring and creativity lessons.

Learning is Fun
The workshops were fun for the children and supported the learning process

Health
> Toilets for Indian Families
Around the world, nearly a billion people have no access to toilets – and about 600 million of them
are in India. IOT Anwesha Engineering & Construction Ltd., a subsidiary of IOT Infrastructure &
Energy Services (IOT), therefore decided to contribute to a project to improve basic sanitation in
the districts close to their headquarters. Between August and October 2015, 43 toilet stalls were
erected for Indian families in the Chhotaudepur and Vadodara districts in cooperation with the
Manav Seva Foundation. The toilets are environmentally friendly, portable and ideal for the quick
and practical implementation of such a project.

Basic Sanitation
In India, having your own toilet is not a matter of course –
43 families in the villages of Bhordali, Jetpurpavi,
Hansapura and Machhalipura now have their
own toilets thanks to the project

Culture & Sports
> Cultural Sponsorship in the Region
Oiltanking Terneuzen in the Netherlands has for many years supported cultural events in the
region to promote cultural activities in local communities. In 2015, the tank terminal supported
Harbor Days in Terneuzen, the Schelde Jazz & More Festival, and
various sailing events with a total of 7,900 euros and the participation of 20 employees. The events were attended by young and old
and enriched the cultural life of the region.

Terneuzen Harbor Days
Terneuzen’s Harbor Days are a great attraction
for children and families every year

> Ten-Mile Marathon in Aid of Cancer Research
On April 4, 2015 the “Fight against Cancer” 10 Miles & Marathon was held in Antwerp. It is the
biggest running event in Flanders, Belgium, and thousands of runners from around the world transform Antwerp into a colorful racetrack on the day. Fifty employees
from the Oiltanking tank terminals in Antwerp and Terneuzen
participated in the run to raise money for cancer research.

Almost There
50 Oiltanking employees gave their
all in the 10-mile run

> Running for the “Kinder helfen Kindern”
(Children Helping Children) Initiative

The HSH Nordbank Run in Hamburg’s new HafenCity district is an annual four-kilometer corporate
run to raise money for a good cause. For each registered runner and team, a six- and ten-euro
donation, respectively, goes to the “Kinder helfen Kindern” association. 22 employees from
Marquard & Bahls and its subsidiaries took part in the most recent run through Hamburg’s
steadily growing HafenCity on June 27, 2015. Overall, 24,386 participants ran in 852 teams, raising the record sum of 155,000 euros. The money will fund “Kinder
helfen Kindern” initiative projects to give children and teens from
low-income families the opportunity to join sports clubs. The initiative supported about 10,000 children and teenagers in 2015.

> 100-km Race for the Development Organization Oxfam
Eight IOT employees in Mumbai, India, and Hamburg participated in the Oxfam Trailwalker in
India in two teams in November 2015. The Oxfam Trailwalker is an international charity walk
hosted by the global development organization Oxfam, in which teams cover a distance of
50 kilometers in 24 hours or 100 kilometers within 48 hours. Both teams of four opted for the
100-km route over steep climbs, rocky descents into canyons, jungle trails and rocky dirt roads
that occasionally led to impassable roads. Two other IOT employees supported the teams on
the route, waiting at 10-km intervals to provide water and provisions for the walkers. Overall, the
team raised 5,871 euros for Oxfam.

Humanitarian Aid
> Hot Meals for the Homeless
According to official figures, 2,000 people in Hamburg currently live on the streets. This is a
major challenge, particularly in the cold winter months. In order to alleviate the plight of these
people, Hamburger Tafel has launched an emergency winter program to make 850 beds
available for the homeless from November 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016. They are also supplied
with free hot stews prepared by catering companies and canteens from all over Hamburg. This
time the Marquard & Bahls staff restaurant team also participated in the campaign and together
with 17 other companies supported the program with freshly prepared hot stews. In the first cooking session for the project on
December 11, 2015, the colleagues prepared 50 liters of goulash
soup.

> Time for Children with Disabilities
In April 2015, Oiltanking staff from the tank terminal in Cape Town, South Africa, visited the
Sibongile non-profit childcare facility in Khayelitsha district, which provides loving care,
therapeutic applications and a first basic education to children with cerebral movement
disorders and other severe disabilities. The institution looks after up to 20 children who
either live with their families or at one of the three Sibongile residential facilities. The Oiltanking
employees spent a day with the children during which they got to
know them, played with them and read them books.

A Gift of Time
The Sibongile center in Cape Town provides care
to as many as 20 children with disabilities, who
were happy to be visited by Oiltanking employees

> Senior Care
People who reach a certain age are often told they have entered the ”Golden Years”. However,
many seniors experience this time of life as anything but golden. Oiltanking Colombia’s “Golden
Years” CSR activity was launched to help alleviate some of the feelings of loneliness and
abandonment felt by many nursing-home residents. It involves staff visiting nursing homes to offer residents support and a change from the routine. The first such event took place just before
Christmas. 19 colleagues visited the San José nursing home in the city of Cartagena to spend
time in the company of elders who would otherwise perhaps have no visitors. Residents and
visitors alike were touched by the time spent together singing, playing games, dancing, telling
stories and sharing with them some gifts.

Listening, Symphatizing and Helping
Each Oiltanking employee cared for and looked after a resident
