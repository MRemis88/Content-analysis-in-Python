Dr Scheifele, 2016 was an eventful year for HeidelbergCement.
How will the acquisition of Italcementi, which was concluded in
July 2016, affect the company?
Dr Bernd Scheifele: The acquisition of Italcementi, a leading international cement manufacturer, has significantly expanded our market
position in North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. The two companies complement one another perfectly. On the one hand, this
is because their product areas and organisational structures are so
similar; on the other, it is due to the fact that they serve different
geographical regions that hardly overlap. This puts HeidelbergCement
into an outstanding strategic position to be successful on the market
in the long term.
Does that also apply to sustainability?
Dr Scheifele: The combined research and development capacities
will open up new business opportunities for us, particularly with regard
to sustainable construction. However, we still need to take action in
some areas to bring sustainability management up to the same high
level at all production sites. We will be working on this in the year
ahead and beyond.

In dialogue
Dr Bernd Scheifele, Chairman of the Managing Board

HeidelbergCement I Sustainability Report 2016

Another major issue besides the acquisition of Italcementi is the
fact that our company is being subjected to new stakeholder
demands. How will stakeholders influence HeidelbergCement’s
future sustainability strategy?
Dr Scheifele: Our main topics are still occupational safety and environmental protection. We can only conduct long-term business if we
offer our employees safe workplaces and take on responsibility for
the environment. Together with the cultivation of good neighbourly
relations, these are the basic preconditions for our licence to operate
as reflected in society’s acceptance of our company and its business
model.

not satisfied with the result. To permanently prevent accidents from
occurring, we will have to further intensify our occupational safety
efforts and introduce the HeidelbergCement standards at the production sites of the former Italcementi Group.
At HeidelbergCement, all levels of management are responsible for
ensuring occupational health and safety. In 2017, we will roll out a
Group-wide training initiative to once again emphasise the importance of the line managers as role models. Moreover, we will continue
to integrate Italcementi into our occupational safety network. The
consistent implementation and observance of the existing safety
standards is a top priority in the plans of all of the Group’s national
subsidiaries — this is a precondition for the prevention of accidents.

We have combined these key topics and other important sustainability issues in the HeidelbergCement Sustainability Ambitions 2020.
This programme, which is valid throughout the Group, defines the
main components and objectives of our sustainability strategy until
the year 2020. We are currently updating the programme in order to
extend our sustainability strategy to the year 2030. It will also reflect
the interests of our stakeholders with respect to sustainable supply
chain management, a circular economy and sustainable products, for
example.
Let us take a look at one of the key issues: safety at work. What
did the company achieve in this respect last year, and what needs
to be improved in 2017?
Dr Scheifele: Our stated objective is to minimise the risk of accidents and injuries. We were able to reduce the number and severity
of accidents as well as the number of fatalities. However, we are still

We will have to further intensify our occupational
safety efforts so that accidents can be prevented
on a sustained basis. The rigorous adherence to
our safety standards continues to be a top priority
in 2017.
Another top priority at HeidelbergCement is climate protection.
How is the company progressing with its efforts to reduce CO2
emissions?
Dr Scheifele: Climate protection and, in particular, the reduction of
CO2 emissions play a key role at our company. We have committed ourselves to doing our share to limit global warming to no more
than two degrees Celsius. Between 1990 and 2016, we reduced
specific net CO2 emissions by 22.6% to 598 kg CO2/t cement. And if
Italcementi is taken out of the equation, our emissions amounted to
only 581 kg CO2/t cement. We plan to lower CO2 emissions further
between now and 2030 – by at least 20 million tonnes of CO2 per
year as compared to 1990 levels. To achieve that, we are extensively
researching future-oriented technologies for the storage of CO2 or its
use as a raw material.

That sounds very future-oriented. How innovative and sustainable
is the product range at HeidelbergCement?
Dr Scheifele: We have made considerable progress in this respect in
recent years. At our global research centre in Leimen, our researchers
are working to develop technologies for increasing energy efficiency and
reducing CO2 emissions. Focal topics include the development of new
types of clinker and the reduction of the clinker content in cement and
concrete. Our researchers have even created a new clinker technology:
Ternocem®. Due to its altered chemical composition and lower combustion temperatures, this technology results in CO2 emissions that
are roughly 30% lower than is the case with a conventional clinker, as
well as energy savings of about 15%.
In addition, we are involved in a variety of research projects for the
reuse of recycled building materials. We are already much further
ahead in the Netherlands, where we have been marketing Ecocrete®
since 2013. Ecocrete® is a type of concrete that contains reprocessed
aggregates, which enable it to contribute to the country’s circular
economy.
Since the acquisition of Italcementi, we have been forging ahead with
our research activities focusing on construction products at the stateof-the-art development centre i.lab in Bergamo. Our employees are
working together with globally leading architects and construction
companies to create customised solutions for pioneering building projects. An example of this is the cutting-edge concrete facade elements
that are self-cleaning and reduce nitrogen oxide emissions.

We have also taken measures to ensure that we meet our human
rights-related responsibilities even more systematically. In the next
step, we will collect and subsequently report key figures on the basis
of a comprehensive human rights risk analysis. We are planning to
incorporate the required non-financial declaration directly into the
Annual Report for 2017 and to publish additional information in a
separate report.

The new research centre i.lab focuses on productrelated innovations. Here, we work together with
leading architects to develop customised solutions
for sustainable, cutting-edge concrete applications
in particular.

Let us now take a look at the future of sustainability reporting.
How well is the expanded Group prepared for new legislation such
as the implementation act for the EU’s CSR directive?
Dr Scheifele: We systematically prepare ourselves for new legislation
and the associated reporting requirements well in advance. With regard
to the implementation act for the EU’s CSR directive, for example,
we examined how far we already comply with the law’s stipulations.

Vertical integration as a growth driver

HeidelbergCement is one of the world’s largest companies for building materials. The core activities of
HeidelbergCement encompass the production and distribution of cement and aggregates, the two essential
raw materials for concrete. The downstream activities primarily include the production of ready-mixed concrete
as well as the manufacture of asphalt and other building products. This vertical integration strategy is one of
our growth drivers. In future, we plan to further integrate our business activities in urban centres in particular.

The former Italcementi Group has been part of HeidelbergCement since 1 July 2016. The two companies complement one another almost perfectly. The integration of Italcementi has given HeidelbergCement a strong market position
in North America, Southern Europe, North Africa, and Asia. HeidelbergCement now operates in around 60 countries
worldwide. The merger consolidates our position as one of the leading global producers of construction materials. In our
core areas of business, we are the world’s leading supplier of aggregates, the second-largest supplier of cement, and the
third-largest supplier of ready-mixed concrete.

For us, doing business means a lot more than just achieving
outstanding financial results. That’s because we also want to
act in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. This
understanding of our company serves as the basis of our sustainability strategy and the resulting Sustainability Ambitions. To
further develop the Ambitions, we also take the expectations of
our stakeholders into account.

Vision and mission
We want to continue to grow. However, in the long term we will only
be able to achieve our business goals if we generate added value for
society as a whole. We conserve natural resources, as they form the
basis of our business activities. Moreover, we take our social responsibility at the various company locations and towards our employees
seriously. We want to provide our employees with a secure income
and good qualifications in the long term. In our production activities,
we focus particularly on ensuring the health and safety of our employees. We want our customers to benefit from the high quality of our
products and a close partnership. We maintain respectful relations
with our suppliers and expect them to comply with our sustainability
standards.
Our business activities are characterised by commercial prudence, the
rule of law, and integrity. We promote value creation at our locations
and help to increase prosperity and the quality of life in emerging
economies in particular. By boosting growth, we achieve appropriate
dividends and increase the value of the company for our shareholders.
Growth and good returns are also the preconditions for benefiting the
environment by means of investments in cutting-edge technologies
and Group-wide environmental management systems.

Challenges and strategy
While we are minimising the risks for our business and exploiting
new opportunities, we are at the same time developing solutions for
environmental, social, and societal challenges. This work focuses on
the following topic areas:
– Occupational safety: Because we are a manufacturing company,
occupational health and safety are a top priority at HeidelbergCement. We employ targeted measures to improve technical and
organisational safety standards and make people more aware
of workplace safety issues. Here, we focus not only on our own
employees but also on those from external companies and third
parties.
– Securing raw materials and conserving resources: Our business
operations are dependent on having long-term access to mineralbased raw materials in the vicinity of our plants. Such resources
are finite and their local exploitation often leads to conflicts of
interest. We therefore view the sustainable securing of raw materials and conservation of resources as a key strategic task. Our strategy for resource conservation in cement production also involves
the use of alternative raw materials and fuels. Water protection
and water management are playing an increasingly important role
in our business operations as well. Water is scarce in many parts
of the world and climate change is exacerbating the situation. Even
though the construction materials industry consumes relatively
little water compared to other sectors, the scarcity of fresh water
at several of our locations presents a challenge to the company. In
response, in 2015 we began to record our water consumption and
implement measures for reducing consumption wherever water
scarcity is especially acute.

– Nature conservation and species protection: Our raw material
extraction and quarrying activities temporarily disrupt the surrounding water supplies, land, flora, and fauna. However, through
the non-intensive use of land we also create refuges for endangered animal and plant species. Although we are unable to compensate in the short term for these encroachments, we can offset
them over the medium and long terms. Here, we place great store in
the high-quality afteruse of our quarries in line with nature conservation principles, and to this end we seek to engage in a dialogue
with local stakeholders and international nature conservation
organisations.
– Energy efficiency and climate protection: The production of
cement requires a lot of energy. From both an economic and an
ecological standpoint, it is therefore imperative that we further
increase our energy efficiency. Cement production by its nature
also leads to a high level of CO2 emissions. Our efforts to lower
such emissions focus primarily on increasing our use of alternative
CO2-neutral raw materials and fuels. As a result, we have been able
to continually reduce our CO2 emissions over the past few years
and we will continue to reduce them further in future. Along with
our research on new types of cements with a lower CO2 footprint,
we are also investing in the development of methods for separating and exploiting the CO2 emissions produced by our cement
manufacturing operations. We also support international targets
and initiatives for reducing CO2 emissions and slowing the pace
of global warming. To help achieve the 2-degree target agreed on
during the COP 21 conference, we have drawn up a long-term plan
of measures for reducing CO2 and had it externally verified.

Our stakeholder engagement
In view of the strongly local focus of our business operations, we can
only be successful in the long term if we maintain good cooperative relationships with the various stakeholders in society. We seek
to establish and maintain a dialogue based on trust with all relevant
stakeholder groups — especially those on the local level but also with
national and international stakeholder groups. The resulting exchange
of ideas and opinions helps us identify critical issues at an early stage
and gain greater acceptance for our activities. Each country organisation is responsible for establishing and maintaining its own dialogue
with national and local stakeholders. The stakeholder dialogue on
international level is managed by the Group departments for commuG4-18, G4-24, G4-25
nication and sustainability.

Targets

Key Figures

Relations with local stakeholders
As most of our plants and quarries are situated near local communities, it is essential for us to continually maintain contact with local
communities and government agencies and local organisations. Plant
or facility management teams are generally responsible for such stakeholder relationships. Wherever necessary, they are supported by the
national subsidiary’s communication department. We take criticism
expressed by our stakeholder groups seriously and we discuss with
them the points they bring up. We have adopted new approaches in
many places in order to reconcile the interests of the company with
those of the local community. Along with personal discussions, we
also make use of the entire range of modern information and dialogue
media including newsletters and guidelines as well as different conG4-24, G4-26
cepts of public participation.
In 2016, the Group approved a handbook for community relationship
management. This handbook regulates the company’s relations with
the communities in which it has facilities and aims to make the charitable activities of HeidelbergCement more systematic and transparent.
A CSR expert group at Group level regularly brings together managers
from all levels for discussing and documenting local activities and
the various experiences the managers have had with regard to social
G4-26
responsibility and the stakeholder dialogue.
Society: p. 57

Stakeholder dialogue at national and international levels
HeidelbergCement is a member of both general and industry-specific
associations that represent their members’ interests vis-à-vis governments, businesses, and the public. These memberships promote an
exchange with other companies and organisations and a common
determination to achieve greater sustainability. The topics addressed
focus on challenges specific to individual countries and industrial
policy, particularly as regards the secure supply of raw materials,
environmental protection, energy conservation, occupational health
and safety, and social and labour issues.

On the international level, we are involved in the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI), which seeks to create a more sustainable cement
industry. The CSI always incorporates affected third parties into the
process for developing standardised guidelines and protocols for the
cement industry. Interested partners such as industry associations and
non-governmental organisations are therefore involved in many proG4-24, G4-25

Dialogue with political decision-makers
Legislation in the European Union is increasingly impacting our business operations by addressing all aspects of sustainability. For this
reason, HeidelbergCement has established a separate corporate
function for political dialogue at the EU level. The manager responsible for this dialogue chiefly represents our interests in CEMBUREAU,
the European Cement Association, which speaks for European cement
manufacturers in discussions and negotiations with the EU and its
various institutions. The key issues addressed by CEMBUREAU include the use of alternative raw materials and fuels, climate protection, emissions, biodiversity, and occupational health and safety. As a

member of the European Aggregates Association (UEPG), we also
present our positions on aggregates to political decision-makers. Our
interests concerning concrete are represented by the European ReadyMixed Concrete Organisation (ERMCO) and the European Concrete
G4-24, G4-25
Platform (ECP).
Our lobbying activities are in accordance with transparent rules and
represent the positions that HeidelbergCement takes in public.
Dialogue with analysts and investors who focus on sustainability
issues
Dialogue with the capital markets is also becoming more and more
important, as our shareholders and a growing number of financial
analysts and rating agencies want to know how HeidelbergCement
integrates the issue of sustainability into its corporate strategy. They
also want to know how successful the company has been in this regard. The dialogue with capital-market stakeholder groups generally
G4-24, G4-25
has a bilateral format.

Materiality analysis
One of the main pillars of our sustainability strategy is the linking
of our Sustainability Ambitions with the assessments of our stakeholders and the enhancement of this programme on the basis of the
stakeholders’ expectations. We use our materiality analysis to regularly determine how important the individual sustainability issues are
for different stakeholder groups and the company itself. The analysis
thus helps us identify and evaluate issues and trends that are important for our business success today, or could prove to be important
G4-18, G4-27
in future.
Our stakeholder engagement: p. 15

The last time we conducted a comprehensive materiality analysis at
the Group level was in late 2014. For this assessment, we asked 57
of our most important external stakeholders from various countries to
give us their opinions. The stakeholders surveyed included suppliers,
investors, scientists, and representatives of government agencies and
non-governmental organisations (NGOs). A total of 26 stakeholders
agreed to take part in our survey, which included standardised and
open-ended questions. For our internal assessment, we queried some
50 staff members from relevant business lines in all Group areas in
the same manner. The topic list that was utilised here was based on
our existing Sustainability Ambitions 2020 and the key issues defined

Ongoing open communication with our
stakeholders helps us to understand
their expectations and take up suggestions early on.

by the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) of the World Business
Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) after close and systematic consultations with numerous stakeholder groups and experts.
G4-18, G4-24, G4-25, G4-26

To further refine our Sustainability Ambitions during the past two
years, we have accompanied these measures with an ongoing dialogue with internal and external stakeholders. For example, inhouse sustainability experts from a variety of business lines and
Group areas met four times in order to discuss key sustainability
issues and their inclusion in the new Sustainability Ambitions. In
addition, we have engaged in dialogues with external stakeholders such as the nature conservation group BirdLife International as
well as with stakeholders of our subsidiaries on the national level.
G4-24, G4-25, G4-26

The importance of some issues has shifted as a result of the findings
that we obtained from these stakeholder dialogues as well as due to
changed political conditions and new legislation. For example, sustainable supply chain management has become more important for us
and our stakeholders, as has the recycling of construction materials
and the creation of sustainable products. G4-20, G4-21, G4-23, G4-27
The regulators on the European and national levels have intensified
their focus on human rights issues and defined new reporting obligations. As a result, this topic has become even more relevant than it
was before. Despite this, we have decided not to update the materiality
matrix for the current report. Instead, we plan to review and possibly
adjust our materiality matrix in late 2017. This will be done with the
help of a stakeholder survey, among other things.

We have also reorganised the chapters in this sustainability report in
line with these changes. The production and product issues that were
previously combined in the chapter on the environment have been
split so that we can more extensively describe our efforts in the field
of innovative, sustainability-oriented product development. This reorganisation of the chapters also makes it clear that our responsibility for
the environment and society is focused on our production processes,
but is not limited to them and also encompasses the supply chain. We
have also added a chapter highlighting the relevance of legally compliant business activities that meet international standards. This chapter

also addresses the issue of human rights.

safety, environmental management plays a very important role within
our sustainability strategy. For example, we conducted environmental
audits at all business lines throughout the Group in 2016 and we plan
to introduce certified environmental management systems at all of our
cement plants worldwide between now and 2020.

HeidelbergCement has dedicated itself to a responsible system of
corporate governance. We aim to achieve our business objectives
in accordance with applicable laws and international standards as
well as with socially and environmentally responsible methods.
This is the only way to ensure that our success will be sustainable.

Laws and standards
We respect and obey the applicable laws and regulations in all the
countries in which we operate, and we regard them as the legal foundation of our business activities. As an internationally operating company, we are also obliged to adhere to global values and standards. As
a result, we are committed to upholding the ILO’s core labour standards, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN’s
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We expect our employees and
business partners around the world to act in conformity with these
essential guidelines and recommendations. That’s why our leadership
principles also reflect our commitment to the aforementioned standards. We commit our suppliers to these standards with our Supplier
Code of Conduct.
Our management and monitoring structures comply with the laws
governing stock corporations in Germany, the company’s memorandum and articles of association, the rules of procedure of the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board and, with a few exceptions, the
guidelines laid out in the German Corporate Governance Code.

Our compliance programme
Our compliance programme is based on a Group-wide Code of Conduct that requires all employees and managers to adhere to our basic
principles of responsible corporate governance, regardless of whether
or not such principles have been written into law.
It is particularly important that
– our employees and managers act with integrity and professionalism when dealing with customers, suppliers, government
authorities, and business partners;
– conflicts of interest are consistently avoided and prevented;
– company property and assets are treated carefully and
responsibly;
– confidential company and business information and personal
data are treated carefully and responsibly;
– fair conditions and a workplace free of discrimination are
ensured and fair discussions are conducted with employee
representatives;
– safe and healthy workplaces are provided;
– natural resources are utilised responsibly and sparingly.
A key element of our compliance programme is our executives’ nontoleration of violations of applicable law (especially competition law
and anti-corruption regulations), and their commitment to taking
action against all those who commit such violations. Our compliance
programme also includes internal measures and guidelines that
provide more specific information on the relevant legal regulations.
Measures here also include periodic training courses for our employees. For example, we have an e-learning module that addresses our
Code of Conduct and provides basic information about compliance
topics. Our electronic courses cover topics such as discrimination
and harassment in the workplace, competition law and measures to
prevent corruption. Around 10,000 employees were registered to use
the e-learning module in the reporting year.

Our compliance organisation
The Director Group Compliance, who heads our compliance organisation, reports directly to the Chairman of the Managing Board. Each
country in which we operate also has its own Compliance Officer.
Every manager is responsible for ensuring that employees comply with
applicable laws and regulations, and of course the employees themselves are also responsible for their own compliance. Defined control
mechanisms throughout the Group ensure that our compliance programme is implemented correctly. Such mechanisms include regular
and special audits by our Internal Auditing department, as well as halfyear compliance reports submitted by the Director Group Compliance
to the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee.
In addition, every Managing Board member receives a report each
quarter on major compliance issues in his region.
We closely monitor developments in the area of compliance and
regularly review our programme in order to determine whether it
needs to be adjusted. In 2016, the integration of Italcementi into the
HeidelbergCement Group gave us the opportunity to compare the
compliance management systems (CMS) of the two companies. The
resulting findings were incorporated into the joint CMS and helped
to improve it.

Compliance activities
During the reporting year, Group Compliance made a compliance risk
assessment to determine whether the company’s compliance-related
focal topics are up to date. This risk assessment is based on structured
interviews of the Group Directors and selected Managing Directors
of our country organisations. It enabled us to identify the main compliance risks of the HeidelbergCement Group. The results confirmed
the general validity of our compliance activities and also gave us valuable information about the areas where HeidelbergCement will have
to intensify its compliance-related efforts in future. This applies to

23

Targets

HeidelbergCement I Sustainability Report 2016

the reporting of human rights protection measures as well as to the
company’s adjustment to tougher data protection requirements. The
focus is on our activities in EU countries that are directly affected
by the EU’s new General Data Protection Regulation. The implementation of these measures is one of the main tasks for 2017 and is
being jointly prepared by several specialist departments.
In 2016, HeidelbergCement made preparations to meet its responsibilities even more systematically with regard to the upholding of
human rights. With external assistance in some cases, we improved
the exchange of information and division of tasks between specialist
departments and extensively took human rights issues into account
during the planning of a new supplier management system in procurement. We also did this for the draft version of the Group’s new longterm sustainability targets. Moreover, discussions are taking place at
HeidelbergCement regarding the development of a Group position
concerning human rights. We are also working on a comprehensive
human rights risk analysis in order to prepare ourselves for the human
rights reporting requirements that will result from the EU’s new CSR
directive. This analysis will serve as a basis for defining and recording
appropriate key figures.

Our Trade Sanctions Policy has been in effect since November 2014.
Given the nature of our business model, which largely focuses on local
activities and unproblematic products, there is no great risk that our
company will violate the sanctions. Nevertheless, the business impact
of such violations would be severe, due to fines and, even more importantly, to more difficult refinancing conditions should US banks no
longer provide loans because of the strictness of US law in this regard.
This policy requires all companies controlled by HeidelbergCement
to check whether their business partners are on the sanction lists published by the EU and the USA. The Group Compliance department
helps the country organisations implement the Trade Sanctions Policy
by supplying data processing solutions in cooperation with Group IT
and by delineating business processes that regulate the necessary
activities following the evaluation of business partners. The actual
assessment is made by the specialist departments (Sales, Procurement, Human Resources, Treasury) and by Accounting (screening of
master data), which notify the local Compliance Officer if they discover
anything unusual.
These processes and software support measures are now being introduced in the companies that were incorporated after the acquisition
of Italcementi.

We continuously review our compliance
programme to see if any adjustments
need to be taken. One of the focal points
in 2016 was the reporting requirements
concerning human rights issues.

As a result of our own anti-corruption guideline, the UK Bribery Act,
and the IDW PS 980 audit standard, we have worked together with
external experts to develop a system for assessing and avoiding corruption risks and possible conflicts of interest. The system is divided
into three stages. In the first stage, the system assesses the potential risks in a particular country organisation. Existing measures are
then applied to limit such potential risks. In the last step, the system determines whether additional measures might be required. This
assessment results in a plan of measures for each country. The implementation of these measures is monitored by Group Compliance. The
assessments will be conducted every three years.
The anti-corruption guideline specifies our principles with regard to
the proper conduct towards business partners and the prevention of
conflicts of interest. These principles are also stated in our Code of
Conduct. The Code especially regulates the handling of gifts, donations, and sponsorships. One focus here is on the correct interaction
with government officials and the special care that must be taken
when commissioning consultants.
In addition to such aspects, we continue to focus on occupational
safety and environmental legislation. This approach reflects the characteristics and special aspects of a heavy industry that extracts raw
materials and generally operates on a local level with its production
and sale of homogeneous bulk goods.
Extensive efforts are also made to ensure compliance with internal
procurement stipulations, the ban on insider trading and the regulations governing capital markets, data security, and equal opportunity
for all employees. The respective specialist departments are responsible for all of these compliance-related areas. To this end, they have
published corresponding guidelines, ensure the issues are properly
communicated, and conduct training courses.

Compliance reporting system
Our compliance reporting system offers both employees and external
parties the opportunity to report compliance violations. This system
also includes criteria for violations of human rights and core labour
standards such as anti-discrimination and anti-child labour regulations. The system encompasses a variety of channels through which
suspected compliance violations can be addressed, ranging from
reports sent directly to specifically authorised contact partners to
information submitted through our whistle-blower hotline. All such
reports are handled anonymously if desired. Our Compliance Incident Reporting & Case Management Guideline contains instructions
and principles on how to report compliance-related matters, process
and investigate complaints, and protect the individuals who report
infringements.
We examine every report we receive. We take appropriate disciplinary action in cases of proven misconduct. These measures can range
from reprimands to dismissal. We also initiate civil action and press
criminal charges, if necessary. In addition to taking corrective action,
we implement preventive measures in order to reduce the likelihood
of recurrences in the future.
Most of the reported violations in the year under review involved
employee issues and occupational safety. The whistleblower hotline
received 46 reports, including three cases of alleged discrimination.
No instances of child labour or forced labour were reported.

Three cases of alleged corruption were submitted through our compliance reporting system in 2016. The claims pertained to Romania,
Indonesia, and the USA. One of these cases was confirmed and led to
the dismissal of employees. The company was also investigating the
possibility of taking legal action at the time of the editorial deadline.
The investigation of the second case had not been completed at the
time of the editorial deadline either, while the third case did not violate
any anti-corruption regulations. No region proved to be particularly
prone to corruption. However, from a structural standpoint it is apparent that the existing internal control mechanisms can be subverted
if several employees purposefully work in concert. Three possible
conflicts of interest were also reported. However, these claims either
proved to be unfounded or were still under investigation at the time of
the editorial deadline. Here as well, the two countries affected (Indonesia and the USA) are rated differently by Transparency International.

Our customers have very high requirements with regard to our
products and services. Our research and development (R&D) activities are oriented towards these requirements as we strive to
innovate. In addition, improved processes and new cement and
concrete recipes help minimise energy consumption and CO 2
emissions. As a result, they also reduce the effects on environment and costs.

Customer orientation and product
development
Our close proximity to the markets enables us to provide our customers with extensive advice and develop our products in close cooperation with them. The responsible departments and employees are
directly incorporated into the organisation of the respective national
subsidiaries and develop cements, aggregates, and concretes that are
optimally adapted to local needs. This development work is often carried out in close cooperation with the customers. However, our work
does not end with the products, but also includes providing our customers with expert advice on their optimisation and use.
Customers who wish to file complaints can get in touch with their
local contact partners, whereby all complaints — whether of a technical, logistical, or commercial nature — are forwarded directly to
the appropriate department. The structural design and computersupported implementation of our Complaint Management System is
carried out worldwide in accordance with a predefined standard.
In order to better understand our customers and offer even greater
utility, we are continuing to comprehensively survey our customers
around the globe within the framework of our Group-wide Customer
Excellence Programme (CEP). The results of this survey show us how
we can focus even more strongly on the customer in our business
operations. We use these findings and other market analyses to

28

HeidelbergCement I Sustainability Report 2016

develop plans for optimising our products and services and to further
enhance the satisfaction of our customers. We treat all the customer
data we collect confidentially and do not pass any information on to
third parties.

Research and technology
We have combined the Group-wide research and development activities and the innovations produced by the cement, ready-mixed
concrete, and aggregates business lines in our two research centres
— within the HeidelbergCement Technology Center (HTC) in Leimen,
Germany, and in Bergamo, Italy. Whereas the research and development work in Leimen focuses on the reduction of CO2 emissions,
increased resource efficiency, and lower production costs, the centre
in Bergamo concentrates on the development of high-tech concrete
applications and on new market opportunities.
In addition, technology centres support our national subsidiaries in the
various Group areas. The Heidelberg Technology Center Global (HTC) is
our competence centre for cement. The HTC assists our cement plants

with technical issues, ranging from the securing of raw materials to

also applies to investment measures. The Competence Center Materials (CCM) provides similar assistance for aggregates and asphalt.
The Competence Center Readymix (CCR) concentrates on the Groupwide optimisation of raw material and logistics costs in the readymixed concrete business line.
Total expenditure on research and technology amounted to E116.6

The innovation activities of HeidelbergCement focus on five main
areas:
– Products and applications: Our research and development activities are geared strongly towards the market and our customers.
The main priority here is the development and improvement of
binders and concretes with optimised properties and innovative
functionalities.
– Cement production: In the first half of 2016, the focus was on
the continual improvement of processes and cost structures at all
of the plants. This includes the cost-efficient substitution of fossil
fuels and natural resources with alternative fuels and raw materials,
as well as measures that reduce energy consumption in production.
In the second half of the year, the focus was on the integration of
the newly acquired Italcementi plants.
– Aggregates: In addition to continual efficiency improvements, the
main development focus in 2016 was on digitalisation. The integration of operational, sales-related, and financial data into a key
controlling tool increases transparency and makes it easier to coordinate production, sales, and quality assurance.

– Optimisation across all business lines: We are focusing on vertical integration in major metropolitan areas in particular. Extensive
and sustained financial savings can be achieved through the coordinated optimisation of the product ranges, production processes,
and logistics operations across the aggregates, ready-mixed concrete, and cement business lines. Moreover, our CO2 emissions are
reduced by a high level of transport efficiency. In addition, the exploitation of our complete raw materials portfolio in individual market regions enables us to optimise the material mix in our readymixed concrete plants to an extent that allows us to use our raw
materials in the best possible manner. At the same time, we are
able to guarantee a high level of concrete quality for our customers.
– Development of cements and concretes with improved CO2
footprints: A key focus for us is to further develop composite cements with lower clinker content — even lower than required by
today’s standards, in fact. The reduction of clinker content is the
most important factor for minimising energy consumption and
CO2 emissions and conserving natural resources. Finally, we are
also conducting research into completely new binder systems that
require no clinker. Such innovative alternative products are still
in the development stage, and it will therefore take several years
before they are ready for the market and wide deployment.

Sustainability and innovation go hand
in hand. At present we are developing,
with international partners, a construction
method for concrete that could well
revolutionise the storage of excess energy
from offshore wind farms.

Alternative raw materials for improving the CO2 footprint
One of the most important measures for reducing CO2 emissions in
cement manufacturing involves the use of alternative raw materials
that are produced as waste in other industries. A very large share of
these secondary raw materials comes from the metalworking industry.
Moreover, coal-fired power plants supply ash as well as synthetic gypsum. All of them are of a very uniform quality. The systematic assessment of the suitability of all raw materials used ensures a consistently
high level of product quality.
HeidelbergCement generally uses alternative raw materials in two
areas: in the combustion process for the production of clinker, which
is the most important intermediate product in the manufacture of
cement, and as additives that give cement special properties in order
to reduce the content of CO2-intensive clinker in cement.
To produce clinker, we use old foundry sand, for example, or lime
sludge from drinking water purification systems in order to reduce
the consumption of finite natural resources. The use of alternative
raw materials in the raw meal at several Italcementi plants enabled
HeidelbergCement to greatly increase its substitution rate. For example, 8% of the production raw materials at the new kiln line in Rezzato,
Italy, were substituted with alternative materials and the goal is to
increase this share even more in 2017.
When we develop new types of cement with a reduced proportion of clinker, we also use additives such as blast furnace slag
from steel production operations, as well as fly ash, a by-product
in coal-fired power plants. Moreover, we have used rock flour from
local quarries as a secondary component for producing cement in
Africa, for example, thus substituting imported clinker with local raw
materials. In the Netherlands, meanwhile, we are investigating the
possibility of using fine fractions from recycled concrete as a component in cement, in order to completely recycle concrete.

atures result in CO2 emissions that are roughly 30% lower than is the
case with a conventional clinker, as well as energy savings of about
15%. The basic technology is protected by several patents.

We produced more than 5,000 tonnes of Ternocem® clinker in a largescale pilot test. This material is now being used for the development
of cement and concrete so that the manufacturing concept can be
optimised and in-depth experience can be gained concerning the use
of Ternocem® cement in a broad range of applications, e.g. readymixed concrete, precast concrete parts, and concrete products.
We launched a multi-year research programme in 2015 to prepare the
technology for the market. This programme receives extensive support
from the EU-funded ECO-BINDER project. It will establish the conditions necessary for the future standardisation of products.

Sustainable construction with concrete
As a founding member of the Concrete Sustainability Council, we have
actively contributed to the development of a certification system for
sustainably produced concrete. This system was introduced in early
2017 and takes into account social and environmental aspects along
the entire value chain. This certification of concrete will probably enable our product and sector to receive more recognition from Green
Building Councils in future as well as from government authorities
when they award public construction projects.
We have also continued to work on the development of product solutions for energy-efficient buildings and cities. In 2016, we intensified
our development of multi-purpose lightweight concrete with better
thermal insulation. A cooperative project funded by the German Federal
Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) aims to develop innovative components such as monolithic wall systems. Unlike conventional
external thermal insulation composite systems the lightweight concrete components will be cost-efficient and recyclable without leaving

any significant amounts of waste behind. As a result, this lightweight
concrete will help achieve Europe’s ambitious energy and resource
efficiency targets. In 2016, we had the opportunity to implement our
ideas of sustainable construction in one of our new buildings: the
HeidelbergCement Technology Center (HTC) in Leimen, Germany. This
new office and lab building has received a gold certificate from the
German Sustainable Building Council (DGNB) and meets the highest
sustainability standards with regard to environmental protection, cost
efficiency, sociocultural benefits, and technical quality. Energy consumption was greatly reduced by district heating, which is supplied
to the offices through the highly efficient thermal activation of the
building’s concrete ceilings.
Recycling of construction materials
In line with the European Commission’s circular economy targets,
our German country organisation is managing a research project for
the reuse of recycled construction materials. This project, known as
R-Beton (resource-saving concrete), was initiated in 2015 by several
cooperation partners and receives funding from the German federal
government. The project’s aim is the development of rules on how to
use recycled aggregates. This includes the utilisation of reprocessed
sand, which currently cannot be used in wet concrete in most countries.

The use of by-products from other
industries for the production of
clinker and cement or the recycling
of concrete from demolished
structures enable us to manufacture
concrete more sustainably.

Our Dutch subsidiary Mebin, which produces ready-mixed concrete,
has contributed its practical knowledge of recycling technologies and
the use of recycled aggregates in wet concrete to the EU-funded Hiser
project. This expertise was put to use in the new REWINN recycling
plant in Amsterdam, which HeidelbergCement and the local demolition company Theo Pouw put into operation in 2016. In this way, we
secure access to high-quality recycled aggregates for the production
of Ecocrete®, a type of concrete that contains reprocessed aggregates.
Ecocrete® has been marketed in the Netherlands since 2013 and is
making an important contribution to the country’s circular economy.

Because we are a raw materials company, our sustainability strategy focuses on environmental responsibility, climate protection,
and ensuring the permanent availability of resources. One of the
key aims that result from this strategy is the creation of sustainable production processes at all of our locations worldwide. However, we also want to sharpen our suppliers’ awareness of our
standards. That’s why a Code of Conduct forms the basis of all of
our partnerships and our contractors have to commit themselves
to upholding this code.

Environmental management
In an effort to place environmental protection on a firmer footing at our
production facilities and achieve continual improvements in this area,
we plan to introduce certified environmental management systems at
all of our cement plants worldwide by 2020. We will focus here on
the ISO 14001 international standard and will also use recognised
national standards. At the end of 2016, 75% of our integrated cement
plants were operating with a certified environmental management
system (not including Italcementi).
In line with the stipulations in our Sustainability Ambitions 2020, we
conducted environmental audits at all business lines throughout the
Group in 2016. Our goal is to analyse all of our locations in this manner
by 2020. The audits conducted to date have led to the development of
several measures to improve our environmental performance. These
measures have now been successfully implemented. No violations of
environmental protection laws that would have led to significant fines
or non-financial penalties were reported during the reporting year.

HeidelbergCement I Sustainability Report 2016

Key Figures

Energy and climate protection
Due to the high temperatures needed to burn limestone, the production of cement consumes a lot of energy and thus causes combustion-related CO2 emissions. When the raw material is heated to over
800oC, it is de-acidified, which leads to further, process-related
CO2 emissions.
As a result, climate protection and the reduction of CO2 emissions,
in particular, play a key role at our company. We have committed
ourselves to do our bit to limiting global warming to no more than
two degrees Celsius. To achieve this goal, we are actively forging ahead
with the development of future-oriented technologies. We reinforced
our ambitions in 2015 by joining the LCTPi (Low Carbon Technology Partnership initiative). In 2016, we presented our climate protection measures and innovative approaches at the UN Climate Change
Conference in Marrakesh. As an energy-intensive company, we have
been diligently striving for many years to reduce our CO2 emissions.
Between 1990 and 2016, we reduced specific net CO2 emissions
by 22.6% to 598 kg CO2/t cement. Over the period to 2030, we are
aiming to lower these emissions by a further 30% as compared to
1990 levels (not including Italcementi).
However, the climate protection-related values are different from those
in 2015. On the one hand, in line with our Group reporting of sales
volumes and revenue, joint ventures are no longer included. On the
other hand, the key figures for climate protection have slightly
worsened since 1 July 2016 due to the integration of Italcementi,
which has not performed as well as HeidelbergCement with regard to
climate protection.

Participation in the EU’s emissions trading system
HeidelbergCement currently has 57 facilities in 16 countries that
participate in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). The debate
regarding the reform of the EU ETS for Phase IV (2021–2030) continued in 2016. Even though many controversial topics were settled,
no final decisions had been made by the end of the year. The three
EU institutions — the European Commission, the European Parliament,
and the member states — will now have to agree on a final regulation
during the trilateral negotiations of 2017.
Emissions trading systems outside of Europe
Emissions trading systems are also being set up in regions outside of
the EU. China, for example, is testing a variety of concepts in six of its
provinces. One of these provinces is Guangdong. Because we operate a joint venture there, we closely monitor how the local emissions
trading system is developing. However, the development of a national
emissions trading system will be delayed in China until the end of
2017.

Innovations for climate protection
In 2015, we tested four different technologies for separating CO2 from
combustion exhaust gases at our plant in Brevik, Norway. On the basis
of a preliminary study conducted in 2016, the Norwegian government
has now decided to carry out a comprehensive feasibility study for
the construction of a large-scale CO2 separation facility at the same
plant. The study will investigate whether 400,000 tonnes of CO2 can
be separated annually by an amine scrubber and stored underground.
This facility would be the first major CCS (carbon capture and storage)
plant in the cement industry.
www.norcem.no/en/carbon_capture

HeidelbergCement is participating in the EU-funded CEMCAP project
for promoting the use of CO2 separation technologies in the cement
industry. Within the context of this project, we are working to
further develop the oxy-fuel technology. The oxy-fuel method uses
pure CO2 rather than ambient air to cool off heated clinker. The gas is
then fed into the combustion process through a rotary kiln. Pure oxygen is channelled into the rotary kiln for the combustion process. Because this combustion process also produces CO2, a very pure stream
of CO2 exhaust gas is created from which only a small amount of gaseous impurities has to be removed. That makes the CO2 much easier
to use. We are currently working on the development of this technology on a pilot-plant scale at our facility in Hanover, Germany. To do so,
we have installed a test cooler in order to determine whether clinker
can be cooled with pure CO2 without impairing process efficiency. This
is one of the main preconditions for successfully using the oxy-fuel
method in clinker production.

Energy efficiency
In 2016, HeidelbergCement put a 250 kW solar power plant into operation in Burkina Faso. It generates electricity for the main systems
of the Ouagadougou grinding plant and its packaging facility. This
project was completed without any government subsidies. By means
of this environmentally friendly power supply, we are not only reducing
the costs of electricity but also protecting against blackouts in order to
improve the available operating time of our production plant and the
packaging facility.

HeidelbergCement is also playing a major role in the LEILAC (Low
Emissions Intensity Lime And Cement) project, which is also being
funded by the EU. The goal here is to demonstrate the technological and economic feasibility of a process technology that helps separate the CO2 that is released when the raw material is decarbonised
in a very pure form. As scheduled, the first milestone was reached on
1 October 2016, when the basic design and concept of the innovative
calcinator was defined and accordingly reported to the EU. In 2017,
the construction plans will be drawn up in detail and the building of
the calcinator will begin.

In 2016, HeidelbergCement teamed up with the Department of
Process Metallurgy and Metal Recycling at RWTH Aachen and the
IASS in Potsdam to obtain funding from the German Federal Ministry
of Education and Research for a three-year research project for the
carbonation of minerals. The aim of this research project is to separate
and store CO2 with the help of natural and waste minerals in order to
produce commercially usable construction materials.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has awarded the renowned ENERGY STAR® to six of our cement plants in the USA:
Glens Falls (New York), Leeds (Alabama), Nazareth (Pennsylvania),
Speed (Indiana), Union Bridge (Maryland), and Waco (Texas). The
facilities were honoured for their above-average energy efficiency.
In fact, the six facilities are among the most energy-efficient cement
plants in the USA and fulfil the strict EPA criteria. The Union Bridge
cement plant has received the ENERGY STAR® for the fourth time in
a row, while the plants in Glens Falls, Leeds, and Nazareth have done
so for the third time in succession.

Alternative fuels
Many waste materials and by-products from other industries serve as
valuable raw materials for HeidelbergCement. We use these resources
as alternatives to finite natural raw materials and fossil fuels in the production of cement. In this way, we are helping to conserve resources
and reduce the problems that municipalities and industrial companies
near our plants have with waste disposal. At the same time, these
efforts are also reducing our CO2 emissions, because the biomass
which accounts for around 8% of the alternative fuel mix is classified
as climate neutral.

Alternative fuels replace natural resources
In all of the countries in which HeidelbergCement produces clinker
(the main component of cement), we investigate possibilities for using
waste from municipalities, agriculture, and industry in an economically
and environmentally responsible manner. In order to develop optimal
solutions, we work together with regulatory authorities, waste producers, neighbours, employees, NGOs, and other stakeholders.
Despite the low price of coal, HeidelbergCement was able to increase
its alternative fuel rate to 23.5% in 2016 (not including Italcementi).
This increase was especially boosted by the countries in northern
Europe, where we were able to use much more alternative fuels at all
of the kiln lines. The increase was as high as 10% at some of the kilns,
even though large amounts of alternative fuels were already being
used before. Our Polish subsidiary also contributed substantially to
the total result, thanks to an alternative fuel rate of 70% at its cement
plant in Gorazdze.
We have also made efforts to increase the use of alternative fuels at
the newly acquired Italcementi plants. In 2016, we achieved initial
successes in France and Morocco, where around 15% of our energy
needs are now met by old tires. In cooperation with waste producers,
waste treatment companies and municipalities, we were able to develop a waste processing system in Morocco. Partnerships such as
this one will be one of the main driving forces for improving the waste
management industry in Morocco, and they were repeatedly mentioned
during the UN Climate Change Conference COP22 in Marrakesh.

Key Figures

Use of hazardous wastes
The careful handling of hazardous wastes is a key element of every
country’s waste disposal infrastructure. For most types of hazardous
waste, reuse in cement plants has proved to be a safe means of disposal and utilisation. The high temperatures (over 1,450 °C) and long
incineration period in the kilns ensure that all harmful components
are completely destroyed. This has been confirmed by measurements
taken by independent state-certified institutes. At the same time,
HeidelbergCement does not use certain types of waste, such as nuclear waste.

Land use and biodiversity
We only extract worthwhile deposits if they can be exploited in an
environmentally compatible and economical manner. Before making
any decision concerning the development of a new quarry or the expansion of an existing one, the company first conducts an extensive
approval process in line with the corresponding laws and regulations.
This process includes an environmental impact assessment and — if
the affected area is of exceptional biological value — special biodiversity studies. In these studies, the priorities are set as follows: prevention, mitigation, compensation. We accordingly first check whether
excavation work can be avoided or at least adjusted to local conditions
in such a way that the ecosystem is not disrupted, that such disruptions are kept to a minimum, or that they can be reduced by means of
corresponding compensatory measures.

Following the integration of Italcementi, we will have to redefine the
alternative fuel targets for our Group. The same applies to all of our
other sustainability targets. We want to publish the reworked targets
for 2030 by the end of 2017.

Concepts for the limitation of land consumption
For environmental and economic reasons, we always strive to limit
land consumption when planning our quarry and renaturation activities. As a matter of principle, the authorised raw material supply is
always completely extracted in order to minimise land consumption.
As a result, we prefer to expand existing quarries rather than develop
new sites. Our production and plant facilities are also optimised so as
to require the smallest possible amount of land area.
Biodiversity management at our quarries
Recultivation plans are now an integral part of approval processes.
These plans define the goals and timetable for the reintegration of a
quarry into the surrounding landscape. Even while a quarry is still in
operation, we renaturate and recultivate those areas of the quarry that
are no longer used.
As early as 2010, we began to collect and analyse information about
the biodiversity of our quarries. In cooperation with our partner,
BirdLife International, we conducted a study to determine how far
our quarries are from nature reserves in Europe, Africa, and Asia. The
study encompassed more than half of our active quarries worldwide.

Many of our sites provide an important
refuge for rare species. To protect
and enhance such species, we aim to
implement biodiversity management plans
at quarries of high ecological value.

We collect data on two key indicators at our quarries in Europe, Africa,
and Asia:
– Proportion of active quarries with subsequent use plans
–	Proportion of quarries in areas with a high level of biodiversity for
which biodiversity management plans are being implemented.
Data for these two indicators was last recorded in 2015, when 85% of
the cement-related quarries had restoration plans. The corresponding
figure for aggregates quarries was 89%. By 2030 at the latest, we
plan to increase this share to 100% in both areas.
In 2015, 74% of the quarries in areas with a high level of biodiversity were implementing biodiversity management plans at the cement
business line, while the corresponding figure at the aggregates business line was 81%. As a result, there are approximately 200 biodiversity management plans in place today. We are steadily extending
biodiversity monitoring to more and more quarries and are also implementing corresponding management plans.
Habitat protection
HeidelbergCement has been able to restore many different natural
habitats by recultivating and renaturating former quarries. For example, we recultivated 300 hectares of endangered banksia forests
in Western Australia and are currently renaturating a high-priority
reed bed in the United Kingdom at a single location measuring up to
460 hectares. In order to effectively promote biological diversity,
we became the first company in the construction materials sector to
define uniform standards for renaturation, recultivation, and habitat
management. These standards are combined in a guideline that is
being implemented at our locations throughout Europe (a comparable
handbook is also used in Asia and Oceania). The guideline focuses on
the following types of habitats:
– Aquatic habitats: lakes, ponds, fens, and springs
– Terrestrial habitats: forests, grasslands, cliffs, and escarpments
–	Anthropogenous habitats: settlements, farmland, and recreation
areas.

This is especially true of habitats where many endangered species
have settled and that are associated with the early stages of ecological succession. In Europe in particular, our quarries are now important
refuges and stepping-stone biotopes for especially protected species
such as the sand martin, the yellow-bellied toad, the eagle-owl, and
the tree frog. In order to highlight the importance of quarries for the
preservation of biodiversity, HeidelbergCement has published a series
of books about various groups of species. The book published in 2016
focused on butterflies and other insects. HeidelbergCement takes part
in numerous species protection programmes run by governmental and
non-governmental institutions and thus supports local and international nature conservation efforts.
Cooperation with nature conservation organisations
We work with many local nature conservation organisations worldwide. Since 2012, we have also been cooperating with the largest
international nature conservation organisation, BirdLife International.
Our work with BirdLife International and our cooperation with its
national partner organisations help us minimise our environmental
impact and promote biodiversity in our quarries and the surrounding
areas. An interactive map on the website of BirdLife provides information about our diverse range of joint projects on the local level:

Quarry Life Award
In 2016, HeidelbergCement organised the Quarry Life Award for
the third time. The research competition is targeted at scientists,
university students, and non-governmental organisations as well as
our neighbours in the communities where our facilities are located.
All of these groups are invited to develop biodiversity projects for
our company’s quarries worldwide and, provided they qualify to
participate in the competition, to implement them. In this way, we
want to promote the investigation of the quarries’ biological value
as well as the development of new methods that would benefit
scientists, government authorities, and our company.
In 2016, more than 490 applications were received, from which the
juries selected 94 projects to compete for the award at the national
and international levels. More than 300 researchers and many other
interested individuals worked to implement these projects in 69 quarries and gravel pits in 21 countries. The projects were of outstandingly high quality and provided a wealth of information, data and
specific recommendations on how we can improve biodiversity at our
locations. The first prize, amounting to E30,000, was awarded to a
Spanish team investigating the ecological connectivity of waterbodies
in gravel quarries for semi-aquatic mammals, and explored how to
enhance this connectivity for greater biodiversity gain.

The acquisition of Italcementi has given us facilities in additional countries that we want to include in our cooperation with BirdLife International. At the same time, we want to continue to cooperate with
nature conservation organisations that Italcementi had worked with.
An example of this is the close cooperation of the facilities in France
with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This
collaboration has existed for many years and will be continued in the
future.

Local environmental impact
Air pollution and noise
In addition to addressing the issues of dust and noise, HeidelbergCement faces a challenge in terms of the air pollutant emissions of
the cement business line. Whereas dust and noise are emitted from
different points in the production process, nitrogen oxides, sulphur
oxides, heavy metals, and other airborne pollutants are mainly emitted
from kilns. These pollutant emissions are regularly measured and
checked to ensure the approval requirements are being met.
In 2016 we continued to make technical improvements to reduce the
emissions of dust, nitrogen oxides (NOX), and sulphur oxides (SO2). In
order to lower dust emissions, for example, we installed a fabric filter
into the clinker cooler in Geseke, Germany. Moreover, an electric filter
was replaced by a fabric filter at the Czech cement plant Radotin. Both
of the plant’s kilns are now equipped with state-of-the-art filters. To
reduce dust emissions, we have also invested in new and additional
fabric filters in the UK, China, and Bangladesh.
At the Ribblesdale cement plant in the UK, we upgraded the sulphur
oxide scrubber in order to meet new energy efficiency standards. At
the cement plant in Guangzhou, China, we put a new sulphur oxide
gas scrubber into operation in order to reduce emissions in line with
the latest standard.
Nitrogen oxide emissions were meanwhile cut in Lengfurt, Germany,
by installing an SCR (selective catalytic reduction) system. The SCR
system at the cement plant in Rezzato, Italy, has been in operation now
for two years. It keeps emissions at the plant low while ensuring the
highest levels of energy efficiency.

In September 2015, the USA introduced new National Emission
Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP). In order to be able
to meet them, we implemented measures for monitoring and reducing
dust, mercury, hydrochloric acid, and hydrocarbon emissions at all of
our plants in the USA in 2015. This also applies to the Italcementi
plants in the USA. However, the measures have not been completely
implemented at one of the Italcementi locations because the raw
material used there varies greatly in its organic composition. This considerably complicates the monitoring and reduction of hydrocarbon
emissions. We expect to implement the necessary measures during
2017.
In 2016, activities at our aggregates business line continued to focus
on reducing noise and dust emissions. For example, we replaced the
old primary crusher at the facility in Slapy, Czechia, resulting in greater
efficiency and less noise as well as dust emissions. At the quarry in Bíl
Kámen, we replaced the old screening plant with a new, more efficient
and dust-proof system.

plans include concepts and measures for reducing water consumption
in order to ensure the sustainable use of scarce water resources. In
addition, the plans aim to involve external local stakeholders in order
to ensure the water utilisation concepts promote the common good
so that local water risks are minimised. We will begin this process at
those locations where water scarcity is an especially urgent problem.
In recent years, we have also introduced a water reporting system at all
of our company’s cement plants. As a result, we have been able to report
reliable consumption figures for the second year in a row. By the end of
2016, HeidelbergCement had also equipped half of its cement plants
with water recycling systems. The specific water consumption
amounted to roughly 300 litres per tonne of cement in 2016. This
figure also includes the newly acquired Italcementi plants.
In Hong Kong, we modernised the dust filters at our ready-mixed concrete plants so that they meet the new emissions limit of 10 mg/cbm.
In addition, the main production facilities of the Sg Besi plant in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia, have been completely enclosed since 2016. This
reduces dust emissions and improves the plant’s appearance.
Water management
HeidelbergCement has committed itself to the goal of mitigating
the impact of its activities on natural water resources to the greatest
extent possible. We comply with stringent environmental regulations
to ensure that our raw material quarrying will not endanger local
bodies of surface water and ground water resources.
In 2014, a global water-risk study supplied us with fundamental information for the creation of a Group-wide guideline concerning sustainable water management in the cement, aggregates, and ready-mixed
concrete business lines. The study showed that 14.3% of our plants
are located in regions that are officially defined as suffering from water
scarcity, i.e. regions where less than 1,000 m3 of water is available
per person each year. In response to this situation, we began developing individual water management plans for these facilities in 2015
and want to extend this measure to all of these plants by 2030. The

42

Targets

HeidelbergCement I Sustainability Report 2016

In 2015, we started to introduce these indicators at our aggregates
and ready-mixed concrete business lines as well. However, we are only
collecting this information in regions suffering from water stress, due
to the large number of plants involved. In this context, water stress
means that less than 1,700 m3 of water are available per person
each year. This information will be collected at all of our plants in the
affected regions by 2030.
To reduce water consumption, we launched measures at a variety of
Group locations in 2016. At the Spy Hill quarry in Canada, for example, we relocated the water collection tanks to the lowest-lying areas
of the site so that quarry water and rainwater can be optimally collected in order to reduce the use of fresh water.

At the ready-mixed concrete business line, the focus was on the recovery of process water and residual concrete. In Georgia, for example,
we installed a recycling system in our new plant in Tbilisi. In Croatia,
we built a new settling basin at the plant in Vinkovci and modernised
the existing recycling system at the Donja Bistra plant. In Australia, we
optimised our water recycling measures nationwide.
Waste materials
Our primary focus in terms of waste management concerns the kiln
dust that is a by-product of clinker production. This dust has to be
removed from the kiln systems at several facilities in order to prevent
disruptions to proper kiln operations. We generally use the kiln dust
as an alternative raw material in cement production, thereby improving
our ecological efficiency. In some exceptional cases, the composition
of the dust prevents us from being able to recycle it 100%. A second
possibility for us is to use the kiln dust as a raw material for the
production of special concrete. If no other option is available, it can
be deposited in underground landfills in a controlled process. The
local operating permit at each plant specifies the allowable amount
of process-related waste products and how it is to be used.

HeidelbergCement strives to ensure compliance with sustainability
standards in the supply chain. Group-wide procurement guidelines
therefore provide clear instructions regarding supplier relationships
and procurement activities. The most important tool for this purpose
is the Supplier Code of Conduct. We consistently communicate this
code to our global and local suppliers, who are obligated to act in line
with the principles defined in the Code. The Code incorporates the key
elements of the SA 8000 International Social Accountability Standard,
the ISO 14001 international environmental standard and the principles of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). If a supplier fails to
abide by the Code and does not correct a weakness or deficiency that
has been identified, this can result in the termination of the contractual
relationship.

Within the framework of a working group in the international Cement
Sustainability Initiative (CSI), HeidelbergCement is also helping to
establish a standardised approach to sustainable supply chain management in the cement industry. The working group has developed a
joint catalogue of principles that are based on the UN Global Compact
and ILO standards and are continually reviewed and improved. This
Sustainable Supply Chain Management Guide encompasses the following topic areas:

Transparency and integrity

On the whole, HeidelbergCement made major progress in 2016 with
regard to the systematic management and assessment of its suppliers.
The basis for the continuous improvement of the supply chain’s sustainability performance is provided by an online supplier management
platform that has already been introduced in several countries and is
currently being prepared for global rollout. This platform simplifies the
systematic recording and consolidation of supplier data as well as its
assessment in accordance with the sustainability aspects addressed
in our Supplier Code of Conduct.

Targets

Key Figures

The roadmap for 2017
In 2017, we want to improve our supplier management not only by rolling out the online platform but also by pursuing three key objectives.
Firstly, HeidelbergCement will once again critically review its Supplier
Code of Conduct. If any potential for improvement is discovered, the
Code will be updated accordingly. Secondly, we will further optimise
the supplier management platform by introducing automatic interfaces
to externally accessible databases that monitor the suppliers’ sustainability performance. In this way, we will incorporate external expertise
for evaluating the suppliers on the basis of pre-defined criteria. Such
external databases have already been successfully used in some of
the major countries in which our Group does business and they will be
introduced worldwide, beginning in 2017. Moreover, we will establish
processes for the automated and targeted monitoring of supplier risks
in certain regions or categories. Thirdly, we will develop a concept for
standardised, physical supplier audits and on-site inspections. These
measures will augment the automated controls and ensure that the
sustainability standards and the Code are actually, transparently, and
sustainably adhered to throughout the supply chain.

In 2016, we laid the groundwork for
sustainable supplier management.
In 2017, we now have to begin implementing the new standards and
processes throughout the Group.

More than 60,000 women and men work for HeidelbergCement
worldwide. Their achievements make us one of the leading companies in our sector. That’s why it is crucial to provide them with
good and attractive working conditions. As a manufacturing
company, we place a high priority on occupational safety and the
protection of our employees’ health.

Law-abiding and ethical behaviour is a key requirement of good leadership and the conduct of each and every employee. This is why the
Managing Board has approved a Code of Conduct that is binding
throughout the Group. This Code specifies our values and the ethical
and legal standards that apply at our company. In particular, this includes non-discriminatory employment conditions and an open and
fair dialogue with employee representatives.

Principles

HeidelbergCement is also committed to upholding the ILO’s Core
Labour Standards, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises,
and the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We have also
enshrined this commitment in our Leadership Principles. We expect
our employees and our business associates worldwide to act in conformance with these key guidelines and recommendations.

For us, a good human resources policy means having due and proper
regard for our employees with their range of talents and wealth of experience. And it therefore means creating the best conditions for them
to do their job with efficiency and dedication. This includes fair remuneration, tailor-made qualification opportunities, a non-discriminatory
working environment and flexible conditions that allow them to reconcile professional and family demands. As a manufacturing company,
we also place high priority on occupational safety and the protection
of our employees’ health. We are proud of the international workforce
at our headquarters and in our technical centres in Heidelberg and
Leimen, which comprises local managers and employees from over
40 countries. Our employees form the foundation of the worldwide
success of HeidelbergCement.
Our Leadership Principles prescribe binding rules for personnel management. They concern, for example, respectful behaviour towards
co-workers, employee development, and a commitment to our company’s strong feedback culture. The main leadership principles are
embedded in standard human resources processes and described in
detail in HeidelbergCement’s Human Resources Guidelines.

Integration of Italcementi
Following the acquisition of Italcementi on 1 July 2016, a key area of
focus for human resources has been to integrate the new employees.
We view differences between the corporate cultures as an opportunity
to learn from each other, combine our respective strengths, and work
together on a joint corporate culture.
In order to discover how each corporate culture is perceived, we
conducted a “cultural baselining” survey among the employees of
Italcementi and HeidelbergCement. The results of the survey, which
had a response rate of 79%, showed that there are very few differences
between the way the cultures are perceived internally and externally.
HeidelbergCement was seen as “fair” and “transparent” throughout
the company. For us, this is an important indication that our policy of
open communication during the acquisition has laid the foundations
for successful integration.

We also run intercultural training courses and team-building workshops to promote mutual understanding and integration. Under the
banner of “Grow Together” various integration meetings with managers and specialists have been held for employees from Group
functions in Heidelberg and Bergamo.

We conduct regular employee surveys — known as “pulse checks” —
to gauge the degree of employee satisfaction with the integration
process. Each survey is sent to over 2,000 employees in all the units
and countries affected. The response rate has been consistently
around 60%. At the last pulse check, in December 2016, over 90%
of respondents said they recognised the economic benefits of the
acquisition. The same proportion expects the integration process to
be a success.
Responses to the pulse check survey also help us make fast and
targeted improvements to the integration process. For example, 10%
of the surveyed employees said they would prefer more-frequent
in-house information on the integration process. In response, management has stepped up communications. In our employee magazine, we
regularly inform employees of the results of the pulse check surveys
and of progress in the integration process.

Organisational adaptations
In the reporting year, we have continued to adapt the organisational
structure in the former Italcementi countries on the basis of our own
well-established country structure. In the area of human resources,
activities focused on the introduction of key processes on a Group-wide
basis as of 1 January 2017 and on the integration of individual human
resources departments within the global human resources organisation. Other key tasks at human resources were the closure of Italcementi
locations with Group functions in Bergamo and Paris, and the relocation of key functions to Heidelberg. Moreover, in line with the reorganisation of Group areas, we have started the process of relocating
regional functions from Brussels and Oslo to Heidelberg.
We have also taken a major step towards our goal of integrating highly
qualified employees within the workforce at administrative headquarters and our technology centres in Heidelberg and Leimen, where
40 employees from Italcementi are now working.
This successful process of integration is also reflected in our European
Works Council. A joint negotiating committee made up of representatives from the two European works councils of Italcementi and
HeidelbergCement had already been established in September 2015.
Its principal task was to conduct consultation and information procedures with company management and to prepare for the amalgamation of the two European works councils. Following new elections
in August 2016, the new and enlarged European Works Council was
constituted at the regular annual meeting in September 2016.

Development of workforce numbers worldwide
At the end of 2016, HeidelbergCement employed a total of 60,424
women and men (2015: 45,453). This increase of 14,971 employees
was essentially due to the acquisition of Italcementi. Some 15,150
employees joined the Group as a result of the initial consolidation of
Italcementi. In addition, the workforce in Australia increased by around
250 employees through the acquisition of the aggregates company
Rocla Quarry Products and the insourcing of truck drivers. Due to our
generally positive business development in the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, a further 420 employees joined
our workforce. This was offset by the reduction of around 930 jobs,
particularly in North America, Norway, Poland, Georgia, Kazakhstan,
Indonesia, India, Malaysia, and sub-Saharan Africa.
Dialogue with employee committees
HeidelbergCement has a long tradition of employee co-determination, which has demonstrated its worth at our business locations in
Germany. The employee committees at the individual locations constitute the Central Works Council and its associated committees for
the company and for the Group Works Council. Moreover, employees
are equally represented on the Supervisory Board.
Managers and employee representatives engage in a continuous, constructive dialogue on the European Works Council. The council supplements the information and consultation processes that take place
on a local level in the various European countries.
In addition, there are labour unions and similar organisations in nearly
all countries in which HeidelbergCement operates. As required by our
Code of Conduct, we also engage in a fair and open dialogue with their
representatives.

Key Figures

In the event of reorganisation or job cuts, we work in close consultation with employee representatives to achieve a socially acceptable
solution. For example, we initially examine the possibility of transferring employees within the Group. If this proves impracticable, we try to
cushion the individual impact by means of retraining, early-retirement
schemes, outplacement, and severance payments. In the case of the
closure of the Italcementi Group headquarters, for example, a comprehensive social plan was negotiated with employee representatives and
trade unions. This comprised detailed provisions either for a transfer
to Group headquarters in Heidelberg or to the Italian country organisation, or for severance from the company.

Remuneration policy and work time regulation
Our remuneration systems are based on performance and results, in
accordance with the market standards for internationally operating
companies in our sector. In addition to fixed salaries, which are specified by collective bargaining agreements or individual employment
contracts, our employees also receive variable remuneration elements
that depend on individual job performance and the success of the
company.
We want the variable component to make up a large share of our
managers’ total remuneration package so that the connection between
their personal performance and the company’s success is directly
reflected. For the period from 2016 to 2018/19, we have created a
Group-wide, long-term bonus plan for the 190 executives from our
top management level. This bonus plan pursues the same objective as
the long-term bonus plan for the Managing Board.
The employees of our foreign subsidiaries profit from attractive remuneration systems that correspond to the conditions of the respective
local labour markets. Collective regulations apply to more than half of
the Group’s employees.

Personnel costs and social benefits
Expenditures for wages, salaries, social security, pension contributions, and social assistance increased by 17.6% to €2,674 million
(2015: €2,274 million). This corresponds to 17.6% of revenue (2015:
16.9%). The rise in personnel costs is essentially the result of the acquisition of Italcementi as of 1 July 2016 and of effects due to further
changes in the scope of consolidation.
The amount of the contribution to the pension scheme at HeidelbergCement corresponds to accepted market standards. In Germany, we
have created a matching model for the pension scheme, with contributions from the employer and the employees. In countries without
statutory retirement or health insurance, we support our employees at
least in line with local practices.
Work time regulation
In our work time regulation practices, we conform to the legal requirements in effect at our locations. We promote adherence to these
regulations by means of our compliance system, which enables employees to individually report possible violations (passive monitoring).
To promote flexible work time options, we offer models such as flexitime, work time accounts, part-time positions, and leaves of absence
to our employees in Germany. Older employees have the option of
switching to pre-retirement part-time work. Part-time work currently
accounts for 11.4% (2015: 11.0%) of all positions at HeidelbergCement AG and for 2.4% (2015: 2.2%) of the positions at the Group
as a whole.

Occupational health and safety
Occupational health and safety have top priority at HeidelbergCement
and are, in fact, two of our main corporate values. Our stated objective is to minimise the risk of accidents and injuries, and the risk of
occupational illness, by means of effective preventative measures.

Group standards
In 2016, we further improved the Group’s technical and organisational safety standards and strengthened the company’s safety culture.
In particular, we focused on work in enclosed spaces, such as silos,
and formulated a new Group standard for this purpose. We have also
used the harmonisation of standards in the wake of the acquisition of
Italcementi to revise and modify all former Group requirements. Work
management systems corresponding to, for example, the common
international OHSAS 18001 standard have already been introduced
at most of our plants. These systems require site managers to employ
a structured approach involving plans, clear working rules, clearly defined responsibilities, and control procedures in order to ensure continuous improvement and to provide even more effective accident prevention. In 2016, we introduced management systems in accordance
with OHSAS 18001 at further plants in Russia, Estonia, Lithuania,
and Liberia, while other plants were able to renew their certification.

Worldwide, 80% of our operational locations now have occupational
health and safety management systems. Additional locations will
follow in 2017. The locations newly acquired from Italcementi have
all introduced an internal management system in recent years.
This system meets the requirements of the International Labour
Organization (ILO) and is regularly checked by internal auditors.
To enable us to identify and exploit further improvement potential,
we have also conducted, in addition to the required management
audits, a total of 64 Health & Safety Improvement Reviews worldwide
at locations with elevated accident figures.
Occupational safety as a management task
Even though we have been continuously improving the technical and
organisational aspects of occupational health and safety for many
years now and have further reduced accident frequency, serious accidents, and even deaths continue to occur at our facilities, and the
cause is often human error.
All of the management levels at HeidelbergCement are responsible
for occupational health and safety. Line managers are expected to set
an example in this area. To underline this fact, we shall once again be
holding a Group-wide training initiative in 2017. At the same time, we
emphasise in our Group Policy on Occupational Health and Safety that
every employee, contractor, and visitor is responsible for complying
with the occupational safety regulations.
Together with this Group guideline, we have also introduced a series
of basic rules that are binding for all employees and contractors. These
basic rules relate to actual accident black spots that are already covered by our Group standards but still demand constant vigilance. In
2016, these basic rules were the subject of a high-profile information
campaign throughout the Group and were made part of the Group
Safety Week. The aim here was to ensure that the people concerned
remain aware of these risk areas and thereby to reduce the number of
accidents, especially those involving fatalities.

Our Group-wide Safety Week, which is held every year at the end of
September, has become an integral part of our company training activities. During this Safety Week, both our employees and our contractors receive occupational safety training and are made more aware of
dangerous situations. In a host of local events, all of which are initiated
and supported by line managers, we emphasise how important it is for
everyone to work together in order to ensure occupational health and
safety measures are effective. Among the various health and safety
issues that were addressed by these events in 2016, local units
focused particularly on work in enclosed spaces and safe driving.
We place a high priority on providing our employees with training
and instruction in the field of occupational health and safety. This is
reflected in the fact that 47% of all training hours are concerned with
this topic and that a number of our larger locations have now set up
special training centres where not only their own employees but also
those from external companies are instructed.

Occupational safety is a management
responsibility. However, all persons,
whether employees, contractors, or
visitors, are also required to ensure
that they are aware of the risks
involved in an activity so as to avoid
danger to themselves and others.

Accident management software
In 2015, we introduced software for the Group-wide registration of
accidents. This has proved its worth, leading to greater transparency
both for line managers and also for safety personnel. The software
has replaced local programmes and simplified the analysis of accident
causes. We also use it now to record and analyse near-accidents — especially those with the potential to be much more serious — so as to
be able to take more appropriate corrective or preventative measures.
We will further enhance the software so that it can be used for other
applications as well.
Development of accident figures
Compared to 2015, accident frequency in our core business fell by 9%
(not including Italcementi). Despite the reduction, we are still not satisfied with this result. In 2016, around 80% of all our locations were
accident-free (excluding Italcementi locations), and many of them have
remained so for a number of years. Overall, however, this improvement
is too small. Taking into account the locations newly acquired from
Italcementi as of 1 July 2016, accident frequency remained virtually
unchanged from the previous year. Our priority task is therefore to
provide more effective support for those locations at which accident
frequency in 2016 either increased significantly compared to the previous year or are on a high level overall.
Compared to 2015, the number of fatalities fell in the reporting year
(not including Italcementi). Nevertheless, we still had to report the
death of two of our own employees in 2016, who lost their lives as
a result of work accidents. In addition, we must also report the death
of five employees from external companies. At former Italcementi
locations there were fatalities involving two of our own employees
and two from external companies. These fatalities are a very painful
loss and clearly show that we still need to further intensify our efforts.
We analyse every fatality in depth and the Managing Board discusses
all such cases. Appropriate measures are then drawn up and shared
throughout the Group in order to prevent similar accidents from happening at other locations.

Occupational illnesses
The general sick rate has been low at HeidelbergCement for many
years, amounting to around 2% of all hours worked.
Most of the cases of occupational illness acknowledged in recent years
have involved noise-induced hearing impairment. In addition, some
employees suffered from back problems and other musculoskeletal
disorders.
To prevent job-related illnesses, we check our work sites for exposure
to factors hazardous to health and regularly conduct medical examinations of our employees. In countries with less-developed statutory
health care systems, our subsidiaries offer comprehensive health
check-ups for all employees and in some instances for their families.
In regions where HIV/AIDS, Ebola, or malaria frequently occur, the local units have set up programmes to advise the employees and inform
them of the risks. These services are mostly offered through our own
medical stations or the medical staff of in-house hospitals.

Human resources development
Talent management
Qualified, motivated employees are a key prerequisite for the longterm success of our company. That’s why our Group-wide human resources policy focuses on identifying and further developing highly
talented individuals and competing with other companies to retain
them. We use the HeidelbergCement competence model to do so. This
model defines the professional and personal talents and skills that are
crucial for our business success. It thus allows the respective supervisors to carry out systematic Group-wide evaluations of performance
and potential on the basis of standardised criteria. It also serves as
a basis for strategic executive development and effective succession

planning. Supervisors and employees hold structured appraisal interviews in which they discuss development opportunities and prospects.
The dialogue is primarily geared towards senior and middle management, experts and future executives. It helps us to attain three goals:
– To fill key positions worldwide with top-quality candidates from
within the company;
– To develop highly talented individuals in a targeted way;
– To bind employees to the Group over the long term by offering
individual development planning programmes.
Training and career development
Sustainable human resources work means investing in the systematic
training of our staff and thus in recruiting and training highly qualified young employees. In Germany as a whole, 5% of our employees
are involved in training programmes (2015: 5%). Around 91% of the
people who complete their traineeships are retained as permanent
employees (2015: 80%).
Technical and mechanical skills are indispensable for ensuring that
process engineering and maintenance activities are properly carried
out at our plants. Besides professional training, we therefore offer
master craftsman courses every year at the Verein Deutscher Zementwerke (VDZ). A number of years ago, we expanded our training programme through the addition of specially developed, multilingual
VDZ e-learning courses on cement production.
In the reporting year, our Aggregates Academy continued to offer
training and career development courses in the aggregates business.
All in all, more than 270 training courses were held in 18 countries,
ideally in the form of practically oriented instruction on site at our production locations. In 2016, the focus of training courses right across
the company’s hierarchy was on achieving continuous improvement
in production processes. The Aggregates Academy, whose trainers
are employees of our company, has also developed several e-learning
modules and video clips as well as printed and electronic handbooks.
These enable employees to learn on their own at their workplaces. We

53

have also introduced additional CREW training modules at our plants.
These focus on optimising the use of resources, including ways of
reducing fuel consumption when operating construction machinery.
Our Cement Academy, which is part of the HeidelbergCement Technology Center (HTC), offers seminars, training courses, and technical simulations for engineers from our cement plants worldwide. In
the reporting year, the range of training at the Cement Academy was
expanded through, for example, the addition of courses in maintenance at the master craftsman level. More than 600 employees from
43 countries took part in one of 38 training courses, which lasted
up to a week. 50 of the participants were employees of Italcementi.
In addition to these courses at the Cement Academy, we have also
introduced the Cement Manufacturing Curriculum — an e-learning
programme in several languages. More than 1,400 employees are
already registered for this programme.
As a rule, the training materials and courses at both academies are
offered in the employee’s native language. The training measures are
supported by local managers who themselves have been trained in
adult education techniques in line with the “train the trainer” concept.

The mission of the Aggregates
Academy is to promote technical
training and knowledge sharing.
It thereby supports continuous
improvement at our aggregates
sites and within our management
team globally.

As was the case in the previous year, occupational safety was a key
focus of our Group-wide training and career development programmes
in 2016. Around 47% (2015: 50%) of all the training measures were
devoted to this topic. Other focal points included specialist career development (31%; 2015: 30%) and advanced management training
(5%; 2015: 6%). On average, each of the Group’s full-time employees
spent 26 hours (2015: 31 hours) on training measures.
Our extensive training and career development programmes cover
nearly all areas of work and feature a practical and business-oriented
curriculum that enables our employees to increase their skills in a
targeted way.
Management training
The motivation and skills of our managers are key reasons why
HeidelbergCement occupies such a strong position in the global competitive field. In order to prepare managers for their future assignments
and challenges, we offer training courses that are specially tailored to
the needs of our company. Training is provided in classic disciplines
such as strategy, leadership, and management, and in technical issues
in, for example, the area of engineering. The standardised course content ensures that everyone at the company develops a shared understanding of strategy, leadership, and integrated management.
Securing and promoting young talent
The promotion of future executives continued to be a very important
objective during the reporting year. We always offer highly motivated
and qualified college graduates international training programmes that
focus on engineering, sales, finance, human resources, purchasing,
and IT. In each year since 2013, HeidelbergCement has been awarded
the seal of approval of the “Initiative für karrierefördernde und faire
Trainee-Programme” in recognition of the excellence of its programme
for the advancement of future executives. As a member of the Fair
Company Initiative, we have committed ourselves since 2004 to
create fair working conditions for interns and job starters, and have
carried the Fair Company seal of approval since then.

Key Figures

In 2016, we hired a total of 256 (2015: 296) college graduates. At
present, 875 (2015: 828) employees are participating in programmes
that prepare them for higher-level tasks.
In 2011, we launched a pilot project in Europe and Central Asia that
prepares high-quality engineers from the cement business line for
higher-level engineering positions. After completing the introductory
Engineer in Training programme, the participants then spend several
years going through precisely defined rounds of technical training at
various plants in Germany and abroad. This training is supplemented
by additional courses in management and leadership. Since 2013, we
have been expanding this programme to other Group areas, such as
Africa and Asia.
At the end of 2015, the Heidelberg Young Professionals (HEYP) network was set up in Germany. The aim of this network, which is run by
employees, is to promote the exchange of knowledge and information
between different areas of the company and to support the personal
and professional advancement of its members.

Diversity management
Generation management
Like other companies, HeidelbergCement is also faced with the consequences of demographic change. Around 12% (2015: 14%) of our
employees are younger than 30. Most of our employees are aged
30 to 49; they constitute about 52% (2015: 51%) of the Group’s total
workforce. A total of 36% (2015: 35%) of our employees are over 50.
This age group’s share of the workforce will rise in many countries in
future.

We are responding to this development with numerous regionally
adapted measures that are intended to maintain the employees’ ability
to work and to promote cooperation between people of different generations. In Germany, for example, we have further expanded our range
of health management services and consolidated them in our FIT for
LIFE initiative. Besides encompassing a preventative programme for
the early detection of illnesses and risk factors, the initiative primarily
helps employees take a proactive approach to leading a healthy life.
In 2016, the emphasis was on check-ups for skin cancer, flu vaccinations, special Health Days, and presentations on health-related issues. In future, our health management activities will continue to focus
on preventing typical age-related health risks and raising employees’
awareness of this issue. As a result, we particularly promote company
sports activities for people of all ages.

The international character of our management team enables us to
benefit from a varied spectrum of experiences in different cultures and
thus to react more flexibly to global challenges and also satisfy the
needs of local markets. Local managers hold around 76% of all of our
senior management positions.

Diversity as a success factor
When putting together teams of employees, it is our Group-wide human resources policy to place a priority on diversity. We see diversity
as a management concept that brings together people with different
cultures, personalities, skills, and experiences in such a way as to
reflect the international and multiform character of our markets, our
customer base and our business environment. We achieve this goal
by:
– Appointing local country management in order to create an international leadership team;
– Maintaining an international workforce at corporate headquarters;
– Ensuring a complementary composition of the management and
the various teams (nationality, skills, experience, age, gender,
etc.);
– Ensuring the percentage of women in leadership positions is as
high as women’s share of our entire German workforce.

In early 2013, we signed the Diversity Charter as an affirmation of
all our activities in this area to date and as a public statement of our
respect for diversity. To mark the German Diversity Day in 2016, we
held a Diversity Week at our headquarters in Heidelberg, featuring a
wide range of lectures, panel discussions, and workshops.

The goal is to recruit and promote highly qualified, top-performing
employees worldwide and to harness their various social and professional skills so as to contribute to our company’s business success.

55

Targets

HeidelbergCement I Sustainability Report 2016

We make sure that employees from the countries in which we operate
are represented in the workforce at our Group headquarters. We benefit greatly from their knowledge of local markets, and their presence
makes it easier to work with colleagues on site. Of the 616 employees
at our Group headquarters and the technology centres (Competence
Center Materials and HeidelbergCement Technology Center) in Heidelberg and Leimen, 433 are from Germany and 183 are from 41 other
countries all over the world.

www.charta-der-vielfalt.de/en

Women in leadership positions
At our company, we believe diversity also means that when we are
hiring to fill management positions, the ratio of women to men should
reflect the corresponding ratio in our workforce as a whole. In 2016,
women accounted for 13% of the total Group workforce and for 10%
of senior managers.
In Germany, HeidelbergCement and other DAX-listed companies
signed a voluntary commitment in 2011. As a result, we committed
ourselves to more than double the share of women in management
positions in Germany: from 7% in the base year of 2011 to 15% in
2020. In 2016, women accounted for 16% of our total workforce in
Germany and held 7% of leadership positions in the top, senior, and
middle management.

We have rigorously committed ourselves to the promotion of women
in recent years and achieved notable successes in this area. In Germany as a whole, for example, the share of women in programmes for
the advancement of future executives was 28% in 2016 (2015: 24%)
and thus significantly higher than the percentage of women in the total
workforce. The global initiative “NOW — Network of Women”, which
was launched by HeidelbergCement in 2011, connects female employees around the world on a virtual and personal level and supports
their career development as well as promoting women in general.

As of 2015, according to the law for the promotion of women in
leadership positions, companies in Germany have to specify concrete
targets for the two management levels below the Managing Board.
The first of these two levels consists of those HeidelbergCement
executives who report directly to the Managing Board, while the second
level encompasses their employees with leadership responsibilities.
This means that by 30 June 2017, we want women to hold 14%
of the positions on the first management level below the Managing
Board and 15% of the positions on the second level. In 2015, when
this target was formulated, women accounted for 15% of the total
workforce.
In 2016 in Germany, women held 10% of the positions on the first
management level below the Managing Board, as in the previous year;
on the second level of management, the share also remained constant
at 9%. This is due to an increase in the number of technical positions,
for which the proportion of men is higher than that of women. Excluding Italcementi, the proportion of women on the first management
level below the Managing Board was 12% in 2016, and 10% on the
second level.

HeidelbergCement I Sustainability Report 2016

In addition, we have conducted analyses of equal pay for men and
women in several large countries, including the USA and the United
Kingdom, and also at our Group headquarters. The results show
that for employees doing comparable jobs with comparable areas of
responsibility there are no systematic differences in the level of pay
for men and women.
Reconciling work and family
In competing for the best employees, we are making adjustments
worldwide in line with changing lifestyles. To help our employees reconcile family and professional demands, we are implementing models
such as flexitime, part-time work, and leaves of absence. Given the
small size of our facilities, it has proved more effective to cooperate
with external networks for the provision of support such as daycare
centres, care for family members who require assistance, and summer
camps for children. This enables our employees to benefit from easy
access to a professional and flexible network at affordable costs. As
part of our FIT for FAMILY initiative, we have formed partnerships with
daycare centres for our location in Heidelberg. In this way, we can offer
a number of daycare slots specifically for our employees.

As a global Group with strong regional business operations, we
act according to the principle “Think globally, act locally”. Our
business operations also create added value for the communities
at our locations around the world. And we do more than simply
conduct business in these communities; we also take measures
that protect the environment and promote social progress.

Creating local value
Good cooperative relationships with the communities in the areas
where we are active are indispensable for our business operations
and also one of the keys to our business success. Here, we establish
business contacts, capitalise on local know-how, and maintain a dialogue with our neighbours. Our materiality analysis has confirmed that
good relations with local communities are extremely important, especially from the viewpoint of our internal stakeholders. That’s why
we will take local communities into account to a greater extent in our
revised Sustainability Ambitions.
Materiality analysis: p. 17

We aim to create value not only for our company but also for the
communities in which we operate. Wherever possible, we therefore
make sure that local employees are selected to manage operations
at our locations. Over the past three years, local managers have held
76% of the senior management positions at our various sites. All of
our plants work closely with local suppliers and service providers, and
we invest around 90% of our procurement volume in the immediate
vicinity of our plants or within the respective countries. In this way,
and through the creation of jobs, we contribute to creating value at
our locations and promote economic development by means of wages,
investment, purchases, and taxes.

Corporate citizenship
As a company, we are also a part of society, and we benefit from the
regional networks at our locations worldwide. We therefore also play
an active role in addressing social issues.
This understanding of our role forms the basis for our Group-wide
Corporate Citizenship Guideline, which lays down the general criteria and objectives relating to our social responsibility. We revised
the guideline in 2015. We paid special attention here to corporate
citizenship activities in conjunction with investment projects, as such
activities could be misconstrued as an attempt to exert influence. The
reworked guideline therefore expressly requires compliance with the
relevant stipulations of our Anti-Corruption Guideline.
Our social responsibility focuses on three areas in which our core competencies enable us to benefit others the most and achieve noticeable
improvements:
– Construction, architecture, and infrastructure: We offer practical
assistance in construction projects by providing materials, time,
financial assistance, and know-how.
– Environment, climate, and biodiversity: We support initiatives that
address the most significant environmental impacts associated
with our business operations.
– Education, training, and culture: Here, we tailor our activities to
the specific needs of each region.
We have also defined certain evaluation criteria in order to ensure that
these activities are both transparent and effective. We support projects, initiatives, and organisations that are active at our locations, or
to which we have a direct link. We also make sure that the guidelines
and principles of such organisations are in accordance with our own
corporate philosophy.

The decisions regarding our support of projects in individual countries
or at our locations are made decentrally by country managers on the
basis of a predefined budget. These managers are also responsible for
implementing and controlling projects as well as for local reporting.
Given our many locations and the variety of activities that we support,
it is not possible at present to make a statement as to the financial
commitment of this involvement.
Our Group-wide CSR expert group has begun documenting our various corporate citizenship activities. On the basis of this work, the
Group approved a community relationship management handbook in
2016. The purpose of this handbook is to systematically catalogue
relations to local communities and charitable projects by the company and to make these more transparent. In particular, the aim is to
strengthen the dialogue with local interest groups, especially in developing countries, and to create a sustainable socio-economic value for
local communities at our locations.

gates was thus deemed as being in compliance with international law,
since it brings benefits for the Palestinian population and makes hardly
any impact on local resources.
The Palestinian people benefit economically from our quarrying activities, as these create valuable jobs in an area otherwise plagued by high
unemployment. Palestinians from the occupied territories account for
more than 60% of the workforce in our quarry in the West Bank, and
the wages we pay them are many times higher than the local average.

Lehigh Hanson supports home building for families in need
In Johnston County, North Carolina, our US subsidiary Lehigh Hanson
is supporting the organisation Habitat for Humanity, which builds
houses for low-income families in the region. Over the past two years,
a dedicated team of workers from the Princeton Quarry in North Carolina has been helping with construction work and has also donated,
together with local management, US$65,000 for the construction of
a further house.

Local conflicts of interest
In recent years, allegations have been made that the business operations of a quarry belonging to our Israeli subsidiary and located in the
area of the West Bank occupied and administered by Israel (Area C)
are not in conformance with international standards. A lawsuit filed
by an Israeli human rights organisation concerning the general cessation of aggregates mining by foreign companies in Israeli-occupied
territory was, however, dismissed by the Supreme Court of Israel in a
legally binding ruling on 26 December 2011. The quarrying of aggre-

We have carefully examined this issue with our local management
team. Our subsidiary also takes care to ensure that Israeli and Palestinian employees are treated and paid equally. Here, we place high
priority on close cooperation in intercultural teams that promote an
exchange between our Israeli and Palestinian employees and thus
understanding between these two groups in a conflict-ridden region.
Moreover, our quarrying activities have virtually no impact on the
existing raw material reserves in the region, which will last for several
centuries.
We received all the required permits, without exception, before we
commenced our quarrying activities. In addition, there has never been
a single instance in which we continued our quarrying activities without permission, and no such instances will ever occur in future.
We respond in a transparent manner to all enquiries from non-governmental organisations and interest groups. Furthermore, we are holding
a dialogue with individual investors on the development of this issue
and are offering both face-to-face talks with local leaders and employees as well as tours of the facility.

About this report
HeidelbergCement is publishing a Group Sustainability Report for the eighth time. In this publication
we explain how HeidelbergCement is fulfilling its economic, environmental and social responsibilities
and report on the progress we have made in 2016 in the implementation of our Sustainability Ambitions. The report targets our employees, investors and analysts, business partners, as well as political
players and non-governmental organisations.
G4-18, G4-24
Report content and organisation
This sustainability report has been prepared according to the GRI G4 guidelines of the internationally
recognized Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). The report conforms to the requirements of the “Core”
option of the GRI G4 guidelines.
Our complete GRI Index: www.heidelbergcement.com/GRI-index
Our decisions concerning the most important sustainability themes for the articles in our report were
guided by the GRI principles (materiality, inclusion of stakeholders, sustainability context, completeness). We continuously refine our reporting processes in line with these standards.

Key Figures

The key economic figures included in this report correspond to those in the consolidated financial
statements and the management report of HeidelbergCement’s Annual Report for 2016. This is also
the case for the facts and figures concerning our workforce. In 2016, we adjusted the consolidation of
the key environmental figures to the new international accounting standards, which have been valid
since 2014. In accordance with this revenue consolidation process, joint ventures are no longer taken
into account. This has also been applied retroactively. This step has led to changes in our key environmental figures.
G4-17, G4-22
You can find information about the indicator G4-17 in the Annual Report 2016, pp. 261–291
We report our key figures for environmental performance and occupational safety according to the
guidelines of the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) of the World Business Council for Sustainable
Development (WBCSD).
The guidelines in their original wording: www.wbcsdcement.org/publications
Some of the key figures on environmental protection and occupational safety from the cement business line were once again subject to an independent limited assurance and are now explicitly marked
as such in this report. As a member of CSI, we are required to have these key figures reviewed. The
review also fulfils the wish of our stakeholders to have key indicators independently verified.
G4-27
The results of this audit can be found on our website:
www.heidelbergcement.com/assurance

The importance of some of the topics shifted last year due to the results of our dialogue with our
stakeholders as well as changed political framework conditions and new legislation. We have also
reorganised the report’s chapters in line with these changes. The production and product issues
that were previously combined in the chapter on the environment have now been split up. The new
chapter “Product and innovation” describes our efforts with regard to innovative, sustainability-oriented
product development. The chapter “Production and supply chain” makes it clear that our responsibility
for the environment and society is not limited to a few production processes, but also encompasses
the supply chain. In addition, we have created a separate chapter to take into account the relevance
of legally compliant business operations that are based on international standards. This chapter also
addresses the issue of human rights.
G4-23
Materiality analysis: pp. 17 f.

Data collection
Methods and systems that have been defined Group-wide are used to collect data at our business
locations. Internal reporting and consolidation of the data take place via centralised electronic KPI data
management systems at the Group; here the key figures are checked for completeness and credibility.
Uniform Group-wide definitions of all the relevant key figures, as well as process guidelines for the
reporting processes, are available on the intranet.

Precise definition and methodology of the report
This Sustainability Report for 2016 deals with the business year 2016 of the HeidelbergCement Group.
The business year ran from 1 January to 31 December. After its acquisition by HeidelbergCement,
the company Italcementi has been fully consolidated since 1 July 2016. Unless stated otherwise, all
of the figures in this Sustainability Report for 2016 include Italcementi’s business contribution since
1 July 2016.
G4-22

Disclaimer of liability
We have compiled the information and key figures contained in this report with extreme care. All of
the contents of this report were examined by the employees responsible for this task. However, we
cannot completely exclude the possibility that this report includes erroneous information. The report
and the information contained in it do not constitute a test of compliance with the current laws, legal
regulations or recognised sustainability practices in the industry.
