About this report

About this report

"Act responsibly. Enable sustainability.“ is the title of our latest CR
report. We chose this title to emphasize our commitment to sustainable
activity along the entire value chain and to highlight the potential that
our products and services hold when it comes to addressing environmental, economic and social challenges.
Deutsche Telekom has been involved in CR reporting for more than
20 years. The CR report is a central communication tool for keeping our
internal and external stakeholders informed of the challenges we face
and the progress we have made as a responsible company committed
to sustainability. The latest report focuses on the key activities and
developments in 2016.
Reporting period, scope of application and target
groups
All quantative data and figures as well as all relevant results and activities pertain to 2016. Any deviations are marked accordingly. The 2016
CR Report is a Group report that includes many national companies in
which Deutsche Telekom holds a majority stake. This report ties in with
the 2015 CR Report.
The current report specifically addresses Deutsche Telekom's stakeholders. These include analysts and investors, CR ranking and rating
agencies and NGOs as well as customers, employees, business partners and representatives from the worlds of business, science, research,
education and politics.
Looking back on Deutsche Telekom’s CR reporting
Deutsche Telekom has been reporting on its sustainability activities
in various publications since 1996. From 2003 through 2006 we published a combined annual HR and Sustainability Report. An interim
report issued in 2007 formed the transition to our current CR reporting.
Since 2008 the Telekom Group has been publishing a comprehensive
CR Report each year.
Our online report: Focal points and context
We have been publishing our CR Report exclusively online since the
2010/2011 reporting year to meet the requirements and user preferences of our stakeholders. The online 2016 CR Report has been
available since April 20, 2017 in German and English. Interest in our CR
report is high. This is reflected in the fact that more than 2,600 visitors
were still accessing our 2015 CR Report in February 2017.
The initial pages of each section start with an introduction and an overview of relevant events and developments on that topic. The subsequent
pages are structured as follows:

 Sustainability relevance: This explains what makes the topic significant to sustainable development and to Deutsche Telekom's longterm business success.
 Management approach: This section starts with an overview of the
key goals, measures and monitoring activities summarized in a
table. It then goes on to explain how Deutsche Telekom approaches
key sustainability topics, what its goals are and how it intends to
achieve them. The management tools, policies and guidelines used
to this end are presented, internal and external standards listed and
the latest organizational developments explained.
 Progress: Examples demonstrate how Deutsche Telekom has contributed to positive development in the the reporting period and
worked to prevent or reduce negative impacts.
The report also includes information on CR facts as well as special
pages for investors and rating agencies. These provide background
information on a variety of topics that can be accessed directly from the
text via links. Readers can also access the "CR facts" section at any time
by clicking in the footer. A download area, search and dialog functions
and an interactive benchmarking tool make it even easier to navigate
the report. What's more, the info cart lets readers select different
content and create a customized PDF file.
This year we will again be publishing a CR brochure on selected areas
in which we made progress during the reporting period. We have been
using the We Care app magazine to get a broad target group interested
in corporate responsibility and motivate them to participate.
Selection of key topics for the 2016 CR Report
We conducted an extensive materiality process to help us identify
material issues to be addressed in the report. The process is a regular
component of our annual CR reporting activities that helps us identify
the topics with maximum relevance for us and our stakeholders.
Structure of the current report
The online 2016 CR Report has been structured as a progress report.
It focuses on the essential developments during the reporting period,
which are discussed in five central reporting sections.

About this report
independenT AssurAnCe reporT

independent assuranCe report

independent prACtitioner’s limited AssurAnCe
report*
to deutsche telekom Ag, bonn
we have been engaged to perform a limited assurance engagement on
selected sustainability information marked with a symbol in the Corporate responsibility report of deutsche Telekom AG, bonn (here after
the “Company”) for the period from 1 January to 31 december 2016
(hereafter “Cr report”).
management’s responsibility
The Company’s management is responsible for the preparation and
presentation of the Cr report in accordance with the criteria as set out
in the G4 sustainability reporting Guidelines of the Global reporting
initiative (Gri) (hereafter the “Gri-Criteria”) and for the selection of the
information to be assessed.
This responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate
methods to prepare the Cr report as well as the use of assumptions
and estimates for individual sustainability disclosures which are reasonable in the circumstances. furthermore, the responsibility includes
designing, implementing and maintaining systems and processes
relevant for the preparation of theCr report, which is free of material
misstatements due to intentional or unintentional errors.
Audit Firm’s independence and Quality Control
we have complied with the German professional provisions regarding
independence as well as other ethical requirements.
The audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional
standards – in particular the professional Code for German public
Auditors and German Chartered Auditors (“berufssatzung für
wirtschaftsprüfer und vereidigte buchprüfer“: “bs wp/vbp”) as well
as the institut der wirtschaftsprüfer (“institute of public Auditors in
Germany; idw”): requirements to quality control for audit firms
(“entwurf eines idw qualitätssicherungsstandards 1 „Anforderungen an
die qualitätssicherung in der wirtschaftsprüferpraxis” (idw eqs 1)”) –
and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control
including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance
with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal
and regulatory requirements.
practitioner’s responsibility
our responsibility is to express an opinion on selected sustainability
information marked with the symbol in the Cr report based on our
work performed.

we conducted our work in accordance with the international standard
on Assurance engagements (isAe) 3000 (revised): “Assurance engagements other than Audits or reviews of historical financial information”
published by iAAsb. This standard requires that we plan and perform
the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance whether any
matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the
sections marked with in the Cr report has not been prepared, in
all material respects, in accordance with the Gri-Criteria.
in a limited assurance engagement the evidence-gathering procedures
are more limited than for a reasonable assurance engagement and
therefore significantly less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable
assurance engagement. The procedures selected depend on the
practitioner's judgement. This includes the assessment of the risks of
material misstatements in the Cr report with regard to the Gri-Criteria.
within the scope of our work we performed amongst others the following procedures:
 obtaining an understanding of the structure of the sustainability
organization and of the stakeholder engagement;
 inquiries of personnel involved in the preparation of the Cr report
regarding the preparation process, the underlying internal control
system and the selected sustainability information;
 examination of selected quantitative information for following
international group companies:






oTe A.e, Greece
Cosmote mobile Telecommunications s.A, Greece
hrvatski Telekom, Croatia
slovak Telekom, slovakia
T-mobile us, usA

 Analytical procedures on selected information of the Cr report;
 Comparison of selected sustainability information with corresponding data in the consolidated financial statements and in the group
management report ;
 Assessment of the presentation of selected sustainability information regarding the sustainability performance;
 Gaining further evidence for selected data of the Cr report due to
inspection of internal documents, contracts and invoices/reports
from external service providers.

within the scope of our engagement we did not perform an audit on
external sources of information or expert opinions, referred to in the Cr
report.

management and sustainability reporting:
 further harmonization and standardization of worldwide reporting

Strategy & management
Statement by the Chairman of the Board of Management

Statement by the Chairman of the
Board of Management
Dear Readers,
2016 was a successful year for Deutsche Telekom. We continued to
invest heavily and, once again, have grown strongly. At the same time,
we maintain our ambition to be the leading telecommunications provider in Europe. This also applies to our role as a responsible company.
In geopolitical terms, 2016 was full of turmoil and unrest. A year of isolationism in which all too many emphasized that what separates people
from each other and not what unites them. I believe this development is
wrong, in principle, given the many global challenges we are all facing:
be it climate change, the global prosperity gap, the refugee crisis or
cyber security.
I am convinced that these challenges can only be resolved through
mutual cooperation. Our corporate actions are also based on this principle: "Life is for Sharing" – this is who we are, and this is what we stand
for. We will not stand for hate or isolationism. Instead, our networks
create connections between people. They overcome boundaries. They
promote sharing. And they contribute to the creation of communities.

Timotheus Höttges, Chairman of the Board of Management, Bonn, Deutschland

In 2016, there were some positive signals for cross-border cooperation:
On January 1, 2016, the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) came into force. In November, the climate conference in
Marrakesh ratified the two degree target the international community
agreed upon a year earlier in Paris. Just like with many other challenges,
it is important that everyone works together to achieve these ambitious
goals: politics, civil society and economy.

Our philosophy: As a leading telecommunications provider, we take
our social responsibility seriously - today more than ever. With this in
mind, I would like to emphasize our commitment to the principles of the
United Nations Global Compact and the German Sustainability Code.

Already, many of our products, services and activities contribute to
greater sustainability. We are accounting for this process with the
CR Report at hand. And we demonstrate specific progress made in
reaching our sustainability targets.

Tim Höttges

I firmly believe that digitization provides an effective tool to reach our
common goals. It offers new opportunities to shape our coexistence
on this planet. After all, digital technologies are based on the idea that
boundaries can be overcome. And they are key for sustainable development. They can contribute, for instance, toward reducing greenhouse
gases, conserving resources and improving health care. Just one
example: Due to improved capacity utilization, our highly secure and
energy-efficient data centers require up to 80 percent less energy than
would be needed if customers operated this infrastructure individually.
But digitization goes hand in hand with data protection and security.
We are especially committed to this area as we are developing solutions
for secure e-mail traffic, protection against espionage for smartphones,
solutions against cyber attacks or educating about risks and protection
options.

Strategy & management
Values and Guiding Principles

Values and Guiding Principles

Corporate responsibility (CR) is based on shared values. To solidify our
value-based corporate culture, we convey the basic values of our company to all employees through binding Guiding Principles. We use
various measures such as the annual "Guiding Principles Day" to remind
employees of these values again and again, anchoring them in our
everyday work. These measures are successful: according to our Pulse
Survey in June of 2016, 77 percent of our employees believe that the
Guiding Principles are lived out in our everyday work. This is eight
percentage points up on the figure for last year (69 percent).
Our Code of Conduct and our Social Charter are other tools that we use
to ensure that our Group and our partners show corporate responsibility
in their conduct. Our compliance management system, which makes
sure that our business activities are in compliance with laws and regulations, is based on these documents.
7th Guiding Principles Day: Best place to perform
and grow
On September 29, 2016, we held our seventh Guiding Principles Day
across the Group. All of our employees were called upon to think about
our Guiding Principles independently and come up with ideas on how
to implement them in day-to-day work. Once again this year, many
different campaigns and team events were held across the Group such
as competitions, workshops, and panel discussions. For example, one
group of interns used the day as an opportunity to exchange ideas on
both the Guiding Principles and their relationships within the intern
group. While previous years each focused on one individual Guiding
Principle, in 2016 we focused on all five Guiding Principles under the
motto "Managing the Seven-Year Itch." The Guiding Principles were
introduced in 2009 – seven years ago – with the objective of defining
a common system of values for all Telekom employees worldwide.
At an event at our headquarters, employees in Bonn got to experience
the Guiding Principles live: there were a panel discussion, various workshops, and a recognition ceremony for "Guiding Principles Heroes"
headed by CHRO Christian Ilek. Employees could nominate colleagues
or even whole teams who had shown unique commitment to implementing the Guiding Principles within our company in advance. The event
was transmitted digitally, allowing all locations to follow the day. Besides
the many different team activities, central international campaigns also
took place. For example, in Denmark "Thank you e-cards" were sent to
colleagues as symbols of appreciation, while a story competition was
held in Slovakia with "success stories" related to implementing the
Guiding Principles.

Commitment to the German "Code of Responsible
Conduct for Business"
We were among the first to sign the German "Code of Responsible
Conduct for Business," which was presented to the public in November2010. All of the members of our Board of Management signed the
code, making an express commitment to responsible corporate
governance in line with the principles of the social market economy, to
fair competition, cooperation with employee representatives, business
excellence and sustainability. We have incorporated this commitment
into our actions and have assumed a leading role in putting our commitment into practice.
In the spirit of the code, we feel obligated to engage in sustainable
business practices and responsible corporate governance for the good
of the people. We are continuously working to ensure that these requirements are implemented in our core business and our supply chain.
In addition, we take responsibility for our employees and our social
environment. We work to guarantee respect for human rights without
exception.
We use our products and services to connect people and to increase
the productivity of many processes. In this way, we contribute to
ensuring that Germany and Europe can continue to make strides in
international competition and that our well-being can continue to grow.
Our smart, digital solutions create new ways to effectively address social
challenges such as climate change. Our goal: to simplify our lives for
the long term. Our network helps us implement this broad social mission by acting as a lifeline: fast, reliable, secure, and easily accessible
to everyone. Just like all of our activities, these efforts are focused on
people. We provide transparent information on our plans and technologies, engage in fair practices and are always open to dialog.
In line with the code, we continue to expand our leading position as a
sustainable company as well as our ongoing efforts to optimize our
value-added processes. To do so, for instance, we are increasing the
energy and resource efficiency of our networks, services, and products.
In this way we are reducing the environmental impact and CO2 emissions produced by our business activities. In 2014 our Board of Management approved a Group-wide climate protection target for 2020.
Building on this work, we have been implementing an integrated climate
strategy since 2015. We also offer our customers sustainable products
and services and encourage our over 30,000 suppliers to do business
with an equal focus on sustainability. To assist this process, we engage
in various activities such as a systematic supplier development program,
and complete audits and training measures. We also train our buyers on
sustainability criteria in procurement. In these efforts – just like in everything we do involving our diverse stakeholders – we primarily rely on
partnership and dialog.

As a responsible employer we give our employees the opportunity to
realize their potential and to contribute their individual strengths and
ideas within our Group. In view of the increasing significance of digitization, we promote virtual collaboration and new forms of work. We are
increasingly turning to digital learning methods when it comes to training and skills development. In 2016, over 30 percent of all hours of
training in our group were digital. The rate was even higher in Germany,
at over 35 percent. Modern formats like Massive Open Online Courses
(MOOCs), for which over 3,500 employees from more than 32 countries
registered by the end of 2016, have increased acceptance for new formats of collaboration and digital learning methods. Our social network
"You and Me" (YAM), which has around 115,000 users Group-wide,
replaced our previous "Telekom Social Network" and serves as the
central, dialog-based communication platform for our company. As
part of our Group-wide ideas management, we give our employees the
opportunity to contribute their ideas within our Group. In Germany
alone, one out of every eight employees submitted a new idea.
Our social commitment, however, is not just to our customers, partners
and employees. We feel it is our responsibility to support the development of media skills in our community and help young people become
more confident. Our efforts in this area include the "Teachtoday"
initiative, which promotes safe media proficiency. For example, around
150 children discussed the topic of data privacy at our 2016 Summit
for Kids. We have also been involved in the "Yes, I can!" initiative for
several years now. Since 2009 this initiative has given children and
young people from disadvantaged backgrounds an opportunity to
learn key skills for an independent and confident life through over
1,100 projects.

 Connecting the unconnected
 Low-carbon society
These form the framework for the focal topics within our sustainability
management: data security and data protection, digitization, sustainable supply chains, human rights, circular economy, resource conservation, and a responsible employer approach. Our CR program states
which specific goals we wish to achieve with which measures. We monitor our progress using key performance indicators (KPIs).
An integrated governance structure helps us to closely interlink strategic
management and operational implementation of our CR strategy
throughout the Group. Overall responsibility for sustainability lies with
the Deutsche Telekom Board of Management.

Our Corporate Responsibility (GCR) unit is a key driver for change
within our company. Within the organization, it reports to the Chief
Human Resources Officer. The duty of the GCR is to further develop
our corporate culture with a focus on sustainable innovation and social
responsibility.
Another pillar of our CR governance structure is the HR Leadership
Team (HR LT). The team is an advisory and decision-making body for
the Human Resources (HR) Board department. It makes decisions on
Group-wide policies and guidelines, CR positioning, and the strategic
focus of the CR department. Members of the HR LT are managers from
the level below the Chief Human Resources Officer.
In addition, the CR Board supports the CR department and the HR LT
when it comes to CR management and strategy enhancement.
The CR managers from the different business units and national
companies are responsible for implementing our CR strategy. They
collaborate intensively within the international CR Manager Network
where they coordinate their activities and share best practices.

CR Policy: International roll-out continues
Our CR Policy provides the mandatory framework for the sustainability
management activities at all Group units. After rolling out the policy at
Group Headquarters, Telekom Deutschland and T-Systems in 2014, we
introduced the policy at other major European national companies in
2015, including OTE in Greece, Magyar Telekom in Hungary, Hrvatski
Telekom in Croatia and T-Mobile Poland. Further national companies of
T-Systems will follow in 2016.
BE SMARTER! - New sustainability strategy 2016 - 2020
from Magyar Telekom
Our company aims to make sustainability an integral part of our business. We therefore developed a new sustainability strategy for the
period from 2016 to 2020 that was influenced by the expectations of
responsible investors, EU directives, industrial and corporate trends,
local conditions, and consumption patterns. Climate protection, education, and digitally enabled sustainability will be the major focus of the
strategy until 2020.
Climate protection
Our goal is to help our customers become climate conscious. Our
ambitious objective is to generate revenue from our climate protection
activities while at the same time reducing our actual CO2 emissions
below 100,000 tons. This enables us to enhance our emissiondecreasing activities and specifically build on our “green” services.
Education
Our goal is to directly or indirectly reach 100,000 people in Hungary
through our training program by 2020 with the aim of educating the public and our customers. We primarily focus on programs aimed at eliminating the digital gap and expanding the succession pool in industry.
Digitally enabled sustainability
As a sustainable digital company, Magyar Telekom enables its customers to use sustainable digital services. We strive to pursue responsible
marketing and activities that enable and inspire others. Awareness of
Magyar Telekom as a sustainable company is projected to reach 50%.
Certified health, safety, and environmental system:
almost all workplaces covered
We want to make sustainability a component of all our business processes and of our employee's everyday lives. Our health, safety and
environment (HSE) management system helps us make this possible.
The system is based on the international standards OHSAS 18001
for occupational health and safety and ISO 14001 for environmental
management.
Through our compliance with legal regulations, we meet the essential
requirements for OHSAS18001 certification in Germany. Outside of
Germany, 99 percent of our employees work at offices and facilities
covered by a certified health, safety and environmental (HSE) management system. Therefore, we have not yet fully reached our goal of having
all national companies outside of Germany with more than 50 employees certified. Certifications in China, India, and Italy are planned for
2017 in order to reach the full 100 percent mark. We verify certifications
with umbrella certificates and with separate certificates as well.
(See graphic.)

An HSE management system calls for systematic planning, implementation and improvement of operational processes in the areas of health,
safety and environment. This promotes the health of our employees and
has a positive effect on their performance. It is also beneficial when it
comes to bidding on new projects since an increasing number of potential customers now require their suppliers to provide HSE certificates.
CR Controlling helps steer our activities
Deutsche Telekom's CR Controlling department plays a key role in
controlling our CR activities. Controlling has been supported by an ITbased data collection system for the past seven years. The system
makes sure that ESG (environmental, social and governance) data and
KPIs are transparently recorded and reported. It supports standardized,
mandatory processes at the Group and national level and enables
Group-wide benchmarks. This IT support lets us focus on content
analysis of ESG data and helps us measure early on in the process to
what extent we have reached our CR targets and if we need to make
changes.
We especially use ESG data to calculate our ESGKPIs, with which we
measure and control our CR performance throughout the Group. CR
Controlling is also responsible for recording other performance indicators with sustainability relevance. These are published in the performance indicator section as well as in the CR report's interactive benchmarking tool.
We once again reviewed and added to our ESG KPIs in 2016. We now
include two new efficiency KPIs in our report: The Energy Intensity
ESG KPIand the Carbon Intensity ESG KPI. We also report the share
of renewable energy as anESG KPI for the first time in 2016. This will
enable us to better assess our performance and comply with increasing
external requirements on transparency in this area.
In this 2016 CR Report, we also cover the Enablement Factor ESG KPI
for the first time. The share of revenue with sustainability relevance,
which we reported for the first time last year, has also been included
under our ESG KPIs in this year's report. The performance indicator
section is complemented by an innovative look at total emissions at
Deutsche Telekom. An interactive graphic illustrates the source of all
Scope 1-3 emissions and shows related data at Group level.

Achieving more together: international
collaboration
How can international corporations put sustainability strategies into
practice across borders? Deutsche Telekom employs CR managers
for the relevant business segments and national companies to reach
this goal. Through the CR Manager Network, CR managers have been
attending regular face-to-face and online meetings since 2008 to share
ideas and promote essential CR topics.
At the 2015 CR Manager Meeting, participants resolved to improve
international and virtual collaboration in working groups. We began
implementing this goal in 2016: working groups set up regular web
meetings to work together on promoting key topics. The 16th CR
Manager Meeting took place on April 25 and 26, 2016 at The Hague.
Under the motto of "Achieve more together," participants discussed
the key issues of "joint crisis management" and "handling environmental
impacts," among other issues, in working groups. The second day
focused on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United
Nations and Deutsche Telekom's contribution to implementing them.

20

We have identified those SDGs that Deutsche Telekom's stakeholders,
e.g., investors, find particularly relevant and those to which we can
contribute significantly with our business model. Below you will find an
overview of the results of this relevance analysis. In 2017 we are planning to further advance this analysis process, e.g., by placing a stronger
focus on essential SDGs in our CR processes and reporting. We we will
also use the SDGs to prioritize measures in place at our company. SDGs
can also be useful in helping us illustrate the sustainability advantages
of our products, services and activities in our dialog with customers and
employees
In 2016 we compared our KPIs with the prioritized SDGs as part of our
2016 ESG KPI review in order to enable our progress to be measured.
All of these SDGs are already effectively covered by our ESG KPIs or
supplemental indicators, and we are planning to align them even more
in the future.
The following overview illustrates our contribution to the SDGs and
refers to specific examples from the current CR report.

We have offered an e-learning training unit on the issue of data collection since December of 2016. CR Managers from our national companies can use the training unit to gain information on the most frequent
challenges they face in data collection and commenting and obtain
valuable tips.
Our contribution to the UN's Sustainable
Development Goals
The member states of the United Nations (UN) adopted the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development at their General Assembly in
September 2015. The aim is to enable economic development and
prosperity – in line with social justice and taking account of the ecological limits of global economic growth. The Agenda applies equally
to all nations of the world. All emerging and developing economies as
well as industrial nations must play their part.
The core of the 2030 Agenda comprises 17 sustainable development
goals (SDGs). They officially went into effect in January 2016. The SDGs
cover all three dimensions of sustainable development – the social,
environmental and economic dimension – for the first time. Implementing the ambitious SDGs will require everyone to work together: policy
makers, civil society, and business. As such, companies are also called
upon to make concrete contributions.
We are answering this call. Many of our products, services and activities
contribute to achieving the SDGs. Our customers can use our smart
home solutions, for example, to more effectively monitor, control and
reduce their energy consumption (SDG 13). Our broadband expansion
gives many people access to digital education media (SDG 4). Our
e-health services help improve medical care (SDG 3). And our cloud
solutions make it possible to reduce energy consumption and conserve
other resources as well (SDG 13). Our 2016 Annual Report describes
our commitment to putting the SDGs into practice. Sections in our
management report (a component of the annual report) that are relevant
to the SDGs are marked with a symbol for ease of reference. These topics are then addressed in greater detail in our Corporate Responsibility
Report.

ESG key performance indicators

The ESG KPIs help us steer our CR activities. They enable us to improve
our performance on an ongoing basis. Because they are relevant to our
supply chain, we also address them in our Annual Report. For the purpose of integrated financial and sustainability reporting, the KPIs map
the six types of capital addressed in these reports and therefore also
reflect the essential aspects of the sustainable value of our company
(see diagram).

Social Commitment ESG KPI
Employee Identification with CR Commitment ESG KPI

All of Deutsche Telekom's national companies that participate in the
CR data collection process are under the obligation to record our
Group-wide ESG KPIs. These national companies represent 99 percent
of the Group's net revenue.
Calculation of the Employee Identification with CR Commitment ESG
KPI is based on an employee survey that is conducted every two years.
The next survey is scheduled for spring 2017, which is why no values
are available for 2016.
All ESG KPIs were systematically reviewed in 2016, just like they were
last in 2014. We analyzed any need for adjustment based on changing
internal and external general conditions. The internal analysis particularly focuses on three factors: relevance to our core business, contribution to implementation of our strategy and relevance to steering our
performance, all questions as to how effective each ESG KPI will be in
supporting our key sustainability efforts in the future. In 2016 we also
analyzed the extent to which the UN Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) relevant to our company are already covered by our ESG KPIs.
In cases where we found coverage lacking, we looked into defining a
new KPI and including it in our external reporting activities.
Based on this review, we decided to include five new ESG KPIs in our
external reporting.

ESG KPIs
We use fifteen Group-wide ESG key performance indicators (KPIs)
to steer our CR performance.

Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) ESG KPI

 Two new energy efficiency KPIs – the Energy Intensity ESG KPI
and the Carbon Intensity ESG KPI – now supplement our Energy
Consumption ESG KPIand will fully replace it in the medium-term.
The two new ESG KPIs look at data volume instead of revenue.
Using data volume as a reference parameter makes it possible to
create a direct link to the performance of our networks,
 In our 2016 CR Report we also report for the first time on the
Renewable Energy ESG KPI, the Enablement Factor ESG KPI
and the Sustainable Products and Services ESG KPI.

Deutsche Telekom - Corporate Responsibility Report 2016

Strategy & management
CR strategy
ESG key performance indicators

We are also planning to expand our Sustainable Procurement ESG
KPIin the medium-term since we already achieved and even exceeded
the target associated with this KPI as planned for 2015.
ESG KPI reporting in the Annual Report
We also report on selected ESG KPIs in the Deutsche Telekom Annual
Report. Forecasts on the further development of three ESG KPIs
(Energy Consumption, CO2 Emissions and Sustainable Procurement)
according to German accounting standard DRS 20 are also included in
the report. We reviewed the forecasts made in the 2015 Annual Report
for our 2016 Annual Report.
The Energy Consumption ESG KPIis calculated by setting electricity
consumption in relation to revenue. The trend for this KPI was positive
in 2016. It decreased year-on-year as expected. Despite increasing
revenue, energy consumption decreased throughout the Group in the
reporting period. Given the unabated rapid growth in data traffic and
ongoing network build-out, this result was achieved only through further
gains in energy efficiency. We anticipate a positive development in our
Energy Consumption ESG KPI for the years 2017 and 2018, with a
declining trend in 2017 and a further slight decrease in 2018. This
development is the result of slight savings in electricity consumption
coupled with a slight increase in revenue. We expect to achieve further
reductions in electricity consumption above all as we migrate our networks in Germany to IP technology and merge T-Systems data centers
in various regions. Most of these savings are likely to be counterbalanced by the expansion of T-Mobile US and the accompanying rise in
electricity consumption.

We use the Employee Identification with CR Commitment ESG KPI
to determine the degree to which our staff identify with, or how satisfied
they are, with our CR commitment. This is based on the Group
employee survey (excluding T-MobileUS), which we conduct every two
to three years; the next is scheduled for spring 2017. This ESG KPI will
therefore not be reported until the next financial year. The figure for both
aspects was 78 percent in 2015.
We use the Socially Responsible Investment ESG KPI to determine how
the finance markets rate our sustainability activities. This indicator
measures the proportion of T-Shares held by investors whose investment strategy is based not only on economic but also on the ecological
and social aspects of corporate governance. In spring and fall 2016
we held a number of Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) roadshows,
at which we offered to answer critical questions from our investors. In
addition, we attended SRI conferences, organized conference calls and
web conferences, and answered numerous direct queries from rating
agencies, analysts and investors.
Our efforts to achieve greater sustainability are also paying off with
investors. At the end of 2016, around 20 percent of T-Shares were
owned by investors who take SRI criteria at least partly into account in
their investment decisions. Almost2 percent of T-Shares were held by
investors who give priority to SRI aspects when managing their funds.

We had assumed there would be a slight decline in the CO2 Emissions
ESG KPIfor 2016, i.e., a slight overall improvement. In fact, CO2 emissions sank by 5percent in the reporting period. This positive trend is
mainly attributable to falling emissions from electricity consumption and
from fuel consumption for our vehicle fleet. Our electricity consumption
is the main driver of our CO2 emissions. We therefore also expect a
slight downward trend in our CO2 Emissions ESG KPI in the years 2017
and 2018. One of the goals we have set ourselves as part of our integrated climate strategy for the year 2020 is to reduce CO2 emissions
throughout the Group (excluding T-Mobile US) to 20 percent below the
figure for the base year 2008. Shutting down outdated PSTN technology
will be a major contribution in these efforts. We will be able to shut this
technology down as soon as migration to IP has been completed.
In the case of the Sustainable Procurement ESG KPI, we exceeded the
prior-year figure by an even greater margin than forecast. The share of
the procurement volume that has been risk-assessed already amounts
to 83 percent. Over the next two years, we expect our Sustainable
Procurement ESG KPI to remain stable at a high level.
We measure the impact of our social commitment with a set of three
ESG KPIs. The Community Investment ESG KPImaps our social commitment in terms of financial, human, and material resources. The Beneficiaries ESG KPI measures the huge number of active contributors as
well as the broad target group they reach. The Media Literacy ESG KPI
highlights the high percentage of projects and activities promoting the
competent handling of media. It is highly relevance to us in controlling
terms as it correlates closely with our core business.

Strategy & management
Sustainable Finance

Sustainable Finance

Companies that rely on sustainable business practices are more competitive in the long term. Analysts from Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management and researchers at the University of Hamburg collaborated to
analyze more than 2 000 studies on the topic. Their conclusion: The
"business case" for sustainability has a sound empirical basis and the
vast majority of the studies analyzed pointed to a positive relationship
between sustainability and financial performance. This is why investors
who are interested in sustainability tend to focus on long-term yields
instead of short-term profit. Socially responsible investment (SRI img)
can be an important component when it comes to securing capital for
Deutsche Telekom AG in the long term.
SRI investment products consist of securities from companies that have
passed an audit conducted in accordance with environmental, social,
and governance (ESG img) criteria. This is why the development of
demand for T-Shares from socially responsible investors serves as an
indicator for assessing our sustainability performance. With our Socially
Responsible Investment ESG KPI we measure how the financial markets
perceive our CR activities. Investors concerned with sustainability often
refer to ratings published by specialized SRI analysts. For this reason
the rating given to our company by SRI analysts has an impact on our
ability to win over and retain socially responsible investors and achieve
our goal of keeping our company's medium and long-term cost of capital at a low level.
An increasing number of investors are responding favorably to the concept behind the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The
future-oriented SDGs are particularly interesting for investors who are
planning for the long term and require greater transparency at companies in terms of their strategic approach and prioritization. We are also
seeing a trend toward impact measurement, i.e., assessing and, in some
cases, quantifying the impact that a company has on the environment
and on society. Taking a look at a company's contribution to the SDGs
can be valuable in this assessment. To us, this trend is both a challenge
and a chance to make the positive impact of our products and services
more transparent both internally at the company and to our customers.
We use different formats – both in our reporting as well as in direct
dialog – to inform SRI analysts and investors of our CR activities. More
and more investors and rating agencies are interested in receiving information on our CR activities. Investors not classified as SRI investors, like
JP Morgan, Société Générale and HSBC are beginning to organize SRI
conferences as well. Deutsche Telekom is regularly invited to present
our CR strategy and commitment as best practice at these conferences.

Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) ESG KPI
At the end of 2016 around 20 percent of T-Shares were owned by
investors who consider SRI criteria in their investment decisions at least
to some extent. Two percent of T-Shares were held by investors who give
priority to SRI aspects when managing their funds.
Investor communication expanded
We have been publishing relevant Deutsche Telekom ESG KPIs in our
Annual Report for several years now, also providing forecasts regarding
their future development. Financial market players interested in sustainability can also review ESG information in the Socially Responsible
Investment (SRI) section on our investor relations portal. Interested
parties can find additional information on these topics in the SRI facts
info box provided as a supplement to this CR report.
In addition to our reporting activities, we also engage in targeted
dialog with investors. Our CR and Investor Relations (IR) departments
conducted two joint SRI roadshows in 2016, for example, one of which
took place in the U.S. for the first time. We also held conference calls
to keep interested investors informed and responded to numerous
direct requests for information. We covered the entire spectrum of ESG
criteria, from governance structure, corporate responsibility controlling
and a sustainable supply chain to climate protection and our refugee
aid efforts.
Current position in rankings and ratings
Deutsche Telekom's ESG (environmental, social and governance)
performance is assessed within the scope of CR ratings, which provide
investors with valuable information for their investment decisions. As in
previous years, the T-Share was again listed on leading sustainability
indexes such as the DJSI World and the DJSI Europe Index from
RobecoSAM in 2016. In addition, rating agency oekom singled us out
as the world's best telecommunications company in terms of ecological
and social performance. We qualified for the A list of internationally
leading companies in the CDP climate protection ranking (previously
Carbon Disclosure Project) for the first time in 2016. CDP commends
companies that report their CO2 emissions extremely transparently and
in detail. In addition to making it onto the A list, we were also included
in the STOXX Global Climate Change Leaders Index. The STOXX Global
ESG Leaders Index listed Deutsche Telekom for the sixth year in a row.
Once again, our share was listed on the FTSE4Good index and the UN
Global Compact 100 index in the reporting year.

Integrated reporting
More and more people are recognizing the significance of CR for a
company's success. This can also be seen in the international trend
toward tighter integration of financial and non-financial reporting.
Sustainability aspects that are very important to corporate added value,
such as environmental protection, employee needs and sustainable
products, are being included in traditional management reporting.
We have been working on integration in the Deutsche Telekom annual
report for several years now. These efforts can be seen in the increasing
inclusion of CR topics in central business processes such as procurement, product development and innovation. Integrating these topics into
our annual report also promotes a harmonized format for reporting on
our company's financial and non-financial performance. This addresses
the requirements of our SRI investors.
In various sections of our annual report, we show how sustainability
contributes to value creation in our corporate processes. We have also
been reporting on our ESG KPIs since 2011. For our Energy Consumption, CO2 Emissions and Sustainable Procurement ESG KPIs we have
been including additional qualitative trend forecasts for the following
two financial years since 2013. In the 2016 Annual Report and this
CR report, we once again compared our forecasts with the actual KPI
trends. Find out more in the ESG KPI section.
To facilitate the integration process, we outlined Deutsche Telekom's
contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for the first
time in our 2016 Annual Report. Many of our products, services and
activities contribute to the SDGs. In order to make this more transparent
for our readers, we have marked the relevant sections with the appropriate SDG symbol.

tive technological developments. In such matters, the department is
particularly focused on immediately clarifying any unresolved tax lawrelated issues as well as providing practical solutions to meeting all
applicable tax requirements.
Socially responsible investment strategy for
Deutsche Telekom pension funds
We take a holistic approach to the topic of socially responsible investments. This includes investments in the capital market for company
pension schemes and similar obligations in Germany, which are also
based on our sustainability principles. These principles were incorporated into our socially responsible investment strategy for pension
funds in 2013 in the form of exclusion criteria. These criteria prohibit
investment in companies that produce or trade in ABC weapons,
anti-personnel mines or cluster bombs. Also prohibited are investments
in companies that have repeatedly violated the principles of the
UN Global Compact img. Deutsche Telekom pension funds are also
prohibited from purchasing government securities from governments
that are subject to sanctions in accordance with public international law.
The pension funds agreed to comply with our socially responsible
investment strategy in 2013.
We are convinced that putting this investment strategy into practice will
help improve our financial risk indicators. It will help us avoid high-risk,
controversial investments and, instead, invest in long-term, stable values
that are in line with our principles of sustainability. This approach meets
the requirements of business customers and support our responsibility
as a trustee when it comes to investing our employees' capital. Last but
not least, it also supports our reputation as a leading DAX company
among NGOs and in the media.

Tax policy guidelines
The Group Tax department is responsible for ensuring that the
Deutsche Telekom AG Group pays taxes and duties at national and
international level in accordance with the applicable statutory provisions. This involves utilizing the scope available for optimizing taxes on
the one hand, and living up to the social responsibility of a multinational
company on the other.
Group Tax makes sure that the Deutsche Telekom Group complies with
all its tax obligations in Germany and abroad, in particular that it pays
the taxes in accordance with the local laws and regulations applicable
to the individual Group entities. This includes the Group's income taxes,
which must also be regularly reported in our IFRS financial statements,
as well as VAT and income tax on salaries payable within the context
of customer transactions and for Group employees. Group Tax also
ensures that the corporation has an efficient tax structure within the
framework of German and foreign tax law as applicable in each country,
i.e., that the Group does not carry any unnecessary tax burden. The goal
is to achieve sustainable tax efficiency for the Group, something in
which transparent, reliable cooperation with local tax authorities is
deemed to be indispensable.
In addition, Group Tax also has the ambition to contribute as much
as possible to the success of Deutsche Telekom's operations, e.g., by
providing detailed tax advice regarding new business models or innova-

Supply chain and materiality

Supply chain and materiality

Which sustainability topics are relevant for our revenue development,
capacity for innovation and reputation? Which topics matter to our
stakeholders, e.g., our shareholders, customers and employees, as well
as the public? In what areas and in what ways do our business operations impact society and the environment? We need to know the
answers to these questions if we want to be successful in financial and
ecological terms as well as in the eyes of society, which is why our
materiality process is not solely based on our own perspective but also
takes into account the needs and interests of our stakeholders.
Our business operations and added value
More than 165 million mobile communications customers, 29 million
fixed-line customers and roughly 19 million broadband connections
make us one of the world's leading ICT companies. We offer consumers
a wide range of products and services in the areas of fixed-line/broadband, mobile communications, Internet and IPTV. corporate and business customers also rely on our ICT services. Deutsche Telekom operates in more than 50 countries. With a staff of some 218,300 employees
throughout the world, we generated revenue of 73.1 billion euros in the
2016 financial year, around 66 percent of which was generated outside
Germany (December31, 2016).
So that we can continue to be successful, we are already evolving from
a traditional telephone company into an entirely new kind of service
company. Our core business, i.e., the operation and sale of networks
and connections, remains the basis. But at the same time we are
proactively committing to business areas that open up new growth
opportunities for us. Because increasingly larger amounts of data need
to be transported at ever faster speeds, we offer our customers fixedline, mobile communications and IPTV from one source. This also calls
for ever more efficient networks, which is why we invest in network
expansion more than any other provider in Germany – more than
34 billion euros in total from 2010 through 2016.
Our subsidiary T-Systems offers integrated solutions for business
customers, including secure operation of their systems, traditional ICT
services and cloud solutions as well as new business models and
innovation projects in forward-thinking fields such as data analysis,
the Internet of Things and machine-to-machine communication (M2M)
and Industry 4.0.
As illustrated in the diagram, our Group consists of four operating segments. The 2016 Annual Report provides more in-depth data regarding
our business development.

We strive to make an effective contribution to sustainable development
along all parts of our supply chain.

Consistent materiality process
Every year we identify which topics are of particular relevance in
defining Deutsche Telekom's sustainability management and sustainability reporting focus from the perspective of our stakeholders as well
as from an internal corporate perspective. We use previous year results
as the basis and assess these in the light of recent developments.
This materiality process has been in place at our company since 2015
in compliance with the methodology of the Global e-Sustainability
Initiative (GeSI). This methodology covers 55 topics that are material
to the ICT industry. These can be placed in nine categories: digital
inclusion, employee relationships, climate change, circular economy,
sourcing and manufacturing, customer relationships, privacy and freedom of expression, governance, and local community and environment
impacts. The advantage of using the GeSI methodology is that it allows
us to focus on our core business as an ICT service provider. In addition,
the materiality topics have been developed to pertain to a variety of
companies and are therefore recognized in the industry.

Supply chain and materiality

Material topics from our stakeholders perspective
Our online survey is always available for our stakeholders to weight
topics based on their importance as well as, since 2016, our performance in the different areas. In the survey, stakeholders are asked to
rate the topics that have been identified through our internal materiality
process. This ongoing, logical process makes it possible to achieve
comparable results. To help us identify which aspects are most material
for our stakeholders, we assessed the results of the survey for the period
from January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2016. You can find the
online survey here. The assessment was based on evaluations submitted by 143 people:
53 customers
41 employees and potential employees or employee representatives

 Revenue growth: We are able to tap new markets and reach out to
new customers through network expansion. High service quality is
decisive when it comes to customer satisfaction and therefore has
a direct impact on winning over customers and customer loyalty.
Customer inquiries on sustainable products are still limited in number but continue to grow, which is why this topic has been identified
as an important driver.
 Business operations: Which topics have a positive impact on business processes or help reduce costs? Extensive employee involvement and fundamental basics like data privacy, service quality,
stakeholder involvement and compliance are particularly important.
 Employee relations: Talent acquisition, retention, development and
staff reduction, employee involvement, employee health, safety and
wellness and employee diversity and anti-discrimination all have a
tremendous impact on employee satisfaction and productivity. Maintaining a service-oriented corporate culture (service quality), ethical
business practices and transparency also have a positive impact on
employee relations.

In addition to giving stakeholders a chance to rate the importance of
topics and assess our performance, the survey also includes questions
open to comment. You can find our stakeholder feedback from the
reporting period here.

 Reputation: A high degree of transparency and extensive reporting
create lasting trust in Deutsche Telekom. Topics such as business
practices, service quality, privacy and supply chain labor standards,
on the other hand, can pose risks to our reputation. If the media
negatively reports on our brands, products or services in connection
with these topics, this can damage our reputation.

Stakeholders also have the opportunity to assess our performance in
different areas. Our stakeholders rate our performance high in the key
areas of privacy, data security and cyber safety. However, they do see
potential for improvement in the areas of sustainable product design
and the socially relevant application of ICT products and services.

Results of the materiality analysis
In our stakeholder survey and at our internal workshop, participants can
rate topics as "very relevant," "relevant," "less relevant" and "not relevant."
We translate their weighting results onto a 100-point scale. Here are the
results of the analysis.

Material topics from the company perspective
We continue to reevaluate the importance of topics every year, conducting internal workshops to assist us in this process as needed. Most
recently in November 2015, numerous experts from different departments, including Human Resources, Innovation and Communications,
participated in one of these workshops. They went through the 55 GeSI
topics and identified those that had the most impact on five key value
drivers behind our business success from a corporate perspective (see
below). These value drivers are also based on the GeSI methodology:

The result
The following illustration shows how all of the topics were rated by our
stakeholders and from a corporate perspective on a scale of 0 to 100.

 Technology and innovation: Our customers increasing demand for
secure, encrypted services has made topics like data privacy and
cyber security two of the most significant drivers of innovation at our
company.

As a company, we are constantly balancing the expectations of a variety
of stakeholders when managing our business. That is why our success
depends on recognizing the interests and demands of our stakeholders
and meeting and addressing these whenever possible and reasonable.
stakeholders img also expect to be kept informed of how companies
are responding to their requirements. we go even further by actively surveying our stakeholders and involving them in our management processes.
engaging in dialog with our stakeholders helps us identify trends early
on, which fosters our innovation processes (click here for current examples). At the same time, this strengthens existing alliances and creates
new opportunities for partnerships. This is particularly important in
terms of our sustainability targets, which we can only achieve in collaboration with partners from the worlds of politics (political advocacy), society, science and research, and industry.

Fostering stakeholder engagement
We systematically encourage stakeholder engagement in our corporate
activities. In 2011 we developed a strategy for stakeholder engagement
in order to manage our various activities throughout the Group. The
strategy is based on the three AA1000 principles developed by the NGO
AccountAbility: materiality, inclusivity, and responsiveness. We reviewed
compliance with these principles in 2013.

Suggestions for strengthening commitment to sustainability among
employees and in the corporate culture:

We distinguish between three types of stakeholder engagement:
information, dialog and participation. Our activities are based on six
principles for stakeholder management.

Requests and suggestions for improved reporting:

In order to ensure that our CR activities are designed effectively, we
regularly assess how our stakeholders perceive and rate these activities.
For this purpose, we particularly rely on our materiality process and
CR topic monitoring.
Feedback from the stakeholder survey
Our ongoing stakeholder survey (To the survey) includes weighting
topics (2016 results) and rating our sustainability performance as well
as open questions. Below is a summary of feedback results for the
period from January 2016 to December 2016 which we use to advance
our CR activities.
Recommendations on how Deutsche Telekom can further improve its
corporate responsibility:
 Stronger customer focus and improved customer service
 Providing transparent information to customers (e.g., on pricing)
and increased focus on consumers
Reduction
of mobility-related emissions (pertaining to

CO2 emissions, fine dust particles and NO2 emissions)

Expectations on sustainability rating in the supply chain
 Placing more importance on sustainability criteria in procurement

 Increasing trust in secure workstations
 Promoting equal opportunity (e.g., of women in technical
professions)
Good
working conditions throughout the Group


 More active marketing of the CR report (e.g., via social networks)
 Shortening the CR report (e.g., focusing more intensively on
material aspects)
Creating
a newsletter for people interested in sustainability

Focus on dialog: Group website and CR report
In 2016, we placed even greater emphasis on dialog with our stakeholders in our CR report and on our company website at
www.telekom.com.
With our 2016 online CR report, we are making it even easier for our
readers to get in touch with us and provide us with direct feedback on
our sustainability performance: Selected articles include a comment
function. You can give us feedback or ask questions, which will be
answered by Deutsche Telekom experts. An overview of all comments
arranged by topic is available under the sub-section "Expert forum“.
With the relaunch of our www.telekom.com corporate website, we
revamped our online presence in 2016. The website features a new
design, new functions and advanced dialog and service offerings.
The heart of the new design is the feed, which consolidates all the latest
news from the Group, turning our corporate website into a digital hub.
The feed content includes articles from the website, along with posts

Representing political interests

The political sector and regulatory authorities influence the development and availability of the network infrastructure, technologies and services. This directly impacts the competitiveness of telecommunications
companies as well as business in general, which relies on having a fast
network infrastructure as well as state-of-the-art telecommunications
services. Networks and services are also of considerable importance for
maintaining a sense of community in society, which is why we engage in
active, ongoing dialog with all interested stakeholders from the spheres
of politics and society.
Lobbying instruments
Our partners from parliaments, governments, and non-profit organizations need to uphold their independence and integrity. This principle
is codified in Deutsche Telekomâs Guiding Principles. Donations to
political institutions, parties and political representatives are not
allowed, for example. Instead, we place importance on factual communication, competence, credibility and integrity. As a result, politicians
and stakeholders feel that the information we provide is authentic and
credible and refer to this information when forming their own opinions.
Deutsche Telekom is registered in the official transparency register for
lobbyists in Brussels. Within the context of our collaboration efforts in
associations and other bodies, we feel that we are under the obligation
to comply with all ethical codes and legal provisions.
Investment incentive needed for broadband networks
Having a high-performing, reliable and secure broadband infrastructure
is the basis of success for all business sectors and is a key factor in
making a business location attractive. Deutsche Telekom has been
investing extensively in infrastructure for fixed-line and mobile Internet
for years, making a considerable contribution and showing more
commitment than any other company to providing full-area coverage,
particularly in rural areas.
In view of the ambitious broadband goals at both the national and
European level, the main purpose of telecommunications and regulatory policies needs to be improving planning security and, in particular,
the financial power of companies willing to invest in the market. This is
the only way to fully tap private network build-out potential using all
available technologies. In areas where broadband roll-out is not economically feasible, it is up to the public sector to develop technology
and provider-independent incentive programs to help finance these
efforts. Forward-thinking regulatory policies need to actively support
investment in modern broadband networks and prevent unnecessary
financial burdens and red tape for the network operators investing in
networks.

Regulatory intervention needs to be restricted to proven market failure
to keep it from unnecessarily limiting innovation. Open access must
be embraced as a basic principle so that competition and free choice
for consumers are guaranteed in connection with all network build-out
projects.
In view of the fact that the Internet and telecommunications market are
converging rapidly and in light of the growing market power of a few
global Internet players, sector-specific regulation of telecommunications
is creating more and more of an imbalance. The same laws and regulations that apply to telecommunications companies also need to apply
to Internet companies providing the same services. The objective here
must be to create equal competitive conditions and enable fair distribution of the financial burden involved in broadband build-out.
Protecting the open Internet
As part of the EU telecoms package, regulations on network neutrality
were adopted at EU level and went into effect on April 30, 2016. The
new regulations particularly address permitted traffic management,
once again raise transparency requirements and limit commercial
product and service differentiation on the Internet.
Deutsche Telekom remains committed to preserving an open Internet.
Content and services will continue to be available online in accordance
with the best effort principle, meaning they will be available to the extent
permitted by the available resources. Deutsche Telekom will continue to
expand and optimize its infrastructure so that we are able to cope with
rapidly increasing amounts of data traffic and constantly upgrade our
network. This is the only way for us to meet our customers increasing
demands and live up to the requirements of online content and application providers who also want to provide their services in high quality in
the future. However, telecommunication networks cannot be operated
without an effective network management system.
That is why Deutsche Telekom is developing business models based on
the "best effort" Internet principle that online businesses can use to offer
innovative services that pose specific demands on transmission quality
and quality of service. This will include managing the rapidly growing
volumes of different types of data streams in the net. Content will in no
way be controlled. Deutsche Telekom supports the freedom of the Internet and does not influence user or provider content in any way.
Deutsche Telekom will continue to take a non-discriminatory approach
to marketing services with different quality-of-service levels in competition with other network operators. This gives consumers greater choice
and guarantees a high quality level.

Consumer dialog
One of Deutsche Telekom's aims is to become the most highly regarded
service company in the industry. That is why we again gave high priority
to consumer-related topics in 2016.
Main topics included:
 Maintaining consumer data privacy, for example in the online
advertising business,
 Improving comprehensive, cross-technology protection of young
people at national and EU levels (in particular by advancing a
comprehensive, Group-wide minimum standard within the EU and
ongoing dialog with organizations involved in the protection of
minors both nationally and at EU level),
 improving customer service standards,
 improving consumer protection in telecommunications, e.g.,
when switching providers for fixed-line and mobile connections, and
 our efforts to provide better transparency for our customers.
Deutsche Telekom once again made progress in 2016 in regard to
switching fixed-network providers - both internally as well as in collaboration with other telecommunications providers in Germany. The goal is
to make it easier for both fixed-network and mobile consumers to switch
providers without any service interruptions. In all these areas, Deutsche
Telekom stands for a constructive and solution-oriented approach that
is geared to both the consumers interests and the interests of our
company.

Compliance

Compliance

At Deutsche Telekom AG we feel it is highly important that all of our
employees and governance bodies comply with our values, rules of
conduct and applicable laws at all times. Deutsche Telekom's central
compliance organization (Group Compliance) plays a key role in
establishing corporate governance structures and a corporate culture
that are based on integrity. It promotes a culture and a set of values
characterized by compliance at the company and encourages managers and employees to fill these values with life. As a result, Deutsche
Telekom's understanding of what compliance means far exceeds pure
legal compliance in business activity, i.e., compliance with laws and
internal regulations, and focuses on the integrity of employees and
governance bodies.

Ensuring integrity and compliance
We have clearly expressed our commitment to complying with ethical
principles and current legal standards. This commitment has been
incorporated in our Guiding Principles and Code of Conduct. We have
introduced a comprehensive compliance management system: this is a
way to combat risks effectively and make sure conduct throughout the
Group is based on integrity and complies with our principles and regulations. All activities related to compliance management fulfill legal regulations and our Binding Corporate Rules on Privacy. This policy regulates how personal data is handled at Deutsche Telekom. Responsibility
for the compliance management system lies with the top management
level at Deutsche Telekom in the Board department for Data Privacy,
Legal Affairs and Compliance. In addition, there is a member in each
company of Deutsche Telekom on the Management or Board level who
is responsible for compliance. The Chief Compliance Officer of
Deutsche Telekom AG is responsible for the Group-wide structure,
advancement and implementation of the compliance management
system. This individual also heads up the Group Compliance unit. We
also have compliance officers at each of our operating segments and
national companies These individuals are responsible for ensuring that
the compliance management system and our compliant goals are
implemented on site.

Goals of the compliance management system (CMS)
At Deutsche Telekom, compliance refers to following the rules and
doing the "right thing," which means compliance requires all employees
to act with integrity. Within the meaning of our five Guiding Principles
and Code of Conduct, integrity, and therefore compliance, forms the
basis of all our business decisions and activities. It defines the behavior
of all our employees when dealing with customers, employees and
colleagues, investors, managers and Deutsche Telekom's general
environment.
The goals of our compliance activities are based on these principles,
the relevant regulations and legal standards as well as on our strategic
objective of becoming the leading European telecommunications
provider. Concretely, the purpose is to avoid compliance violations and
business decisions that are not made with integrity. In addition, compliance should be integrated early on and permanently into business
processes. This reduces liability risks for the company. Furthermore,
compliance contributes to ensuring that our customers perceive us
as a reliable partner. We ensure implementation of our overarching
compliance goals in business activities by systematically applying the
compliance management system in the areas of prevention, identification and response.
Focus on prevention
Each year, we carry out a Group-wide Compliance Risk Assessment.
This helps us identify and assess our compliance risks and define
focal points for conducting effective preventative measures, which are
compiled in our compliance program.
The goal is to make sure that the conduct of our employees is ethical
and compliant at all times, which is why we have set forth clear expectations on employee conduct in our Code of Conduct. We have introduced compliance-related Group policies for this purpose, such as
regulations on anti-corruption measures, gifts, invitations, and events,
as well as on handling consultants and agents. A policy database
makes it easy for our employees to access and follow our policies
(Group-wide implementation of the Code of Conduct).
Besides regular compliance training sessions, we also carry out comprehensive anti-corruption training. We specifically address managers
to act as multipliers to further raise awareness of compliance. Their
feedback is analyzed carefully and used to initiate additional training
sessions or other measures if necessary.
Employees can also visit the "Ask me!" portal to have their compliance
questions answered and find reliable information on laws, internal
policies and codes of conduct relevant to their daily activities.

Deutsche Telekom - Corporate Responsibility Report 2016

Strategy & management
Compliance

Finally, we established a variety of communication measures to promote
a "compliance culture" in the company.
Identification and monitoring
Despite the best preventative measures, we are not always able to prevent breaches of law or serious violations of internal regulations at the
company. We have created the Tell me! whistleblower portal to uncover
non-compliant conduct. Our employees as well as external parties, e.g.,
business partners or customers, can use the portal to report misconduct (Protecting whistleblowers). Deutsche Telekom thoroughly investigates all reports within the limits of the legal framework and punishes
such activity appropriately. We have introduced a Group-wide reporting
process to control and monitor these activities, including regular internal and external audits of our compliance management activities.
Compliant interaction with business partners and suppliers
Our Code of Conduct specifies proper conduct for all of our employees.
With our Social Charter img we make a commitment to protecting and
promoting human rights including compliance and other issues with the
ILO's core labor standards. Our suppliers are expected to comply with
the obligations, principles and values set forth therein and we do our
part to place our suppliers under the obligation to do so. We also expect
our suppliers to require the same of their sub-suppliers. Our General
Terms and Conditions for Purchasing include a corporate social responsibility and anti-corruption clause that places suppliers under the obligation to take all steps necessary to prevent and punish active and passive
forms of corruption. We have been offering regular e-learning and faceto-face compliance training to our suppliers since 2014 and provide
them with a compliance guideline as well (see GRI index).
We select our business partners based on compliance criteria and
conduct risk-oriented compliance business assessments. This applies
to customers and suppliers as well as consultants (Consultant Policy),
sales agents, development partners, and joint venture partners.
Renewed compliance management certification
In 2016, we once again had our compliance management system
certified with a focus on anti-corruption measures. This enables us to
ensure we can confront risks consistently and that we have established
effective processes in the company. Ten companies in Germany were
under review; 13 companies in other countries will follow in 2017.
The certification focused on processes in procurement, sales, HR, and
mergers & acquisitions, as well as the topics of events, donations, and
sponsorships. The potential danger of corruption is greatest in these
areas. Auditors completed their audit of the effectiveness of our compliance management system (CMS) and the system passed with flying
colors. We document details regarding audit content and corporate
departments that have undergone anti-corruption audits in our audit
report.
Certificates and audit assessments play an ever growing role, for
instance, in bidding processes and decisions to award bids, offering a
clear advantage whenever we are in competition with other companies.
External auditors have previously certified our compliance management
system (CMS) with a focus on anti-corruption measures and anti-trust
law in 2010 and 2013.

50

Strengthening our corporate culture, encouraging
a speak-up culture
A compliance management system (CMS) is only effective if it is lived
out in practice in everyday work. This is why we started the "Transparent
company culture initiative" in 2016 with the intention of encouraging
integrity and a speak-up culture within our company. The project
consists of two central pillars: we will begin by completing a scientific
study to analyze the existing corporate culture at Telekom. Our research
partners are ESMT Berlin and the Hertie School of Governance. As part
of this study project, in spring of 2017 we will invite employees from 25
national and international companies to take part in an online survey
for the purpose of examining our current compliance culture. The second pillar of the initiative is founding an independent panel of experts
to monitor the study intensively. The expert panel will consist of company representatives as well as external experts from NGOs, economics,
science, and society. After completing the online survey, the panel of
experts will assess the results and develop suggestions for strengthening our corporate culture. These will be submitted to the Board of
Management as a basis for decision-making on future measures.
In addition, we started the "Speak-Up Culture" initiative in 2016 to
encourage objection within the company where this is necessary.
Employees are to be empowered to report misconduct or take action
early on. Besides a variety of communication measures, the initiative
includes completing a survey that allows our employees to state their
views on the speak-up culture at Telekom and find out how they fit in
with this culture. The results of the survey show that there is already a
speak-up culture within the company, although it does need to be
strengthened further. Managers, in particular, need to be willing to
accept dissent, and doubters must be encouraged to express their
opinions more often. Experience reports by former whistleblowers will
supplement these various measures.
International collaboration on compliance
Different legal practices and cultural values in the countries where
Deutsche Telekom is active represent a significant compliance challenge. The increasingly dynamic development of global markets and
intensified international competition also influence our compliance
strategy.
In line with the Group's international structure, we discuss strategic
issues with an international compliance advisory team twice a year and
define a shared compliance approach. The team is a trend-setter of
sorts, as it provides an impetus for designing and implementing balanced compliance structures at Deutsche Telekom. We have also been
promoting Group-wide compliance collaboration for years through
meetings of the representatives of all compliance organizations from
our international subsidiaries. Our International Compliance Days took
place for thetwelfth time in 2016: around 140 compliance officers from
31countries met on April 13 and 14 at the Telekom Forum in Bonn.
They discussed compliance strategies and trends under the motto of
"Teamwork, Excellence and Integrity". In addition, they launched the
"Speak-up Culture" campaign, with which we want to encourage
employees to report misconduct or take action promptly.

Strategy & management
Compliance

Preventing and fighting corruption
All Group units regularly audited for risk of corruption
We conduct a wide spectrum of internal measures to prevent and fight
corruption. The compliance risk assessment forms the foundation of
our compliance management system. It helps us identify and evaluate
compliance risks and develop appropriate prevention measures. We
have established an annual process for this purpose Group-wide: it
identifies responsible officers and defines clear assessment criteria that
are documented in a traceable manner. The companies that will take
part in the compliance risk assessment are selected using a model
centered on how developed and complete their compliance programs
are. 79 companies participated in the assessment process in 2016.
Our Group risk map is a key component of the compliance risk assessment that we use to assess risks that are particularly significant to our
company. The risk map enables Deutsche Telekom's globally active
companies with their various business models to conduct systematic
risk analyses. It currently covers 27 core risk categories ranging from
corruption and anti-trust law violations to violations of the Group Code
of Conduct. Each subsidiary can add additional categories specific to
their business needs. This involves defining which specific threat each
risk poses to the subsidiary and stating which measures have already
been implemented to mitigate this risk. If necessary, additional measures are developed to reduce the risks to a manageable level. Responsibility for the compliance risk assessment lies with the respective Group
company. Our central compliance organization provides support and
advice in these matters.

51

Engagement in anti-corruption initiatives
Deutsche Telekom AG regularly joins forces with national and international organizations that deal specifically with compliance-related
issues including combating corruption. As a member of associations
and organizations such as the Compliance & Integrity forum of ZfW
(Center for Business Ethics), DICO (German Institute for Compliance
e.V.), Bitkom (Federal Association for Information Technology, Telecommunications and New Media), Deutsche Telekom makes use of the
opportunity to exchange ideas and experiences related to compliance.
Thanks to this collaborative approach and exchange of experiences,
Deutsche Telekom AG not only makes a valuable contribution to anticorruption within the Group, but also to initiatives in this field worldwide.
Deutsche Telekom AG uses the findings to work on continually improving its compliance management system.
Major ongoing legal proceedings
Deutsche Telekom is party to several proceedings both in and out of
court with government agencies, competitors, and other parties. The
proceedings mentioned in the 2016 Annual Report are of particular
importance from Deutsche Telekom's point of view.

The subsidiaries managing boards are informed of the results of the
compliance risk assessment. Subsequently the compliance program
for the following year is defined, including specific measures and
responsibilities. The managing board passes a formal resolution to
approve the program. The compliance program measures are monitored closely.
Investigation based on clear criteria
Deutsche Telekom has specified clear criteria for investigating suspected cases of corruption. We only start investigations if a violation of
legal or internal regulations is reported with a sufficient degree of detail.
Any tips that meet this requirement are investigated thoroughly. Any
violations we uncover are punished appropriately. In some cases
employment relationships have even been terminated for good cause.
Claims for damages may also be asserted. Any weaknesses identified
in the internal control system during the investigation are systematically
analyzed and remedied.
"Tell me!" portal: 121 reports received
In 2016, 121 compliance-related reports were made to Deutsche
Telekom via the "Tell me!" portal (120 reports were made in the previous
year). 14 of those are still being reviewed for plausibility and investigations are being made into 60 plausible reports (as at: January 2017).
20 of these were confirmed as actual misconduct and were punished
accordingly. 26 cases are still in the investigation phase. In confirmed
cases, we impose systematic sanctions that are proportionate to the
act and the guilt of the perpetrator and are in line with applicable legal
provisions. Overall, most reports made in 2016 related to potential
cases of embezzlement, theft, and fraud, commission fraud, and manipulation of targets.

Human rights

Human rights

As an international player, the Deutsche Telekom Group assigns high
priority to human rights compliance, especially since the ICT img sector
is frequently criticized for deficiencies in its supply chain. That is why we
have established comprehensive social standards at Deutsche Telekom
and implement these using appropriate methods. We attach particular
importance within our company to granting the right to collective bargaining and supporting diversity and equal opportunities. We expressly
require our suppliers to assume responsibility as a way of making sure
human rights are also protected outside of our Group.

How we protect human rights
Deutsche Telekom has made an express commitment to the UN
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights published by the
United Nations Human Rights Council in 2011. These principles require
businesses to systematically identify the impact their operations have
on human rights, and to prevent, mitigate or compensate these where
necessary. In order to meet these requirements, we have developed an
extensive program to implement the UN Guiding Principles and introduced an ongoing process comprised of several interconnected
measures and tools (see diagram).

Tools for assessing potential impact on human rights
We use two tools to assess compliance with our Social Charter img:
first, each year we prepare a central Social Performance Report, in
which 104 fully-consolidated companies of Telekom participate. This
report did not record any violations of our Social Charter during the
period from October 2014 to September 2016. We have also been offering a central Contact Point for Human Rights since 2013. This contact
point can be reached via various channels, for example the public
e-mail address humanrights@telekom.de. Others use our anonymous
whistleblower system, which allows them to submit their information
anonymously. All contact options are listed on our Tell me! whistleblower portal, the purpose of which is to resolve violations of legal
regulations and internal policies. We look into all tip-offs and reports
received and introduce countermeasures as soon as the information is
identified as plausible. You can find out how we handled the reports we
received in 2016 here.
We also continued the process launched in 2013 to integrate human
rights issues into the due diligence activities conducted in the context of
mergers and acquisitions. In addition, we introduced special evaluation
processes to assess employer-employee relations as part of implementing our Employee Relations Policy.
Reports and inquiries to the Contact Point for
Human Rights
We established a contact point for human rights at Deutsche Telekom
in 2013. Between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016, the contact
point received ten reports related to human rights, submitted either
directly to the e-mail address of the contact point or through the (anonymous) whistleblower portal. Not all of these tip-offs were deemed plausible. Most of the reports related to the issues of "freedom of opinion" and
"code of conduct." One inquiry was related to the topic of "implementing
human rights issues at Deutsche Telekom." The inquiry specifically concerned our activities and conflict management. One inquiry dealt with
the issue of "social responsibility." Of course, all reports were treated as
confidential.

The obligation to respect human rights is anchored in the basic policies
of Telekom, the Guiding Principles, the Code of Conduct, and the Social
Charter. The Employee Relations Policy and the Diversity Policy of
Telekom are also important in this context.

Risk and opportunity management

Risk and opportunity management

For us, comprehensive risk and opportunities management also means
considering the opportunities and risks arising from ecological or social
aspects or from the management of our Company. To this end, we
actively and systematically involve all relevant stakeholders in the process of identifying current and potential risks and opportunities. We
also participate in a number of working groups and committees. In parallel with our ongoing monitoring of ecological, social and governance
issues, we systematically determine our stakeholders’ positions on
these issues. The key tools we use here are: our year-round open online
materiality survey for all stakeholders our bi-monthly NGO report, which
systematically analyzes press publications of the NGOs relevant for us;
our involvement in working groups and committees, countless national
and international business associations and social organizations, e.g.,
GeSI img, Bitkom, Econsense, and BAGSO; stakeholder dialog formats
organized by us, such as the CR Forum and Dialog Days on sustainability in procurement; and our various publications, such as the press
review and newsletter. We have identified the following as our main sustainability management issues.
Reputation
How we deal with sustainability issues also entails both opportunities
and risks for our reputation. A high level of service quality is one of the
most important factors for improving customer perception. Customer
satisfaction has been embedded in our Group management as a nonfinancial performance indicator to underline the importance of this
issue. Transparency and reporting help to promote the trust of other
external stakeholders in our Group. Our annual and CR reports also
serve this purpose. However, issues such as business practices, data
protection, or work standards in the supply chain also entail reputational
risks: If our brands, products, or services are connected with such
issues in negative media reports, this can cause substantial damage
to our reputation. As part of our sustainability management activities, we
continuously review such potential risks and take measures to minimize
them.
Climate Protection
We pursue an integrated climate strategy, which means focusing not
only on the risks that climate change poses for us and our stakeholders,
but also on the opportunities it presents. ICT products and services
offer the potential to save up to ten times as much in CO2 emissions in
other industries as the ICT sector itself generates (according to the GeSI
SMARTer2030 study). This creates an opportunity to save 20 percent of
global CO2 emissions in 2030, and to maintain worldwide emissions at
the level of 2015 with simultaneous economic growth. The additional
revenue potential here amounts to USD 6.5 trillion, USD 2.0 trillion of
which is for the ICT industry alone. Further, ICT solutions can save a

total of USD 4.9 trillion in costs. To give a specific example: The broadband roll-out in Germany has the potential to save an aggregate amount
of 19 million metric tons of CO2 between 2012 and 2020. What is more,
the economic momentum triggered by rolling out broadband can create
an aggregate number of 162,000 new jobs and increase GDP by EUR
47 billion between 2015 and 2020. We are supporting this trend by
evaluating our product portfolio to identify sustainability benefits.
Among the risks that climate change harbors, meteorological extremes
are one we are already experiencing. This is having a direct effect on
our stakeholders, e.g., our customers, suppliers, andemployees. We can
take preventive action in this area by reducing our own CO2 emissions,
which is one of the reasons we set ourselves the goal of achieving a
20-percent reduction in our Group-wide emissions – leaving aside our
United States operating segment – by 2020 (baseline: 2008). Climate
protection also carries financial risks, whether from the introduction of
a levy on CO2 emissions or an increase in energy costs. The measures
we are taking to counter these risks include measuring our own energy
efficiency and finding ways to improve it. Beyond that, in 2015 three of
our subsidiaries (Magyar Telekom in Hungary, OTE S. A. in Greece, and
T-Mobile Netherlands) covered 100percent of their electricity requirements with renewables, thus actively reducing climate risks.
Suppliers
We see more sustainability in our supply chain as an opportunity – for
our reputation and our business success. Thus through a development
program, we help strategic suppliers to introduce business practices
that are socially and ecologically acceptable and economically efficient.
The program showed measurable successes again in the reportingyear.
Better working conditions at our suppliers reduce the number of workrelated accidents and the turnover rate. This increases productivity,
while at the same time lowering costs for recruitment and training.
Thus not only do we strengthen CR performance at our suppliers, we
also significantly reduce identified risks. As part of our global procurement activities, we can be exposed to country- and supplier-specific
risks. These include, for example, the use of child labor, the conscious
acceptance of environmental damage or inadequate local working and
safety conditions. However, the reporting of NGOs or media can give
rise to risks to the Company’s reputation, but also to supply risks. We
reduce these risks by systematically reviewing our suppliers. In the
renowned RobecoSAM sustainability rating we scored 98 out of 100
points for our supply chain management in the reportingyear, fivepoints
higher than in the prioryear. Our partnerships with suppliers that comply
with international sustainability standards ensure a high level of product
quality and reliable procurement.

Health and Environment
Mobile communications, or the electromagnetic fields used in mobile
communications, regularly give rise to concerns among the general
population about potential health risks. This issue continues to be the
subject of public, political, and scientific debate. Acceptance problems
among the general public concern both mobile communications networks and the use of mobile handsets. In mobile communications, this
affects projects like the build-out of the mobile communications infrastructure and the use of mobile handsets. In the fixed network, it affects
sales of traditional DECT (digital cordless) phones and devices that use
Wi-Fi technology. There is a risk of regulatory interventions, such as
reduced thresholds for electromagnetic fields or the implementation of
precautionary measures in mobile communications, e.g., amendments
to building law or labeling requirements for handsets.
Over the past few years, recognized expert organizations such as the
World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Commission on
Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) have repeatedly reviewed
the current thresholds for mobile communications and confirmed that –
if these values are complied with – the use of mobile technology is safe
based on current scientific knowledge. The expert organizations,
currently the ICNIRP, regularly review the recommended thresholds on
the basis of the latest scientific findings.
We are convinced that mobile communications technology is safe if
specific threshold values are complied with. We are supported in this
conviction by the assessment of the recognized bodies. Our responsible
approach to this issue finds expression in our Group-wide EMF Policy,
with which we commit ourselves to more transparency, information,
participation, and financial support of independent mobile communications research, far beyond that which is stipulated by legal requirements.
We aim to overcome uncertainty among the general public by pursuing
an objective, scientifically well-founded, and transparent information
policy. We thus continue to see it as our duty to maintain our close and
successful dialog with local authorities, over and above the statutory
requirements. This also applies since our longstanding collaboration
with municipalities to build out the mobile network was enshrined in
law in2013; previously, this collaboration was based on voluntary selfcommitments by the network operators.

Data privacy

Data privacy

Almost half of the German population (48 percent) has been victim to
Internet crime - for example through viruses, Trojans or computer
worms. These were the findings of a survey conducted by TNS Emnid
on behalf of Deutsche Telekom in February 2016. Few users – whether
they are using the Internet for private or professional purposes – are
aware that every click leaves behind data traces online that can potentially be traced. Hackers can take advantage of this to collect specific
data and identify vulnerabilities in hardware and software. Our customers' trust is the basis for our business as an ICT img company, which
is why data privacy and data security are of utmost importance to us.

We have been publishing an integrated report on data privacy and data
security since 2011. Download the Data Privacy and Data Security

Laying the foundation for effective data privacy
In 2008 we created a Board of Management department for Data
Privacy, Legal Affairs and Compliance as well as the Group Privacy unit.
This has given us the necessary capacities for effective data protection.
The responsible Board member is advised by the independent Data
Privacy Advisory Council, which comprises renowned experts from
politics, science, business and independent organizations. The Council
was founded in February 2009.
In 2016, we established our new unit, Telekom Security, which began
operations on January 1, 2017. Telekom Security brings together all of
Deutsche Telekom's security departments under one roof. This gives us
the capacities necessary not only to identify cyber attacks in plenty
of time but also to respond quickly with countermeasures.
We are also committed to improving the political framework conditions
to ensure comprehensive data privacy. At the 2015 national IT summit
we signed the "Charter for the Promotion of Trustworthy Communications" together with the German Federal Minister of the Interior and
other organizations. Its main purpose is to make sure that the encryption of private communications becomes standard.

Regular employee training courses
Telecommunications companies are obliged to provide new employees
with information on data privacy regulations. Deutsche Telekom goes
above and beyond this legal requirement: every two years, we train all
of our employees in Germany and commit them to data privacy and
telecommunications secrecy. Corresponding requirements for national
companies are in place. We have also introduced specific trainings in
the customer and human resources departments where the risk of data
abuse is higher. These trainings include online courses for independent
learning, presentations on data privacy and face-to-face courses on
specific topics such as "Data privacy at call centers." This helps us make
sure that all employees have in-depth understanding of the relevant data
privacy policies.
Annual review of measures through audits and certifications
We conduct an annual Group data privacy audit to measure and
improve the general data privacy standards at Deutsche Telekom in
Germany and at 34 international affiliated companies. 30 percent of
Group employees, who are randomly selected, are asked to participate
in an online survey. The basic data privacy audit is supplemented by
self-assessments completed by the data privacy officers at the national
companies on implementation of the requirements defined in our "Binding Corporate Rules on Privacy."
Based on the results, the Group Privacy department identifies need for
action at the respective departments and requires them to implement
improvement measures. To this end, the Global Data Privacy Officer
holds personal meetings with the responsible directors, managers and

Deutsche Telekom - Corporate Responsibility Report 2016

Strategy & management
Data privacy

56

data privacy officers at the different departments. The Group Privacy
department supports implementation of the improvement measures by
providing information and advice and conducts a follow-up evaluation.
Unusual audit results are taken into consideration when planning the
follow-up audit.
We also have our processes and management systems as well as products and services certified by external, independent organizations such
as TÜV, DEKRA and auditing firms. The technical services company
TÜV NORD confirmed once again this year that Telekom's IT systems
are secure.
EU General Data Protection Regulation: Supporting
the implementation
In May 2016, the EU passed the General Data Protection Regulation,
which will take effect in 2018. Laws must always be interpreted to
determine how they can be implemented in everyday life. Group Privacy
has now drawn up a set of standardized rules for the Group: as a whole:
the Binding Interpretations. They were put together in collaboration
with data privacy experts in the national companies. The Binding Interpretations include specific recommendations and best practice examples to implement the EU regulation. For example, they explain what a
customer consent must entail, or how customer data has to be deleted,
if this is requested by the customer. Over the next few years, we will be
collecting further practical experience and further developing these
interpretations. Our data privacy training will also be adapted to include
the new content.
Publication of international transparency report
Telecommunications companies are legally obligated to cooperate
with security agencies: this includes surveillance measures to record
telecommunications connections or disclosure of customer information.
Deutsche Telekom has been publishing an annual transparency report
for Germany since 2014, which covers the types and amount of information we disclose to security agencies. In January 2016 we also published our first international transparency report for all of Deutsche
Telekom's national companies.
International legal framework conditions differ considerably. In some
countries it is illegal to disclose security measures, in others surveillance is directly conducted by the authorities without the involvement
of telecommunications companies. You can find more information on
the local situations in the various country reports at
http://www.telekom.com/transparency-report.
We consider it the responsibility of the authorities to ensure transparency regarding security measures and called for improved online
security in the context of a ten-point program in January 2015. Until our
requests are met, we strive to provide the necessary transparency within
the legal possibilities.

Responsibilities for supply chain management
At the highest level, Deutsche Telekom's Chief Human Resources
Officer is responsible for supply chain management and implementation of the Global Compact principles for human rights and labor
standards.

Supplier environmental requirements
Our CR clause, which we include in every agreement, requires suppliers
to make their goods and services more environmentally friendly and
energy-efficient as well as to provide information on the ingredients and
materials used.

Contact for suppliers
If employees along our supply chain have any issues, they can report
these via our Tell Me! whistleblower portal. The channel is publicly
accessible via our corporate online portal.

We have set limits for devices provided by our suppliers with regard to
hazardous substances such as phthalates, antimony, beryllium and
arsenic, and we request analytical findings as proof that these limits are
being met. We also exclusively purchase halogen-free devices pursuant
to the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive.

Supplier audits
We conducted a total of 73 audits (on-site evaluations and visits)
in 2016. The audits include employee interviews. They are "semiannounced," which means that we notify the suppliers of the approximate time of the audits in advance. That is absolutely necessary to make
sure that relevant representatives and employees in key functions are
present for the audit.
Within the context of JAC we also launched a pilot project headed by
Vodafone in 2016 in order to test a complementary, optional type of
on-site evaluation. The surveys, which are conducted via cell-phone
calls, are primarily aimed at addressing needs, concerns and issues
of employees at production facilities. They can be carried out anonymously and outside of the facilities. If the pilot phase is successful, JAC
and Deutsche Telekom as an active member of the initiative will consider introducing these surveys as a complementary tool to physical
audits for evaluating conditions of production.
Call center outsourcing
Our labor standards, as laid down in our Employee Relations Policy,
Code of Conduct and Social Charter as well as our anti-corruption and
bribery policy, are applicable throughout the Group. They also form
an integral part of agreements entered into with our business partners
and suppliers, which is why they are also applicable for outsourced call
centers.
Supplier labor standards
The JAC Supply Chain Sustainability Guidelines [link to PDF] require
suppliers to grant their employees the freedom of association and the
right to collective bargaining as well as a healthy and safe working environment. The following minimum requirements are applicable regarding
working hours: a maximum of 48 working hours per week, a maximum
of twelve hours of overtime each week and one day off after six consecutive days of work. Compliance with these requirements is reviewed during our on-site audits.

Our suppliers are required to provide self-assessments and we also
conduct supplier audits. In the scope of the audits, we check whether
our suppliers use an environmental management system and how they
manage their energy and water consumption, as well as other factors.
We also explicitly ask them about their waste management system. We
also intend to increase our requirements towards suppliers by introducing our own environmental guideline.
Supplier social standards
We do not require our suppliers to obtain external environmental or
social certificates. Based on our audits, however, the majority of our
relevant manufacturing suppliers have an external "Social Accountability“ certificate. The assessment of material social aspects as part of
our audits is also carried out pursuant to international criteria and standards such as the ILO core labor standards and SA8000 certification.
Supplier standard of living
The JAC Supply Chain Sustainability Guidelines require fair pay that
enables an adequate standard of living. The audit questionnaire also
includes questions on features and quality of working, sleeping and
canteen areas.
Sustainable Procurement ESG KPIs
In addition to the target that we introduced in 2012 to increase the
share of self-assessments and/or audits in our procurement volume, we
have now defined two additional ESG KPIs. Firstly, we hope to increase
the order volume covered by the CDP Supply Chain Program. Secondly,
we plan to increase the share of CR-qualified suppliers among our top
200. Qualification includes self-assessments, audits, sustainability workshops for suppliers and supplier development programs.
Conflict resources
Although we do not purchase resources ourselves, we do expect that
our manufacturing suppliers abstain from using ores sourced from conflict zones and similar resources in our products. Our requirements are

Deutsche Telekom - Corporate Responsibility Report 2016

Strategie & Management
CR-Ratings

58

expressly and comprehensively set out in our Coltan Statement and
Statement on Extractives. These requirements are an integral part of our
contracts with manufacturing suppliers. As a member of GeSI, we
actively support the Conflict-Free Smelters Initiative and strongly
encourage our direct and indirect suppliers to use the CFSI tools to
ensure responsible procurement of resources.
Handling customer complaints
At Deutsche Telekom, we aim to handle complaints immediately, effectively and efficiently. Our compensation policy is concerned with regaining customer satisfaction and loyalty and is used as an internal guideline. We have corporate guidelines in place on how to deal with credit
notes (goodwill and refunds) that our employees follow.
ISO 14001 coverage
In Germany, 100% of relevant employees are covered by ISO 14001
certification. A total of 93% of our employees worldwide are covered
by ISO 14001 certification, 77% of which by our central umbrella
certification.
Addressing climate risks
We pursue an integrated climate strategy, which means focusing not
only on the risks that climate change poses for us and our stakeholders,
but also on the opportunities it presents. We can take preventive action
(mitigation) in this area by reducing our own CO2 emissions. Our climate
protection target plays a key role in these activities.
Among the risks that climate change harbors, meteorological extremes
are one we are already experiencing. Impacts on climate are influencing
the continuity of our business processes. Our internal Group Policy
on Continuity and Situation Management specifies responsibilities,
processes and measures for protection from the impact of damaging
events and disruptions. It also outlines how to handle emergency and
crisis situations like floods. Possible consequences of climate change
are also taken into account when planning our future business activities,
by making sure, for instance, that our network infrastructure is set up to
be protected from storm conditions, changes in temperature and high
winds. Climate change also carries financial risks, whether from the
introduction of a levy on CO2 emissions or an increase in energy costs.
The measures we are taking to counter these risks include measuring
our own energy efficiency and finding ways to improve it.
We report to the Board of Management quarterly on current climate
risks within the context of our Group Risk Report. More information on
risk management is available in our annual report.
We evaluate our product portfolio in terms of sustainability advantages.
That allows us to help customers reduce their carbon footprints with
innovative products and services (mitigation) and address the negative
impact of climate change more effectively (adaptation). Real-time solutions in agriculture can help optimize the use of fertilizer, seed and
machinery. We also contributed to decarbonization and adaptation with
innovative projects in the field of smart cities, for example in the mobility
sector.

How we guarantee excellent service quality
"Customer delight and simplicity drive our action" – this is an ambition we have anchored in our Guiding Principles as a fixed component. In the competition for customer interest, network quality, an extensive product portfolio, and above all service quality play an ever growing
role. We record customer satisfaction and loyalty regularly through a
variety of instruments. Some of these results are tied to our managers'
variable salary components and thus play a role in their performance
assessments
We are continuously developing our customer service. We differentiate
between online services (such as online forms on our website), personal
service (such as in our shops and on the phone) and anticipatory service such as informing customers proactively regarding foreseeable
disruptions. We have combined our measures into the two programs
"C1 – customers first" and "eCompany Service".
All of our fixed-line and mobile communications customers in Germany
have been able to contact us by phone around the clock at no charge
since 2013. This applies to all of our service numbers and for questions
regarding Internet and TV services. Our online channels are becoming
more and more important. More than 40 percent of all service inquiries
at Telekom Deutschland are solved by support provided by our crossarea online platforms. We systematically evaluate our customers' inquiries and complaints to identify the root of the problem and make
improvements.
Indicator shows customer retention progress
We use the TRI*M img index to gauge customer retention and regularly
participate in benchmarkings. In the 2016 reporting year, the Groupwide TRI*M was 70.2 points, in comparison to the previous year's value
of 68.3. The value for Germany was 60 points (previous year: 58).

This means we have achieved our Group target stipulating a slight
increase for both the Group as a whole and for Germany. By 2020,
we want to achieve an annual increase of 2 points in Germany.
Best customer experience with "C1 - customers first"
The "C1 – customers first" program plays an important part in implementing our Guiding Principle "Customer delight and simplicity drive
our action." The program ran from 2012 to 2016 and was designed to
increase customer satisfaction, reinforce customer loyalty to Deutsche
Telekom, create positive customer experiences, and spark enthusiasm.
We implemented the following measures in 2016:
Personalized service
 Fixed-line customers switching to Deutsche Telekom from another
provider have benefited from a personal advisor for their switch
since May 2016. The advisor is available to the customer during the
transition period. The service was tested in advance through a pilot
project and received a very positive evaluation from customers.
 With the program "Mobile communications complaints 2.0," we
introduced a new concept for processing complex complaints from
mobile communications consumers in 2016. Our goal is to process
these complaints in a quicker and more targeted manner.
 With our new personal call-back service, the customer is connected
once again with the same customer care agent they spoke to previously. This means the customer does not need to explain their concern a second time. Under the service, we send a text message
offering a call back from a customer care agent. This service can be
used within 48 hours after the initial contact.
Anticipatory service
 For network and service disruptions planned to last at least five
hours, we inform our customers early on via text message or e-mail.
 Especially in the summer months, there are occasional weatherrelated disruptions caused by lightning strikes. In regions with
storms, we warn customers of the storm in advance via text message. In it, we give tips for how they can protect their electronic
devices. Furthermore, we explain what they can do themselves if
they experience problems after the storm. As soon as possible after
a lightning strike, our Technical Service assigns the regional field
staff so that they can repair the faults quickly and give affected
customers concrete instructions for what to do.

Successful customer program: C1 takes stock
The C1 program was ended successfully at the end of 2016 after five
years. Since the start of the program, our customers' willingness to
recommend us has seen a positive development, with a total index process tracking of 7.36 points in 2016 in comparison to 7.16 points in
2012. Key factors in the positive development were, first and foremost,
programs like the welcome sent after a move, the personal switch
advisor, and the continual improvement and automation of internal
processes. We were able to achieve a slight improvement of 0.01 points
in comparison to the previous year.

Responsible internet and smartphone use
As T-Mobile Netherlands, we believe it is our responsibility to provide
information about the possibilities and threats entailed by smartphone
use. We are therefore carrying out the following projects:

Furthermore, we consistently increased our TRI*M index values measured for customer loyalty. Consumer loyalty in 2016 reached a record
59 points (up from 52 points in 2012). We also achieved the best result
to date for the overall TRI*M index for Germany of 60 points in 2016.
This is an increase of 4 points in comparison to the annual value from
2012 (56).

 Guest lectures on debt prevention in schools during National
Money Week:This nationwide project week organized by the
Ministry of Finance particularly targets primary schools. Since
90 % of children get their first mobile phone when they are 11 or
12 years old, T-Mobile Netherlands has been providing guest
lectures to teach children how to prevent high costs resulting from
mobile use and showing them how to use their connection in a
responsible way. In 2016, 150 colleagues were involved and the
guest lectures reached over 4,500 children. The company’s employees held the guest lectures with materials provided by the company.

Ongoing measures in our C1 program will be transferred to existing
service structures or other projects in 2017.
eCompany Service program: new digital service
offers
We want our customers to always receive the best service from us –
no matter whether they contact us personally, by telephone, or online.
The eCompany Service program expands our online service and
improves our existing offerings. Online services are established as an
additional channel of contact. To achieve this goal, we developed a
variety of measures during the reporting period.
 Besides classic telephone service, we now also offer text and video
chat. The chat feature can be used both on desktop PCs and on
mobile devices.
 We use the video ID process to check our customer's identity via
video call. This allows the customer to identify themselves online
via their mobile device. The process is also used by banks.
 These and many other online services can be used via the
MagentaSERVICE app, which we have consistently enhanced over
the past few months. The MagentaSERVICE app combines all of our
services offered to mobile and fixed-network customers in a single
app. Our customers can use the app to view their data usage and
manage their contracts. We updated the app in 2016 and added
new functions to it. For example, users can now change their bank
details themselves without having to get in contact with customer
service for this purpose. In addition, they can submit a query as to
whether there is a disruption in their exchange area. We can also
inform them of the projected duration of the disruption.
 The new "digital fault assistant" offers our customers fast, direct
help. This is a so-called chat bot – software that can hold text-based
dialog with humans. The assistant can automatically answer simple
and moderately difficult questions related to wiring, installation, and
faults. Besides step-by-step solutions, it also provides recommendations and aid in the form of instructions, images, and videos. This
service allows our customers to solve some concerns on their own.

Debt prevention and debt-solving activities
We launched a variety of projects to help prevent customers from getting into debt owing to the fact that many households in the Netherlands
are struggling financially. There are many different reasons why they are
having difficulties paying their monthly bills.

 Financial Cafes: We work together with the NGO Humanitas and
other companies such as insurance companies to help people
directly with their financial problems. Volunteers of Humanitas can
call a direct telephone number of one of our employees, so debt
problems can be solved immediately. Hundreds of people in need
visit these cafes and there are plans to roll them out across the
Netherlands.
 Poverty Coalition:This partnership between corporate banks,
insurance companies, energy companies, bailiffs, money-collecting
companies, universities and tax authorities is working to alleviate
poverty among Dutch households in the Netherlands. In 2016,
we had several meetings in which we shared our thoughts and
approaches. One outcome wasa television program about people
in poverty.
 Outbound calling team:T-Mobile brought together a team of
engaging colleagues as a special outbound calling team that calls
customers involved in the debt-collection process. Instead of asking
them to pay, the message is “How are you? We appreciate you very
much as a loyal costumer. Can we help you?” This is being undertaken with the understanding that essentially every customer is
willing to pay and that an appropriate solution can always be found
for customers in financial trouble. In 2016, the team built on its
success and was extended by 8 people so we can help more people
in this customer-friendly way.
 Financial debt prevention through product design: We are very
much aware of our responsibility to protect customers against fraud,
unexpected costs, bill shocks, taking out subscriptions they cannot
afford and problematic telecom debts. We introduced new services
(Stel Samen Stel Bij) that enable customers to adjust their usage
in real time. The T-Mobile App gives customers real-time insights
into their costs and usage. We also prevent bill shocks by contacting
customers in real time if usage is high. And if a specific customer
cannot be reached, the services are put on a temporary stop.

Traffic safety
In September 2014, the Dutch Transport Ministry and Safe Traffic
Netherlands launched a campaign about the safe use of mobile phones
in road vehicles: "Keep Your Eyes on the Road”. T-Mobile Netherlands
was the first company from the telecom sector to adopt the campaign.
A similar campaign was launched to encourage safe cycling since
20% of all cycling accidents in the Netherlands are caused by social
media use in traffic. The fietsmodus-app activates a traffic mode that
works in similar fashion to flight mode. In 2016, we gave away 3 bicycles
to school kids who used the app the most. We equipped these bikes
with special bells, which we developed together with a start-up. This
bicycle bell automatically turns your smartphone into flight mode to
prevent kids being disturbed by incoming calls or apps.
Boefproof campaign
We joined forces with the Ministry of Justice, smartphone manufacturers
and other telco's to support a national campaign informing people
about how to make their smartphone unattractive for thieves. This
campaign ran on television, radio, billboards and online for a total of
three weeks.
In 2016, we were very active in raising awareness about smartphone
use. The year was launched with an extensive Q+A section on our
corporate homepage featuring tips and tricks. An e-learning platform
is being developed on financial aspects, fraud and the use of social
media for teachers. The aim is to educate school children with this
platform. Our quiz on online safety was our contribution to the national
“week of the knowledge about media” and the “alert online” campaign.
Our “T-Mobile Helpt” program teaches elderly people to use their smartphone properly.
Awards for our service
TÜV Rheinland: rating of "good" for Telekom Service

In 2016, TÜV Rheinland once again investigated how satisfied our
customers are with our service. During the study, a representative
random sample of 2,550 customers from Germany were asked how
satisfied they were with our service hotline, Telekom shops, and our
Technical Service. We received the TÜV seal for the fourth time in a
row with an overall rating of "good" based on their positive feedback.

Deutschland TEST 2016: best online service
Deutsche Telekom has the best online customer
service in Germany. That was the finding of a study
by "Deutschland Test" (a brand of the magazine
Focus Money) and "Statista." The study evaluated
the online customer service of 40 companies from
the telecommunications, insurance, banking, and
transportation industries. Service chats and communities were evaluated in the assessment, as was
the quality of dialog through social networks like
Facebook and Twitter.
Deutschland TEST 2016: „Service-König“
Deutschland Test investigated customer service
quality across Germany in 34 different industries
for the second time. Deutsche Telekom is the winner in the Telecommunications category. Customers in the 40 largest German cities were surveyed
for the test. This means a total of over 300,000
votes were recorded and evaluated.

CHIP hotline test 2017
In collaboration with Statista, one of the largest
market research companies, CHIP completed
a major hotline test in 2017. Over a period of 8
weeks, they tested the service hotlines of a total
of 150 companies from 12 industries with over
9,000 test calls, then summarized their findings in
rankings. The testing focused particularly on the
topics of customer service, wait time, availability,
and transparency. Deutsche Telekom was rated
as "excellent" overall for its mobile communications
hotline, and was the test winner in the Customer

Infrastructure expansion

Our network infrastructure enables economic performance and participation in the knowledge and information society. As a result, demand
for faster, full-coverage data services is immense. That is why we continue to rapidly expand our infrastructure and improve transmission
speeds with new, secure technology.

Expanding our infrastructure
The data volume generated globally will increase tenfold by 2020
compared to 2013, according to a study conducted by US-based IT
company EMC. That would mean 44 trillion gigabytes in the networks a
year instead of 4.4 trillion. The amount of digital data being produced in
Germany alone is expected to grow from a current 230 billion gigabytes
to 1,100 billion. Networks need to be continually expanded to be able
to handle this volume.
We have been the largest investor in this area in Germany for years now
and will continue to drive network expansion. The main objectives of our
pan-European integrated network strategy (INS) form the basis for these
activities: growth, efficiency and quality. We will continue to expand our
networks, increase the efficiency of our systems and further strengthen
our role as a leader in network quality. Our integrated network strategy
is in line with the network expansion goals specified by the EU Commission and the German federal government (digital agenda and broadband strategy).
Network expansion based on four pillars
Deutsche Telekom's integrated network strategy (INS) for Europe is
based on the four pillars LTE, fiber optics, VDSL vectoring and hybrid.
In addition to expanding the LTE mobile network, fiber-optic expansion
in combination with VDSL vectoring technology is the short and
medium-term focus of Deutsche Telekom's INS for Germany.
We have defined two targets in implementing our INS in Germany that
we plan to have achieved by 2018. We expect to be able to provide 95
percent of the population with LTE img. Secondly, progress of the fiberoptic network roll-out should allow VDSL img vectoring lines with bandwidths of at least 50 Mbit/s img for around 80 percent of all households.
This is subject to regulatory changes.

Upgrading our network architecture
We intend to make our networks faster and more efficient. To do this,
we are going to deactivate all analog PSTN (public switched telephone
network) platforms that we no longer need and switch our entire
telephone network to IP-based lines by 2018. Thanks to this switch and
other measures to improve efficiency, Deutsche Telekom will reduce the
carbon footprint of its fixed and mobile networks in Germany by around
40 percent by 2020 compared to 2008. The switch to IP img technology,
which requires considerably less energy compared to earlier network
technologies, will contribute significantly to the overall reduction of CO2
emissions.
We will also rely on fiber optics when updating our network architecture
in order to meet our customers' demands for fast network connections.
Using the fiber optic-based VDSL vectoring technology speeds up
download data transmission rates to up to 100 Mbit/s and even up to
40 Mbit/s when it comes to upload transmission rates. But vectoring
requires more energy. We are working on control solutions for energyefficient operation of our facilities in order to decrease the amount of
energy required. The combination of IP technology and VDSL vectoring
is already considerably more energy-efficient than conventional PSTN
technology.
New mobile communications standard:
network revolution, instead of evolution
The current LTE mobile communications standard is a fourth generation
standard (4G). The possibilities of this standard certainly have not yet
been fully exploited. LTE is continually developing and can fully meet
the requirements of consumers for ever greater bandwidth. However,
the successor to the LTE standard, 5G, is already taking shape. Industry
experts are intensively discussing which elements will be included in
this new standard. The goal is to agree on a uniform global definition of
5G. Many companies share our belief that 4th generation LTE technology will most likely remain as part of a future 5G standard. 4G will, in a
way, form the foundation of 5G performance. This will allow us to meet
the growing requirements of consumers in the future as well.
However, 5G will be able to do much more: the new functions will be
interesting first and foremost for industry. They will facilitate new business models that aren't even conceivable based on current standards.
This includes innovative solutions for the health or automotive industry.
All in all, this next generation will provide 1,000 times higher capacity
depending on the application, 10 times better speed, ten times faster
response time (latency) and 1.5 times better mobility in comparison with
conventional technologies.

infrAsTruCTure expAnsion

At the mobile world Congress in barcelona in spring 2016 and at other
venues, we presented development steps on the road to 5G: the first
fully functional end-to-end 5G network worldwide. in addition to high
transmission rates, the model achieved minimized latencies of less than
one millisecond. in comparison: top latencies achieved with lTe are currently 40 milliseconds.
continuing expansion of the fibeR-optic netwoRk
Telekom already operates the largest fiber-optic network in europe with
more than 400,000 kilometers. however, demand for higher bandwidths
is constantly increasing. in view of this trend, we continue to expand our
fiber-optic network in order to secure our business success in the long
term. our goal is to provide 80 percent of Germany's population with a
minimum of 50 mbit/s by 2018 – subject to regulatory changes.
To reach this goal, we are using fTTC (fiber to the curb) technology and
are expanding fTTh as well. with fTTC, fiber optics are laid to the gray
cable distribution boxes on the curb. from there we can supply our customers with large bandwidths via existing lines by means of Vdsl vectoring. with fTTh, or fiber to the home, the fiber-optic cables are taken
into the home.

continuing buildout of the lte mobile netwoRk
we continued to expand our use of lTe mobile network technology in
the deutsche Telekom network in 2016. in late 2016, average network
coverage was at 84 percent of the population, putting our european
national companies in line with their target coverage. network coverage
at the end of 2016 was just below 92 percent of the German population.
our goal is to achieve 95 percent by the end of 2018. Around 75 percent of european transmitter masts are currently equipped with lTe.
Two or more frequency bands are active in almost every fourth lTe
location, ensuring more extensive reach and higher speed.
speed breakthrough of one gigabit per second
Together with device manufacturer huawei, we broke through the speed
barrier of one gigabit for mobile data transfer in the lTe network in
2016 for the first time. using deutsche Telekom's mobile network, we
achieved the breakthrough with a transmission rate of 1.22 gigabit in a
live demonstration in berlin. The latest lTe Advanced pro technology
was used for the test. The technology combines at least three frequency
bands to achieve high speeds.
fast inteRnet access on boaRd
deutsche Telekom and inmarsat are planning to provide airline
passengers in europe with even better internet access on airline flights.
The companies are currently establishing the european Aviation
network (eAn) within the scope of a strategic partnership.

65

we installed the first lTe sites in england in 2016. A total of around
300 new lTe base stations will be set up in europe for the eAn.
The first successful test flight took place in the uk in november 2016.
The connections were stable during numerous transitions between
mobile base stations. This result exceeded expectations and provided
the development team with valuable data.
After the current test flight program has been finalized, the eAn will be
available by mid-2017.
pan-euRopean netwoRk (pan-net) is taking shape
To date, our european national companies operate their own infrastructures and develop their services independently. The switch to ip
technology - to be completed by 2018 - however, will make it possible
to develop new services together and share them across borders. we
hope to tap into this potential by creating a pan-european network.
individual services such as text messages, voicemails and e-mails will
be made available to all countries in the pan-european network as
"product building blocks." our pan-net cloud will serve as the basis.
every national company can then use the building blocks to create an
offer that suits their local market and customer requirements. we can
also use this technology to offer new solutions throughout europe
within just a few days.
in 2016 we opened our first "production site" for pan-net services in
hungary. The site is now the first cornerstone of our pan-european
network. we founded a new company for management and control of
the new infrastructure in 2015: deutsche Telekom pan-net in slovakia.
we plan to add two further sites in poland and Greece in 2017.
switch to ip technology advances
we are working on switching our telephone network to ip-based lines
by 2018. Thanks to ip technology phone calls are no longer transmitted
via analog channels or using isdn technology but in the form of data
packets, a method that has been the standard in online and mobile
communications services for some time now. energy use with ip
technology is considerably lower than with the network technology
previously used. The switch therefore also helps us decrease our Co2
emissions.

we reached a key milestone at the end of 2016 when we finished
switching half of our lines – around twelve million – to ip. After placing
our focus on switching private customer lines for some time, we began
increasingly focusing on business customers in 2016. of 3.5 million
business customer lines in Germany, more than one million had been
switched to ip by the end of the year.
in the other eu countries we also increased the number of ip lines. in
Croatia, montenegro, macedonia and slovakia, all lines have already
been switched to ip. hungary will follow in mid-2017. The plan is to
complete the switch in Greece, romania and Germany by 2018.

Sustainable products & services

Information and communications technology (ICT img) allows
industries, service providers and consumers to be more sustainable.
It also offers great market potential. An example: According to the
SMARTer2030 study, 20 percent of greenhouse emissions could be
saved reduced by 2030 through targeted use of ICT. Sustainability not
only involves protecting the environment but also has further relevance
when it comes to ICT. Technology can contribute to reduced resource
consumption, stabilizing power supply networks, simplifying work processes and continuing to improve medical care.
As a modern technology corporation, we want to help shape this trend.
That is why we continuously expand our offer of sustainable products
and innovative ICT solutions for private and business customers.
We have been offering service to dematerialize business processes
such as online billing , digitizing workflows and cloud computing for
several years now. At the same time we want to give as many people
as possible the chance to participate in the information society and to
use the opportunities it offers. For example, we make it easier for people
with age-related or physical limitations to use modern means of communication. We develop products and services that meet their needs and
continue to work on improving user friendliness. Throughout the Group,
Deutsche Telekom also offers various subsidized rates to provide lowincome customers and people with disabilities with an opportunity to
place calls and surf the Internet at low cost.
In addition to developing innovative solutions, we also invest in extensive research, e.g. in the field of M2M. The responsibility lies with our
central research facility, Telekom Innovation Laboratories (T-Labs img).
We invested a total of 84.1 million euros in research and development
throughout the Group in 2016. We also finance professorships, collaborate with universities and encourage innovative business concepts with
our start-up incubator, hub:raum.

Developing sustainable products and services
We wish to systematically use the sustainability potential of ICT. That
is why we continue to expand our range of products that contribute
to sustainable development. Our primary focus in these efforts is on
machine2machine communication, smart home technology and
e-health. Sustainable products are an important pillar of our integrated
climate strategy.

Managing the issue of sustainable products calls for systematic measures to be implemented throughout the supply chain. As we do not
produce our products ourselves but receive them from suppliers, our
measures already start with procurement. This is how we make sure that
sustainability criteria are complied with along our supply chain. We aim
to have our products certified by recognized environmental labels such
as the Blue Angel and the TÜV "Certified Green Product“ label. The
strict requirements of these labels help us see how we can further
improve our products. They also help us inform our customers of the
benefits of choosing sustainable products. At the end of a product's life
cycle, we contribute to its recycling or proper disposal. For example,
we regularly carry out used cell-phone collection campaigns.
When developing new, sustainable ICT solutions, we cooperate with
various partners and exchange ideas with our stakeholders.
Making progress measurable
We measure our progress by means of various indicators. In 2014 we
started measuring the share in sales of products and services that are
classified as sustainable based on a risk-benefit analysis. 39 percent of
our overall sales was generated with such products in 2015. We have
defined performance goals, e.g., sales goals, as internal monitoring
tools in certain fields such as e-health and Smart Home. We measure
the impact of our collection campaigns with our Used Cell-Phone Collection ESG KPI.
Continued analysis of the sustainability benefits
of our products
One building block of our integrated climate strategy is to analyze the
sustainability benefits of our product portfolio. In 2014 we began
analyzing our portfolio together with external experts based on sustainability criteria [see analysis]. The current analysis for 2016 shows that
the share of products and services with sustainability benefits is growing. The share was already at 39 percent in 2015, up from 37 percent
in 2014 (excluding T-Mobile US).
Examples of sustainability benefits include reduced CO2 emissions
thanks to virtual meetings instead of business trips, improved medical
care by means of e-health solutions and conserving resources by
replacing devices with digital solutions (e.g. phoning via a laptop
instead of a fixed-line phone).
Overall, we have carried out in-depth analyses for 17 product groups
with regard to their sustainability benefits and the corresponding
business potential (as at end of 2016). We have illustrated the benefits
of some selected products based on all three pillars of sustainability
(ecological, social and economic).

We use the results of these analyses to advance our sustainable product
portfolio. Future plans also include keeping our customers better
informed of these sustainability benefits, thereby sharpening our
competitive edge.
Pilot project for analyzing the sustainability of
our products
Studies such as GeSI SMARTer2030 show that information and
communications technology solutions (ICT) can make an important
contribution to sustainable development. Many of our products offer
economic as well as social and ecological benefits.
Quantifying and measuring this added value certainly constitutes a
challenge, but we are tackling this challenge and testing various
approaches. In addition to establishing a sustainable product portfolio,
we participate in the industry-wide Sustainability Assessment Framework (SASF) pilot project conducted by the Global e-Sustainability
Initiative (GeSI). The goal of this pilot project is to develop a tool that
can be used to measure a large variety of ICT products based on
sustainability. The results will also help determine risks along the
value-added chain. The SASF evaluation criteria are not limited to
environmental aspects but also include social criteria such as compliance with human rights and customer requirements such as cost transparency and data protection. With this comprehensive approach, SASF
is setting new standards for product evaluation in the ICT sector.

New wireless technology allows for innovative applications
Our networks are the basis for a number of M2M applications, as mobile
network technology is the key transmission channel of every M2M connection. In this respect, the Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is
gaining significance. As opposed to broadband applications, which
enable transmission of large amounts of data, narrowband technology
is specifically designed to reliably transfer very small data packages.
Benefits of NB-IoT include its low energy requirements, extensive reach
and low-cost device networking. NB-IoT is particularly suitable for use in
logistics. When tracing transport containers, all that is needed is for the
current position to be transferred about once an hour. Only very small
amounts of data need to be transferred in small data packages – and
not necessarily in real time. NB-IoT is based on existing standards and
can therefore be operated in existing networks. The technology was
approved in spring 2016. We played a leading role in the development
of a standardized NB-IoT standard.
Example: The port of tomorrow
During the reporting period we continued our smartPORT logistics
(SPL) pilot project for the port of Hamburg. The goal of the project is to
improve HDV traffic flows at the port of Hamburg and in its vicinity. All
relevant traffic and infrastructure data is collected and analyzed in real
time for this purpose. Results can be used to inform users about waiting
times, alternative routes or parking. The project is increasingly being
integrated into commercial operation.

We have been contributing to the development of SASF since 2015
and took part in the pilot study – an initial hands-on test – in 2016. We
evaluated one selected product in terms of its sustainability for the test.
During the pilot phase, the focus was on sharing information with other
participating companies. The goal was to find out whether other companies were facing similar challenges when evaluating product sustainability.
We will evaluate further products in 2017. We will then decide whether
SASF can be integrated into our processes as a measurement tool.
M2M communication: Opportunities of digitization
Machines and products are becoming increasingly intelligent. Cars can
communicate with repair shops, containers with cargo ships. The technology that makes this possible is called machine-to-machine communication, or M2M. By 2020 the number of M2M connections around the
world is expected to increase to 2.5 billion. Machine-to-machine communication is an important area of growth for us.
M2M
can help ideally coordinate the processes of various devices, vehicles
and entire industrial facilities. This helps increase industrial productivity,
ensure efficient logistics, recude energy consumption and conserve
resources.
We support the German federal government's Industry 4.0 initiative
through our involvement in machine-to-machine (M2M) communication.
The initiative's objective is to maintain Germany's competitive edge in
the technology sector.

Guiding principles for more data protection
In 2016 we introduced data privacy guidelines for the data collected
in M2M communication. Among other things, the six rules define how
Deutsche Telekom deals with personal data.
Smart cities: Innovative solutions for smart urban
spaces
Cities account for a large share of global CO2 emissions. At the same
time they can also be the driving force behind and the origin of sustainable solutions. Deutsche Telekom is dedicated to innovative solutions
that help reshape cities into smart urban spaces. We are involved in
several smart city projects throughout the world:

mySmartLife in Hamburg
The City of Hamburg was awarded the mySmartLife project. For a
period of five years starting in December 2016, various large and small
projects are being realized to start transforming Hamburg into a smart
city – for example in terms of renewable energy and environmentally
and climate-friendly mobility. Smart technical solutions are being used.
All projects involve active citizen participation. The project was backed
by a total of 14 partners including Deutsche Telekom, HafenCity University, the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, electricity grid operator Stromnetz Hamburg and public transport operator Verkehrsbetriebe
Hamburg-Holstein. The project is subsidized as part of the European
Union's Horizon2020 research and innovation program. In addition to
Hamburg, Nantes and Helsinki have also been chosen as future smart
cities.
Smart street lamps save energy
In 2016, the City of Monheim am Rhein installed new street lamps as
part of a pilot project. The new lamps require less energy, are dimmable
and can be remote-controlled. The pilot project was realized in cooperation with Deutsche Telekom and the municipal utility company MEGA
(Monheimer Elektrizitäts- und Gasversorgung GmbH).
The lights' lampheads were replaced with state-of-the-art, energy-saving
LED systems. While the new lamps look just like the old lights they are
replacing in the Old Town section, they use only 22 watts of power per
hour, for savings of nearly 70 percent (the old lights used 70 watts).
What's more, the city is enjoying additional energy savings during latenight hours when traffic has quieted down. This is because the lights
are remotely dimmable, thanks to the light-management system
Deutsche Telekom has provided. The smart lamps also simplify maintenance for MEGA: Thanks to networking, they can report technical failures themselves.
Kick-off: Croatia's largest Smart City pilot project
In March 2016, Hrvatski Telekom (HT) kicked off Croatia’s largest Smart
City pilot project in Dubrovnik worth more than EUR 200,000. The city
has officially become the first Smart City center of HT for innovation,
testing, development, and sales.
The installation of magnetic parking sensors at 30 parking spaces will
enable us to provide drivers with real-time information on vacant parking
spaces. City safety will be improved with multisensor video surveillance
that records traffic violations, speeding, overtaking and unauthorized
use of the left-hand lane. It also monitors illegal parking. We provide
high speed WiFi, free of charge and citywide. Our smart streetlight solution regulates the light intensity and consumption based on pedestrian
movement and vehicle traffic, allowing significant energy savings to be
achieved. Sensors enable us to monitor air quality and other parameters
impacting on the environment.
HT introduced a smart record system for waste collection in Koprivnica.
It comprises waste containers with installed chips that transfer information about the amount of waste present in the container in real time.
The system then independently plans and provides the most appropriate waste collection schedule.

Telekom Romania announces its first Smart City project in Romania
In 2016, Telekom Romania successfully rolled out the first integrated
Smart City project in Romania. We combine four technologies at the
Tineretuliu Park in Bucharest: smart parking, WiFi connectivity, city
safety and smart lighting. They are all integrated through an internet
of things platform. This project ensures a better and safer experience
for the users of the park.
The “Tap&Park” app enables car drivers to easily identify whether a
parking space is available near the park. The local authorities can also
use the data to output reports on parking space occupancy and traffic
levels in the area. More areas of Bucharest will be included in the app
and notifications will be provided on when parking times expire.
The WiFi solution enables visitors at the park to enjoy internet access
free of charge in a designated area. This can be extended to include
data analytics features providing local authorities with a monitoring tool
for traffic showing peaks and troughs. The tool allows security services
in the area to be managed more efficiently. Other public facilities can
also be introduced or rearranged to better serve the needs of the citizens.
The City Safety solution incorporates a video surveillance system and
an application that permits identification of specific predefined scenarios that trigger intervention by the authorities. The solution provides
alerts for cases of vandalism or trespassing in restricted areas. It also
gives an alert if a person is in a situation requiring immediate help.
The Smart Lighting solution was deployed on eight columns equipped
with LED lights and controllers with motion sensors and responses to
ambient light intensity. They can be controlled remotely or automatically
to increase the light intensity whenever an individual is close to them.
Implementation of this solution results in a decrease in energy costs by
as much as 60% yielding a significant benefit to local authorities.
Award winning Smart City project in Skopje
At the beginning of 2016,Makedonski Telekom launched the first smart
city project in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia. Our goal is to put
smart technology at the center of the modern city. We want to use smart
solutions to contribute to improving the quality of life and the safety of
citizens. An additional objective is for smart technology to promote economic development. Our first step was to install an advanced integrated
automatic vehicle location system and a system of electronic ticketing in
public city transport. This has a unique central database which enables
real-time monitoring of the traffic network and the movement of passengers. The database also helps to control and regulate the transport
service.
The smart technology encourages more widespread use of public
transport, allows demand to be managed, and reduces traffic jams and
air pollution. The system also facilitates fast, transparent, and easy collection of fares, and has significantly improved the customer experience
for residents and tourists. It also marks the launch of the era of the Internet of Things in Macedonia. In October the project received an award in
the category Sustainable Growth Solution by the World Information
Technology and Services Alliance.

Smart metering for water conservation
T-System South Africa's products also help to preserve natural
resources. In 2016 we launched a Smart Metering Solution that encourages better management of water and resource consumption as well
as waste elimination by promoting awareness of water usage efficiency
among industrial companies and private households. The solution
measures how much raw water is taken from a source, how much water
leaves the water treatment plant, how the water is then distributed within
the water distribution system and how it is delivered to the individual
consumers. The consumption data are saved on a Cloud where they
are accessible from anywhere. As a result, we are able to monitor water
consumption in real time.
This enables the meter reading company to provide more regular water
readings, determine potential water leaks and to make consumption
information available to the consumer.
Connected farming
Roughly two billion metric tons of CO2 emissions can be reduced and
250 billion liters of water saved annually in agriculture alone by the year
2030 through the use of ICT. The SMARTer2030 study published by the
Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) confirms these numbers. These
amounts are equivalent to around 2.2 times Germany's carbon footprint
and the water consumption of around 180 million people. The reduction
could be made possible by pushing the digitization of farming, for example. Real-time solutions are already making their way into agriculture.
Farming machines send their data to the cloud via satellite; the data is
analyzed immediately and important information is sent to the farmer
via text message. This lets the farmer optimize their use of fertilizer, seed
and machines, save time, reduce costs and conserve resources.
Deutsche Telekom is working hard to encourage digitization in farming.
Our goal in particular is to use smart technologies to help farmers
become more sustainable and master the varied challenges they face
every day.
Service platform for connected farming
We have been involved in the Smart Farming World project since March
2016. The goal of the project is to develop a platform that enables manufacturer-independent networking of farming machinery. Today, smart
harvesting machines already provide useful information regarding soil
and crop yield quality. Profitable use of data collected, however, remains
a challenge. In farming there are many different parties using machinery
made by a variety of different manufacturers. The goal is for the service
platform to be able to connect all participants throughout the farming
process. For this purpose, agricultural land and machines are connected and data sources such as weather and geographical data are
integrated. The platform collects and analyzes incoming data, creating
a basis for new services such as fertilizing and harvesting strategies.
These strategies will contribute to increasing productivity and conserving resources at the same time. Project partners with scientific and
industrial backgrounds are involved in the project. Smart Farming World
is scheduled to last three years and is being subsidized by the German
Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy.

Living with telemedicine 4.0
Networking health services has many advantages. Telemedicine assistance systems can help patients and their families in everyday life and
make work easier for medical personnel. In addition, they help lower
costs. We are helping shape digital healthcare through numerous pilot
projects, such as the antibiotics network and register with the St. Georg
Hospital in Leipzig. The primary goal is to enable the fast, secure
exchange of information between doctors, patients and health insurers.
Pioneering project "Living with telemedicine 4.0" in Halle
The project "Living with telemedicine 4.0," which is carried out in Halle
in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, was presented in November of 2016.
The model project is intended to provide new impetus for telemedicine.
Deutsche Telekom provides the technical infrastructure. During the
project, a residential complex for seniors will be equipped with many
different telemedicine applications in 2017. This will spare the residents
frequent visits to the doctor: they can independently measure data like
their blood pressure, blood glucose, pulse, or weight. If necessary, they
receive support from a medical professional. The measurement equipment sends vital signs to a smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth. Then
the data is transmitted to the doctor through a secure mobile connection. The doctor can call up this data and take it into account in their
treatment. If necessary, the doctor can contact the patient by telephone
or video. The patient is invited for treatment to the doctor's office when
required, or a home visit is scheduled.
Reiner Haselhoff, the Prime Minister of Saxony-Anhalt, took over
sponsorship of the project. Numerous other partners are involved in
the project: from the housing industry, science, technology, hospitals,
healthcare service providers, attorneys, financial service providers, the
Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians, and health insurance companies are on board.
National Telemedicine Network on the Aegean islands
On 2016, the OTE Group completed the National Telemedicine Network
on behalf of the 2nd Regional Healthcare Administration of Piraeus &
the Aegean. This network offers health services to the residents of some
of the most remote islands in the Aegean and the tourists visiting these
islands. The Network comprises of43 telemedicine unitswhich interconnect health centers on the Aegean islands with central hospitals in
Piraeus and the region. It also offerstele-learningservices to facilitate
training for medical, nursing, and administrative personnel in real time.
Each telemedicine unit consists of a specially designed booth equipped
with a high-definition camera, screen and special medical instruments
streaming live images of examinations. Doctors and patients can communicate in real time with consultants based at hospitals in Piraeus with
actual size visualization. This means that distance from central hospitals
is eliminated as a factor, and air and land transport can be reduced.
Pilot project on digitalization in medical institutions
Hrvatski Telekom collaborated with the IN2 Group to start a pilot project
at Zagreb Children’s Hospital and Zabok General Hospital. The objective was to reduce the work load and increase the efficiency of nurses
on wards. The “mNurse application” enables ward nurses to enter their
observations and designated information in the hospital system while
carrying out regular checks on patients. Relevant patient information is

available immediately to everyone who needs it. The graphical display
of data in the application also ensures better visibility for patient data,
and the data records are adjusted to the working process of the ward
nurses.
We installed the necessary WiFi infrastructure in the hospitals and provided tablets for the ward nurses. These comply with the technical and
safety standards for secure exchange of sensitive personal data about
patients.
QIVICON – Our smart home platform
A smart home can simplify life for its residents in many ways. It allows
them to control and monitor various household and security devices as
well as consumer electronics. The challenge: If customers buy a smarthome solution offered by one particular provider, they can only use
those functions and devices and not those offered by other providers.
That is why we have set up the open, manufacturer-independent smart
home platform QIVICON together with leading companies. Companies
of various industries can offer their own solutions on this platform. This
platform gives consumers the option to customize their own combination of offers. More than 40 partner companies and brands currently
offer their solutions on the platform.
During the reporting period, Smappee, Plugwise, E WIE EINFACH,
Stadtwerke Bonn, KPN and Slovak Telekom joined the platform. Energy
provider E WIE EINFACH's smart home offer has been available on the
platform for end customers since November 2016. Users can use the
platform to optimize their energy costs with solutions like smart heating
thermostats.
End-to-end solution for companies
Businesses in Germany and abroad can use the QIVICON smart home
platform and Deutsche Telekom's white label app as an end-to-end solution, making ti possible for them to offer the app under their own brand
and modify it to fit the needs of their company. E WIE EINFACH, KPN
and Slovak Telekom all use Deutsche Telekom's end-to-end white label
solution, selling the products via their own sales channels. Slovak
Telekom is the third company after Austrian company eww and Dutch
company KPN to market its international smart home offer on the basis
of the QIVICON platform.
Security and data privacy at QIVICON
All communication via the QIVICON Home Base, which is connected to
the Internet via servers, is encrypted. Any user data related to QIVICON
is stored exclusively on Deutsche Telekom servers in Germany. All
devices made by brands managed via QIVICON employ wireless technology based on state-of-the art security functions. AV-TEST GmbH, an
independent institute for IT security, has confirmed that QIVICON provides excellent protection. The security test conducted in 2016 again
showed that the QIVICON platform is well-protected against third-party
manipulation.

Honored as most-innovative smart home solution
International consultancy Frost & Sullivan once again presented QIVICON with the European Connected Home New Product Innovation
Award in 2016. According to Frost & Sullivan, the QIVICON smart home
platform is currently the leading smart home ecosystem thanks to its
open, manufacturer-independent approach.
Protecting resources with cloud computing
With cloud computing, our customers no longer need to be bothered
with their own servers and storage media. In most cases, cloud computing is more resource and energy-efficient than running your own infrastructure outside of the cloud. Our data centers require up to 80 percent
less energy thanks to more effective capacity utilization and less hardware. We also continue to work on further improving the efficiency of
our data centers.
First steps into the cloud
We have been offering our The Cloudifier program to companies looking to switch to cloud solutions since 2016. We analyze the customer's
IT landscape and identify which applications can be transferred to the
cloud. We also offer the T-Systems integration platform, Data Orchestration as a Service, to help integrate the new cloud services into the company's IT infrastructure as seamlessly as possible. The service enables a
seamless interplay between information in the cloud and traditional onsite systems at customer offices, giving our customers faster access to
new, optimized cloud services.
Secure access control
We offer customers secure infrastructure solutions (Infrastructure-as-aService – IaaS) with our Open Telekom Cloud. This gives them access
to our servers and storage, where they can manage their data. The
OneLogin identity management solution has been available on the
Open Telekom Cloud since 2016. The service guarantees secure, convenient access to cloud applications. Users who have been assigned
access rights can sign up with multiple services all at once using their
preferred device. The solution manages user profiles centrally across
all applications and guarantees the highest security standards.
Don't buy, rent
We want to make sure that used routers and media receivers don't just
end up in the trash. That is why we promote the "Don't buy, rent"
approach. Our rental services conserve resources, reduce electronic
waste and prevent CO2 emissions. Customers return the devices if they
cancel their contract. The devices are then either refurbished and
rented out again or properly recycled. We have simplified the return process by introducing a returns portal. The online returns portal enables
customers to manage their own returns. A twelve-month minimum contract term extends the devices' average usage space while also reducing returns before the minimum rental period is over. We actively and
effectively promote the rental service in many ways including at Telekom
Shops, online, via customer service and in product flyers. The offer has
been well received by our customers; the number of people using the
rental service increased to around 8.7 million by the end of 2016.

Customers have been able to return their used, high-end cell phones
and smartphones to Telekom Shops under a buyback program since
2013. They receive store credit from the Telekom Shop reflecting their
old device's current value, which they can use to purchase a new device,
or they can choose to have the amount booked to their customer
account. In collaboration with Teqcycle Solutions and Deutsche
Umwelthilfe (DUH), we also operate the Handysammelcenter (cellphone collection center) online portal, which was redone in 2016.
The new website provides an overview of our partners and collection
campaigns. Companies can use the portal to properly and safely
dispose of their used cell phones and smartphones free of charge and
receive a certificate as confirmation. Authorities, associations and
other organizations can use the portal to launch their own collection
campaigns.

Product certification: Blue Angel for speedphones
Sustainable products are a key factor in competition at our company.
We keep our customers informed regarding environmental aspects and
manufacturer specifications and give tips on how to use their devices in
a way that is secure, energy-efficient and appropriate. We also tell them
about ways to dispose of their devices that help conserve resources. We
use well-known environmental labels when communicating with our
customers.
Blue Angel for Deutsche Telekom products
95 percent of Telekom Deutschland's fixed-network devices are certified
with the renowned Blue Angel environmental label. All of our DECT
phones in our Sinus series and all phones in our Speedphone series
bear this familiar symbol. Our speedphones are particularly energyefficient, low-radiation and come with replaceable batteries. A new
feature lets users configure the transmission power individually and
thereby save energy. Updates can directly be transferred to the Speedphone, making the devices easy to update, extending their useful lives
and reducing their carbon footprint.
In 2016, our Fairphone 2 became the first smartphone in our offer in
Austria to bear the Blue Angel label. It is available at T-Mobile Austria.
TÜV Certified Green Products
In addition to the Blue Angel we are increasingly focusing on the TÜV
Certified Green Product environmental label. This label exceeds the
Blue Angel criteria in ways such as requiring inspections of working
conditions at production sites. A number of our routers, including the
Speedport Neo, have already been certified by this environmental label.
Used cell-phone collection
Too many used cell phones and smartphones are stuck in drawers or
disposed of illegally with the household waste. Germany's recycling and
reuse rate for small electronic appliances is much too low. Used cell
phones, smartphones and tablets should be refurbished and reused or
properly recycled to help us conserve valuable resources. We have
been offering different ways for people to hand in their devices since
2003.

In 2016, we collected 273 079 used cell phones and smartphones
throughout Germany and either reused them or had them properly
recycled. The entire cell-phone collection process is DEKRA certified
and complies with strict data privacy standards. The joint cell-phone
collection system run by Telekom Deutschland and DUH entered its
thirteenth year in 2016. More than 2 million used cell phones have been
collected so far.
Support for different collection campaigns
As in previous years, we supported the Die Handyaktion campaign
conducted by different church-affiliated groups in the state of BadenWürttemberg in 2016. The campiagn is going to be expanded in
collaboration with the Baden-Württemberg Ministry of the Environment.
The "Responsibility and sustainability. Join in!" collection campaign in
Saarland, which we have been supporting since 2014, was extended
due to ongoing interest. The Netzwerk Entwicklungspolitik im Saarland
e.V. (NES) network took over the project's office activities in 2016.
We are still a cooperation partner to the campaign, which focuses on
projects such as providing special course material on the topics of
cell-phone collection and resource efficiency. The campaign was
acknowledged as a Werkstatt N project by the federal government's
Council for Sustainable Development in 2016. That makes it one of
Germany's 100 most innovative sustainable projects.
Woche der Umwelt expert forum
In 2016 Telekom Deutschland organized an expert forum in collaboration with DUH at the Woche der Umwelt (Environment Week) trade fair
held on the park grounds at Bellevue Palace, the official residence of
the president of Germany. Guests had the opportunity to ask questions
about cell-phone collection and recycling processes. Woche der
Umwelt is a trade fair for innovative environmental protection technologies and products. Around 13,000 people attended the event at the invitation of the German President and the German Federal Environmental
Foundation (DBU).
Handset recycling at T-Mobile USA
T-Mobile USA’s device recycling program mobilizes customers to help
reduce environmental and human health impacts from improper recycling. The company is also increasing access to quality reusable and
refurbished equipment for those who need it, while conserving our
limited natural resources.

Deutsche Telekom - Corporate Responsibility Report 2016

Customers & products
Sustainable products & services

Any wireless consumer can bring any make, model or carrier phone,
battery, accessory, tablet or netbook into any T-Mobile USA location to
be recycled for free. Through the JUMP! and Mobilize programs,
T-Mobile USA incentivizes its customers to trade in their used devices
and accessories for great deals on the latest technology. Those tradeins are all reused, refurbished or recycled.
T-Mobile USA launched the recycling program for its customers in 2008,
resulting in over 13.3 million devices being reused or resold since then.
87% of the devices that are taken back are reused or resold, with the
rest being responsibly recycled by providers selected on the basis of
their leading industry environmental certification. Since 2013, T-Mobile
has sold over 1.4 million cell phones refurbished to its high standards
directly to its customers through theCertified Pre-Owned program.

74

The service has received very positive feedback from customers and
the media. In February 2016, it was presented at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and the service was nominated for the Global Mobile
Award in the category “The Connected Life Awards – Best Mobile Innovation for Health”.
E-book reader that helps people with dyslexia
In 2016, Slovak Telekom launched the e-book reader “Dibuk Saga”. It
provides significant benefits for dyslexic users in particular. The reader
has a special font and enables people with dyslexia to read more easily
and with less effort. The dyslexic font optimizes the distance between
words and the thickness of specific characters.

In 2016, T-Mobile USA collected 3,803,691 used cell phones.
Accessible products and services
Deutsche Telekom wants to make it easier for people with disabilities to
have access to the knowledge and information society. Not only do we
offer subsidized rates to people from low-income households, we also
offer them to people with hearing and vision impairments. We also support them with products and solutions especially designed to meet their
needs.
Services for the hearing impaired
We set up a hotline (Deaf Hotline) for deaf and hearing-impaired customers in 2003. Customers can send an e-mail, fax message or letter,
or use their video phone to communicate with our specially trained
employees for any requests they may have. Up to 50 people currently
call the hotline every day to get help with issues involving their DSL
routers or find out more about special cell-phone rate plans, for
example.
In summer 2016 we equipped Deaf-Hotline employees with what we
refer to as LiveBerater workstations, which feature HD cameras and
much more. The customer and consultant see each other in a videobased live chat, making it possible to advise the customer in sign language. The LiveBerater solution is easy for customers to use. All they
have to do is click on a link and the connection is established after a
brief system test. LiveBerater also allows the display, joint editing and
sharing of documents. The solution is run at a Deutsche Telekom data
center, giving customers end-to-end security.
Family Assistant for the elderly and chronically ill
Slovak Telekom worked together with Falck Healthcare to launch an
innovative product entitled Family Assistant in 2015. The product helps
the elderly and chronically ill by offering continuous remote monitoring,
assistance services and special communications equipment with their
own SIM card. Two devices are supplied to automatically detect risk situations and call for help fast: the GT300, a small and simplified mobile
phone designed for carrying in a pocket or around the neck, and the
smart watch Navigil. The devices are connected to a surveillance center
with professionally trained personnel provided for Telekom by Falck
Healthcare. Since 2016, the Family Assistant has been available as a
social service in compliance with the relevant legislation in several cities
across Slovakia. This makes it more affordable especially for senior
citizens.

Supporting start-ups: creating space for ideas
The hub:raum start-up incubator
We have been running our own start-up incubator in Berlin, Cracow
and Tel Aviv since 2012 under the name hub:raum. The objective of
hub:raum is to get direct insight into the innovative ideas that start-ups
are working on. In return, we offer start-ups access to our technological
expertise and our customers and help them set up their company.
Experienced entrepreneurs and Deutsche Telekom experts act as
mentors to the start-ups in a variety of programs. hub:raum also
provides selected start-ups seed financing of up to 300,000 euros.
Interested start-ups can go to the hub:raum website and apply for
collaboration or seed financing. We collaborated with around 75 startups in 2016 in a variety of programs. We also established the independent hub:raum investment fund, which will make our decisions regarding
investments in start-ups more flexible. The first investments made under
this investment concept will be announced in 2017.
Start-up programs with external partners
In 2016 we conducted the second round of the Challenge Up! program,
this time on the Internet of Things, in collaboration with Intel and Cisco.
We collaborated with twelve start-ups and more than 25 mentors for
over seven months on a variety of applications including remote maintenance of industrial facilities. We also launched our first joint program
with telecommunications companies Telefonica, Orange and SingTel.

Cyber Security Boot Camp
hub:raum introduced a new, topic-based event format referred to as
boot camps in 2014. We invite start-ups to present their solutions at the
boot camps. With this format we hope to help start-ups advance their
ideas and tap business opportunities within the Deutsche Telekom
Group. The second Cyber Security Boot Camp was held in Berlin in
February 2016. Twelve start-ups participated in the event and presented
their most innovative ideas and solutions on cyber security.
Fashion Fusion competition: technology meets fashion
For the first time, Deutsche Telekom has selected the winners of the
Fashion Fusion competition as part of the Berlin Fashion Week. We
invited creative talents from the fields of fashion and technology to submit their ideas for combining high-tech and couture in our international
ideas competition. People who submitted the most promising ideas got
the chance to realize them at the Berlin Fashion Fusion Lab where they
were supported by experts from industry, fashion and the start-up
scene. From among the more than 120 applicants from 25 countries,
twelve teams qualified for the final round. The jury presented a total
of 35,000 euros in prize money to three winning teams at the awards
ceremony in Berlin. First place went to the Trainwear team whose idea
was to develop smart athletic wear with an integrated personal trainer.
Support for internal "start-ups"
Since 2011 we have been helping our employees develop their own
concepts for new services and business areas at Deutsche Telekom
within the context of our UQBATE internal innovation program. Employees can present their ideas to interested colleagues on the UQBATE
platform, create teams and then work together to turn their ideas step
by step into products that are ready to go to market. The "start-ups" even
receive assistance from external trainers if needed.
We focus our sponsorship on promising concepts, whether they involve
marketplaces, gaming platforms or e-commerce solutions. We release
the project teams from their job responsibilities for three months and
give them a budget so that they can effectively implement their ideas.
2016 was another year for exciting ideas. Four teams ultimately qualified for sponsorship.
Take-offs program supports regional start-ups
2016 saw the sixth round of the Take-offs program. The T-Mobile Czech
Republic program provides financial support, long-term professional
advice, and expertise to regional start-ups. The overall aim is to help
potential entrepreneurs, who often belong to vulnerable groups (people
in regions of high unemployment, women on maternity leave, senior or
handicapped citizens, students without work experience).
Out of the 409registered projects this year, 41regional winners were
chosen and announced by an expert jury at 10 regional workshops run
for all interested participants free of charge and attended by more than
500 people. The regional winners all receive a helping hand from
experts in marketing, communication and finance, as well as tangible,
financial support worth EUR 3,700.

Václav Staněk and his project called Vasky (manufacture of footwear
based on regional tradition and values) was selected as the national
winner and received prizes worth EUR 25,900.
The Take-offs again enjoyed significant media coverage. The winners
were invited to present their projects on TV and radio, and in various
print and online media.
hello holnap! – the sustainability mobile app from
Magyar Telekom
Our hello holnap! mobile phone app is part of the hello holnap! sustainability initiative. It has been downloaded 9,300 times from AppleStore,
GooglePlay and Windows Store. The app enables users to earn points
for performing tasks supporting sustainable development that are
organized by the operator and its partners. The points can then be
redeemed in Forints and spent on donations. Users can earn points
for various tasks including the following:
 Donations to organizations through achievements
 Partnership with enterprises in the sharing economy to collect
points (e.g. car-pooling or food from local farmers)
Donation
partnerships with NGOs

Planting

Points can also be earned by buying a sustainability-related mobile
phone from the Magyar Telekom portfolio. Magyar Telekom defines
a sustainability-related phone as one that either has an international
certificate (e.g. TCO), an environmental sustainability declaration or
social attributes (e.g. for elderly people or the disabled).
OTE Group provides Fire Service
In 2016, the OTE Group implemented an IT project that is expected
to make a significant contribution to preventing fires and controlling
them at an early stage in a conflagration. This project was carried out in
cooperation with Byte and Satways on behalf of the Fire Service. Installation of advanced IT systems at their Operations Center enables firefighting units to be coordinated before and after an incident. Immediate
and continuous information is also provided to citizens in emergencies.
The system is designed to collect and analyze geographic data received
by the vehicles and the fire command centers, or even drones. This
gives units in the Fire Service access at all times to critical data on fires
in progress and to the means which could help the work of extinguishing. Information can be viewed on smartphones, tablets PNDs (Personal
Navigation Devices).

Members of the general public are invited to select the overall winner
from among 41 regional winners. More than 12,000 people took part in
the online voting and selected David Richtr and his project entitled the

Consumer protection and security

In October 2015, the European Court of Justice determined that the
Safe Harbor Agreement was invalid. In accordance with the agreement,
U.S. companies were able to self-certify that they met European data privacy regulations. But these principles were not effectively implemented
at those companies. Edward Snowden's revelations also demonstrated
that U.S. security authorities store all of the personal data transmitted to
the United States. The protection of personal data is part of the shared
fundamental values in Europe. It is up to the German government, the
EU Commission and the United States to create an appropriate basis for
secure data exchange between Europe and the United States.
For us at Deutsche Telekom, the decision passed by the Court of Justice
of the European Union is a sign that we are on the right path. We called
for an "Internet of short distances" at an early stage, ensuring a direct
path from the sender to the recipient when transferring data - without
any detours through other jurisdictions such as the United States. This
has already been implemented in our networks.
European business customers are critical of data storage outside of
Europe; demand for secure cloud services "made in Europe" is growing.
Our security solutions meet this demand. We guarantee the same high
security standards at all of our data centers. We also develop products
for consumers, such as products offering end-to-end encryption, and
solutions for SMEs to detect and fend off hacker attacks in real time.
In addition to data security, we have also introduced measures for consumer and youth protection.
To us, security is more than just protecting data and infrastructure - it
also means protecting the public's health. We have established a Groupwide basis for this with our EMF img policy.

Consumer and youth protection

We stand for the highest possible standards when it comes to consumer
and youth protection. One example of how highly secure our products
are is De-Mail, our service for the legally secure identification of e-mail
senders and recipients. We are also setting a security standard for sending private e-mails with the E-Mail made in Germany industry initiative,
which we co-founded.
We want to teach children and young people how to use digital media
safely and effectively and protect them from inappropriate content.
which is why we work throughout the Group to improve their media
skills in a variety of projects. We also work with a variety of initiatives
and partners to create a child-friendly Internet. We have reinforced our
stance with numerous national and international voluntary commitments and internal codes of conduct. In doing so, we often exceed the
standards required by national regulations.

Protecting consumers and young people
Data privacy and data security are very important to us. In 2008, we
created a special Board of Management department for this topic and
introduced the Binding Corporate Rules on Privacy specifying how personal data is to be collected, stored, and processed at the Deutsche
Telekom Group. Not only do we provide transparent information on all of
our activies and measures in our annual Data Privacy and Data Security
Report, we also take stock of the current situation: What has Deutsche
Telekom achieved so far? What do politicians consider to be the areas
needing the most improvement? And what do experts think about the
current state of data privacy and data security?
Our products and services have always provided a high degree of data
privacy and data security. Growing volumes of data require special precautions to protect the privacy of citizens, which is why we approved
eight mandatory principles for handling big data, or large amounts of
personal data, in 2013. In January 2015, we also approved specific
measures to protect data and infrastructure in our "Ten-point program
for increased cyber security." We also developed new protective products including our Mobile Encryption app designed to ensure end-toend encryption of mobile communication.

Data privacy and security also play a key role in the development of
our other products and services. Our Privacy and Security Assessment
(PSA) procedure allows us to review the security of our systems in each
step of the development process. This procedure applies to newly
developed systems as well as existing systems that undergo changes
in technology or in the way data is processed. We use a standardized
procedure to document the data privacy and data security status of our
products throughout their entire life cycle. Youth protection aspects are
also taken into consideration in our product and service design. In
Germany we involve our youth protection officer in all issues regarding
planning and designing offers for young people. The youth protection
officer can then recommend restrictions or changes. In 2013, we also
made it mandatory for every international subsidiary within the EU to
designate a child safety officer (CSO) to handle youth-protection related
topics. As a result, at least one CSO was appointed in each of our
European markets in 2014. The CSO acts as a central contact for members of the community in the respective EU market. They also play a key
internal role in coordinating topics revolving around the protection of
minors. These measures increase the consistency and transparency of
Deutsche Telekom's involvement in protecting minors.
Strategic approach to protecting minors from unsuitable media
content
Our strategy to protect children and young people from harm when
using digital media is based on three pillars. We
 provide attractive, age-appropriate offers for children and give
parents and guardians tools (filters) that they can use to restrict
the access minors have to harmful content,
 work to fight child abuse and child pornography and
 promote skills to help people use the Internet safely.
We also collaborate closely with prosecuting authorities and NGOs as
well as other partners from business, politics, and society to ban online
content that is harmful to children and young people. We documented
our commitment to protecting minors from unsuitable media content in
Germany in relevant codes and introduced minimum standards. In
2007, we committed ourselves to fighting child pornography on the
Internet throughout the European Union. At a global level, we have been
a member of the global association of mobile providers, GSMA, since
2008, which pursues the same objectives. In order to better coordinate
our activities within the Group, we also approved a list of general guidelines in October 2013 for our activities to help protect minors from
unsuitable media content and made these guidelines mandatory at

Deutsche Telekom - Corporate Responsibility Report 2016

international level, thereby setting new standards in our markets. In consideration of their particular cultural situation and business model, each
international subsidiary in the European Union can further specify these
measures, adopt additional measures, and also determine their own
strategic focal points.
Because protecting minors from unsuitable media content poses a challenge that affects many industries, we cooperate with different organizations for the protection of minors and participate in coalitions that coordinate the involvement of companies and organizations from the Internet and media sector. For example, we are a member of the "CEO
Coalition to make the Internet a better place for kids." We also play a
leading role in the ICT img Coalition for the Safer Use of Connected
Devices and Online Services by Children and Young People in the EU.
In this coalition, we pursue a comprehensive cross-industry approach
based on six principles that expressly includes helping young people
learn media skills.
In January 2013, as part of both coalitions, Deutsche Telekom
announced plans to implement an EU-wide set of measures based on
the principles of the ICT Coalition. The ICT Coalition published an
annual report in April 2014 on the implementation of corresponding
measures at all of the companies represented in the ICT coalition. The
report, which was written by an independent expert from the Dublin
Institute of Technology, comes to the conclusion that Deutsche Telekom's approach to implementing the ICT Coalition's principles is exemplary.
Protecting personal data
Almost one-third of all Germans are concerned about the misuse of
data and insufficient data security. These were the findings of the 2016
Security Report that we commissioned from the Allensbach Institute.
Deutsche Telekom is by far the most trusted company in the ICT industry when it comes to handling personal data. And we are proud of it,
because protecting our customers' data is one of our top priorities.
We document our wide range of data protection activities in our annual
Data Privacy and Data Security Report. The following are just a few
examples of our activities during the reporting period.
A simple data privacy statement for everyone
Non-specialists often have a hard time understanding data privacy statements. Our one-pager provides our customers with an easy-to-read
overview of data privacy at our company. It contains simple, condensed
information on the basics behind our data processing activities. It does
not replace our formal data privacy statement, to which we link in the
document and which complies with legal requirements. Instead, it
provides users with transparent information on how and to what extent
we process and use personal data. With this one pager, we have
followed an initiative launched by the National IT Summit, supported
by the Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection.
Mobile Protect Pro
According to the 2016 Security Report, half of those surveyed consider
an attack on their smartphone to be unlikely. But the number of attacks
on mobile devices is increasing and these attacks can do just as much
damage as an attack on your PC at home. With the Mobile Protect Pro

78

application, we have been offering our business customers end-to-end
protection for mobile devices since 2016. The app continuously checks
the device for possible threats, similar to a non-stop ECG. It also provides protection for wireless connections like Wi-Fi.
Encrypted e-mails for everyone
Together with the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology (Fraunhofer SIT), we launched Volksverschlüsselung in mid-June
2016. It is a simple, free way to encrypt emails. We operate the solution
at a high-security data center. The goal is to make state-of-the-art
encryption methods accessible to everyone. The keys are generated on
the user's device. The user is the only person with access to them; they
are not sent to the infrastructure operator. To use the encryption, users
only need to install the software and identify themselves as part of a
simple one-time process. In the first step, users are identified via the
established Deutsche Telekom registration processes or with the aid of
an electronic ID card. Other processes for secure identification are
planned at a later stage.
The online Deutsche Telekom security guide
Information on cyber criminals, malware and phishing is distributed
over thousands of websites on the Net. The www.sicherdigital.de website brings this information together, providing users with easy access
to security issues. Young people, adults and businesses can find useful
information and specific tips concerning security and data protection.
The "Confidential" issue of our We Care app talks about how dangerous
hacker attacks can be and how users can protect themselves.
Collaboration for the protection of minors
We want to create a safe, positive online experience for children
and young people. We offer them attractive, exciting content on ageappropriate websites.
Supporting standardized child protection offers
We became a member of the non-profit organization JusProg e.V. in
August 2016 in order to expand our involvement in child protection
efforts. Child protection programs are traditionally based on different
platforms like IOS, Android and Windows. However, we feel the only way
to develop a truly effective solution is within the scope of cross-system
collaboration. That is why we decided to donate the rights to the program code behind our child protection software (Windows) and our
child protection app, Surfgarten, (iPhone/iPad) to JusProg e.V. The
organization will further develop and operate both products. They will
also incorporate the JusProg filter list. These filters decide whether or
not content can be accessed. With these decisions, we hope to help
JusProg develop a standardized child protection offer.
Teachtoday in the Aktionsbund Digitale Sicherheit network
In addition to these solutions, we also promote secure and responsible
media use among children and young people with our Teachtoday initiative. The initiative supports children and their families with practical and
everyday tips and materials. Teachtoday was accepted into Aktionsbund
Digitale Sicherheit in May 2016, a network of organizations and associations that are focused on providing people with tangible assistance
when it comes to online safety.

Fighting child pornography
We consider it our obligation to take rigorous action against depictions
of child abuse on the Internet. We have been involved in an EU-wide
fight against the depiction of child abuse since 2007 in the European
Framework for Safer Mobile Use by Younger Teenagers and Children.
Since 2008 we have been committed to combating the spread of such
content together with other mobile providers in a global association.
Since 2013 we have been participating in two cross-industry coalitions
committed to fighting child abuse on the Internet, the "CEO Coalition to
make the Internet a better place for kids" and the "ICT coalition forthe
safer use of connected devices and online services by children and
young people in the EU." The ICT Coalition published its first annual
report in 2014. The report acknowledges our involvement in this area.
We continue to be active in both coalitions and remain fully committed
to their principles.

Services to protect children in the digital world
T-Mobile USA has about four million customers using a free service that
blocks their children from viewing sexual content, graphic violence and
crude humor. It also has 375,000 customers who pay USD 4.99 a month
for something called Family Allowances, which lets parents block their
children from texting and calling certain phone numbers, shut down
their phones during school and homework hours, and monitor how
much they are texting. T-Mobile has about 100,000 subscribers who pay
USD 9.99 a month for another service, FamilyWhere, which lets families
keep track of the location of all phones on their accounts.

Collaboration with the Center for Child Protection on the Internet
We continued our collaboration with the Center for Child Protection
on the Internet (I-KiZ) in 2016. I-KIZ is a project of the German Federal
Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth. The aim
of the network, which is under the patronage of Manuela Schwesig,
Federal Minister of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth,
is to effectively fight the online depiction of children and young people
in sexual poses and ban it internationally. The network was once again
expanded in 2016, including expansion of the jugend.support advice
and support system. It now encompasses a total of 16 advice centers
that teenagers can contact with their problems. During the reporting
period we also participated in the conference held by I-KIZ under the
title "The latest in media protection of minors" where we discussed the
latest developments on the topic with members of the network.
Digital inclusion of senior citizens and school
children
The new Školák (“Schoolchild”) package is a special offer for parents
of schoolchildren. Independently of the child’s mobile credit, parents
can purchase the package to keep an eye on their children’s movements, protect them against inappropriate content on the internet and
keep track of their mobile credit. The package is linked to the “Surfie”
application. This app is provided free of charge and makes it possible
to track the location of children and restrict viewing of internet content.
The app is in the Czech language, works with the iOS and Android
operating systems, and includes three licenses. These can be used to
protect three children or they can be installed on three different devices.
The app requires internet access and the bundle therefore contains a
10 MB data allowance per month for the child. After the data allowance
has been completely used up, the internet access speed slows down,
i.e. children will still be able to use the app.
Also, we held two seminars for senior citizens on “How to use mobile
phones” and “Internet and apps” with 25 participants in total.

Cyber security

Cybercrime has established itself as a business model. Private individuals as well as public organizations, companies and the military are all at
risk. Weaknesses in computer systems are often taken advantage of
within hours of their discovery, with attacks being run fully automatically.
As a responsible ICT img provider, we are fighting this trend. Our business model includes guaranteeing our customers a high degree of
security and effectively protecting the data and infrastructure of the
people and companies who use our services from unauthorized access.

§§ Entering into collaborations

Protecting our infrastructure
In 2016, we established our new unit, Telekom Security, which began
operations on January 1, 2017. Telekom Security brings together all of
Deutsche Telekom's security departments under one roof. This gives
us the capacities necessary not only to identify cyber attacks in plenty
of time but also to respond quickly with countermeasures. Telekom
Security focuses on internal security issues and also develops security
solutions for consumers as well as business customers. With this
approach we can provide our customers with the perfect security solutions along the entire value-added chain, from product development
and secure, high-performing networks to high-security data centers,
applications and individual consulting.
We are always working to develop new ways to defend against attacks.
To help us do this, we opened our own Cyber Defense Center where
we analyze online behavior patterns and develop defense strategies.
Cooperating in the name of security
Cyber security is a shared responsibility. In order to improve collaboration in the area of digital defense, we regularly host the Cyber Security
Summit, in collaboration with the Munich Security Conference. The last
summit was held in September 2016.

The 2016 summit was held in Silicon Valley. Around 100 high-ranking
representatives from the worlds of science, politics, business and the
military met there to discuss digital defense in an increasingly connected world. Topics under discussion at the summit included cyber
defense, the future of warfare, developing standards and regulations for
cyberspace, combating cyber-terrorism and the economic ramifications
of cyber security.
Summit for the security sector: Magenta Security
More than 500 participants met in Frankfurt on November 29 and 30,
2016 to discuss the future of online security at the first Magenta
Security Congress. Tim Höttges, CEO of Deutsche Telekom, spoke at
the event along with internationally-recognized IT experts and a number
of other speakers from Deutsche Telekom and partner companies.
One of the guest speakers was Bruce Schneier, a leading expert in
cryptography and computer security from the U.S. We also took the
opportunity to present our new Telekom security portfolio at the event.
We are planning to host a second congress in 2017 due to the positive
feedback.

In 2016 we also held the first Magenta Security Congress. The event
focused on new IT security trends and solutions. At the event we also
presented our latest Magenta security portfolio, which offers companies
an extensive selection of security services.

(emf)
electromagnetic fields (emf img) are a prevalent element in our connected world, even if we are not able to perceive them directly. Their
effects on our health remain a topic of discussion. it is very important
to make sure that they do not present a problem for people or the
environment when we use them in mobile communications.

our emf policy stipulates the following principles and measures:

The effects of electromagnetic fields img have been thoroughly
researched over past decades in numerous scientific studies. The
world health organization (who) analyzes the findings of scientific
research and last made a statement regarding the results in october
2014. in its statement the world health organization concludes that the
current threshold values for electromagnetic fields ensure that mobile
communications technology can be used safely but that further
research is required.
deutsche Telekom has made a commitment to actively address scientific research on mobile communications and health, and provides
detailed information on the Group website regarding the latest technology and scientific risk assessments published by expert committees
and organizations.

stRiving foR secuRe mobile communications
we want to make our mobile communications infrastructure and our
new products, as well as the processes on which they are based, as
resource-efficient, secure and safe for health as possible. in Germany
these activities are based in particular on voluntary commitments by
mobile communications providers and an agreement with local
authorities' associations. Compliance with these voluntary commitments
is reviewed every two years. we recently submitted our annual expert
report to the German federal Government in 2016. in collaboration
with Telefónica, we also support the information portal
www.informationszentrum-mobilfunk.de
our Group-wide emf policy, which we adopted in 2004, plays a pivotal
role. The policy specifies standardized minimum requirements in the
area of mobile communications and health, requirements that by far
exceed those set forth by national laws. our policy provides our national
companies with a mandatory framework that makes sure that the topic
of mobile communications and health is addressed in a consistent,
responsible way throughout the Group. All of our national companies
have officially accepted the emf policy and implemented most of the
required measures.

We conduct ongoing reviews of compliance with our EMF Policy. The
findings are used to improve individual aspects and develop solutions
in different working groups such as our EMF Core Team and the EMF
Technical Working Group.
Evaluating and implementing the EMF Policy
We want to seamlessly implement our EMF Policy throughout the Group.
We help our national companies do this by providing specific tools. We
developed standardized policies for funding research, for example, and
published these on the Deutsche Telekom website. Our national companies are using these policies in their own funding programs. We also rely
on our national companies' own initiative and encourage them to continue to improve their measures even after they have fully implemented
the EMF Policy. The dialog conducted by the Deutsche Telekom national
companies with other network providers and with consumers, politicians and scientists plays a central role in this context.
Regular reviews show us that the EMF Policy is being implemented in
all of our action areas. We are also working on expanding our countryspecific activities.
 In 2016 we introduced Small Cells, an innovative, high-performing
mobile communications technology. Small cells add additional
capacity to our mobile communications network in places with high
traffic volumes. Small cells generally emit weaker electromagnetic
fields than traditional macrocells as they are used in mobile communications networks. With small cells we can reduce cell phone transmission levels because the distances are so small. Because cell
phone transmission levels are often the main source of electromagnetic fields in our immediate environment, reducing these is a
particularly effective way to reduce EMF exposure. To guarantee
the safety of the technology, we have conducted a series of projects
in collaboration with RWTH Aachen, including projects to minimize
emissions. Emphasizing transparency, we then discussed the results
with stakeholders from the worlds of politics and science as well as
with various associations. The results were incorporated into a pilot
project launched in 2016 focused on setting up small cells in
Munich. The project was approved by the Munich City Council.
 In Austria, the citizens' mobile communications forum gave interested citizens the opportunity to pose questions about mobile
communications directly and online. The citizens' mobile communications forum is an initiative sponsored by the industry association
Forum Mobilkommunikation (FMK). The goal over time is to turn the
forum into a knowledge platform where people can go to to get their
questions answered.

Raising awareness

We want to be a reliable partner in the digitized world, which is why
we work to raise awareness of the opportunities and challenges that
digitization brings and encourage public dialog. Our study on digital
empowerment and involvement in the Charter of Digital Networking
help further our efforts.
Signing the Charter of Digital Networking
The Charter of Digital Networking is an initiative that spans companies,
industries and associations, and was founded at the instigation of the
National IT Summit. Beside Deutsche Telekom, its initiators include
other business enterprises, associations and academic institutions.
The charter comprises ten principles regarding the social and economic
potential of digital networking and dealings with data, infrastructures
and standards. Companies that sign the charter commit themselves to
these principles and, in doing so, show that they intend to contribute
toward Germany's future-minded digital development. The charter
stands for a shared set of values and sense of responsibility. The object
is to hold a forward-looking dialog across all social levels and to create
a common understanding as we move toward a digital society. Together,
topical questions on digital transformation are addressed, answers
developed and an exchange of experiences organized on the implementation of corporate digital responsibility.
New study on digital empowerment
The majority of German Internet users do not feel their data is safe
online. These were the findings of a representative survey on digital
empowerment conducted between late 2015 through mid-2016 by the
Cologne Center for Ethics, Rights, Economics, and Social Sciences of
Health (ceres). The study was commissioned by Deutsche Telekom.
91% believe that their personal data is being accessed unnoticed on
the Internet. 82% assume that most companies release data held on
their customers to other companies. The findings show that companies
need to do more to convince people to go along with digitization.
Deutsche Telekom continues its efforts to increase transparency for
Internet users. The sicherdigital.de advice portal, for example, provides
information on online risks and protective measures. We are also helping the EU Commission come up with standardized symbols for the
topic of data privacy. Similar to traffic signs, these symbols will make
it easier for consumers to navigate the Internet [link to Customers &
products; Consumer protection]. With our Teachtoday initiative and our
involvement in "Deutschland sicher im Netz", we promote empowerment
when it comes to personal data.

The "Silent night" app tracked how many minutes people switched their
smartphone to silent. Our customers throughout Austria participated
in the initiative, with a total of 14 million minutes spent silently on Christmas Day – a tremendous success. The idea of a digital detox was presented at a discussion panel of Austrian celebrities who talked about
spending time away from their smartphones.
The silent minutes go to benefit Austrian children with cancer. Because
participation was so impressive, we tripled our donation to the charities
involved, donating a total of 45,000 euros. We can look back at a tenyear partnership and, with this initiative, we support follow-up cancer
care camps for children and young people.

Deutsche Telekom's 2016 holiday campaign in Germany drew attention
to the motto "Life is more rewarding through sharing." The story, "The
magic Advent calendar", in which a little boy learns about the joys of
sharing, was at the heart of the campaign. This put our Christmas
campaign's focus on an emotional message that goes hand in hand
with our commitment to society.

Campaigns: Digital detox and Christmas Day sharing
On December 24, 2016, T-Mobile Austria called upon people to participate in a digital detox as part of its "Silent night" initiative. The aim was
to raise awareness of responsible smartphone use.

Building skills

We want to enable people to participate in digitization, which is why
we teach specific target groups about risks and opportunities. Our
Teachtoday initiative is designed to promote media literacy. The
Deutsche Telekom Stiftung foundation is dedicated to encouraging
skills in the STEM img subjects science, technology, engineering and
mathematics. Sharing digital knowledge is also the aim of a number
of webinars and massive open online courses (MOOCs) that are made
possible by our networks. Another focal point in our efforts to build skills
is the work we do to integrate refugees into the job market.
Teachtoday – Initiative for safe, competent media use
Teachtoday is our initiative for teaching people how to use media safely
and competently. It supports children, young people, parents and
grandparents as well as teachers by offering hands-on tips and material.
Our homepage, teachtoday.de, is available in German, English, Romanian, Polish and Croatian.
Around 150 children talked about data privacy and participated in
eventful workshops at the Teachtoday Summit for Kids in November
2016. The highlight of the event was the awards ceremony for the
"Media, sure! But secure." competition. The jury presented awards to
eight projects including a cross-border media workshop entitled "Das
ist unser Netz! – To jest nasza siec!“ by Aktion Kinder- und Jugendschutz Brandenburg e.V. At the workshops, German and Polish kids
have the opportunity to learn more about their own media use.
The Teachtoday media obstacle course toured Germany again in 2016.
The goal of the obstacle course is to the raise awareness of children
between the ages of 9 and 12 when it comes to secure media use.
Among other destinations, the obstacle course paid a visit to the Schlingel childrenâs film festival in Chemnitz. Teachtoday is a partner of the
festival, which attracts more than 18,000 visitors and currently features
more than 150 films from all over the world for children and young
people.

of digital education: targeted media education for all and intensified
communication with each other. Teachtoday also interviewed Timotheus
Höttges, Chairman of the Board of Management at Deutsche Telekom,
about the digitization of society, the significance of data privacy and
how to turn young people into responsible Internet users.
The Teachtoday initiative received a number of awards in 2016. We
received four Fox Awards, which recognize effective and efficient marketing and communication solutions. The Gold Fox Award went to our
communication concept and we received the Fox Visuals Gold Award
for our visual presentation. The Scroller media magazine received the
Silver Fox Award and the Fox Visuals Silver Award. Teachtoday also
received three Comenius EduMedia Seals presented by the scientific
association Gesellschaft für Pädagogik und Information (GPI). The
entire initiative was recognized in the "didactic multimedia products"
category, the obstacle course in the "computer games that encourage
competence" category, and Scroller magazine in the "general multimedia products" category. Scroller was also recommended by Stiftung
Lesen, the German Reading Foundation, to promote safe, competent
media use.
Shaping education – the Deutsche Telekom Stiftung
foundation
The Deutsche Telekom Stiftung foundation supports a number of STEM
projects. The goal is to promote the skills of young people in math,
natural sciences and technology and get them excited about the STEM
subjects. The foundation began combining its activities under the
categories of "education drivers," "education opportunities," "education
innovations" and "education dialog" in July 2016. Projects like "Be a
math whiz" and "Junior Science Café" are some examples of the foundation's successful efforts.

Two issues of our Scroller media magazine were published in 2016.
The issues focused on social networks and data privacy. The magazine
targets children between the ages of 9 and 12 and provides parents and
teachers with information in special supplements. Scroller is available
online and as a free print version. It encourages children to think about
how they use media and learn to co-create the digital world. The
scroller.de portal is available in German and English. We also published
the first interactive issue in German and Arabic in October 2016.
Digital education was on the agenda at the 2016 National IT Summit
held in Saarbrücken. One central focal point was secure, competent
media use by children, young people and adults. Teachtoday spoke with
German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the event. Her credo for the future

Education and Digitization Forum
The Deutsche Telekom Stiftung foundation launched the Education
and Digitization Forum together with four other German foundations
in 2016. Those working for the foundations are convinced that digital
media can help improve the education system, thereby improving
participation and equal opportunity. The collaboration formulated three
core focal topics: "personalizing learning," "developing skills," and
"creating change." When it comes to personalized learning, digital
media can be used to give different target groups access to different
learning approaches, including people with disabilities, particularly
talented people and refugees. The goal of the second focal point is to
convey the media skills necessary for living an independent life.
"Creating change" focuses on developing an educational concept for
using digital media at educational institutions and within the education
system.
The Education Digitization Forum also looks to engage in dialog with
different participants in the educational landscape and to develop new
approaches to education. Experts from the worlds of science and education collaborate at conferences, in networks and at development
workshops to find answers to the big questions and challenges involved
in the digital transformation of educational institutions. The schulentwicklung.digital workshop focuses on changing the school and learning
culture through the use of digital media. 38 schools that are already
successfully using digital media in the classroom are participating in
the workshop.
The STEM reading mentors
In collaboration with the German Reading Foundation, the Deutsche
Telekom Stiftung foundation is looking for volunteer reading mentors
to get children from the ages of 3 to 10 excited about STEM content.
A total of 1,300 reading mentors have already signed up in the network,
including six mentors in Madrid and Málaga. Their efforts made it possible to reach around 5,300 children throughout the country. The reading
mentors receive training in both classroom and online formats. They are
then able to work with children at day-care centers and elementary
schools.
We also held two events with Deutsche Telekom Board of Management
members in 2016. In May, CFO Thomas Dannenfeldt read out loud at a
daycare in Bonn. CHRO Christian Illek read out loud to young schoolchildren in Frankfurt on German National Reading Day, November 18,
2016.
GestaltBar – the digital workshop
Young people need to learn how to skillfully and creatively use digital
tools so that they can actively shape their lives and have the opportunity
to work in a future-oriented profession. With its "GestaltBar – the digital
workshop" project, Deutsche Telekom particularly targets students at
lower-level secondary schools. The goal is to use a hands-on approach
to introduce young people to digital technology and give them some
insight into the different technical professions. Courses include topics
like robotics, app development and 3D printing. The project is initially
being conducted in four pilot locations – Bonn, Berlin, Hamburg and
Cologne.

Calliope Mini – mini-computer for young schoolchildren
The Calliope Mini mini-computer helps young schoolchildren learn
how to program. The computer is scheduled to be introduced into daily
classroom activities throughout Germany in 2017. The Deutsche
Telekom Stiftung foundation supports the project by developing and
testing learning materials and course concepts. Ideas for the creative
use of digital technology are currently being worked on at six universities within the scope of the "Elementary school digital learning" project.
Junior Engineer Academy
The Junior Engineer Academy gets secondary-level students (grade
eight and higher) excited about technical professions and careers in
engineering. The Junior Engineer Academy is offered as an elective at
schools for two years and conducted in collaboration with universities,
scientific institutes and companies. The project was implemented for
the first time in 2005 and gives students the opportunity to put the
knowledge they learn in the classroom into practice. Just under 80
schools in Germany currently participate in the Academy. The school
network has been growing consistently since project launch. Participants meet regularly at annual conferences where they can share their
experiences. Activities were expanded to countries in central, eastern
and southern Europe in 2016 where technology-based school partnerships are being established. These include preparatory visits for teachers, conducting technology projects for students and the opportunity for
international teachers to attend annual conventions.
FundaMINT
FundaMINT is a grant program for student teachers in the STEM subjects. It helps competent, motivated student teachers get ready for
their future. Up to 25 grants are presented each year for a period of
four semesters each. The program was expanded during the reporting
period in collaboration with the Pädagogischer Austauschdienst (PAD),
a department of the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education
and Cultural Affairs, and the Central Agency for German Schools
Abroad. Grant recipients now have the opportunity to work at schools in
central, eastern and southern Europe, conduct student projects and
participate in preparatory and post-project seminars.
STEM Didactics Fellowship program
The Deutsche Telekom Stiftung foundation initiated the STEM Didactics
Fellowship program in 2016. Up to nine fellowships are granted each
year to young researchers and scientists in the fields of mathematics,
physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, technology and science
education. The fellows can attend seminars and workshops on topics
like job negotiations and supervising doctoral candidates and are
involved in the Deutsche Telekom Stiftung network.
More than 200 new projects for the "Yes, I can!"
initiative
Our "Yes, I can!" initiative teaches young people key skills to enable
them to act independently and with self-confidence. In doing so, it
promotes equal opportunities within our society. In the reporting year,
more than 200 new projects went live with funding totaling over
850,000 euros. The focal topic for 2016 was "Competence knows no
borders," and integration was at the top of the agenda. As a result,
the initiative upped its support for projects promoting participation in
society, creating space for encounters and involving activities shared by

children and young people from different ethnic backgrounds. The
"Yes, I can!" project has sponsored more than 1,100 projects throughout
Germany with a total of almost 6 million euros since it was launched
seven years ago.

89

The "Yes, I can!" initiative was integrated into the Deutsche Telekom
Stiftung foundation in January 2017. The initiative's new focus will be
on teaching media skills. The goal will be the long-term sponsorship
and development of projects.
International competition for the Women's STEM
Award
With the Women's STEM img Award, Deutsch Telekom hopes to
increase the attractiveness of STEM subjects and encourage women
to choose careers in these areas. The prize awarded in collaboration
with the "audimax" student magazine and the "MINT Zukunft schaffen"
(Creating a STEM future) initiative. It goes to thesis papers written by
female graduates that focus on one of the following key growth areas:
digital life, Industry 4.0 img, networks of the future, cyber security
or automotive technologies. For the first time, this year's competition
was also open to international graduates from other European countries. Nine thesis papers were submitted from Finland, the UK, India,
Macedonia and Austria. The goal is to increase the number of international applicants from STEM subjects in the future.
Helping refugees: from first aid to job market
integration
Our commitment to refugee aid began in2015. Our initial focus was
on first aid. Measures included supplying Wi-Fi to refugee reception
centers, providing accommodation and recruiting civil servants for
the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF). More than
700employees provided temporary aid to BAMF in working with
refugees. More than 130civil servants employed with Deutsche Telekom
transferred to BAMF.
The refugees.telekom.de online portal, which we set up in 2015, was
further developed in collaboration with partners during the reporting
period. We relaunched it in 2017 under the name "Handbook Germany".
The online portal provides information on topics like jobs, education
and life and living in Germany. handbookgermany.de addresses refugees in the place where they communicate most – social networks.
Content is circulated on a number of social media channels. The
platform can also be used on smartphones.

The "Media workshops" pilot project got off the ground in Berlin in
November 2016. The 6-month focus is teaching media skills at public
institutions for children and young people. Educators from four Berlinbased institutions are participating and using what they learn in their
own teaching activities. The media workshops focus on topics like
"Making & Repair," "Computer, Internet & Social Media", "Film & Photo"
and "Programming & Robotics." The goal of the project is to improve
the skills of children and young people when it comes to the digital
world.

group is refugees with professional experience that don't have credentials recognized in Germany. we want to help these people improve their
career prospects. To start with - and to help them find their way around they participate in two phases of practical training (internships). we
subsequently hire them for a limited period of two years. during this
time, the refugees are given the opportunity to take part in integration
and language courses. many of our employees have been involved in
refugee aid right from the start and have been supported by deutsche
Telekom in their efforts. in future, we intend to channel their efforts into
supporting new colleagues who are starting work at deutsche Telekom.

educational stem activities in cRoatia
hrvatski Telekom (hT) recognizes the importance of fostering the
interest of young people in science, technology, engineering and math
(sTem). we therefore focused activities in 2016 on strengthening this
interest.
together we are stronger
in 2016, the competition for funding entitled “Together we are stronger”
(Zajedno smo jači) concentrated on projects aiming to enhance the
quality of sTem education in elementary schools. our employees
selected up to five finalists for each category out of 39 projects submitted in each of the two categories “new Technologies” and “science”.
The two winners were chosen by the expert panel comprising hrvatski
Telekom’s representatives and experts from specialist institutions and
associations. each project received funding of hrk 350,000 (approx.
eur 46,000). “internet of things in Croatian elementary schools in
2016” by the institute for youth development and innovation was the
winner within the category “new Technologies”. The project focuses
on the Croatian makers robotics game that teaches children advanced
concepts of automation. The first project phase saw around 750
students from 50 different schools being reached. The Astronomical
society Višnjan won in the “science” category with “Campus”. The
project involves workshops and camps for elementary and secondary
school students where they participate in sTem-related activities. The
donation allowed new equipment to be purchased for the interdisciplinary laboratory for biology, Chemistry and Astrobiology (lAbos).
Around 450 children are able to participate in workshops here.
over the past ten years, hrvatski Telekom has donated more than hrk9
million (approx. eur 1.2 million) to provide support for implementation
of 240 valuable projects through its “Together we Are stronger”
competition.
ht stem hub
The hT sTem hub was launched in spring 2016. This is a project
organized by hrvatski Telekom together with the faculty of electrical
engineering and Computing (fer). it aims to create an active academic
and economic community of young experts in various fields of science,
Technology, engineering and math (sTem).in August, we provided
summer internships for students within the sTem hub. They were
given the opportunity to work on smart city solutions, augmented reality
systems, robotics and intelligent control systems. final year students
also have the opportunity of taking a scholarship with a professional
mentor from hT.

HACK IT!
We joined forces with hub:raum – Deutsche Telekom’s incubator –
to organize the “HACK IT!” hackathon. The hackathon is part of our
broader strategy to enhance STEM activities in Croatia. More than ten
teams competed to develop the best solution for communication of the
future within the space of 24 hours. The main prize was for HRK 20,000
(approx. EUR 2,700). A total of 150 developers, designers, marketing
experts, and business professionals applied to take part in the hackathon and 43 were selected to participate in teams. The winning project
provided a vision of a personal digital assistant. It predicts the user’s
requirements and wishes by collecting data through the mobile phone.
For example, it automatically schedules a meeting arranged during a
conversation and enters it into the digital calendar. Second place was
taken by a team creating a platform for holographic communication.
The third prize went to a mesh network for offline communication
between devices. The teams get access to the hub:raum programs.
Access to the Digital World Program
COSMOTE supports theAccess to the Digital World Program to reduce
PC illiteracy among the over 50s and enhance their access to the digital
world. In 2016, the program was held in three cities and a total of 765
people with an average age of 64 years attended. So far, more than
2,000 people have participated in this program. This program is
acknowledged as being extremely important for contemporary society
andit will be transformed and expanded in 2017. Specifically,the goal
for 2017is to reach a population of more than 5,000 senior citizens so
that they can make their lives easier and better with just one tablet and
an internet connection!

Encouraging implementation

We want to motivate people to find creative digital solutions to social
challenges. To do this, we provide tangible support and make it easier
for them to realize their ideas. Our efforts include, for example, our
involvement with the "Deutschland sicher im Netz" association and our
collaboration with the German National Association of Senior Citizen's
Organisations (BAGSO) to sponsor media literacy projects for seniors.
We also encourage the development of innovative solutions such as
new apps and develop our own sustainable products and services.
We want to be a reliable partner in the era of digitization, which is why
we closely evaluate all of the feedback we receive. Our stakeholder
dialog gives stakeholders the opportunity to rate sustainability topics
according to their importance and assess our performance in the different areas.
Partnering with "Deutschland sicher im Netz"
and BAGSO
The Deutschland sicher im Netz e.V. (DsiN) association has served as a
central point of contact for consumers and small businesses interested
in the topics of IT security and data privacy for ten years now. As a member of the association, we participate in projects like the myDigitalWorld
competition for young people and the IT-Sicherheit@Mittelstand workshop series. We also participate in the Digital Neighborhood project,
which trains people to become volunteers sharing their IT knowledge
with others. The project was recognized as a "landmark" in the Germany
– Land of Ideas competition in June 2016. Thomas Kremer, Deutsche
Telekom Board Member for Data Privacy, Legal Affairs and Compliance,
is chairman of the board at DsiN.
We promote media literacy among seniors in collaboration with the
German National Association of Senior Citizen's Organisations, BAGSO.
As a partner, we sponsored BAGSO's Internet Gold Award 2016. The
award recognizes people over the age of 60 who use the Internet skillfully and help others to get started in the online world. As an advisory
board member we are also involved in the joint Digital-Kompass project
conducted by BAGSO and DsiN. Digital-Kompass is a platform for everyone helping seniors to navigate the Internet.
Innovative solutions to social challenges
Technology can also be used to address social challenges, which is
why we supported the development of a variety of digital solutions and
educational offers during the reporting period:
Play to fight dementia: the Sea Hero Quest app
The mobile game Sea Hero Quest in Deutsche Telekom's Game for
Good initiative paves the way for the world's biggest baseline study in
dementia research. The object of the study is to help recognize signs
of dementia at an early stage and to obtain information on the effective-

ness of therapies. One of the first effects of dementia is the loss of
spatial orientation. Although researchers have data from dementia
sufferers, hardly any comparative data are available from healthy
individuals. Sea Hero Quest therefore collects anonymous data on
the orientation patterns of people playing the game. Players can also
provide information on their age, gender and nationality to further
contribute to the research. This data helps scientists understand exactly
which abilities are affected in the early stages of dementia. All of the
data is transmitted twice per second, stored at our high-security data
center in Germany and then made available to scientists.
So far, over 2.7 million people have played Sea Hero Quest and, in
doing so, have made their contribution to dementia research. 13 of
our European subsidiaries flanked the game with communication
measures, ads, media and public relations work, and thus helped
"Play to fight dementia" on the way to success. Standard data on the
spatial orientation of healthy people in all age groups is now available
for the very first time. This standard data is seen as a key step in the
development of new methods that will make timely dementia diagnosis
possible.
Year of voluntary social/digital work: second round
The "Year of voluntary social/digital work" (FSJ Digital) pilot project,
which is being conducted in the city of Halle in Saxony-Anhalt, moved
into its second year. Under the FSJ Digital program, young people
between the ages of 16 and 26 with an interest in modern media can
work on digital projects or help people learn how to use new media at
non-profit organizations, such as facilities for seniors and people with
disabilities, day-care centers and clinics. Volunteers receive media
teaching support during their entire time in the program. The concept is
being tested at 25 facilities in Saxony-Anhalt. The program offers a wide
spectrum of activities ranging from digital storytelling to creating accessible web content. The project is sponsored by the German Federal
Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth (BMFSFJ)
and supported by Deutsche Telekom and NrEins.de AG. The project will
be evaluated after completing its second year.
Fast, safe response to sports injuries – the GET app
We contributed to the development of the GET app in 2016. GET
stands for the German equivalent of "concussion test app.“ Athletes
can use this interactive tool to find out whether they have a concussion
after a fall or collision with another player. The app identifies signs of a
concussion within three to four minutes. In addition to having access
to information on concussions, users can conduct a quick test and
check their response times and eye function. The app is provided by
the "Protect your head" initiative of the ZNS – Hannelore Kohl Stiftung
foundation.

MyShake app turns smartphones into an early warning system
for earthquakes
Researchers from UC Berkeley are working together with Deutsche
Telekom on a smartphone-based earthquake early warning system.
The general idea is smartphones that use an accelerometer to read
earth movement. If the data correspond with the vibrational profile of an
earthquake, the MyShake app sends the time, location and strength of
the tremor to the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory for further analysis.
An earthquake is confirmed if at least four phones register the movement. We are currently looking for more people to use the MyShake
app in order to create a network with better coverage. The plan is to
begin sending earthquake warnings to users following a one-year pilot
phase.
Shared Heartbeat app
The Shared Heartbeat app is a joint project of Magyar Telekom and Isobar Budapest and was launched in April 2016. The app enables newborn babies to hear their mother’s heartbeat. The heartbeat of a mother
is a defining factor in an infant’s life but this sound moves away after
birth. We aim to use technology to connect people in ways previously
unimaginable and enhance the most natural bonds through this app.
Cheering Heart app
The Cheering Heart app allowed anyone in Hungary to express support
and cheer athletes and teams participating at the Olympics, helping
them to excel in their discipline. Athletes were provided with a heart that
vibrates and flashes once a heartbeat is sent to them, indicating that
lots of people at home are thinking about them. A heartbeat can be
sent in numerous ways: using #egyekvagyunk, by sending a message
or clicking a button on the Internet site egyekvagyunk.hu, as well as by
shaking their smartphones. The hearts have been used at the Olympic
Games, the Paralympic Games and other major sport events. So far,
more than 2 million heartbeats have been sent to athletes.
Navigation stick for the visually impaired
As a socially responsible company, T-Mobile Czech Republic aims to
support visually impaired people. We have been cooperating with the
Czech Technical University to develop a unique navigation solution for
the blind. Connecting up global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and
wireless data transfer networks has created one of the most advanced
orientation solutions for visually impaired people. T-Mobile Czech
Republic has supported the development of this navigation solution
by providing connectivity in 3G and 4G, data SIM cards and modems.
The newly developed navigation stick for blind people is connected to
a smartphone and the navigation center. Based on a 2G-4G app, the
service enables navigation data, voice communication and images to
be transferred. It also utilizes a camera for orientation in buildings where
GNSS does not work. Currently, the solution is in the final testing phase
and will be launched in 2017. We will be offering the technology and a
special tariff to blind people who have been trained to use this tool.
Digital Schools in Romania
In a partnership with Cisco and Webhit, Telekom Romania is providing
modern technologies for performance learning in 36 schools throughout Romania. The program offers resources ranging from digital learning to live virtual lessons through telepresence. A total of 10,000 pupils
have access to the implemented digital solutions. In 20 of the 36 interconnected schools, telepresence centers have been set up to allow

93

students to participate in lessons taking place at the other schools.
The children can follow the content of the class and edit in real time.
In addition, the lessons are recorded and made available to students on
a dedicated online platform. In the other schools, a software application
replaces the telepresence center and provides students in isolated
areas with access to digital content as well as putting them in contact
with teachers in the big cities. The success of the program is quantifiable. The participating schools recorded a significant rise in attendance
rates together with an improvement of the level of performance and
competitiveness of the students.
We also launched an electronic school catalogue to support the digitalization of Romanian schools. The digital bundle includes a tablet and
internet connectivity, as well as access to an educational management
platform. It contributes to the efficient organization of the school, an
improvement in teaching, and an increase in interactivity between teachers, students and parents. Schools where the platform has been introduced have seen up to 63 % fewer absences and test results have
improved.
Connected kids
Digital literacy is becoming a basic skill required for participating in
any aspect of society. T-Mobile Austria wants to use its Connected Kids
project to raise awareness among students, parents and teachers about
the many different ways of using mobile Internet for learning. The company also wants to advance the use of digital media in schools. The
topic of this year’s “Connected Kids” event was “education 4.0 – flipped
classroom”. The aim of the event was to introduce teachers, parents and
employees to new learning formats that correspond with the current
transformation of society towards digitalization, automatization and
interconnectedness.
7,879 students in 372 participating classes and 434 teachers have
already had the chance to explore digital learning in a connected classroom since its launch in 2013. Educational and technical support is
provided by T-Mobile Austria to make sure students get to experience
all the advantages of mobile communication in teaching.
The Connected Kids blog is an important tool to make the experience
of using digital media in schools and families as part of a connected
classroom available to the public.
Long-term project goals include inspiring students to pass on what they
learn to people outside traditional educational institutions.
Coding workshop for kids
Coding is a serious matter for many people and it is associated with
complex and painstaking work to save hundreds and perhaps thousands of lines of code. However, programming language is no different
from the language, which we use every day as far as IT specialists are
concerned. That’s why thousands of volunteers encourage ordinary
citizens to try learning about coding in the EU Code Week and help
them to understand the principles of programming.
This year, the CoderDojo foundation was the coordinator of the EU
Code Week on behalf of the Ministry of Digitalization in Poland. This
was a great opportunity for T-Mobile Poland to get involved in the action
and support the foundation.

Between 15 and23 October 2016, children and young people in 13
towns in Poland participated in coding activities. Mentors from the
CoderDojo foundation encouraged them with their passion for coding
and helped them to take their first steps in this magical world. SuperDojo Ninja provided the culmination of all the classes. It took the form
of a meeting between children and mentors from across Poland at our
premises on 22 October. Nearly 200 children took part in the workshops
and gained insights into the secrets of coding. 120 mentors showed
how great programming can be.

Our social commitment reflects our responsibility as a company acting
in the political, social and business environments. To us, this also means
encouraging the volunteer efforts of our employees, which contribute
significantly to strengthening the sense of community. By getting
involved in the community, our employees also propagate our values
and promote a favorable reputation for Deutsche Telekom in their immediate environment. Volunteering is also very beneficial when it comes to
internal HR development. It expands each person's horizon and has a
positive impact on social skills and teamwork. It also encourages identification with the company.
That is why we give our employees ample opportunity to volunteer, preferably with a focus on teaching media skills. This is just another way in
which we help simplify and enrich the lives of those around us. We also
support our employees in their private volunteer activities.

Taking responsibility in our society
We contribute to society in a number of ways with our corporate citizenship program, engagement@telekom. engagement@telekom is based
on two pillars:

In times of digital transformation, we want to be a trusted partner to society. We contribute our core expertise and the commitment of our
employees to these efforts.
We give our employees the opportunity to volunteer for social projects
or the environment within the scope of our Social Days. Examples
include our participation in Civic Involvement Week sponsored by the
National Network for Civil Society. Our social commitment often takes
the form of longstanding partnerships like our partnership with Nummer
gegen Kummer, the Telefonseelsorge crisis helpline, the Lebenshilfe aid
organization and DKMS, the German Bone Marrow Donor Center.
Corporate volunteering img is also an important component of our training and development activities. The volunteer efforts of our apprentices
are given special recognition in our Group competition, "Responsibility
wins!".
Our corporate giving concept includes donations for aid organizations
worldwide, preferably those with which we have longstanding partnerships, and fast disaster relief. Our Group Donation Policy lays out the
guidelines for these activities. For example, we have been collaborating
with Germany's Relief Coalition, Aktion Deutschland Hilft, for 13 years
now.
When it comes to our corporate volunteering, we collaborate closely
across country borders and share experiences and best practices.
We use a set of KPIs to measure our success:
 The Social Commitment ESG KPI reflects our performance.

 Long-term partnerships with non-profit organizations
 Corporate volunteering (supporting our employees in their volunteering activities) and corporate giving (our donation activities)

 The Community Investment ESG KPI reflects our social commitment
in terms of financial, human, and material resources.
 The Beneficiaries ESG KPI measures the huge number of active
contributors as well as the broad target groups they reach.
 The Media Literacy ESG KPI highlights the high percentage of projects and activities promoting the competent handling of media. It is
highly relevant to us as it correlates closely with our core business.
In 2016 we have analyzed the impact of our engagement with the SDGs.
The results show that our corporate citizen strategy is a large contributor
in achieving the goals, with emphasis on SDG #4, #5, #10 and #17.
For 2017 we are planning to further strengthen the connection between
our corporate citizenship program and the SDGs - focusing on core
activities (e.g. inclusion by broadband expansion and innovation) as
well as our focal topic “digital literacy”.

"Responsibility wins!" competition
Our "Responsibility wins!" competition gives our apprentices and cooperative degree students the opportunity to get involved for the greater
good and develop their skills beyond the scope of their professional
training. Many of them all over Germany once again participated in
2016. A total of 47 projects were submitted to the jury. Four of them
received an award in February 2017 at an awards ceremony held at
Deutsche Telekom headquarters in Bonn. Because so many good ideas
were submitted, first place was awarded twice: to a team of apprentices
from Hamburg and to one from Nuremberg. Both teams launched
projects giving refugees the chance to see what it is like to work at
Deutsche Telekom and complete an application training offer.
International Red Cross
During the reporting period we supported the Restoring Family Links
(RFL) program conducted by the International Red Cross in the context
of our donation program. It often happens that family members lose
contact with each other when fleeing their home country. The RFL
program tries to put families in contact with each other via phone,
Internet or handwritten messages and to locate missing persons, especially children.
Humanitarian action for the people affected
by the floods in Skopje
Skopje is the capital of Macedonia and the city was hit by the “water
bomb” storm on 6 August 2016. 21 people lost their lives, dozens were
injured or went missing, and roads, houses and infrastructure were
damaged.
Makedonski Telekom immediately called on its employees to take
humanitarian action. They were asked to help thosepeopleaffected by
the flooding and provide essential resources. Apart from collectingfood
and toiletries, our colleagues also visited the municipality Stajkovci
which had been most severely affected by the flood. They helped to
rescue some of the furniture in flooded accommodation, removed mud
and cleaned up homes. Our volunteers also took away waste and debris
that had been deposited by the flood waters. They worked tirelessly and
with great dedication for many hours each day. Alongside the volunteering work carried out by our employees, we also donated EUR 32,000
toward reconstruction of homes in the municipality Gazi Baba. We
provided power banks and mobile units for local citizens in the affected
areas. Our mobile phone network was fully operational.
The Telekom for Macedonia Foundation and the Red Cross started a
donation hotline and this collected more than EUR 100,000.
Social initiatives by OTE-Cosmote
COSMOTE Scholarships Program
COSMOTE ran its scholarships program for the 15th consecutive year.
The program provides 51 scholarships for first-year students facing
financial and social difficulties with a total value of EUR 770,000. Alongside financial support, COSMOTE offered the scholars fixed and mobile
products and services free of charge to cover their telecommunication
needs for the duration of their studies along with cable TV services.
Over a period of 15 years, the program has provided a total of 581
scholarships valued at more than EUR 4.3 million.

Supporting NGOs for children
Once again this year, the OTE Group supported 16 charitable organizations caring for children all over Greece by contributing financial aid that
exceeds EUR 550,000. Over the past 17 years, the OTE Group has supported more than 55 institutions with over EUR 7 million contributing to
the improvement of children’s living conditions all over Greece. Again,
three of the NGOs were selected by vote of the employees. Two of these
help to satisfy the basic needs of children in terms of food, clothes,
education and housing. The other NGO provides psychological support
to children at the Oncology Units of Hospitals in Athens.
Contribution to Children’s Hospitals
In 2016, the OTE Group cooperated with the “Pediatric Trauma Care”
non-profit organization and contributed to the creation of Trauma Centers in two Children’s Hospitals in Greece. Over recent years, the Group
has allocated more than EUR 370,000 to infrastructure and healthcare
equipment for children in nine Greek public hospitals. Up until now, this
helped more than 81,000 children.
Edition II of "Exempt from Theory" – T-Mobile for the
Young!
Since August 2015, T-Mobile has been a strategic partner in the Exempt
from Theory program initiated by the start-up Social Wolves in 2014.
The program is a contest that helps young people to gain their first professional experience after school. The aim is to develop practical skills
in project management among young people and inspire them to take
part in social activity.
Participants identify an idea for the most interesting action and then put
it into practice with the support of mentors. Each finalist will receive an
international certificate signed by the Project Management Institute.
As part of the partnership, T-Mobile Polska provides internships for
students, and several dozen employees also act as mentors. They look
after the technical equipment for the interns, and assign a special award
for the best technological project. We are also working on an e-volunteering platform where students can address problematic issues and
our employees can help them online.
In 2016, 11,000 students signed up for the program in the most recent
edition and they carried out 506 projects which reached about 5 million
beneficiaries. We are now in the middle of the third edition and 7,700
students have registered so far.
Participation in this project provides another example for implementation of corporate responsibility activities that benefit young people,
foster volunteering among employees, and strengthen the company’s
image as a professional and socially responsible employer.
TUN Fund presents fourth sustainability award
T-Mobile Austria started out 2016 with its fifth annual call for submissions for Austria's popular sustainability prize through its T-Mobile

Getting involved in culture and sports
We encourage variety in cultural expression throughout the Group.
In Germany, we are one of the leading sponsors of culture and sports.
In addition to providing funding, we support artists, athletes, event
organizers and associations in their communication and marketing
activities. Regional involvement at our locations also plays a key role.
Sponsoring music is a long-standing tradition at Deutsche Telekom
and a vital element in the our brand communication activities. We want
to give as many people as possible access to cultural events, thus
encouraging them to share thoughts and ideas. Our main sponsorship
focus is placed on events like the Beethovenfest and the International
Telekom Beethoven Competition in Bonn, which has been providing a
stage for up-and-coming pianists from all over the world for eleven
years.
We are a partner of the Junges Theater Bonn and sponsor a number
of projects including a media education school project that works to
motivate young schoolchildren to take a fun, creative approach to
learning about new media.
We support both professional and mass sports with our sports sponsorship activities, which focus on soccer partnerships with the German
Football Association, FC Bayern Munich and other German major
league soccer teams. We also place emphasis on those aspects of
sports that foster community life. We sponsor athletes via the Deutsche
Sporthilfe organization, projects focused on mass and school sports
and athletes with disabilities. And we make some noise at our Bonn
location with the help of the Telekom Baskets Bonn.

Encouraging enthusiasm for sports with the Telekom
Baskets
We want to take responsibility for our immediate social environment,
which is why we sponsor the Telekom Baskets in Bonn.
Ticket sweepstakes for the Telekom Baskets
Before the 2016/2017 season got underway, we launched our ninth
Tix for Kids ticket sweepstakes. We raffled off two sets of tickets (2 x 30)
for each home game. Participation was open to all schools in Bonn.
Businesses# also had the opportunity to become ticket sponsors for
social welfare institutions, school classes, club teams and work centers
for disabled people. We participated in the sweepstakes as well and
donated an additional 242 tickets to various organizations including
the Maria im Walde children and youth center and refugee housing.
Baskets@school student training project
Deutsche Telekom's Baskets@school initiative makes it possible for
students in 5th through 10th grade to have their sports idols visit their
school. Children and young people experience what professional basketball training is like by participating in a training session that lasts for
around 90 minutes. The goal of the project is to strengthen team spirit
and teach students from the region more about basketball. Pros from
the Telekom Baskets teach the students tricks and special moves. Head
team trainers offered a total of eight training sessions from November
2016 through April 2017.
Stollenhelden: The new soccer program for future
stars
Stollenhelden (Soccer Heroes), Deutsche Telekom's new soccer program for future stars, in an advancement of the ANSTOSS! soccer initiative. We are involved in youth soccer with projects like "Soccer Heroes of
the Month," "New sports experience" and "Team spirit." The sponsorship
program supports amateur soccer clubs with a focus on young talent.
Soccer Heroes of the Month
Each month we recognize the best goal shot by soccer players up to
15 years of age. They all have the opportunity to upload videos highlighting exceptional goals. Five are pre-selected by the jury. People can
vote for their favorite online at stollenhelden.de. The "Soccer Hero of t
he Month" receives a prize worth 1,000 euros for them and their club.
They are have the opportunity to compete for the title of "Soccer Hero

The RioMaNiacs young reporter project is a collaboration between
Deutsche Telekom and the Aktion Mensch charity lottery organization.
An integrative reporter team comprised of one disabled and one nondisabled student from the German Sport University in Cologne reported
online on the 2016 Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Via the
riomaniacs.de social wall, the reporters followed the events and
reported on the latest news from the Paralympic living quarters of the
young German Paralympic athletes. The reports were designed particularly to get young people interested in the Paralympics. The integrative nature of the project shows sports can bring together people with
and without disabilities.

Sport Is Good campaign
The 2016 Biggest Sports Hour
“The Biggest Sports Hour” is a sports and movement festival and more
than 50,000 people from 16 cities in Romania and Bulgaria participated
in the sixth edition of this festival. Approximately 100 volunteers backed
the organization of the event. Telekom Romania is hosting the festival
within the “Sport is good” campaign. 41 sports classes took place in the
festival including a shooting gate for football enthusiasts that was supported by 64 famous national and international trainers. We organized
a run called “TriKids” for the little ones and a bicycle training session
entitled “Kids Bike School”. During the event, we set up a new world
record for “the largest number of people running 100 meters in a
12-hour outdoor relay”. Around 1,000 runners took part and ran a total
distance of 154 km in the city of Bucharest over a period of 12 hours.
We were also able to advise more than 700 people on nutrition and a
healthier lifestyle.

Deutsche Telekom has been a sponsor of the German National Paralympic Committee (DBS) since 2006. We are a national partner of "Together
for Germany – The German Paralympic Team" and promote and support
Germany's Paralympic athletes.
A unique concert experience at the Beethovenfest
and Jazzfest festivals
Beethovenfest Bonn
We were again Chief Sponsor of the Beethovenfest Bonn in 2016.
The slogan of this year's concert experience was "Revolution." The
program's two focal points were the French and Russian revolution with
the Toulouse National Orchestra and the Ural Philharmonic Orchestra.
The student manager project of the Young Beethovenfest initiative again
organized an event at last year's festival. The Outside the Box! concert
featuring vocalist Helen Schneider and the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra was organized by secondary school students over a period of eight
months. The students handled financing and advertising and make
sure the concert runs smoothly. The team was also responsible for artist
and sponsor services, visitor services, the online presence on different
channels, a press conference and planning and running the entire
supporting and educational program. Beethovenfest employees
assisted the students in all of their responsibilities.

Telekom Romania supported the second edition of Brasov
International Marathon
In May Telekom Romania organized the Brasov International Marathon
as part of the “Sport Is Good” campaign. More than 2,000 national and
international runners participated in the marathon. The fees collected
from the 5 km race and 15% of the value of the other competition races
(marathon, relay-marathon, half-marathon and 10 km race) were
donated by the Telekom Romania Foundation to the ”Copiii de Cristal”
Association for the benefit of the children with autism.

Jazzfest Bonn
We were also once again the Chief Sponsor of last year's Jazzfest Bonn
in April 2016. In this role we presented a double concert at the Telekom
Forum on April 22 where the Bundesjazzorchester (German Jazz
Orchestra) and the Thomas Quasthoff Quartett entertained the
audience.

Free WiFi img services at 20 top archaeological sites
and museums in Greece
The OTE Group has been cooperating with the Greek Ministry of Culture
and Sports to offer free WiFi at 20 archaeological sites and museums
throughout Greece. The aim of this initiative is to promote Greek cultural
heritage through technology, enhance interaction by the public and
increase the connectivity of the sites. The investment exceeds EUR 2
million and includes research, design and development relating to wireless infrastructure, procurement of the necessary equipment, operation
and maintenance of the networks, and provision of free wireless internet
services for a period of three years. Free WiFi provision will be gradually
completed by the end of 2017.

The OTE Group’s Telecommunications Museum
in the new digital era
The OTE Group's Telecommunications Museum has completed the
huge task of documenting and digitizing its collection. This is one of
the few Greek museums that have documented and digitized the majority of its collections, including more than 23,000 items and files that
comprise the story of telecommunications and Greece as a country.
The collection can now be accessed by everybody. The online archive
is constantly being enriched and it currently includes more than 600
exhibits displayed on the new Museum's website.

Working in the digital age

Working in the digital age

And what do you tell those employees who do not want to come
along on this journey?
I would tell them: "Give digitization a chance, there are no alternatives.
Get actively involved. That will secure your job in the future." And I would
definitely point out the many supportive offers at our Group that enable
our employees to keep up with digitization. We need to show people
that digitization is also about guaranteeing your attractiveness as an
employee.

Christian P. Illek, Member of the Deutsche Telekom Board of Management for Human Resources
since April 2015

Mr. Illek, what does digitization mean for all of us as well as for
society – is it a blessing or a curse?
We are seeing dramatic changes in our world due to digitization. As the
saying goes: "Life will never be as slow as it is right now." We all need to
deal with these changes – both personally and professionally. One thing
we can be sure of - digitization knows no limits. This may sound threatening to some, but anyone who takes a closer look will notice that they
are already part of this development: when they surf the Internet, use
social media or simply check their account balance online. I consider
the situation as a positive one and am convinced that digitization will
promote us as a society and as a company. Previous industrial revolutions show that those countries and businesses that adopted new technologies at an early stage are those that are well off now.
Doesn't Deutsche Telekom have a home advantage in this respect?
Its services play a significant role in digitizing our everyday life.
The major challenge that we at Deutsche Telekom are also facing is how
to digitize our core business, which we have been growing for decades,
and take our employees with us on this journey. We are not a start-up;
we have an established structure and culture. That is why we need to
consider how to properly balance out the enormous changes we make
in the Group in terms of digitization. We want to take as many employees with us on this journey as possible. Although we have some employees who do not wish to take this step into digitization, there are also
others who can hardly wait. We need to consider these two mindsets in
the digital transformation of our Group.

And what will change with digitization?
The work of the future will in many ways be a lot more project-based
than today.. Team structures will be much more heterogeneous. We
will have to come to terms with the fact that some of our activities, in
particular standardized, repetitive tasks, will be carried out by intelligent
machines. The topic of employee participation, i.e., democratization of
the workplace, will be boosted by digitization. Independent work and
self-management are becoming increasingly important. Information
monopolies are starting to dissolve, knowledge is being shared. Social
media, although still dismissed by some as a gimmick, will become the
main drivers of process productivity, and offer huge potential as yet
untapped. I firmly believe that in the future we will collaborate much
more in virtual communities, not only within the company but also with
our partners and customers.
And what are the new challenges Human Resources will have to
face?
Good HR management provides orientation and transparency – both in
everyday work and regarding the future challenges our employees will
face in our work environment. We support our employees in mastering
and shaping digitization– the best team that will drive us along our path
to becoming the leading European telecommunications provider.
Key innovations are no longer the product of individuals but are created
in collaboration. That is why we are interested in the topic of digital,
virtual collaboration, what trends exist outside of our company and
how we can use them in human resources management. With work
becoming increasingly mobile, access to our systems via mobile
devices needs to be possible as well. This, of course, also has an impact
on our leadership styles. We are paving the way by demonstrating the
collaborative leadership models that are out there. We are focusing on
concepts like workspaces and work environments, from office layouts
to what people need for mobile working.

Getting the right people to the right place at the right time has
always been HR management's key task. During a time when everything is in motion, this is becoming an entirely new challenge. How
can that challenge be mastered with almost 220,000 employees?
One example is our strategic Skills Management project, which will
help us manage our HR planning more effectively while promoting the
employability of our employees. The goal of this pilot project, which has
been agreed with the Group Works Council, is to create a database that
provides a transparent overview of our employees' skills. We will be able
to use the database to identify skills gaps for each employee and team
and then encourage any necessary training. The skills database is
another example of our productive collaboration with employee
representatives. This project is a great example of how employers
and employee representatives are prepared to shape the digital transformation together, in the interest of employees. After signing the first
collective agreement on mobile working last year, we have taken things
a step further with our skills database.
If the professional world is steadily and radically changing, how can
people keep up?
I think that is a question most people do not even ask themselves.
Because digitization has many positive effects and can increase quality
of life, they are prepared to take this path. In my experience, people
flourish when they have freedom and can grow. Employees, regardless
of their age, are increasingly expecting creativity, diversity and openness
as well as individual training and development opportunities from their
working environment and tasks. They want to take on responsibility and
new challenges – ideally no day is like another. And when it is no longer
important where and when we work and constant availability and accessibility is no longer a sign of performance, work can more easily be
combined with private life.
But couldn't it be that employees are scared of losing their jobs due
to digitization? Aren't there studies with dramatic predictions?
There are studies that predict dramatic job losses and there are studies
that expect a very favorable impact on employment figures. We will
see very different results depending on the industry and field. This also
applies at our company, as we will be making job cuts in some fields
while creating new jobs in others. The sooner a company recognizes
and addresses the topic of digitization, the better prepared it will be
for the changes to come and the more able to shape the best possible
future for the company and its employees. I believe that digital solutions
will help us meet growing customer requirements and offer more services. That means that we will have more possibilities for corporate
action and thereby create jobs.
I don't know what the future holds. But in having a positive attitude
toward change and innovation, I can help shape the changes to come –
whatever they may be. That is what we need to do to guarantee a strong
future at Deutsche Telekom.

Responsible and agile employer

Responsible and agile employer

Competent, dedicated, employees with an entrepreneurial approach are
key to success along our path to becoming the leading European telecommunications company. As a responsible employer, we want our
employee relations worldwide to be based on dialog and focused on
collaboration and fairness. We give them the opportunity to realize their
potential and to contribute their individual strengths and ideas within
our Group. In a market characterized by transformation, we use pioneering methods and tools to help them approach necessary changes and
new technological opportunities with flexibility.

Shaping employee relations as a responsible
employer
As a responsible employer, we pursue dialog-oriented employee
relations throughout the Group and engage in trusting, constructive
collaboration with employee representatives and unions. The works
councils, central works councils and Group Works Council represent
the interests of our employees at our Group in Germany. Our partner
at a European level is the European Works Council. We also have
executive staff representation committees and disabled employee
representatives at unit, company and Group level.
Fair pay and benefits
We offer our employees competitive, performance-based pay oriented
to the relevant national market. Our remuneration policies are structured
to guarantee equal pay for men and women and do not discriminate.
Executive compensation at Deutsche Telekom is based on our Groupwide Global Compensation Guideline. We also offer our employees
additional benefits such as our company pension scheme. We regularly
assess employee satisfaction with our employee survey and also conduct surveys on specific topics and in specific units.
Flexible working models
Having the chance to structure one's work according to one's own
needs considerably improves work-life balance and helps prevent stress
and the feeling of being overworked. That is why we encourage flexible
working models. Our offer ranges from flexitime and part time to lifetime
work accounts. We have been offering lifetime work accounts to around

100,000 employees and civil servants in Germany since early 2016.
This reflects 90 percent of all employees in Germany. Lifetime work
accounts give our employees the opportunity to finance future absence
from work of longer than one month, which may be used for early retirement, a sabbatical or to support a period of part-time work. Executives
have had this option since 2012. We set up 6,000 lifetime work
accounts by the end of the year. In 2016, the sector-specific collective
agreement on mobile working laid the foundations for establishing
mobile working as a new format within the company.
Socially responsible staff restructuring
The ICT img industry is undergoing a far-reaching transformation and
our customers' demands are subject to constant change. We have to
continue to grow and develop to be ready for the future. This also means
quantitative and qualitative staff restructuring at some of our companies. The main objective is to structure these changes for our employees
in a way that is as socially responsible as possible. At the companies
affected, for example, we decided to enter into collective agreements
that rule out compulsory redundancies. Within the scope of this socially
responsible staff restructuring, we employ alternative instruments such
as severance payments and phased retirement as well as strategic training programs that help our employees prepare for new assignments.
Employee satisfaction and participation
We highly encourage a feedback culture throughout the Group characterized by open dialog and constructive communication with our
employees. An important tool in these activities is our You and Me
(YAM) social network with around 115,000 users, which replaced our
earlier Telekom Social Network in 2016. Not only can our employees
visit YAM to get all the information they need, they can also participate
in cross-level dialog and suggest their own topics for discussion. Our
Board managers also regularly use YAM as a platform for direct dialog.
Another key element of our feedback culture is our employee survey.
We supplement this survey with pulse surveys, which give us a snapshot
of the mood Group-wide twice a year. Our Group-wide ideas management activities are another key tool in encouraging employee contributions to the success of the company.
We have seen an increase in the number of employees participating
in our Group-wide pulse surveys as well as our ideas management
activities. 73 percent of our employees took part in the November 2016
pulse survey, the highest participation rate we have seen so far.
Employee satisfaction remained high as well at 73 percent. Statistically
speaking, one out of every eleven employees submits their ideas to our
ideas management team, giving us a continually high participation rate.
We also offer our employees different ways to get involved, e.g., in the
form of corporate volunteering projects.

Deutsche Telekom - Corporate Responsibility Report 2016

Employees
Responsible and agile employer

We have set Group-wide standards for managing employee relations.
These are documented in our Guiding Principles, Leadership Principles
and our Employee Relations Policy.
Employee relations at our national companies
We employ reviews to gauge progress when it comes to implementation
of our Employee Relations Policy at our national companies. Two to
three national companies are subject to a review each year. Our national
companies use the results to further improve relations between the
company and its employees. The results also help us assess employer/
employee relations and any human rights risks involved in our business
activities.
In 2016 we conducted an employee relations review at e-value, the service center unit of OTE (Helenic Telecommunications Organization S.A.)
and Cosmote (Cosmote Mobile Telecommunications S.A.) in Greece
and at T-Systems Iberia. We publish the results on our website.
The review showed that employees at e-value are very satisfied with
their employer. e-value is very concerned with team building and promotes a work culture based on trust and transparency. In view of the
current economic instability in Greece, these aspects are highly valued
by employees. The company successfully implemented all eleven elements of our Employee Relations Policy.
At T-Systems Iberia, the review showed that the core elements of the
policy, e.g., training, non-discrimination and complaint channels, were
also successfully implemented . The health rate is at an excellent level
at the company (97.7 percent). In addition to other health-promoting
measures, T-Systems Iberia also offers its employees psychological
support if needed. The company also runs a "Stable Table of Labor
Relations," a platform set up to encourage communication between
the four main trade unions.
In 2016 we also took a look at how the measures recommended after
the 2015 review were being implemented.
Socially responsible staff restructuring continued
The transformation of our company, which will help us stay competitive
in the future, was a central topic in the past few years and will continue
to be in years to come. This process is connected to complex staff
restructuring. We are creating new jobs in growth fields and are training
qualified personnel to fill these positions. Other areas are the focus of
restructuring activities involving workforce reduction. We make sure
that all restructuring measures are implemented in a socially responsible way for our employees. Vivento, our internal service provider for staff
restructuring at Deutsche Telekom in Germany, supports us in these
activities.
Civil servant transfer
Around 500 civil servants employed with Deutsche Telekom transferred
to federal, state or local authorities in 2016 with the help of Vivento. This
high number can partially be attributed to a growing need for personnel
on the part of a number of authorities in the wake of reform projects.
2016 also saw the addition of numerous new activities in connection
with high refugee numbers. The job offers placed by various authorities
were particularly attractive to employees from Group units that were

105

restructured in 2016 as well as all employees looking for a new challenge outside the Group. Employees with civil-servant status showed
particular interest in transferring to the German Federal Office for
Migration and Refugees (BAMF) within the scope of our "Deutsche
Telekom helps refugees" initiative as well as to IT jobs offered by federal
and state authorities. Vivento also helped employees find positions with
federal, state and local administrative authorities.
Staff restructuring at T-Systems
T-Systems in Germany has been undergoing an extensive transformation since 2014, which has now been successfully completed. This
transformation was accompanied by complex staff restructuring
measures. T-Systems launched the Job Service & Placement (JSP)
project in 2014 to support employees affected by the change. The company offered support to employees whose positions were cut through a
variety of measures. We were able to entirely avoid compulsory redundancies as a result.
JSP prepares employees whose positions are subject to restructuring in
the transformation process for employment opportunities within and
outside of our company. Advisors and coaches assist these employees
with a professional career analysis, advise them on their perspectives,
help them through the application process and help them identify interesting job openings. Employees switching to an internal or external
position with less favorable pay and benefits can also qualify for compensation payments. Employees involved in the JSP program were given
first choice over external applicants for internal T-Systems job offers in
Germany and we offer employees additional training of up to six months
as needed. We also offer support in the form of information events such
as a seven-week workshop series. At these workshops, our employees
can improve their personal skills and strengths and learn how to best
apply these on the job market. Continuing education such as English
coaching and XING training complete our offer.
In 2016 we decided to continue JSP beyond the scheduled end date in
the summer of 2016 until June 30, 2017. More than 1,300 employees
have found new jobs since we launched JSP.
Staff restructuring at Telekom Deutschland
Telekom Deutschland is engaged in an ongoing process of transformation in order to guarantee long-term competitiveness. This process
involves a three-pronged approach of staff restructuring, upsizing and
downsizing. There were around 2,000 new hires in 2016, more than 70
percent of which involves junior staff who have been trained at the
Group. Around 3,600 employees left Telekom Deutschland in 2016 with
the help of socially responsible options such as early retirement, severance pay, phased retirement and transfer to various German authorities.
We take an innovative approach to internal restructuring activities such
as forward-thinking skills management (link to Skills management:
ready for the challenges of tomorrow).
And we are forging new paths when it comes to working hours as well.
Working hours that are the same at every department are no longer
current and fit neither the expectations of our customers nor our actual
working hour needs, for example when it comes to network build-out.
Within the context of restructuring Telekom Deutschland, we are speaking with employee representatives about more flexible working hours in

Deutsche Telekom - Corporate Responsibility Report 2016

Employees
Responsible and agile employer

order to help us come up with custom-fit solutions. These include permanently reducing weekly hours in the service and technology areas to
help us manage the restructuring process. We are also working on making the weekly work schedule more flexible. Our idea is to be able to
increase weekly working hours by two to four hours during peak load
times and then reduce them by two to four hours when things are slow.
That would give us some flexibility with a responsible approach while
also helping us secure employment.
Flexible working hour schemes expanded further
We offer a wide range of optional working models tailored to the needs
of specific target groups.
Voluntary commitment to encouraging part-time employment
Our goal is to improve the work-life balance and more effectively
facilitate part-time models in everyday work routines, for men as well
as women. With our Group-wide policy on part-time work, we made a
commitment in 2010 to encourage part-time work in executive positions. In 2016 a total of 35 executives throughout Germany were working part-time. Deutsche Telekom also made a similar voluntary commitment regarding employees covered by collective agreements and civil
servants. 13.4 percent of employees covered by collective agreements
and 20.7 percent of Deutsche Telekom civil servants throughout Germany are currently working part-time. In 2016 we developed another
part-time model, which we refer to as "additional days off," which is
scheduled to go into effect in late 2017. The model gives part-time
employees additional days off to help them be even more flexible with
their schedules.
Lifetime work accounts
Since early 2016 we have been offering lifetime work accounts to
around 80,000 employees and Deutsche Telekom civil servants
throughout the Group. These give them the opportunity to finance future
absence from work of longer than one month, which may be used for
early retirement, a sabbatical or to support a period of part-time work.
Our employees can finance their lifetime work account either from their
gross salary or with time credits converted into monetary amounts. Until
2018 we will also support employees who are below a certain income
limit with an annual contribution. As many as 6,000 lifetime work
accounts were set up by the end of 2016.
Guaranteed return to full-time work
Part-time employees throughout the Group can be sure that they can
return to their previous schedule earlier than planned if they want to do
so. This guarantee has been in place since January 1, 2014. All they
need to do is give 3 months' notice; business requirements will not be
considered in such cases. That means more flexibility and security
for employees. With this policy, we are setting the bar for part-time
employment. This makes discussion about returning to a full-time
position unnecessary.
Phased retirement
Phased retirement is a model to help employees with a smooth transition to retirement. Employees aged 55 and above throughout the Group
can reduce their final working years and begin early retirement. We offer
phased retirement both as a block and as a part-time model. Unlike
regular part-time regulations, we make a substantial top-up payment to

106

the employees' part-time pay with our phased retirement offer. That
means that reducing their weekly hours does not mean a proportionately high reduction in net pay for employees. A total of 1,996 phased
retirement contracts were signed during the reporting period, 1,293
with employees under collective agreements, 127 with employees not
covered by collective agreements and 576 with civil servants.
Part-time training for single parents
We have been offering single parents up to the age of 25 the opportunity to complete a training program or cooperative course of study parttime at Deutsche Telekom in Germany since 2011 in collaboration with
the German Federal Employment Agency. 20 young people began their
part-time training with this program in 2016.
Returning to work after parental leave
Within the scope of the Stay in ContacT parental leave program,
Deutsche Telekom offers employees on parental leave a part-time
program to help them return to work.
Job sharing, splitting and pairing
We also offer a number of additional options for reducing working hours
such as job sharing, in which two or more employees share a position.
This option can be employed using a job splitting model where each
employee is responsible for different tasks or via job pairing, where
employees share responsibility for one area.
2016 collective bargaining rounds finalized
We pursue a trusting relationship to employee representatives and pay
our employees salaries that are fair and based on market standards. In
the 2016 collective bargaining round the negotiating partners agreed
on the following terms for the large majority of employees of Deutsche
Telekom in Germany.
 Starting in 2016, the salaries of roughly 60,000 employees covered
by collective agreements at Deutsche Telekom AG and in the Germany operating segment were raised in two phases by a total of 4.7
percent for employees in the lower pay groups and 4.3 percent for
employees in the higher pay groups. The first increase took place on
April 1, 2016 with the second scheduled to follow on April 1, 2017.
The duration of the new collective wage agreements is 24 months
and they are scheduled to end on January 31, 2018.
 Salaries at T-Systems for some 20,000 employees under collective
agreements will be raised in two phases by a total of 3 percent for
employees in the lower pay groups and a total of 2.5 percent for
employees in the higher pay groups. The first phase took place on
June 1, 2016 with the second scheduled to follow on April 1, 2017.
The collective wage agreement had a term of 24 months and will
expire on March 31, 2018.
 The wages of apprentices and students in cooperative study programs will also be increased in two phases. On April 1, 2016, they
were raised by 35 euros with another 25-euro increase scheduled
for April 1, 2017. Subsistence allowance has been increased to
23 euros.

Deutsche Telekom - Corporate Responsibility Report 2016

Employees
Responsible and agile employer

 During the 2016 collective bargaining rounds, the partners also
agreed to introduce a remuneration system using salary bands at
Deutsche Telekom AG. The former remuneration system with its
fixed group levels had been introduced in 2001 and was replaced
at Deutsche Telekom AG by the banding system already being used
at Telekom Deutschland GmbH on October 1, 2016. This is another
step toward standardizing and harmonizing our German remuneration systems.
 Collective agreement regulations to protect employees from compulsory redundancies were extended until December 31, 2018,
at Deutsche Telekom AG, Telekom Deutschland GmbH and the
associated service companies as well as at T-Systems.
Great interest in employee survey
We feel it is important to take the opinions of our employees into
consideration when growing the Group, which is why we regularly ask
them what they think. Our most important feedback tools include our
employee survey, which is conducted every two years, and the bi-annual
pulse survey. The pulse survey gives us a snapshot of the current mood
in the Group and allows us to monitor the effectiveness of the follow-up
measures taken as a result of the employee survey. This lets us make
quick adjustments if necessary.
Around 73 percent of our employees throughout the Group participated
in the November 2016 pulse survey, the highest participation rate we
have seen so far. 73 percent of participants expressed high satisfaction
with their employer. The next Group-wide employee survey is scheduled
for 2017.
High turnout for Group-wide ideas management
A large number of employees once again participated in our Groupwide ideas management activities in 2016. One out of every eight
employees submitted ideas in Germany alone, giving us a continually
high participation rate. This shows how strong our employees' interest
is in actively playing a part in improving our products and services.
The economic benefit resulting from the 10,125 ideas submitted translated into a total of 168.5 million euros in cost savings and tapping
new business potential. One idea submitted in 2016 deserves special
mention: it enabled us to reduce our mast replacement rate from 14 percent to 10 percent, thereby making a significant contribution to conserving resources and reducing cost.
We particularly encourage our employees to submit ideas on the topics
of the future, which is why we launched the Magenta Service Innovations ideas management campaign in November 2016, calling for innovative suggestions on the topic of customer care. At total of 32 ideas
were submitted, a reflection of the popularity of this ideas management
campaign among our employees.
Our employees' ideas can also hold their own in external competitions.
One employee idea won the Deutscher IdeenPreis 2016 award presented by the German Institute for Business Management (dib). Another
idea took home third place in the "Best idea for occupational health and
safety" category of the 2016 Ideas Management Award presented by
Deutsches Institut für Ideen- und Innovationsmanagement.

Future Work – work in the digital age
The primary aim of our human resources policy is to promote virtual
collaboration and new workplace structures. We want to create a communicative, performance-oriented working environment and encourage
diversity in innovation, independence and agility at the company. These
things require a modern working environment. We also employ a variety
of measures to support flexibility, virtual collaboration and a corporate
culture centered around sharing knowledge. The first and, as of yet, the
only collective agreement on mobile working concluded by an employer
association creates the framework.
Open-plan offices
We are creating open office layouts and tearing down the proverbial
walls to promote inter-departmental collaboration. Employees at
Deutsche Telekom in Germany can structure their work flexibly and
choose their work environment. Room concepts tailored to requirements and an inspiring environment promote creativity and a sense of
well-being as well as cross-hierarchy collaboration. We moved into our
new Group campus in Hamburg in 2016 and effectively created new,
open-plan offices at our facilities in Frankfurt and Bonn. The majority of
restructuring activities at our headquarters in Bonn has been completed
and our employees have moved into the new offices. Large locations in
Essen, Berlin and Düsseldorf will follow. Several thousand employees
are already experiencing the new office world.
Virtual collaboration
In addition to redesigning our office landscape, we encourage virtual
collaboration in a variety of ways, including independently organized
working groups. Instead of rigid, closed project teams, our employees
work together to develop cross-functional and cross-hierarchical solutions and to increase their knowledge informally. During the reporting
period, for example, 40 international working groups, referred to as
"communities of practice," were working at T-Systems on more than
20 strategic topics such as cyber security, the cloud and Industry 4.0.
Community members receive intensive support with online training
offers. Our employees at T-Systems invested a total of 31,000 hours in
meetings and web conferences in their community of practice in 2016.
We have been improving virtual collaboration and shared learning
processes since 2014 with our digital Working Virtually platform.
Thanks to the platform, we reached out to 17,600 T-Systems employees
in 2016, offering them digital learning opportunities around the clock.
They can find numerous learning videos, webinars, weekly learning
calls and a number of other offers on the platform. Our employees have
already invested a total of 6,546 hours in digital learning.
Digital learning
In collaboration with our partners from the world of science, we have
developed a format that combines new forms of collaboration and learning: Magenta MOOC. MOOC stands for Massive Open Online Course.
It is an online course targeted toward a large number of participants that
provides the opportunity to learn anywhere and at any time. The format
is particularly suited to our needs as we face the challenge of reaching
more than 225,000 employees in 50 countries.
After our first Magenta MOOC in 2014 met with excellent response
throughout the Group. we decided to again offer the program in 2016.
Under the motto, Go Digital, participants could develop solutions that

address one of ten actual challenges we face in our business at
Deutsche Telekom. Topics included connected cars, Internet of Things
and managers as role models in the digital age. Participants were
divided into teams where they applied innovation methods like design
thinking and were assisted by mentors and tutors. Around 3,500
employees from 31countries signed up for the program. The video
contributions were accessed around 50,000 times. 177 small, international, cross-departmental teams developed solutions for a variety of
challenges. Magenta MOOC shows how we effectively apply the ideas
of our employees. It also encourages cross-departmental, cross-hierarchy and cross-border collaboration and improves the digital skills of
our employees.
Innovative strength through Group-wide collaboration
The topic of open, cross-departmental collaboration is becoming
increasingly important as digitization progresses. We need methods
and approaches that bring our employees from different areas closer
together. In 2016, we brought together the strengths of different
innovation areas at our company in our Co-innovation Labs. There
Telekom Innovation Laboratories (T-Labs), Deutsche Telekom's main
research and development area, is now collaborating with the T-Systems
Innovation Center in Munich and the T-Systems Global Systems Integration unit, our implementation partner, which develops innovative solutions in collaboration with our customers. At the Digital Co-innovation
Labs, which are structured along the lines of a start-up, our colleagues
work with agile processes and use a variety of tools and methods like
design thinking, a creative process for coming up with ideas, prototyping and implementation. This helps us develop products that address
trends early on and offer maximum customer benefit.

Occupational health and safety

Occupational health and safety

The health and performance of our staff are the foundation of the longterm success of our business. We feel that it is our duty and responsibility to maintain and promote the health of our employees. We use numerous target-group-oriented measures and extensive preventative offers to
support our employees – from trainees to our older employees – in their
personal health and safety.

Promoting the health of our workforce
Our health management strategy is designed to maintain and promote
our employees’ health and performance. We view occupational health
and safety legislation as minimum requirements.
Incorporating health and safety management throughout the Group
Our occupational health and safety measures are effectively integrated
into our operational structures via certified management systems and
appropriate policies and guidelines. The internationally recognized
OHSAS18001 management standard, which has been in use since
2010, serves as the foundation. During the reporting year, 70 German
and international locations were audited according to OHSAS 18001
and 51 German and international locations were audited according
to ISO 14001. Their certification was renewed in all cases. With these
results, we can guarantee a high health and safety standard in years to
come.
All of the parties, tasks and measures involved in the health and safety
management system are described in a handbook entitled Health &
Safety Environment. The handbook was signed by our top executive
managers as a symbol of our commitment to health and safety. Our
health and safety measures are centrally steered at Group level with
health managers being responsible for implementation at the different
locations. We systematically assess the effectiveness of our measures.
This includes reviewing the results or our employee survey, evaluating
stress prevention measures under collective agreements, competitor
benchmarks and other relevant indicators. The analysis of this data
forms the basis for annual measures that by far exceed legal requirements. Some examples include our extensive psychosocial counseling
offers and initiatives like driving safety training and activity and exercise
offers.

One focus of our corporate health promotion activities is encouraging
our employees to assume responsibility for their own health. We place
our managers under the obligation to encourage a corporate culture
based on these values and have incorporated health promotion into our
leadership model. Implementation of this model is assessed using unitspecific targets, some of which are based on the results of our employee
survey.
Results of different indicators during the reporting period
Different indicators reflect the effectiveness of our corporate health
management activities:
 The health rate at Deutsche Telekom in Germany dipped slightly by
0.2 to 93.8 percent*. (*95.5 percent excluding long-term absences,
down by 0.1)
 The accident rate is considerably below the industry average.
 According to health insurance providers, the number of our
employees suffering from mental health problems and the length of
treatment is rising only slightly in contrast to the industry trend.
There are clear reasons explaining this trend, but we are planning to
implement extensive measures to counteract this development in 2017.
This year's RobecoSAM img rating, for example, again attests to our
high standards. RobecoSAM is one of the leading rating agencies,
annually assessing the sustainability performance of major corporations. We scored 100 out of 100 points in the Privacy and Operational
Health & Safety category of the 2016 RobecoSAM Corporate Sustainability Assessment, making us an industry leader.
Fitness at work: activity and exercise offers
expanded
We have been offering our employees special fitness programs at
locations in Germany since 2014 to help counteract the effects of a day
spent working at their desks. Qualified "mobile fitness coaches" teach
easy-to-do exercises particularly for the back and neck to small teams
of employees. We continued this program, which is popular with our
employees, in 2016 within the context of our extensive health promotion
activities; more than 1,000 courses were held by the end of 2016. We
plan to continue this offer in 2017.
We added a new activity offer during the reporting period with the
Active Workplace project. Recent scientific studies show that regular
interruptions of a seated occupation are more effective than lengthy
training sessions after work. Active Workplace gives our employees
the opportunity to incorporate exercises into their daily schedule.

Employees
Occupational health and safety

During a six-week pilot, 60 employees tested a variety of mobile exercise
equipment. The "desk bikes," or bicycles attached to the desk, proved
the most popular. The pilot phase was scientifically followed by a study
conducted by Berufsgenossenschaft Verkehr (the occupational accident insurer of the transportation industry), the Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German Social Accident Insurance (IFA)
and the German Sport University Cologne. The academics examined
not only the test participants’ levels of acceptance and whether they felt
good using the equipment, but also physiological activity parameters,
energy conversion levels and individual posture. Not only were participants having fun, their mental activity also increased. Another positive
side effect was that participants burned more calories when cycling
than when just sitting.
Because the positive response of our employees was supported by the
accompanying study, we decided to purchase 460 desk bikes in 2016.
More than 4,000 employees currently participate in the program. We
are planning to expand the program in 2017 and include international
locations as well.
Psychosocial counseling as part of change
management
Changes at work can be perceived as stressful, which is why transformation processes currently underway at Deutsche Telekom are intensively supported by the Employee and Executive Advisory Service. Our
goal is to provide support to employees and managers and prevent
psychological crises.
To this end, we offer individual counseling as well as other services.
Employees can take advantage of several one-hour counseling sessions. Accompanying offers are available to managers and those
responsible for change processes. Talks and workshops on psychological health complete the offer. Targeted communication measures inform
employees at affected locations of these offers.
In 2016 we particularly accompanied the restructuring measures at
GHS (Group Headquarter & Shared Services) by offering psychosocial
counseling. We provided managers there with a guideline on health and
leadership during change processes, for example. The guidelines also
provide orientation regarding specific approaches and links to additional information and support offers.
T-Systems: health app and corporate culture pilot
project
Health app
We introduced the Froach health app at T-Systems during the reporting
period. The app was developed by a Berlin-based start-up and can be
customized by companies to meet their individual needs. It helps our
employees take active, health-promoting mini-breaks. People who sit
every day staring constantly at their PC displays, without taking time for
some short breaks, will feel various types of aches and pains over time,
and their eyes will become tired as well. The "main actor" of Froach is
a friendly green frog that motivates users to be more active in short
animated videos. The project was initially tested in Germany. Froach
became available at T-Systems in English in fall 2016 and is being
introduced globally.

Corporate Happiness pilot project
T-Systems has started initiating changes in its corporate culture within
the scope of a pilot project. The aim of the project is to apply the scientific findings of "positive psychology" to identify values that will enable
all employees to better realize their potential. The project encourages
them to independently work toward their own, and the company's, success. During the reporting period we trained 27 "happiness ambassadors" within the scope of the pilot project, offered trainings and impulse
talks and launched the "Stop complaining" initiative.
Workshop makes promoting health a top priority
A corporate culture that promotes health needs role models. A healthpromoting leadership style is an integral part of our Leadership Excellence and Development (LEAD) program in Germany. Managers learn
about the options available to them for their own preventative health
care and how to strengthen their individual resources. We also teach
them about the basic principles behind a health-promoting leadership
style and how they can apply these in their daily activities. Managers
can also take advantage of other workshops on leadership and health.
These offers will continue to be available in 2017. We also support our
managers in their responsibilities by offering online trainings on health
& safety facts, mental health and corporate integration management,
which helps employees get back to work after a longer period of illness.
Recent study on digitization and health
What are the effects of the digitization of work on the health of our
employees? To find out, we conducted a study in collaboration with
BARMER GEK health insurance, University of St. Gallen and German
weekly, BILD am Sonntag. More than 8,000 participants from Germany
were polled via phone call in July and August 2016. The results show
that digitization is already a part of life for our employees Those surveyed welcomed the possibility of flexibly structuring their working
hours and working at different places, saying that in this way, digitization helped reduce the conflict between career and family. The study
also showed that having a good relationship to their managers helps
employees effectively take advantage of digitization. However, participants also mentioned negative consequences of the digital workplace,
such as difficulty falling asleep, headaches and back pain. The survey
also revealed that there are still major differences when it comes to
corporate health offers such as courses on stress prevention. The majority of those surveyed, both younger and older employees, were optimistic about the digitization process. Visit the BARMER GEK homepage for
more information.
As a modern ICT company, Deutsche Telekom closely deals with the
challenges of digitization in the company's corporate health management activities. We continue to advance our corporate health management policy to meet changing requirements. During the reporting
period, for example, we offered online fitness courses, online coaching
for better health, expert chats and video counseling. These offers allow
us to reach our employees at any time no matter where they are. Our
Health & Safety Management department also analyzes new, potential
problems that could arise in connection with digitization. In spring
2017, for example, we are planning to conduct a risk assessment of
mental stress within the context of our employee survey. The results will
be compared with the findings of the latest BARMER GEK study, which
will help us develop new health offers.

Health Month
As part of our “Total Health” program, an in-company training program
promoting physical exercise to improve employees’ health and lifestyle,
and enable them to participate in relaxing activities with their co-workers, we organized a “Health Month” in October 2016. During this month
three offers were made with a total of 756 employees participating:
IMSS Brigade running medical tests
We invited the IMSS Brigade (Mexican Social Security Institute) to our
office in Puebla. They ran medical tests like calculating the body mass
index and glucose update and gave tetanus or influenca vaccines. 382
employees participated in 8 days of tests. The medical problems found
were diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and obesity. 284
of the participants were diagnosed with medical conditions; 98 people
are without any risk.
Health Talks
The IMSS also gave talks about health issues like: medical checkups,
handling stress, eye care, smoking, high blood pressure, body postures
at work, health insurance, depression, healthy food and first aid. The
purpose of the talks was to provide our employees with information and
advice on important health matters and therewith contribute to their
long-term well-being. 232 employees participated in the talks.

Health Days at T-Systems Russia
Our voluntary medical insurance program is available for all employees
and includes a Health Day. A doctor is available for several hours at all
our offices to carry out consultations every Monday. Our members of
staff can ask the doctor questions about their concerns, get advice or
obtain a referral note for treatment at a state clinic. Up to 20 employees
can use the service every Monday. Around 15 people visit the doctor
each week.
T-Systems Russia also provides the opportunity for a visit to a specialist
doctor once a year:
 Neurologist: 60 employees attended a consultation in 2016
 Ophthalmologist: 60 employees attended a consultation in 2016
 Cardiologist: 107 employees attended a consultation in 2016
In addition, 70 employees were vaccinated in the fall of 2016.

Kiloton – our program for weight loss
Obesity is a very serious health risk. By staging an internal competion
known as Kiloton we encourage our employees to reduce weight and
body fat within seven weeks.Kiloton combines exercise and a balanced
diet. The activities offered included a nutritionist program, kick boxing
and dance classes on the premises, as well as weekly tips on how to
reduce or lose weight. 142 participants made up47mixed teams in the
Puebla and Mexico City offices. The program was built as a competition
to provide additional motivation for our employees and strengthen their
team spirit. The program again was a great success and each participant achieved the weight loss in a healthy way with a lot of exercise.

Health activities and e-learning for employees
In 2016, Slovak Telekom made arrangements to carry out a large number of preventive health checks for employees. The checks included
measurement of blood pressure, cholesterol levels, varicose veins and
hemoglobin. Health boxes were also provided for front-line staff, first-aid
courses, massage sessions, lymphatic drainage, health seminars, and
information about healthy food in the workplace. These activities are
very popular at Telekom. 2,793 employees took advantage of the health
checks and 1,390 participated in 14 health seminars and workshops
featuring nutrition specialists, doctors and other professionals.
We have been using e-learning solutions to train our employees for
more than ten years. They have proved to be successful for the education and training required under statutory regulations such as occupational safety and fire protection. More than 150 courses are available
online. The e-learning system automatically notifies employees if they
have not completed an assigned course. We incorporated a gamification mechanism in the system which allows employees to collect points
for studying courses and then qualify at different levels. The element of
competition and game further promotes digital education within Slovak
Telekom.

Training and development

The need for highly qualified workers in the STEM img subjects (science, technology, engineering and math) will continue to grow in coming years. This development will particularly be felt in business areas
such as cloud technology, big data, cyber security and the Industrial
Internet. Our extensive training and continuing education offers help
prevent a lack of these skilled workers, sharpen our company's competitive edge and get us ready for the digital future.

Investing in training and development
Our goal is to identify and get talented young people on board early
on in their careers. That is why we extensively invest in training and
continued education. From 2016 until 2018 we are planning to annually
hire a total of 2,200 apprentices, students in cooperative study programs and interns for our entry-level training scheme in Germany. This
fixed number of openings enhances planning security. We currently
offer nine training programs, eight cooperative bachelor's programs and
three cooperative master's programs. We are one of the largest training
providers in Germany with around 7,600 young people in training.
A wide array of development opportunities for our experts and managers complement our training offer. With these efforts, we improve career
proficiency and effectively promote life-long learning.
The cornerstones of our vocational training and development programs
are our Employee Relations Policy, Guiding Principles and Leadership
Principles.

Strategic focal points
Our aim is to more intensively structure our vocational training and
development programs around our company's future needs. Big data,
all-IP img and security are some of our strategic focal points. In mid2016, for example, we launched a pilot project using an online course to
train employees to become big data experts. 50 employees from five different countries participated in the one-year e-learning pilot project. Our
cyber security professional training, which we launched in 2014, went
into its third round. This course has also been available since 2016 to
employees with job experience.
Promoting digital learning
We have been promoting digital learning at our corporation for many
years. In 2016 more than 30 percent of all course hours at our company
were completed in digital form, with Germany recording more than 35
percent. Our modern formats are boosting the popularity of digital learning. Take our massive open online courses (MOOCs), for example. More
than 3,500 employees from more than 32 countries signed up for these
courses by the end of 2016. Other popular formats include simulations,
short learning units for on the go and games. We also rely increasingly
on informal digital learning. Our experts use communities to share ideas
on tomorrow's topics. There are currently roughly 40 international communities of experts, 20 of which focus on Deutsche Telekom's strategic
business areas. Community members at T-Systems use the "communities of practice" digital collaboration format to facilitate collaboration
across segments, countries and hierarchies.
We will continue to expand our offer of digital learning formats in 2017.
We laid the foundation for this at T-Systems in 2016 by purchasing
licenses for external online platforms. T-Systems employees can now
take advantage of a variety of learning offers from any location based
on their requirements. 70 percent of T-Systems employees have signed
up for the offer so far. In view of the favorable reception the program
received at T-Systems, we are planning to roll out use of digital learning
licenses throughout the Group and expand our list of providers for
courses such as English coaching.
Group-wide leadership development
With our LEAD (Leadership Excellence and Development) program,
we offer standardized business-based, strategically relevant learning
formats to all managers at the Group. The portfolio covers central topics
that support managers in mastering daily challenges as well as in their
roles as leaders and team managers. The program is based on our
leadership principles "Collaborate," "Innovate" and "Empower to perform." T-Systems also introduced a Vice President Leadership program
in 2016. 32 selected managers will spend nine months learning about
leadership and digital transformation in face-to-face and online courses.

Tools for performance assessment
The Performance Dialog is the tool that we use to assess the performance of currently around 2,800 top-level managers. The assessment
involves not only target achievement levels but also looks at how the
manager went about achieving these goals. Managers complete a selfassessment and obtain feedback from their colleagues sharing the
same hierarchal level. We also continue to use our Compass tool to
assess civil servants and employees covered by collective agreements
in Germany and our Performance & Potential Review for employees
outside collective agreements in Germany, a tool that is also used at
many of our national companies.

collaboration with "audimax" student magazine and the MINT-Zukunftschaffen (Creating a STEM future) initiative, is now open to STEM students not only from Germany but also from other European countries.

Reviewing effectiveness
We regularly and systematically review the effectiveness of our training
and development activities. These reviews involve standardized surveys
conducted as part of our quality circle, which gives us a regular overview of the quality of our training and development activities via monthly
reports. Our Bologna@Telekom program designed to encourage parttime study, for example, is now subject to extensive quality controls –
from the application process to graduate management. We also ask
employees to evaluate our training and development offers in our regular employee survey and employ additional tools beyond our standard
reports and surveys in special cases.

Start up! trainee program for young innovators
Our international Start up! trainee program makes it possible for young
people with entrepreneurial spirit who are open to new ideas and innovation to get started at Deutsche Telekom in Germany. We hope to
attract graduates in STEM subjects to the trainee program. During a
period lasting 15 to 18 months, trainees familiarize themselves with
different areas of the company in Germany and abroad. They take on
challenging project assignments in various business areas. Experienced
mentors assist the trainees. The program is supplemented by innovative
training formats and events. Our Start up! trainees also pursue their own
initiatives and support social projects within the context of events such
as our Social Days. A collaboration was launched in 2015, for example,
among different refugee accommodation centers in and around Bonn
under the motto "Telekom cares." Following a donation campaign in
2016, our Start up! trainees worked together with a children's home in
Königswinter to plant a garden, tend it and bring in the harvest, which
they enjoyed at a Thanksgiving celebration.

Recruiting target: to be a global magnet for
digital talent
As a leading European ICT img service provider, we need the best
minds: creative thinkers and employees with a knack for technology that
want to help us design the digital transformation. We are looking for top
people with talent to work for us as a global corporation. Our recruiting
activities definitely play a key role in the ongoing internationalization of
our company, which is why we continue to look for top talent in external
and internal talent pools in a number of countries. We compiled all of
our recruiting activities into one Global Competence Center in 2016
because standardized processes and tools help us work more efficiently.
We have positioned ourselves as an attractive employer in Germany,
our native market. Our surprising, target group-oriented campaigns
and initiatives on social media help boost our image as a sought-after
employer. In 2016, the Potentialpark ranking once again confirmed that
we have the best career website in Germany, and our social media
activities landed us second place in a company comparison.
Last year we were also presented two awards by the Trendence
Employer Branding Award committee: one for the best university marketing and the other for our "Vom Flüchtling zum Talent" (From refugee
to talented employee) project in the Employer Branding Innovation
of the Year category. In this project we specifically target refugees as
potential candidates. The project is comprised of the
www.careers4refugees.de job platform, internships for refugees and
our "Train the trainer" project in which we teach volunteers and employees how to give application training.
We are currently particularly focused on increasing our attractiveness as
an employer on new and growing markets. An example: Our Women's
STEM img Award, which we have been presenting since 2013 in

Our new Global Competence Center will take over full management of
our recruiting activities in 2017. Positions that require a particularly
high degree of talent will be managed by our Global Strategic Active
Sourcing team. Our experience with active sourcing, or active, personal
contact with potential candidates via networks, trade fairs and events,
has been so positive that we are planning to use this tool worldwide.
This will make it easier for us to find and win over top talent.

Deutsche Telekom's in-house university educates
experts for the telecoms market
We educate experts for tomorrow's telecoms market at our University
of Applied Sciences in Leipzig (HfTL). With 1,400 students in full-time,
cooperative and part-time bachelor and master's programs, HfTL is the
only university in Germany to offer this special profile. When it comes
to research, we focus on ambitious topics that are relevant to society
like conserving natural resources and advancing Germany standing in
the technology sector. Research and teaching go hand-in-hand. Our
research findings are seamlessly incorporated in the academic eduction
of our students, guaranteeing that high-quality scientific knowledge is
shared by the university, the company and society.
New data privacy certification program for Deutsche Telekom
employees
Data privacy is a key factor in the acceptance and use of modern
technologies. That is why we have set up a department for data privacy
and security at HfTL university. Starting in the 2017 summer semester,
Deutsche Telekom employees can expand their knowledge and expertise within the scope of the one-year certification program entitled Data
Privacy and Security in Information Systems. The certification program
conveys detailed knowledge of data privacy approaches in areas such
as data management, data analyses, process design and law. We are
also planning to give people with the right qualifications the opportunity
to build on the certification program by taking a master's degree.

Graduates of this master's program will be able to develop scientific
methods for problem solving in IT systems and advance data privacy
methods through practical contributions.

Encouraging diversity in education
We stand for open-mindedness and are committed to diversity, which is
why we accept different levels and needs when it comes to junior staff.

Competition instead of class
Connecting academic education with the latest research results in the
area of software engineering and using the latest teaching and learning
methods has been a reality at HfTL since 2014 thanks to a challenging
software engineering competition. In the 2016/2017 winter semester
more than 160 students participated in the 3rd Software Engineering
Competition. Students are asked to develop innovative solutions
to current problems in the telecommunications industry and other
business sectors. The projects cover a wide range of topics from web
applications for associations and apps that can be used for song writing
to budget planning for roommates. The student projects will be judged
by an internal jury at the university on the basis of specified criteria.
Creative implementation as well as programming, user friendliness,
mobile usability and project documentation are all taken into consideration. The winners of the competition can look forward to attractive prizes
like a workshop on the software development method Scrum and IT
security or a trip to CeBIT.

 Depending on how long their families have been in Germany and
where they come from, young people with migrant backgrounds
often encounter particular problems on the job and vocational training market. We see encouraging them as an opportunity and are
careful to guarantee an non-discriminatory selection process. And
we have been successful: Today, 9.2 percent of our apprentices and
students in cooperative degree programs have a nationality other
than German, representing a total of 66 countries.

Training experts for the 5th generation mobile communications
The HfTL university participates in global research and the development
of 5th generation mobile communicationsin collaboration with different
partners and projects. HfTL also focuses on training future experts in
this technology.
Current research topics and challenges in the area of mobile communications are directly addressed in course materials. Ongoing exchange
of knowledge and experience is guaranteed thanks to the active,
intensive collaboration of bachelor and master's program students
in development projects.
Hands-on lab activities are focused on optimizing the air interface in
live-system operation.
Students develop measuring platform for polymer optical fibers
A key element in our study programs at HfTL is to actively involve students in research and development projects. This approach is also
being taken in a recent research project on developing an environmentally friendly, energy-efficient production method for polymer optical
fibers, which are used in data communication as well as in smart lighting concepts. HfTL is collaborating on the project with the Institute of
Textile Engineering of RWTH Aachen University and Perlon-Nextrusion
GmbH from Dormagen, Germany. The project is sponsored by the
German Federal Environmental Foundation. Within the context of this
research project, HfTL students developed an innovative measuring
platform and programmed a user-friendly software for using the measuring platform.

 In 2009 we launched the "My chance to get going" entry-level training scheme in collaboration with the German Federal Employment
Agency. The project prepares disadvantaged young people with
very little chances on the vocational training market for an apprenticeship at Deutsche Telekom. Results so far have been good. 483
out of 630 interns from 2009 through 2015 started a vocational
training program with us. 104 were accepted into the first year of
the program and 334 directly into the second year. Another approx.
30 interns started the program in 2016.
 Since 2011 we have been collaborating with the German Federal
Employment Agency to offer single parents the opportunity to complete a training program or cooperative degree program part-time.
20 young people began their part-time training with this program in
2016.
 To encourage diversity in the program, we also work to increase the
number of women participating in technical cooperative study programs. While in 2010 the share of women was only 11 percent, it
has meanwhile risen to 22 percent.
 Around one percent of our apprentices are young people with disabilities. This is above-average in view of the total number of disabled
people in Germany.
We have been helping refugees get their careers started since 2015
within the scope of the Group's refugee initiative. Between 2016 and
2018 we will be offering up to 100 refugees per year the opportunity
to attend vocational training, a cooperative program of study or an
internship within our entry-level training scheme. Around two-thirds of
the openings we offered in 2016 were filled. In the recruiting process
we rely on our longstanding, successful cooperation with the German
Federal Employment Agency's job centers. We are particularly interested in integrating refugees into regular training structures and offering
them the support they need. They receive professional support from
their trainers or coaches and also have the opportunity to attend additional, job-related language courses. The training staff receives assistance from an external service provider to make sure that the special
needs of this target group are met. The refugees also have access to
counseling and supportive services as needed. Deutsche Telekom is
planning to continue its involvement in integrating refugees into the
professional landscape in the years to come.

Digital skills in education
Digital skills are one of the main qualifications that we encourage in
our junior staff over the course of their vocational training or studies.
To this end we give them access to different digital media. The main
hub of our activities encouraging the development of digital skills is our
online learning platform for apprentices and cooperative university
students, which has been up and running since 2008. We encourage
the next generation to post their own knowledge on the platform and to
participate in the experience and knowledge of others in addition to
focusing on the ongoing expansion of core learning offers. During the
reporting year, for example, we added a variety of new topics to our
digital materials, integrated a digital course on the topic of health and
launched a learning blog. We also offer a number of online tools that
our junior staff can use to assess their own skills and compare their
knowledge and results with their program requirements. They can
use the learning platform to virtually plan their learning schedule,
document it and then later make it available to other apprenticds.
We support independent learning with this offer.
Training program for cyber security professionals
enters next round
Training courses for cyber security professionals (certified by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry) are important continuing education
offers which we have established at our company in Germany. We
launched this program at our company in 2014, closing a gap on the
German education and job market. According to a study by the BITKOM
industry association, IT data privacy experts are extremely hard to find
on today's market. The study found that there were no vocational training programs and very few degree programs that people could attend to
learn the necessary skills. Our aim is to change this, which is why we
offer a two-and-a-half-year part-time course for professionals. Deutsche
Telekom apprentices and students in cooperative study programs can
apply for the program after completion of their vocational training or
course of study. Skills development is integrated into standard activities
and supplemented by topic-based and general modules in a variety of
formats (classroom courses, e-learning, blended learning). Hands-on
learning is combined with an academic approach. Those who complete
the development program receive a certificate for IT security professionals from the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry. We won third
place in early 2016 with the concept in the "Large Enterprise" category
at the Education Awards hosted by the German Chambers of Commerce and Industry (DIHK).
The development program entered its third round in September 2016.
A total of 30 professionals are currently taking part in the cyber security
program. The first group will complete their certification exams in March
2017. The program is in high demand with 300 applications submitted
each year.
The topic of usable security and privacy, i.e., the "human" factor in IT
security, plays a particularly significant role in the program. With this
focus, the program addresses the question of how to best design
security systems so that they can be effectively used by people. In 2015
we collaborated with the Fraunhofer Institute for Communication, Information Processing and Ergonomics (FKIE) to develop a continuing education offer particularly focused on this aspect. The offer complements

115

our training program for cyber security professionals. Participants
can work toward a certificate as a "network forensics professional" or
a "media forensics professional" within the scope of an academic program, making them certified experts in analyzing security incidents.
The course was developed in collaboration with a number of universities.
In 2016 we also prepared another program that will be available to all
of our employees as of 2017. The program addresses a number of IT
security topics (including reverse engineering, forensics, network security, cryptography, cloud security and forensics and computer crime law.
Skills management: ready for tomorrow's
challenges
Forward-thinking skills management is essential to companies that want
to stay competitive. The HR units engage in cross-departmental communication in order to identify the skills that our employees will need in the
future and areas in which new skills are needed. We then structure our
continuing education courses, re-qualification programs and new-hire
activities accordingly.
Planning the job profiles of the future
The rapid pace of technological transformation is making it necessary
to identify early on which skills our employees are going to need in the
future. Our HR department collaborates closely with specialist units to
this end within the scope of the Speed Boat project. They work together
to identify strategic focal topics, develop future job profiles and determine the skills and hiring needs through the year 2020. Measures are
then defined to close any gaps in terms of skills, hiring and training. The
project was launched in 2015. After the first year, the teams had already
defined the first job profiles of the future, e.g., data center infrastructure
manager at Deutsche Telekom Technik. The project is considered a
role-model project for the entire Group.
T-Systems HR Academy
Our human resources at the HR department also need regular continuing education to help them stay on top of the latest technological trends
and future skills requirements. The T-Systems HR Academy focuses on
the requirements of the digital future. The academy is currently offering
a combination of face-to-face and online seminars in German and English in the workshop series that began in March 2016, Almost 1,000
employees signed up for the online seminars and almost 200 employees participated in 16 face-to-face workshops in Germany. The HR
department also held an HR summer camp in which more than 40
T-Systems employees from different countries participated. At the
camp, participants applied the design thinking method to three key
HR projects.
Encouraging and retaining talent
Dedicated, technology-minded and service-oriented employees are
pivotal to the success of our business. This makes it important to secure
the loyalty of these talented employees, encourage them, get them
involved and develop their skills further.. Our global talent management
system serves as the basis for succession planning and placement of
talented employees at our company.

„Talents@Telekom“: online platform simplifies hiring process
Talented people who are planning the next steps in their career or
looking to gain experience by working on strategic projects can sign
up on our Talents@Telekom online platform. Employees from Human
Resources and Recruiting throughout the Group can use the platform
to get in touch with them. With more than 449 employee profiles,
27 percent of which were posted by women and 41 percent by international colleagues, the response to the platform was slightly less than
the previous year. The share of women (24 percent in 2015) and international colleagues (36 percent in 2015) increased compared to the
previous year. The platform is a useful tool in simplifying the process
of finding the right person for a position anywhere in the Group and
increasing an employee's chance of getting noticed. It also encourages
employees to gain experience at different business units or national
companies and in a range of functions, furthering diversity at the Group.
"Do it yourself!" Talent Conference offers opportunity for dialog
Around 210talented people from roughly 20 countries attended the
Talent Conference in Bonn in September 2016. The year's motto was
"Do it yourself!“ or "How to take charge of your career." Participants had
the opportunity to learn more about effective strategies to help them
advance their careers. The event also offered an opportunity to network
with around 100 of the Group's top-level managers, who made guest
appearances at the event.
Second Performance Dialog for executives
Performance Dialog, which was introduced in 2014, is a tool for developing and assessing the performance of top-level managers. During the
reporting period, the review was conducted with all executives worldwide for the second time.
Performance Dialog encourages ongoing dialog between executives
and their superiors. Working together closely with their superiors and
reflecting intensively on their own leadership style is expected to
improve the performance of our executives and make the assessment
process more transparent. This performance assessment is based on
our Guiding Principles and our Leadership Principles "Collaborate,"
"Innovate" and "Empower to perform." In addition to being reviewed
by their superiors, their colleagues for the same hierarchical level also
assess their leadership style. This peer feedback also has a direct
impact on target achievement.
Our Compass tool for assessing employees covered by collective agreements and civil servants in Germany and our international Performance
& Potential Review continue to be used throughout the Group.
Employee development in Croatia
Our professional education programs “HT Academy” and “Education
of your choice” enable all our employees to participate in a rolling program of skill enhancement. In 2016, we launched our new talent management program “Top Talent” with the aim of retaining and motivating
our key people and high-potential staff. Manager nomination and
assessment center results were used to identify 105 talented high-flyers
with expert or leadership career potential out of larger pool. The highflyers participating in targeted development activities over a period of
1.5 years. They were given individual development plans and took part

116

in customized development programs, strategic projects and special
events like the talent forum. By the end of 2016, 30 percent of these
top talents had been promoted to a more complex or managerial role.
Magenta Infusion Leadership Program with GIBS
in South Africa
In order to develop leaders who can deliver on the TSSA strategy of
Growth and enable our value proposition through competency development, we collaborated with GIBS (The GordonInstituteof Business
Science Business School of theUniversity of Pretoria) to design the
Magenta Infusion Leadership Program with the help of expert assistance and specialist input. The focus of the program was on competency and behavioral change based on our cultural pillars of:
 Collaboration
 Innovation
 Empowered to Perform leading to Customer Centricity
The blended learning approach comprises master classes facilitated by
worldwide specialists, e-learning modules, leadership competency and
behavior assessment, team collaboration, courageous conversations
and a marketplace day. We succeeded in achieving the desired outcomes of the program. These involve our leaders in contributing to
a good financial year 2016, behavioral changes such as a change in
mind-set, increased collaboration and better understanding of the
strategy. The evaluation of the master classes received from delegates
on the value added provided by the program was between 83 and 85
percent.
In 2017, we will hold another leadership competency and behavior
assessment and expect to see competency improvements. All in all,
109 leaders completed the program in 2016.
Employability Program
T-Systems Netherlands deliberately encourages employees to invest in
their professional development and position themselves as experts in
their individual fields. This is reflected in the company’s Employability
Program, which promotes employees’ well-being by enhancing their
knowledge of the internal tools and international platforms provided
by the organization.
In 2016, we evaluated the Employability Program that has been running
for a number of years. Our priority is to maintain a high level of awareness level for this topic. During the course of 2017, we are going to put
more instruments in play to enable our employees to increase their
value inside and outside the organization. Our mission statement is
“Movement and growth – personal and for the organization”. We want
to train our employees for the internal and external labor market and
preserve employment opportunities in the Netherlands. Our training
and projects are focusing on future workforce (developing IT and business skills), work in a digital age (virtual, intercultural and flexible working), health benefits, and recognition (inventiveness and recognition
of individual contributions). We use our career checks to measure the
progress of the program.

Supporting diversity
Our aim is to promote and benefit from the diversity of our employees as
a source of creativity and innovation. That is why we offer our employees
numerous opportunities to grow personally and professionally, regardless of their gender, age, sexual preference, health situation, ethnic
background or culture.
We are particulalry concerned with increasing the number of women in
expert and management careers at our company. We want to be the first
DAX-30 company to have 30 percent women in middle and senior management positions. To this end, we launched the Fair Share initiative.
We have been encouraging our employees to value diversity at the
Group since 2015 with our unconscious bias campaign. We used
explanatory videos and practice-oriented workshops to show to our
employees how an unconscious bias influences thoughts, feelings and
actions and how such behavioral patterns can be overcome. We held
more than 90 workshops (face-to-face or online) in Germany in 2016
alone. We offer multiplier and mentor programs to establish managers
as role models and ambassadors who encourage diversity. Many of our
employees have become actively involved in addressing various aspects
of diversity, for example as members of internal initiatives such as queerbeet, a network of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual employees, or
of the numerous women's networks that have been established within
the Group. These measures are heavily based on our Diversity Policy,
Guiding Principles and our Employee Relations Policy as well as the
Deutsche Telekom Social Charter. We are also a founding member of
the Diversity Charter association. Click here for more information for
investors and rating agencies.

As early as during the hiring process we emphasize diversity and consider options other than just traditional educational routes. One good
example is our entry-level training scheme for young people who are
disadvantaged in terms of their social and educational background and
our part-time apprenticeships/degree programs for single parents.
We support an effective work-life balance with extensive offerings to
allow our employees to work at their best. This includes daycare offers
and assistance with caregiving, offers which exceed legal requirements.
Examples include different options for reducing working hours and the
guaranteed return to full-time work. All employees can return to their full
weekly hours whenever they want. In 2016 we also introduced lifetime
work accounts, which can be used by our employees to take limited
time off, for example.
We regularly assess the effectiveness of our measures for encouraging
diversity and publish the findings on platforms such as Fair Share and
the Deutsche Telekom work-life report. The share of women on our
Group's Supervisory Board has meanwhile risen to more than 40 percent. And the proportion of part-time employees at our company continues to increase as well. 13.4 percent of employees covered by collective
agreements and 20.7 percent of Deutsche Telekom civil servants
throughout Germany are currently working part-time. The number of
disabled employees working for us in Germany puts us well over the
statutory quota of 5 percent.
Fourth German Diversity Day
As in previous years, we participated in the fourth German Diversity Day
held by the Diversity Charter association in 2016. This year we hosted a
Rhine-Ruhr Diversity Network event under the motto "Diversity makes
the difference – cultural skills for business success." Around 100 managers met at the event to discuss the role diversity plays in success in
the business world.
German Diversity Conference 2016
The Diversity Conference is an independent platform for dialog, strategy
and innovative projects focusing on diversity. We have been organizing
it in collaboration with the German newspaper Tagesspiegel and the
Diversity Charter association since 2012. Deutsche Telekom is a founding member of the initiative. Key players from the worlds of business,
politics, society and science once again met at the conference in Berlin
in 2016. Focal topics included real life experience of organizations and
companies and questions like: Which trends are going to define the
workplace in the future? What has changed in the last ten years since
the Diversity Charter was founded? What areas require the most attention? Participants tweeted about the topics and presentations during
the event. The tweets were posted on a Twitter wall. Deutsche Telekom
made the software available at no charge.

Diversity and equal opportunities

Inclusion action plan completed
We are committed to enabling people with and without disabilities
to work together. For years now, we have made sure that more than
7 percent of employees at the Group are people with disabilities, considerably more than at many other companies. With our "Experience
diversity – Inclusion@DT" action plan we added another tool promoting
inclusion in 2016. The action plan helps us comply with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The convention specifies
targets and gives advice on how to encourage inclusion. It also requires
companies to create universal access at the workplace so that it is
accessible to both people with and without disabilities. Our commitment
to employees with disabilities received the 2016 Rhineland Palatinate
award for exemplary employment of people with disabilities.
Child and Career mentoring program: second round
completed
We completed the second round of our Child and Career mentoring program in September 2016 after a run of 22 months. In the program, we
provide support to young experts and managers during the time before,
during and after parental leave. They are mentored by an experienced
manager during this transitional period, learn new skills during tandem
activities and benefit from dialog in new networks. 31 tandem teams took
part in the second round of the program. More than 90 percent of participants were female and half of the mentors were women. 58 percent of
participants landed a new position at the company with the help of the
program, 32 percent of which transferred to a more challenging area.
Training program prepares employees for
supervisory board positions
In 2014 we became the first DAX company to develop a training program to prepare employees for supervisory board positions. The program was developed in collaboration with the European School of
Management and Technology (ESMT) . The goal is to create a pool of
candidates who could potentially assume a position on the supervisory
board at a Deutsche Telekom company in Germany or abroad. We are
particularly interested in encouraging women to take on supervisory
board positions. In addition to information on the traditional activities of
supervisory board members, the training also gave insight into practical
experiences presented by supervisory board members, case studies
from the Group and a simulated supervisory board meeting.
The second round of the program with 33 participants ended in summer 2016. This time seven of the participants were men. So far we have
trained a total of 64 potential supervisory board members, around half
of which work at national companies outside of Germany. Eight people
who have completed the program were appointed to a Deutsche
Telekom supervisory board.
Family Manager pilot project completed
In July 2015 Deutsche Telekom set up the Family Manager pilot project
as a point of contact offering employees personal advice on all kinds of
topics relating to the reconciliation of work and family. This offer also
included a family hotline. This pilot project was scheduled to run for one
year and was available in Bavaria only.
The results following completion of the pilot project were good. 200
employees and managers contacted a family manager for advice within
that year. 500 employees at our Munich and Nuremberg offices also

118

signed up for monthly seminars on the topic of caregiving. We were
able to use what we learned from the project to further improve the
work-life balance of our employees.
Commitment to increasing the number of women in
managerial positions
In 2010 we became the first DAX-30 company to commit to staffing
30 percent of our mid and upper-level management positions worldwide with women. Our Fair Share initiative is designed to help us
achieve this goal. In 2011 we also launched an initiative together with
two other companies to boost the number of women in managerial
positions at the 30 DAX-listed companies, an initiative that is unique
in Europe. With these initiatives we were able to help fuel the ongoing
public debate on the topic.
We initiated a number of measures to help us achieve our goal:
work-life balance offers such as parental leave models, flexible work
hours and childcare offers, a mentoring program for supervisory board
candidates and targeted communication with talented women via our
Talents@Telekom platform.
As a result, we have been able to continually increase the share of
women in management positions since 2010. With 40 percent on the
Group's Supervisory Board, we have already surpassed our own goal
in Germany as well as the legal quota introduced on January 1, 2016.
Since announcement of the women's quota of 30 percent in early 2010,
we have been able to increase the percentage of women throughout
the Group from 19 percent to a current 25,4 percent . We extended the
deadline to 2020 and expanded the area of application to the two levels
below the Board of Management and managing boards as well as to our
internal supervisory boards in Germany. With these efforts, we are significantly surpassing the statutory regulations in effect in Germany since
2015. We are planning to further pursue the measures we have already
taken in order to reach our goals.
Sponsorship of “Every woman in technology” awards
T-Systems Limited partnered with Everywoman in 2013 and is now an
active member of the network. Everywoman is a membership organization that has championed the advancement of women in business since
its foundation in 1999. It works alongside companies looking to develop
and retain a pipeline of female leaders who want to advance themselves
and others.
We have our own Everywoman community with the aim of helping
staff connect and stay inspired by providing the opportunity to network
internally and externally, and to attend in-company webinars, bi-monthly
meetings and an annual event to hear and learn from each other and
from leading women in the technology industry. As part of our commitment to the Everywoman program, we attended the “Everywoman in
technology” awards in 2016 taking some of our customers with us to
help build our brand and maintain a broad client relationship. The
awards play a vital part in highlighting role models whose stories and
achievements demonstrate to those young women and girls that they
too can achieve great success if they opt to forge a career in IT.
T-Systems views the Everywoman program as an important part of its
strategy and will continue to support it in 2017.

Managing sustainability in procurement processes
We continue to make our supply chain more sustainable and have
laid the foundation for this with our sustainable procurement strategy. We adhere to principles for socially and environmentally friendly
procurement throughout the Group and manage our processes with
the help of internal and external performance indicators and management tools.

Fundamental norms and standards
We have defined minimum social and environmental standards for our
corporate governance through our Guiding Principles and voluntary
commitments. We also require our suppliers to comply with these standards. Our CSR and anti-corruption clause forms an integral part of our
supplier agreements to ensure compliance. The clause makes reference
to the following Group policies:

 Our Group-wide Code of Conduct,
 Our Social Charter.
In addition, our collaboration with suppliers is based on the following
principles:
 The Fraud Policy,
 The Coltan Statement and
 The Statement on Extractives.
With our Social Charter we have made a commitment to complying with
the fundamental principles and standards set forth by the International
Labour Organization (ILO img) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD img) as well as with the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Global Compact img.
Commitment to sustainable procurement
Our strategy for realizing sustainable procurement practices is based on
our CR strategy and has been effectively incorporated into our procurement processes. The Sustainable Procurement Working Group (SPWG)
ensures Group-wide, i.e. international, compliance. The members of the
SPWG img are available to assist our employees in all sustainabilityrelated procurement matters. The heads of the CR and Procurement
departments are jointly responsible for the implementation of sustainable procurement practices. They report directly to the Board of Management member for Human Resources and Finance, respectively. Our
escalation process calls for decisions to be made at Board of Management level in serious cases. We have also specified all necessary
requirements to ensure sustainable procurement for the BuyIn joint
venture.
We have incorporated our sustainability principles into the Group's
Global Procurement Policy to provide orientation for our buyers. The
procurement practices set forth in the policy provide specific guidelines
for procurement in Germany and serve as recommendations for our
subsidiaries. An e-learning tool is available to our employees throughout
the Group for training purposes. Our buyers can, for example, use the
tool to learn how to implement our sustainability principles in their daily
business activities. Our new buyer handbook provides an overview of
which CR criteria need to be taken into account during which part of the
procurement process. We use random sampling to review acceptance
of our CSR and anti-corruption clause among our suppliers.
KPI img to promote sustainability
We measure and manage our sustainability performance in our procurement activities with the Sustainable Performance ESG key performance
indicator (ESG KPI). This KPI measures the ratio between the procurement volume we receive from suppliers whose compliance with social

Deutsche Telekom - Corporate Responsibility Report 2016

and environmental criteria has been verified through self-assessments,
E-TASC img or social audits, and our total procurement volume. Our
goal is to cover 80 percent by 2020.
Scores in sustainability ratings
Every year leading rating agencies measure the sustainability performance of large enterprises. Deutsche Telekom scored 98 out of
100 points in the supply chain management category of the 2016
RobecoSAM img Corporate Sustainability Assessment. We were able
to make improvements from the previous year and are currently among
the industry leaders.
110 participants in international sustainability dialog
Around 110 interested parties from ICT companies, NGOs, scientific
institutes and auditing firms met in Nanjing, China under the motto:
"How sustainability can accelerate the delivery of business benefits."
The event was organized by the Joint Audit Corporation (JAC), a collaboration of 13 telecommunications service providers of which Deutsche
Telekom is a founding member. Participants talked about how to best
realize sustainability along the ICT supply chain as well as its benefits
for companies. The discussion included approaches on how to assess
the entire product life cycle in consideration of social and environmental
criteria.
The event made one thing perfectly clear: Sustainability along the
supply chain pays off. Responsible employee relations not only help
improve employee satisfaction, but also reduce employee churn rates,
increase product quality, minimize rework and up productivity.
JAC is planning to further improve sustainability along the supply chain
by intensifying audit activities and encouraging suppliers and other
relevant stakeholders to share their experiences more actively.
Training and handbook on sustainable procurement
The topic of sustainability in day-to-day business was a focal point of
our training activities for buyers in 2016. New employees attended
a four-day training where they learned about processes and tools for
sustainability. In addition, 561 employees took advantage of our
Sustainable Procurement e-learning tool in 2016. We are planning
to rework and update our online training offer in 2017.
We created a new buyer handbook during the reporting period. It
provides an overview of which CR criteria need to be taken into account
during which part of the procurement process. The handbook helps our
buyers quickly identify where to apply sustainability processes, where
to find the right documents and who to contact with questions.
Our training activities go beyond our own employees. We also offer
sustainability training to our business partners and suppliers through
our supplier development program.

We maintain business relationships with more than 30,000 suppliers in
over 80 countries. Our relationships with suppliers are based on trust
and dialog combined with monitoring and providing concrete support
for the implementation of sustainability standards. We have a variety of
instruments, methods and measures in place to help us improve the
sustainability of our supply chain. Our basic aim is to recognize the
cause of any problems and to work closely together with our suppliers
to resolve them.

Improving sustainability in the supply chain
Depending on the development phase of the supplier relationship, we
use different tools to make our supply chain more sustainable. A tenpercent sustainability-weighting factor is included in all bids for proposals. This creates strong incentives for suppliers to offer more sustainable
products and services.
We also use a four-level approach to minimize risks and encourage
our suppliers to improve their practices. The funnel chart illustrates the
process. Via our supply chain management system we initially ask all
potential suppliers with an annual order volume of more than 100,000
euros about 18 sustainability-related aspects (phase 1). These aspects
relate to human rights and corruption as well as environmental protection and occupational health and safety. All suppliers are subject to
mandatory re-qualification after three years.

As the business relationship proceeds, we ask strategically relevant
and/or high-risk suppliers to enter extensive information about their
practices in the E-TASC img (Electronics Tool for Accountable Supply
Chains powered by EcoVadis) information system. Experts evaluate
these statements on the basis of additional background information and
targeted research. We take things a step further in our relationships to
some suppliers that exhibit a higher CR risk and conduct on-site social
audits (phase 2). In doing so, we focus not only on direct suppliers of
Deutsche Telekom but also on downstream suppliers as far as possible.
We also boost the effectiveness of our audits by collaborating with thirteen other companies in the Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC). The increase
in the number of JAC members means that the number of suppliers that
do business with several members of the cooperation is growing. This
prevents audit redundancies.
Based on the information obtained from suppliers and on audit results
we classify and evaluate suppliers according to CR criteria (phase 3).
This is done using supplier scorecards, which let us assess a supplier's
sustainability performance and compare them with other suppliers at a
glance. All available sustainability information (from the E-TASC information system, our own research, audits and pre-qualification results) are
included in our assessments of top suppliers.
We work closely with our suppliers to address any acute problems
that are identified. We have set up a continuous process to help these
suppliers improve their sustainability for the long-term. Our supplier
development program (phase 4) and sustainability workshops are key
elements of this process. We held workshops with four suppliers in
2016. In cases of significant disregard of our requirements, we initiate
an escalation process to effect fast resolution in accordance with the
Deutsche Telekom sustainability standards. The results of the supplier
evaluations and the measures taken to solve the problems are recorded
centrally.
Four new additions to supplier development program
We collaborate as partners with our suppliers to make sure they are able
to meet our high sustainability criteria with measures like our development program for key strategic suppliers. In this program we work
together to come up with solutions for topics such as environmental
protection, working hour regulations and occupational health and
safety. It is a clear win-win situation for us as well as our suppliers
because better working conditions have a positive influence on
employee loyalty and motivation, raise productivity and improve the
quality of products. In 2016 we added four new suppliers to the program; it now comprises a total of eleven suppliers.

Supply chain management

We conducted a pilot online survey during the reporting period to
assess the effectiveness of corrective measures following social audits.
Supplier employees had the opportunity to anonymously rate improvements in nine different areas. We analyzed the results of the survey and
introduced additional improvement measures where necessary.
We are planning to use such surveys as a standard tool in the future to
assure the quality of improvement measures introduced in social audits
and in our supplier development program.
We also developed training content for our suppliers. This content will
be made available via an online tool in 2017 and suppliers will be able
to use it independently. We are hoping this will help us reach even more
suppliers.
The program's success is tangible. The following improvements have
been made at Chinese suppliers, for example:
 Work hours at one of our suppliers have dropped from 68 to
48 hours a week.

We are committed to the sustainability of our supply chain and were
once again recognized for our efforts in 2016. The Ethical Business
Corporation presented us with 1st prize for Best Supplier Engagement.
The jury was impressed by our supplier development program (SDP).
They were particularly inspired by the results that our suppliers have
already achieved.

 Waste at the main facility of another supplier was reduced by
16 percent thanks to a waste analysis.
 One supplier now generates 16,902 metric tons less CO2 per year,
equivalent to the CO2 emissions of 10 fully booked flights from
Berlin to New York.
The diagram shows the areas in which we audit the suppliers participating in our program. Using the results, we work with them to develop a
plan for remedying any issues. Suppliers receive support from Deutsche
Telekom experts as well as professional external consultants in applying
these measures. All activities and results are documented so that we
can gauge the effectiveness of the measures employed. Adjustments
are then made as needed.

We were also able to score points with our engagement in the supply
chain during the previous year. In 2015 we were presented the German
Award for Excellence in the "Responsible sourcing" category at the DQS
Sustainability Conference for our "ongoing supplier development efforts
for permanent improvement of sustainability performance." In 2015 we
also received an award in the "CSR along the supply chain" category of
the German CSR Award. The award recognized our genuine approach
to ongoing supplier development.

Resource scarcity and raw materials sourcing

Resource scarcity and raw materials
sourcing
Production of electronic devices like smartphones is harmful to the
environment and requires large amounts of water and energy. Because
the production facilities of suppliers and manufacturers are often
located in regions where water is scarce or the population does not
have sufficient access to electricity, the availability of resources plays
a more significant role there than it does in countries like Germany.

Handling critical raw materials
We collaborate with suppliers and industry initiatives to effect responsible raw materials sourcing. One
of our requirements on suppliers is that they do not use any conflict
resources in the devices that we sell or the network technology we
employ.

Moreover, valuable raw materials like metals are used in producing
smartphones and other ICT img products. Some metals, including
tantalum, gold, tin and tungsten, are extracted from ores, some of which
are extracted in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo
under conditions that are inhumane and/or associated with civil war.
The parties involved in conflict in the region use the profit for purposes
such as financing civil wars. Deutsche Telekom does not produce any
ICT products itself. We purchase these products from international
manufacturers and sell them at our stores, offer them in the context of
service provision or use them in our network infrastructure. We require
our suppliers to refrain from using any of these conflict resources. We
also support industry initiatives like the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative,
which work toward a more sustainable supply chain.

We published our Coltan Statement in 2005 and added the Statement
on Extractives in 2009. The use of conflict-free resources has been a
product requirement on our manufacturers since 2014. The purpose
of this decision is to make sure that both our direct suppliers as well as
their sub-suppliers minimize the social risks that come with extracting
raw materials. We require our suppliers to comply with Deutsche
Telekom's Statement on Extractives img. Policies regarding conflict
resources and their use are also an integral aspect of our supplier
audits.

initiative for responsible raw materials sourcing. Its objective is to identify conflict resources and prevent their extraction and sale.

Supporting responsible resource extraction
Deutsche Telekom requires its suppliers to protect the environment and
use resources responsibly. These requirements are documented in our
Social Charter. They are also included in detail in our CSR clause, which
has been a mandatory component of our General Terms and Conditions
for Purchasing since 2013. We require our suppliers to provide information on their activities as part of a self-assessment and conduct supplier
audits to emphasize the importance of these requirements. In the scope
of the audits, we check whether our suppliers use an environmental
management system and how they manage their energy and water consumption, as well as other factors. We also explicitly ask them about
their waste management system.

CFSI is based on a working group that was founded in 2008 by the
Global e-Sustainability Initiative and the Electronic Industry Citizenship
Coalition industry associations (Extractives Working Group) to address
sustainable raw materials extraction. Since then, the number of metal
processing companies and smelters participating in CFSI has continued to grow. 241 of these companies have been audited in compliance
with the standard audit protocol (as of January 2017).

Climate strateGy

one of our goals is to reduce the environmental impact of our business
activities. one important milestone is our climate target: by the year
2020, we are planning to reduce the absolute amount of Co2 emissions
we produce by 20 percent compared to base year 2008 (excluding
T-mobile usA). one step in this process is investing in energy-efficient
network technology.
And we are concerned with more than just reducing our own carbon
footprint. we want to help our customers reduce their Co2 emissions
as well. The Gesi img smArTer2030 study shows that information and
communications technology may be part of the solution in the fight
against climate change. products such as our cloud and mobility solutions help reduce the amount of Co2 emissions our customers produce.
And we continue to expand our offer of solutions like these.
ouR integRated climate stRategy
we have bundled our climate protection activities in our integrated
climate strategy. our strategy consists of four climate protection aspects
that significantly influence our business activities: Co2 emissions,
renewable energy, energy efficiency and sustainable products. we have
set goals for all of these aspects and defined kpis to help us regularly
review our progress. our integrated climate strategy is also tied to our
"leading european Telco" Group strategy, allowing us to effectively
integrate climate protection measures into our core business.

col. by 2016, we were already able to reduce our emissions by 5 percent compared to 2008 in absolute figures.* in Germany we were able to
realize a reduction of 6.5 percent in the same period of time. key forces
behind this reduction include using modern building technology and
office concepts as well as an efficient vehicle fleet and replacing business trips with audio and video conferences. initial projections within
the scope of our 2016 climate target monitoring show that the broadband expansion in Germany is impacting our Co2 emissions to an unexpected degree and that these are rising above those that we planned in
2013. As soon as we have completed our climate target monitoring
activities we will be able to precisely identify these impacts and discuss
them as well as any measures that need to be taken with the Group's
board of management at the end of the year. The results will be presented in the next Cr report.

data only confirmed by pwC for Germany

renewable energy
we are assessing ways to increase the share of green energy in use at
our company, e.g., by purchasing guarantees of origin for energy from
renewable sources, generating our own renewable energy and introducing carbon pricing. some national companies are setting a great
example: magyar Telekom in hungary, T-mobile netherlands, and oTe
in Greece obtained 100 percent of their electricity from renewable
sources in 2016. we have also introduced parameters throughout the
Group that can be used to assess electricity procurement in terms of
sustainability. These parameters help us make our energy mix more
transparent and increase the share of energy obtained from renewable
sources at our company. The share of energy from renewable sources in
use at the Group was almost 10 percentage points higher on average in
2016 than in the national energy mix of each relevant country*.
when calculating the share of energy from renewable sources, we also
use the share of renewable energy in the country mix, as the (usually
lower) share of renewable energy in the residual mix is not available. for
Germany, the eeG surcharge paid is taken into account when calculating the share of renewable energy.

the four pillars of our integrated climate strategy:
Co2 emissions
our goal is to reduce the absolute amount of Co2 emissions we produce throughout the Group. by the year 2020, we are planning to
reduce our Co2 emissions by 20 percent compared to base year 2008
(excluding T-mobile us). To help us achieve this goal, we record all
direct and indirect emissions using the globally recognized GhG proto-

energy efficiency
we continue to expand the capacity and performance of our fixed-line
and mobile networks to meet the demands that come with rapidly growing data traffic. because network operation calls for a considerable
amount of energy, we are investing in modernization and energy-efficient technology. in order to measure our progress, we introduced two
new key performance indicators (kpis) in 2016. They show our energy
consumption energy intensity kpi and our carbon footprint Carbon
intensitykpi in proportion to the transmitted data volumes.

Sustainable products
Many of our products and services provide various sustainability advantages. They can help reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions,
improve healthcare and make logistics more efficient and environmentally friendly. In 2015 we generated 39 percent of sales with products
and services that provide sustainability advantages such as these while
ruling out any significant sustainability risks. This reflects an increase of
two percentage points compared to 2014.
Collaboration for climate protection
Effective climate protection calls for joint efforts on the part of business,
politics, science and society. That is why we are involved in a number
of German initiatives, such as the 2° Foundation, and international
associations. One of these is the Global e-Sustainability Initiative img
(GeSI img). As an industry association, GeSI's vision is to help make
society greener and more climate-friendly with the help of ICT solutions.

Co2 emissions

in order to achieve our climate protection target, we need to reduce our
Co2 emissions including our energy consumption. Areas with especially
high energy needs, such as our networks (fixed-line and mobile) and
our data centers, are particularly high on our list. in these areas it is
particularly difficult to decrease energy consumption with continuously
increasing data volumes and transmission rates. other focal points
include how we operate our buildings, business trips and our fleet of
company and service vehicles in Germany. our vehicle fleet boasts
roughly 26,000 vehicles in Germany and is one of the largest in europe.

pRotecting the climate
"we assume responsibility for a low-carbon society" is one of the key
action areas of our Cr strategy. we intend to keep this promise with the
help of our Group-wide climate protection target, which was adopted in
2013: we are planning to reduce our Co2 emissions by 20 percent by
2020 compared with 2008 (excluding T-mobile usA). we have specified
a variety of measures and developed measurement tools to help us
reach this goal.
measurable success in climate protection
we use different key performance indicators (kpis) to measure the
effectiveness of our climate protection efforts. kpis also provide transparency to shareholders regarding our progress in realizing our climate
target. we have been recording two new kpis since 2016: Carbon intensityand energy intensity. These kpis express the ratio between our Co2
emissions or energy consumption and the data volumes we transport.
They will be replacing our energy Consumption kpi, which creates a
correlation between energy consumption and revenue. in contrast,
these new kpis provide a clear depiction of developments in the energy
and emissions efficiency of our network, thereby underlining the relationship between these developments and our core business.

Co2 emissions

we have been publishing the emissions generated by our key european
national companies since 2015, adding u.s. subsidiary T-mobile us in
2016. emissions sources at our national companies are similar to those
identified in Germany. At national companies without any relevant fixedline business such as those in Austria, poland and the netherlands,
however, purchased products and services are the main source of
scope 3 emissions.
overview of scope 3 emissions (t Co2e)

we have been fully disclosing the scope 3 emissions generated
throughout the Group since 2016. They came to 4,879,850 metric tons
of Co2 equivalents in Germany, roughly 2.6 percent more than in the
previous year. This slight increase can be attributed, among other
things, to an increase in the number of devices being leased by our
customers and higher investments in network expansion. As in previous
years, most of these emissions were generated by the use of end
devices sold or leased out by us (roughly 40 percent). emissions
generated by purchasing technology to expand our networks as well
as the purchase of end devices and other goods and services were
significant as well.

enablement factoR: customeRs Reducing co2
our products and services not only connect people, they also help them
reduce their Co2 emissions. That is why, in addition to calculating our
own carbon footprint, we also calculate the amount of Co2 our customers can avoid producing by using our products and services. The ratio
between these two figures – the "enablement factor" – allows us to
assess our overall performance when it comes to climate protection.
we began calculating the enablement factor in a pilot project launched
in 2014. The calculation methodology was developed further in 2016.
This process included specifying statistical methods for reviewing data
and information provided by the Group's various departments in order
to improve the validity of our data and ensure comparability in years to
come. we were able to perform twelve case studies for our products in
Germany by the end of the year. one study focused on the savings our
customers achieved by using our cloud offers and outsourcing their
infrastructure to our highly efficient data centers. in addition, we carried
out five case studies for europe.

deutsche Telekom - Corporate responsibility report 2016

Climate & environment
Climate strategy
CO2 emissions

Our findings: The savings achieved by our customers in Germany in
2016 were 33 percent higher than our own CO2 emissions (an enablement factor of 1.33 : 1). The reductions potential of our customers
throughout Europe (including Germany) in 2016 was not quite as high
as our own CO2 emissions, resulting in an enablement factor of 0.95
(see analysis).
We always take a conservative approach in our case studies and the
methodology we use. This applies to both the emissions reduction realized by our customers and our own emissions generated throughout the
value chain. For example, we incorporate all levels of emissions generation when assessing our carbon footprint, including emissions generated when our customers use our products (e.g., emissions produced
by our Entertain customers' TV sets).
New CHP plants up and running
With our energy management activities, we are planning to reduce our
energy use and come a step closer to achieving our climate target.
We are increasingly using combined heat and power (CHP) plants in
addition to the conventional power grid. The majority of 32 units in total
(as of late 2016) power our network nodes. The CHP plants convert the
energy supplied by gas into electricity and heat. We use the waste heat
produced on site to heat our office buildings, which brings overall
energy efficiency to a level of up to 90 percent. As a comparison, electricity generated by conventional sources and fed through the general
German power grid has an efficiency level of roughly 40 percent. By
using these plants, we have been able to reduce the CO2 emissions
caused by network operation.
We put two new CHP plants in Berlin and one new unit in Frankfurt into
operation in November 2016. Around 350 MWh of electricity and 500
MWh of heat was produced at these locations through the end of the
year, reflecting a reduction in CO2 emissions of 97 metric tons. For
comparison: An average two-person household uses around 3.1 MWh
of electricity each year.
Innovative local energy concept
A local heating pipeline runs from our CHP unit in Berlin to a neighboring school. Waste heat from the unit heats the school and its gymnasiums throughout the year. Not only does this reduce costs, it also helps
reduce CO2 emissions by up to 800 tons a year. The school was able to
get rid of its old gas boiler and pays a reasonable price for the waste
heat produced by the CHP unit. We received the Green Buddy Award
from the City of Berlin in November 2016 for this innovate local energy
concept.
Planned upgrading measures
We are planning to upgrade two other CHP plants in the cities of Ulm
and Rottweil. Absorption chillers will be installed in both units to convert
waste heat into cold air, which will then be used to cool network nodes.
Additional, environmentally friendly dry coolers will also be installed in
order to further reduce water consumption during the cooling process.
Renovation is scheduled for completion in 2017.

9,924 tons of CO2 compensated
Preventing greenhouse gas emissions is one of our top priorities. Investing in certified climate protection projects is one way to compensate for
some of the CO2 emissions that we are unable to avoid generating or
reduce.
Telekom Deutschland compensated for 9,924 metric tons of CO2 in
the 2016 reporting year. These included emissions associated with our
events (participant travel to and from the event, room usage, etc.) and
certain products and services (e.g., conference calls or web conferences). Our Event Policy specifies the ways in which we compensate
for emissions generated by events.
Climate-friendly mobility
We set a new target for climate-friendly mobility in 2016: to reduce the
average CO2 emissions produced by all new car purchases (company
cars and service vehicles) to 95g CO2/km by 2020. This new target is
based on our previous target (110g CO2/km by the end of 2015), which
we successfully achieved.
We pursue a three-pillar strategy to ensure a climate-friendly fleet
management strategy:
 Rightsize: selecting appropriately sized, energy-efficient, lowemissions cars. By introducing our Green Car Policy we have also
created incentives for drivers of company cars to select smaller,
more efficient cars.
 Economize: encouraging a fuel-efficient, low-emissions driving
style with driver training courses
 Substitute: piloting and testing alternative mobility concepts.
Alternative engines
We can further reduce our fleet's carbon footprint by purchasing vehicles with alternative engines and fuel systems. We have been turning to
natural gas and electric vehicles for some time now to help us achieve
this goal. For us, low-emissions natural gas engines are a good step on
the road to climate-friendly mobility in principle. This technology is able
to effectively reduce pollutants and CO2 emissions, particularly if renewable resources such as biogas obtained from bi-products and waste are
used. However, long-range use of natural gas vehicles is still very limited
due to an insufficient number of natural gas filling stations. We find the
limited offer of suitable compact cars available from manufacturers particularly restrictive. Nevertheless we continue to use natural gas vehicles
as both company cars and service vehicles. We are especially planning
to continue to keep tabs on developments in electric mobility and
employ electric cars effectively.
Extensive choice of mobility options
We also encourage our commuting employees to actively protect the
climate by enabling them to buy discount season tickets for local and
regional public transportation. We also rely on other modern forms of
mobility including our shuttle service, which we have been offering at a
variety of locations for ten years, rental bikes for getting around in the
city and rental cars. Our employees benefit from the attractive option
of buying bicycles and e-bikes through a salary sacrificing scheme.

employees can lease a bicycle through their employer for three years.
The monthly payments are subtracted from the employee's gross salary.
The new offer has met with tremendous response right from the off.
roughly 1,300 employees are already taking advantage of the offer.
we provide shuttle service between different locations, e.g., to the
Cologne/bonn airport or the siegburg iCe train station to reduce the
carbon footprint of business trips. roughly 130,000 passengers used
this service in 2016. The offer was expanded in 2016 to include additional routes in order to meet increasing demand. employees can use
an app or visit the intranet to conveniently book a shuttle.

 At our bonn offices, for example, we offer four next-generation electric and plug-in hybrid rental cars. employees can use these cars
for business trips free of charge. Thanks to incentives such as the
budget from our Green Car policy penalty program, we were able to
purchase two new cars in 2016 in addition to the two existing ones.
 we have been participating in an e-mobility funding project
("wirtschaft am strom") in hamburg together with deutsche
Telekom Technischer service since April 2014. Ten electric service
vehicles were employed until october 2016. based on the experience gained in this project, we will be procuring additional electric
service vehicles in 2017.
 we have two electric chauffeured cars in our management fleet
for trips in the Greater Cologne/bonn area and in berlin. Charging
stations for the car were set up on-site.
 A few selected hybrid cars have been available in our company
car segment since summer 2014. we also offer electric cars as
company cars in selected regions.
fosteRing the use of electRic caRs
in may 2014, T-systems netherlands introduced electric cars for lease
drivers in order to help reduce the Co2 emissions of the company’s cars.
Charging stations have now been installed in parking area(s) to facilitate
charging sessions during office hours.
pure electric and hybrid cars help to reduce Co2emissions as shown
in the table below. The reduction in Co2 emissions is good for the
environment and the lower tax rates additionally provide a big advantage for drivers. These two advantages promote the popularity of these
types of car in the netherlands. This is illustrated by the 22.6 % share of
cars designed to reduce Co2 in the company’s fleet at the end of 2016.

our employees can also use bicycles available at more than 30
deutsche Telekom locations to get to their business appointments
within the city.
moRe electRic caRs in use
There are still several hurdles to overcome before electric cars can be
widely employed. limited range, insufficient charging infrastructure
and high procurement costs make the cars unattractive in many usage
scenarios. it is particularly difficult to find suitable service vehicle
models. There is a bright side, however. Thanks to the government
environmental bonus, we were able to somewhat reduce the costs for
electric vehicles in our fleet.
nevertheless, our electric car projects have only been possible because
project partners have supported the set-up of charging stations at our
locations. we participate intensively in selected electric mobility pilot
projects in order to take advantage of the medium-term potential of
electric mobility.

is an important performance indicator for managing our climate protection measures. We are planning to reduce the PUE factor of our fixedline network in Germany to 1.4 by the year 2020. We expect to see this
value continue to fall over the next few years and are confident that we
will reach our goal. This will allow us in part to compensate for increasing energy requirements due to growing volumes of data and new
features.
Researching efficient network technologiesWe successfully wrapped
up the EARNI research project in 2016. The project' goal was to improve
network capacity utilization and energy efficiency by using multipurpose technologies.
Expansion of energy-efficient data center in Biere
Our data center in Biere (near the city of Magdeburg) was put into
operation in 2014 and is one of the world's most efficient data centers.
And because demand for cloud services "made in Germany" is on the
rise, we are currently expanding it to increase the server capacity by
150 percent. The expansion process began in September 2016 and
Biere 2 is scheduled to be up and running by Q2 2018.

 We update our network infrastructure, e.g., by migrating to IP technology, installing highly efficient air conditioning units and systematically removing equipment we no longer need.
 We optimize energy generation and supply with the help of technical
innovation.
 We use more energy-efficient technology for lighting, monitoring
and above all cooling our facilities.
Our internal energy service provider, Power & Air Solutions, which provides energy for our Group companies in Germany, plays a key role in
these activities. Power & Air Solutions' energy management practices
have been ISO 50001 certified since 2013.

Reduced CO2 emissions in data centers in Germany
We also keep our goal of reducing our carbon footprint in mind
when planning and operating our data centers. To achieve this goal,
T-Systems takes a two-step approach. It starts with optimizing energy
consumption at each data center site and then continues with improving
processes throughout the global data center landscape.

Energy efficiency

The key indicator of increased energy efficiency at our data centers is
the PUE factor. We were able to reduce the average PUE factor at the
T-Systems data centers in Germany from 1.85 to 1.54 between 2008
and 2016 (1.63 in 2015) due to ongoing data center consolidation
measures. Applications from less efficient data centers are being
migrated to new, highly efficiency data centers.

Environmentally friendly data centers in Austria
Operating data centers requires a lot of energy and T-Systems Austria is
dedicated to running its data centers in a maximally environmentally
friendly approach. Mitigation makes our data centers in Gmünd, Linz
and Vienna entirely carbon neutral. Mitigation means that resources are
used absorb the same amount of CO2 as that emitted by production of
the necessary energy.
We are also actively engaged in initiativesto reduce energy consumption.We use a “cold/warm technique” in server cabinets to regulate temperature as efficiently as possible and this results in energy savings. In
2016, we achieved total energy reduction of 367,624 kWh. This yields a
year-on-year reduction of 63 percent.
Our fire-extinguishing system has also been designed on environmental
principles. Our data center at the T-Centerin Vienna has 168 fire extinguishersfilled with a mixture of nitrogen, argon and carbon dioxide for
emergencies. The extinguishing agent is harmless to humans, leaves
no residue, and is 100 percent environmentally neutral.
New measures for more efficient networks
We launched the following projects in 2016 to reduce our energy
consumption and improve the energy efficiency of our infrastructure:

The DC11@2018 program for improving processes throughout our
global data center landscape has been up and running since 2013.
The project combines physical data center consolidation (i.e., reducing
data center space and sites) with logical consolidation (i.e., virtualizing
data center infrastructure). The objective of the DC11@2018 program
is to consolidate global data center capacity at FMO (future mode of
operation) data centers using the latest IT technology. We effectively
completed all of the steps necessary in this process in 2016.
The target average PUE factor at all FMO data centers will be 1.4 once
the program has been completed in late 2018 / early 2019. This requires a homogeneous IT landscape combined with optimum capacity
utilization of data center infrastructure, IT hardware and the software
running on the systems. We expect to see further significant reductions
in CO2 emissions as a result. For the year 2020, the latest program plans
indicate accumulated reductions in CO2 by up to 51 percent compared
to 2012.
Our target PUE factor for our highly efficient data center in Biere is 1.3.
By migrating data from outdated data centers to Biere, we were able to
achieve a PUE factor of 1.46 by the end of 2016 and expect to record a
PUE factor of 1.3 in Biere by late 2017.
Progress in our office buildings and data centers
Since 2016, our office building in Vianen has been supplied entirely
with green energy (100 percent). Our offices in Heerlen and The Hague
are currently in a negotiation phase. The other tenants in the building
need to agree to green energy supply.
The main focus for our data centers in 2016 was the significant
decrease of floorspace and energy consumption (13 percent less
compared to 2015). This was achieved through our asset refresh
program, decommissioning and data-center consolidation.

Advancement of Energy Dashboard
The Energy Dashboard is a web-based application that we use for
monitoring the energy consumption of our fixed-network nodes. New
functions were added to the app in 2016, helping us more effectively
analyze stored data. We also further developed the user interface,
making it easier to upload external data.
New intermediate meters help reduce electricity consumption
We installed roughly 1,500 calibrated intermediate meters in our offices
and technology sites during the reporting period. The meters identify
heavy consumption devices and point out additional areas where consumption can be reduced at our facilities.
Pilot test for energy-efficient climate control a success
In Nuremberg we are testing innovative control technology for our server
cooling system, which uses several sensors to record room temperature
directly at the servers. The result is a 15 percent reduction in electricity
consumption since the existing cooling systems can be operated more
effectively. We are planning to continue testing in 2017 with the aim of
being able to estimate reduction potential during live operation.
Completion of research project on energy-efficient
networks
We are always expanding and optimizing our networks so that we can
offer services that are demand-oriented and energy-efficient. Whenever
technically feasible, we are increasingly employing system technology
based on multipurpose hardware. We joined forces with Alcatel-Lucent
and the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute in 2015 to launch the
Energy-Aware Network Infrastructure (EARNI) project. The aim of this
project was to find out whether using new multipurpose systems has a
favorable impact on network energy efficiency.

eneRgy efficiency in buildings
our facility energy management activities focus on the two areas of
heating energy and electricity consumption. we have defined subtargets for each of these areas to help us attain our climate target in
Germany. progress is measured twice a year.
Two approaches help us achieve our sub-targets: we are reducing our
office space as part of hr downsizing measures and are optimizing
space usage by introducing new office concepts. we also identify needs
for reduction in energy consumption by using specific indicators such
as "kilowatt hours per square meter," "energy consumption at midnight"
or "peak loads" to compare similar facilities. power & Air solutions is in
charge of the energy management system, which is iso 50001-certified.
heat and hot water
we use approximately 522 Gwh of heating energy throughout Germany
each year, primarily by using gas and heating oil as well as district heating. That is the same amount of energy needed to provide around
100,000 newly built apartments with heat and hot water. we regularly
assess the need for repairs at our properties and conduct feasibility
analyses to reduce consumption. keeping the available budget in mind,
we focus on the most necessary and particularly cost-efficient measures, including:
 optimizing heating systems
 updating the heating system in line with the German energy saving
ordinance
using
condensing boiler technology to replace old heating systems

and pumps
 recovery of waste heat produced by data centers
 using Chp plants
for the research project, we used an actual use case to calculate energy
requirements and compared the results with conventional technology.
final results show that careful planning and network design enable
improved energy efficiency of multipurpose systems compared to traditional network systems thanks to higher capacity utilization. The system
also permits load-adaptive operation.
multipurpose hardware also makes it possible to incorporate controllers
to control local energy supply systems. This way Chp plants and photovoltaic systems can be used to provide power to the telecommunications network. The network system hardware can also be used to operate the controllers. The eArni project also analyzed a relevant use case.
The research done within project eArni was based on the previous
projects lolA and desi, which examined operating concepts for the
load-adaptive operation of networks.
The project results were presented in 2016 at electronics Goes Green
2016+ in berlin and at the european Conference on optical Communication (eCoC) in düsseldorf. more information can be found here.

our real estate management departments are responsible for measurements, analyses and developing appropriate measures.

our employee workstations, lighting, and building technology, including
pumps, ventilation, cooling and elevators, are responsible for the largest
part of electricity consumption in our buildings. we focus our energy
conservation measures on the following areas:
 using led lighting and motion detectors in underground parking
structures and hallways
using
state-of-the-art pumps and fans

switching
off building technology outside working hours

we conducted comprehensive energy consumption reviews at our sites
in 2014 and 2015 and then implemented reduction measures during
the reporting period based on the results. our ventilation systems, for
example, have been running on more efficient motors since 2016.

TMUS Energy Strategy
T-Mobile’s cross-functional energy team representing retail, corporate
real estate, critical facilities, network engineering, procurement and
sustainability meets several times annually to raise the profile of energy
efficiency across the business. This year’s energy audits resulted in a
43,000 MWh annual reduction.
A formal renewable energy plan was drafted in 2016 establishing
short-term goals and guiding TMUS in its management of these efforts.
The team engaged with leaders in the sustainability field in evaluating
science-based targets and working toward longer-term goals.
T-Mobile also submitted its first Carbon Disclosure report in 2016.
Additionally, we completed an Analytic Platform of the energy intensity
per cell site. The analytic engine was incorporated into the existing
metric platform used by local/regional engineering teams to further
energy efficiency in spite of ever increasing data consumption by
T-Mobile’s customers. Short term projects such as LED lighting and
HVAC retrofits continued in earnest. Energy efficiency was incorporated
into the criteria for new and expansion office and retail spaces within
the TMUS footprint.
The company seeks energy savings
In 2016, T-Systems Mexico continued to reduce energy consumption
by implementing a variety of different measures. One of the measures
involved a change in our phone technology. We also followed up on all
the measures we had already implemented during the previous year.
These involved monitoring the air conditioning system to decrease
power consumption at peak times, installing motion sensors in offices
to give employees an individual air conditioning supply so that it is
always off when no one is in the room, andreplacing fluorescent lamps
with LEDs. The totality of these measures resulted in an energy reduction of 14.38 % in 2016.

Renewable energy

Renewable energy

Renewable energy is key when it comes to reducing greenhouse gas
emissions. In addition to reducing electricity consumption by improving
energy efficiency, improving the energy mix behind electricity production can significantly improve our carbon footprint. That is why renewable energy is one of the four pillars in our new climate strategy. As part
of this strategy we are currently devising concrete renewable energy
targets and strategies. Our national companies in Greece, Hungary and
the Netherlands are already pioneers in this field with 100 percent of
their electricity coming from renewable sources.
New solar power units installed
We are increasingly relying on solar energy to power our technology
sites. In 2014 we decided to equip 600 sites with photovoltaic units over
the next several years. Our internal energy service provider, Power & Air
Solutions, is responsible for installing the units.
In early 2016, we were operating solar power units at a total of 311
switching centers in Germany. These units are expected to reduce our
carbon footprint by 1,510 metric tons of CO2 each year. New units with
up to 150 kWp were added over the course of the reporting period,
which will lead to further reductions in CO2 emissions of 77 metric tons
in 2017.
More green energy at European national companies
We have encouraged our European national companies to work toward
a share of renewable energy in total electricity consumption that is at
least 10 percent above the national energy mix. Indeed, our national
companies further increased their shares of electricity from renewable
energy, coming to a total group-wide average of almost 33 percent by
the end of 2016.
On average our group-wide share of electricity from renewable energies
was 10 percent above national energy mixes*. To this end, our national
companies also use renewable energy certificates (guarantees of origin
img). Despite our efforts, however, we were unable to achieve our target
values at some of our national companies. Other national companies
such as Magyar Telekom, T-Mobile Netherlands and OTE in Greece are
setting a great example and are already using 100 percent renewable
energy to meet their electricity needs.
In calculating the share of renewable energy in the electricity we
consume, we take the country mix as a basis as no data is available
regarding the share of renewable energy in the residual mix. The share
of renewable energy in the residual mix is typically lower than the country mix. For Germany, the EEG surcharge paid is taken into account
when calculating the share of renewable energy.

Sustainable products

Our products and services contribute to sustainable development.
Thanks to our solutions, devices such as set-top boxes can be replaced
by digital solutions, conserving valuable resources and reducing CO2
emissions. That makes sustainable products a key element in our integrated climate strategy.
Our goal is to continue to systematically record and increase the CO2
reduction potential offered by our products. Our cloud solutions are an
excellent example of how our products can help customers considerably reduce CO2 emissions. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
that take advantage of cloud solutions can reduce CO2 emissions by
up to 21 metric tons each year on average. This is because, instead of
being operated on the customer's premises, applications are shifted
to efficient data centers, enabling customers to minimize their infrastructure.

Circular economy

Circular economy

There are a lot of areas where digitization can help conserve valuable
resources and protect the environment. One example is dematerialization. Companies that store their data in the cloud no longer need a hard
drive. Doing away with your hard drive conserves natural resources,
reduces electricity consumption and generates less waste.
The "sharing instead of owning" approach also contributes significantly
to resource conservation. Numerous sharing economy offers such as
car-sharing become practical solutions thanks to digitization. Our goal
is to use our expertise to support and encourage effective sharing
concepts.
In areas where services cannot entirely replace products, the product
life cycle plays a key role in the efficient use of resources. Our rental
model for routers and media receivers, for example, can extend the life
cycle of these devices. Returned devices can then be reused by new
customers after proper servicing. Efficient use of materials is important
even during the product development stage and less waste is generated
as a result.
Conserving resources is part of the solution. We also act responsibly
in how we work with raw materials. It is important to reintroduce raw
materials obtained from outdated products to the production process,
which is why customers can return their outdated devices to us for
proper recycling.

identifying their own measurable targets and then monitor target
achievement. This approach makes it possible to flexibly address the
specific requirements of each country and company without working
with quantitative objectives.
Resource efficiency is also a priority at the workplace. We use recycled
paper and energy-efficient multifunctional printers and encourage
employees to use green office supplies. In order to reduce the amount
of paper used throughout the Group, we ask our employees to have
their salary statements sent to their "De-Mail" account instead of having
a printout sent by post. Around 20 percent of employees have already
canceled delivery by post.
Waste reduction and recycling
Our national companies are responsible for implementing our waste
management strategy according to standardized Group-wide principles.
We have not set a Group target for waste reduction. Instead, our national
companies are developing their own waste strategies or updating their
current strategies on the basis of our International Waste Management
Framework, which we adopted in 2013. They are also setting their own
targets, the reduction of hazardous waste such as lead batteries having
top priority.
Requirements for Group-wide copper cable recycling
Our activities are currently focused on disposing of the copper wires
that have been the main component of telephone lines for decades.
These are being replaced over the course of our fiber-optic roll-out. In
January 2016, we introduced a Group-wide, mandatory policy requiring
copper cable recycling. This policy provides a guideline to our national
companies when it comes to recycling and disposal of used cables.

§§ Use of space

Saving resources and protecting the environment
With our health, safety and environmental management system (HSE)
we have made a commitment to continually improving our performance
in these areas. The system is based on international standards OHSAS
18001 on occupational health and safety and ISO 14001 on environmental management.
We support cell-phone collection campaigns in order to recover valuable resources. For this purpose, we have introduced the Used CellPhone Collection ESGKPI, which compares the number of cell phones
in circulation to the number of collected devices.
We regularly collect Group-wide data on the amount of waste we
produce. Our International Waste Management Framework guarantees
standardized guidelines for all Deutsche Telekom companies. Our
national companies are required to use this framework as a basis for

Testing on recovery of tantalum from electronic
scrap
With our switch-over to IP technology and dismantling analog infrastructure, we will be removing tons of old electronics over the next few
years. We intend to recover precious metals such as gold and tantalum
from the scrap.
The tantalum used to manufacture condensers is extracted from coltan,
and is considered a conflict resource. For this reason we have been
conducting a project together with the bifaUmweltinstitut environment
institute since 2013. The goal is to develop the perfect method for disassembling and recycling tantalum condensers. Different manual and
automated methods for disassembling tantalum condensers were
tested. Based on the results, we opted for an automated method in
2016. The circuit boards will be disassembled using thermal treatment.
The next step will be to introduce the method in live operation.

Sale and reuse of electrical and electronic
equipment
Since 2012, T-Systems Iberia has been handing over redundant
electrical and electronic equipment to Kapema, a company committed
to reselling this type of equipment. Employees at T-Systems are given
top priority for the resale of any equipment. This scheme has greatly
reduced the amount of electrical and electronic waste generated.
During 2016, more than 500 computers were handed over to Kapema
and this reduced overall waste by a total of 2,776 kg.
T-Systems Iberia also continued selling redundant electrical and electronic equipment from its data centers to a supplier who is required to
use any suitable spares for maintaining the company’s equipment. This
supplier is turning redundant equipment into spares for carrying out
repairs and the company is reducing the amount of waste generated
at data centers. Cost savings are therefore being achieved in the fields
of spare parts, storage, and waste management. In 2016, a reduction
of 3,200 kg of electrical and electronic waste was achieved by means
of this reutilization (by the end of the third quarter).
4,000 metric tons of copper cable recycled
In 2016, Deutsche Telekom removed more than 4,000 metric tons of
copper cable from duct systems in Germany alone. The cable is processed in accordance with environmental standards at certified waste
disposal facilities and up to 90 percent of the material was recycled.

Waste Management at T-Mobile Netherlands
T-Mobile Netherlands collects glass, paper, chemical waste, cardboard
and electronic waste separately. Digitalization and more aware product
development has enabled us to decrease our paper and residual waste
by 25 % over the past three years.

Other environmental topics

Other environmental topics

We assume responsibility for creating a low-carbon society – at our
company, at our customers and suppliers and through our social commitment. We focus on those areas where we can make the most impact.
Other environmental topics are addressed as well, such as protecting
biodiversity and responsible water consumption. Although the impact of
our business activities on these areas is very limited, they are integral
elements in our comprehensive environmental management activities.
Protecting biodiversity
Extinction continues to be a global problem. The consequences are
difficult to predict. One major cause of extinction is the fact that more
and more space is being taken up for industry, agriculture and transportation. In 2014, we conducted a study on the size of the space used for
our business activities in Germany in order to effectively steer our efforts
to help protect biodiversity. We also included worldwide upstream value
chains in our analysis. The study's findings confirmed that the amount
of space we use has relatively little impact on the environment. Our
business activities primarily impact biodiversity at the source of our
value chain, with impact at other stages being more limited. The study
identified use of space along the entire value chain at a total of 1,730
square kilometers per year. That is around twice the size of Berlin.
14 percent of this is space characterized by highly above-average biodiversity according to the criteria specified by the non-profit organization, Conservation International.

Different Deutsche Telekom locations in Bonn also launched two
initiatives for reusing office supplies sustainably (spring cleaning and
an exchange platform) as well as giveaways (sale to employees), all of
which were well received by our employees.
Project to reduce plastic waste in oceans
We donated to the "Seekuh" project conducted by One Earth – One
Ocean e.V. in 2016. The Seekuh is the world's first waste collection ship
and will be used in coastal regions and at river deltas. Using a special
net, the ship can fish up to two tons of garbage out of the ocean per trip.
The ship can also conduct water analyses. The Seekuh was presented
on the 35th German Maritime Shipping Day in Kiel in September 2016.
The ship is scheduled to go into production after the testing phase has
been completed.

Our influence on maintaining and improving habitats with high biodiversity is greater in areas close to our facilities. That is why we collaborate
with competent partners on nature conservation efforts near us.
Renaturalizing habitats with high biodiversity
We have been supporting nature conservation projects initiated by the
Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH) organization since 2000 with the proceeds
from our used cell-phone collection activities. In 2016 we supported a
project to protect endangered species on an old bed of the Weiße Elster
river near Bad Köstritz with the objective of recreating habitats for animals and birds such as the kingfisher, oriole, western marsh harrier and
otter. We also supported another nature conservation project - renaturalization of former mining areas in the Lusatia region. You can find more
information at www.handysammelcenter.de.
Initiatives for resource-efficiency at the workplace
We try to use as many green office supplies as possible in order to
improve resource efficiency at the workplace, including paper bearing
recognized environmental labels such as Blue Angel or Nordic Swan.
11 percent of the products contained in our office supplies catalog are
classified as sustainable products. In 2016, 31 percent of the orders
we placed were for green office supplies.

Water consumption
We need water to live and it continues to grow scarcer. The World Health
Organization estimated that more than one billion people worldwide
do not have access to clean water. As a service provider, our water consumption is comparatively small compared to agriculture and the manufacturing industry. We almost exclusively use water within the scope of
our office activities. According to our analyses, water consumption also
plays a minor role along our supply chain. This particularly applies to
the first stages of our supply chain, where we have the most influence.
For that reason, water is not a main focal area in our CR management
activities. Nevertheless, we use our Water Consumption KPI to record
our annual water consumption, which we have been able to consistently
reduce since 2012.

we are building an ip-based network with high transmission bandwidths
so that, in the future, we can offer our customers competitive high-speed
lines, e.g., by migrating our Vdsl network to vectoring technology. in
addition, we are investing heavily to offer greater coverage and even
higher speeds in rural areas as well. we are also using innovative products for this purpose – like our hybrid router, which combines the transmission bandwidths of fixed-network and mobile communications, thus
enabling much higher transmission speeds.

part of our network strategy is to also systematically build out our mobile
networks with 4G/lTe technology to increase transmission rates in all
our national companies. Thanks to investments in our 4G/lTe network,
our customers enjoy better network coverage with fast mobile broadband. in 2016, we supplied 84 percent of the population of Germany
with lTe. This puts us right on schedule to reach our goal of between
75 and 95 percent network coverage by 2018.

net value added
net added value increased slightly year over year from 31.6 billion euros
to 32 billion euros. This year-on-year increase in net added value is primarily the result of increased payments to lenders, which can primarily
be attributed to a reduction in new medium and long-term debt. please
refer to the section on "financial position of deutsche Telekom AG" in
our current annual report for more information on cash flow from financing activities and details on financial liabilities.

in contrast to the statement of income, the net value added only takes
account of real payment flows. That means that deferred tax expenses
and the accrual of provisions do not impact the net value added of the
reporting period. Although these costs are deducted from net profit in
the statement of income, they are not linked to any current payments to
stakeholder groups, as is the case with net value added. outpayments
in this respect are scheduled for the future and will only be accounted
for in net value added in future years.

Revenue development
in 2016 deutsche Telekom generated Group revenue of 73.1 billion
euros, reflecting growth of 3.9 billion euros, a significant increase year
on year. The international share of Group revenue rose by 3.4 percentage points to 66.3 percent. likewise, revenue per employee increased
steadily in 2016 to 331,000 euros, translating into a growth rate of 8.2
percent.

Revenue peR employee
in the year 2016, revenues per employee increased to eur 331,000
groupwide – this represents a gain of 8.2 percent. The majority of this
increase in revenues per employee can be traced back to outside
Germany (+ 11.4 percent). in Germany, revenues per employee
increased from around eur 227,000 to around eur 229,000.

peRsonnel costs and peRsonnel cost Ratio
by personnel costs we mean basic personnel costs (salaries) and
incidental personnel expenses – where applicable including, or
adjusted for, special factors in conjunction with personnel restructuring
measures (individual downsizing instruments). The personnel cost ratio
represents personnel costs as a proportion of revenue. The development of this rate serves as a benchmark for company business. This
performance indicator has fallen continually Group-wide since 2012

from 23.2 to today’s figure of 20.3 percent. The key driver of the Group’s
adjusted personnel cost ratio, which fell by 0.9 percentage points, is the
significant rise in revenue. it more than compensated for the rise in personnel costs in the Group.
The disadvantage of the personnel cost ratio is that it ignores external
personnel costs. Therefore the total workforce costs ratio is more meaningful for the management of personnel costs at deutsche Telekom.

deutsche Telekom measures the energy Consumption esG kpi as the
monetary power efficiency index (mpei) in which developments in
energy consumption (in thousands of mwh) are indicated in relation
to revenues (in billions of euros).
The trend for this kpi was positive in 2016. it decreased slightly year-onyear as expected. despite increasing revenue, energy consumption
decreased throughout the Group in the reporting period. Given the unabated rapid growth in data traffic and ongoing network build-out, this
result was achieved only through further gains in energy efficiency.

162

we anticipate a positive development in our energy Consumption esG
kpi for the years 2017 and 2018, with a declining trend in 2017 and a
further slight decrease in 2018. This development is the result of slight
savings in electricity consumption coupled with a slight increase in revenue. we expect to achieve further reductions in electricity consumption
above all as we migrate our networks in Germany to ip technology and
merge T-systems data centers in various regions. most of these savings
are likely to be counterbalanced by the expansion of T-mobile us and
the accompanying rise in electricity consumption.

decoupling poweR consumption and co2 emissions
deutsche Telekom was able to reduce the emissions generated by its
electricity consumption to zero from 2008 to 2012 by purchasing reCs
certificates (renewable energy Certificate system). however, we feel
that these certificates have not had as positive an impact on the environment as we had hoped. demand for certificates was generally limited.

166

As a result, reCs certificates do not make a noticeable contribution to
encouraging the expansion of renewable energy sources. That is why
we feel it makes more sense both in terms of ecological and economic
aspects to invest in reducing our energy consumption and increasing
our energy efficiency than to purchase reCs certificates.

co2 emissions esg kpi
The Co2 emissions esG kpi indicates the development of absolute as

we had assumed there would be a slight decline in the Co2 emissions
esG kpi for 2016, which stands for a slight improvement. in fact, Co2
emissions sank by 5 percent in the reporting period. This positive trend
is mainly attributable to falling emissions from electricity consumption
and from fuel consumption for our vehicle fleet.
our electricity consumption is the main driver of our Co2 emissions.
we therefore also expect a slight downward trend in our Co2 emissions
esG kpi in the years 2017 and 2018. one of the goals we have set ourselves as part of our integrated climate strategy for the year 2020 is to

169

reduce Co2 emissions throughout the Group (excluding T-mobile us)
to 20 percent below the figure for the base year 2008. The gradual
network changeover to ip will make a substantial contribution here.
for detailed comments on the figures for each national company,

we calculated our Co2 emission values based on different energy and
fuel consumption data. Calculation complied with the Greenhouse Gas
(GhG) protocol and was based on emission factors set forth by the international energy Agency (ieA) and/or the GhG protocol calculation
tools. The total value reflects direct (scope 1) and indirect (scope 2)
emissions. since our Co2 emissions are largely driven by our power

our Co2 emissions are largely driven by our power consumption. The
year-over-year decrease of 5 percent is largely due to the use of energy
certificates (reCs, Goo) at magyar Telekom in hungary, T-mobile
poland and Cosmote in Greece.
As last year, we distinguished between "location-based" and "marketbased" methods in calculating the scope 2 emissions img in the table
below. The "location-based" method is based on emission factors for

171

certain geographic locations; i.e., without taking a company's individual
power mix into consideration. The "market-based" method on the other
hand is based on the emissions actually generated by a power source.
in this method, procuring renewable energy decreases the emission
results. if the power source being used and thus the emission factor
cannot be clearly determined, a residual factor is applied for calculation.
This residual factor is sometimes considerably higher than the regional
power mix factor.

company pension schemes
The increase in fund assets can be attributed to the payments of the
increasing number of plan participants (as was the case in previous
years). because the majority of participants in the 2001 pension plan
are still active, i.e., still paying into their retirement plans, this increase
will remain steady over the next few years.

deutsche Telekom pension funds are also prohibited from purchasing
government securities from governments that are subject to sanctions in
accordance with public international law. our pension providers agreed
to our socially responsible investment strategy in 2013.

investments in the capital market made by deutsche Telekom for company pension schemes and similar obligations in Germany are based
on our sustainability principles. These principles were integrated into
our socially responsible investment strategy for deutsche Telekom
pension providers, which we introduced in 2013, in the form of exclusion criteria. They prohibit investments in companies that produce nbC

we are convinced that putting this strategy into practice will help
improve our financial risk indicators. This strategy will also promote
perception of Telekom as a socially responsible company. it will help us
avoid high-risk, controversial investments and, instead, invest in longterm, stable values that are in line with our principles of sustainability.

Around 20 young people began vocational training or a cooperative
course of study on a part-time basis again in 2016. for many of them
this is the only way to combine training or their first job with the challenges of family life. part-time training is available in all of our training
programs, and means apprentices spend 25 hours per week either in
the company, in school, or in the training center. The highlight: like all
apprentices, part-time apprentices can cut their training to two and a
half years and therefore apply for a job earlier than would have otherwise been possible. A success model all round, since deutsche
Telekom also benefits from the young people's commitment.

our strategy to become the leading telecommunications provider in

risen notably since the turn of the millennium – albeit with fluctuations
in some places. whereas 91.4 percent of company employees were
working in Germany in 1998, the rate has leveled at around 50 percent
since 2009. The figure for 2016 was 48 percent.

pRopoRtion of civil seRvants in gRoup woRkfoRce
The proportion of civil servants employed in the company fell once
again in 2016. The reason for this is that deutsche Telekom has not
recruited any new civil servant staff since the company was privatized.
in addition to civil servants leaving the company when they reach retirement age, others also took advantage of early retirement or moved to
other agencies. This led to a continuous drop in the number of civil servants in our workforce.

personnel service provider Telekom placement services continued to
support the Group in its workforce restructuring efforts in the year 2016.
since its creation, Telekom placement services has opened up new
professional prospects for more than 48,000 employees – increasingly
in the public sector such as, for instance, at bAmf, the federal office for
migration and refugees. 400 civil servants were seconded to bAmf in
the reporting year to provide support for refugee relief work, including
the processing of asylum claims. in fact, deutsche Telekom employees
are now working at more than 50 percent of the bAmf offices throughout Germany.

in addition, in 2016 we were once again able to offer internal employment options to employees in units with surplus staff. in the reporting
year alone, over 1,200 employees had been transferred to new positions
inside the Group by december 31, 2016.

employees have the chance to submit their own ideas and, in doing so,
to actively shape their workplaces. Costs reductions of €168.5 million
in 2016 played a key role in keeping deutsche Telekom competitive. in
addition, workforce commitment enables the Group to position itself
as a more innovative and more competitive enterprise. An incentive
for idea generators: deutsche Telekom awards attractive bonuses for

successful suggestions. one idea submitted in 2016 deserves special
mention: it enabled us to reduce our mast replacement rate from 14 percent to 10 percent, thereby making a significant contribution to conserving resources and reducing cost. deutsche Telekom employees ideas
also earn external accolades: for instance, one employee idea won the
"deutscherideenpreis 2016" award presented by the German institute
for business management (dib).

poRtfolio of intellectual pRopeRty Rights
275 patents were registered during the reporting period. by the end of
2016, we owned around 7,900 intellectual property rights (iprs), fewer
than in the previous year. we take a targeted approach to managing
these iprs in consideration of cost-benefit aspects. we regularly take
stock of our iprs and eliminate those that are no longer relevant.
patents are gaining more and more significance in the telecommunications industry. market players and their areas of activity are changing,
with a knock-on effect on our ipr (intellectual property rights) agenda.
on the one hand, our Group's scope for action must be maintained. on
the other hand and alongside our own research and development activities, we want to pave the way to open innovation through collaboration
projects and partnerships. national and international iprs are vital for

204

these types of activity. we are strongly dedicated to generating our own
property rights. industrial property rights include inventions, patent
applications, patents, utility models and design patents.
Thanks to our intense efforts to develop and structure our ipr portfolio,
the rights we hold are highly valuable and firmly in line with our Group's
strategic objectives. we have put in place a professional patent law
management process to keep our ipr assets safe. Additionally, we are
represented on various standardization bodies in our industry. we manage our iprs on the basis of cost/benefit aspects, filing only selected
applications and de-registering patents systematically.
