ANNEX

At Evonik, we believe that
­r esponsible action and business
success are inseparable. We began early on to entrench environmental and social criteria in
our corporate decisions so that
we could strike out in new and
sustainable directions. Our
­Sustainability Report for 2016
shows how successfully we are
doing that.
The essence of a fiscal year:
We have continued to analyze
the sustainability of our business
operations and increasingly
aligned our innovation-related
activities toward sustainability.
Our sustainability-related activities support the Sustainable
­Development Goals (SDGs) of
the United Nations in many
­a reas. In the future we want to
firmly embed these activities
in our corporate strategy and
our management processes.
Today our contribution toward
reaching the SDGs already
ranges from resource-conserving products such as the
high-performance insulation
material CALOSTAT to our
new combined-cycle power
plant in Marl, which reduces
CO2 emissions by up to
280,000 tons annually.
Projects like these demonstrate
that if you want to change
something, you have to be creative. Unusually creative.
We wish you inspiring reading.

megawatts. Its fuel efficiency rate is approximately
90 percent.
“Together with renewable energies, natural-gas
power plants that work with combined heat and
power technology will play an important role in
the energy mix in the future,” says Andreas Steidle,
who heads Evonik’s energy management team.

In addition to electricity, the production facility in
Marl primarily requires steam. Steidle calculates
that if Evonik wished to produce this steam from
renewable raw materials, it would have to burn
three million tons of wood annually; this corresponds to the lumber produced by half of the forest
area of the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
Combined heat and power technology is therefore
the first choice wherever facilities require electricity and heat all year round. At other locations,

Evonik buys the steam from external suppliers.
For example, in Darmstadt it comes from a waste

Raw materials for the cosmetics industry, lightweight construction materials for the aerospace
sector, and high-grade plastics are some of the
products Evonik manufactures in the Greater
China region, which includes China, Taiwan, and
Hong Kong. Evonik operates ten production facilities in the region, including plants in Shanghai,
­Jilin, and Nanning. About 3,000 employees work
in these facilities, which posted sales of about
€1.3 billion in 2016. “Of course we’re proud of our

Strategy and growth

Business model

Decentralized corporate structure

Strong market positions, a clear culture of
­innovation, sustainable business activities

Evonik is one of the world’s leading specialty chemicals
­companies. We concentrate on attractive growth markets—
especially health, nutrition, and resource efficiency. Our
strengths include the balanced spectrum of our business
activities, end-markets and regions. Around 80 percent of
sales come from market-leading positions, which we are
­systematically expanding.
Our specialty chemicals make an indispensable contri­
bution to the success of our customers’ products in global
competition. Close cooperation with them enables us to build
up a deep knowledge of different businesses and end-markets,
leading to products that are tailored exactly to specific customer
requirements. Technology centers and customer competence
centers throughout the world support this claim.
Research & development are important drivers of profitable
growth. Our strong innovation culture and well-trained and
highly motivated managers and employees form the basis for
this.
A wide range of activities help us to gain and develop talented employees and position Evonik as a preferred employer
in order to retain them.
Our sustainability strategy takes up the growth markets
identified in our corporate strategy and defines areas of
action geared to balanced management of economic, ecological
and social factors. We undertake to comply with internationally
recognized standards, and more far-reaching internal guidelines
and principles of conduct. See “Governance and compliance”,
page 26.
Our sustainability reporting complies with the Global
Reporting Initiative (GRI G4, core). We are a member of the
GRI’s Gold Community.

Our specialty chemicals operations are divided into three
chemical manufacturing segments, which operate close to
their markets and customers and have a high degree of entrepreneurial independence. The Nutrition & Care segment
produces specialty chemicals, principally for use in consumer
goods for daily needs, and in animal nutrition and healthcare
products. The Resource Efficiency segment supplies
high-performance materials for environment-friendly and
energy-efficient system solutions for the automotive, paints,
coatings, adhesives and construction industries and many
other sectors.
The Nutrition & Care and Resource Efficiency segments
operate in attractive markets. They both offer customers
­customized, innovation-driven solutions and the aim is for
them to achieve above-average, profitable growth through
innovations, investments and acquisitions.
The heart of the Performance Materials segment is the
production of polymer materials and intermediates, mainly for
the rubber, plastics and agriculture industries.
The Performance Materials segment is characterized by
processes that make intensive use of energy and raw materials. It therefore concentrates on integrated, cost-optimized
technology platforms, efficient workflows, and economies of
scale. Our strategic goal for this segment is to contribute
earnings to finance the growth of the Evonik Group. In the
future, investments and, where appropriate, alliances will
concentrate on securing and extending our good market
­positions.
In addition, the Services segment offers services for the
chemical segments and external customers at our sites and
supports the chemicals businesses and the management holding
company by providing standardized Group-wide administrative services.

Major events

A good performance in 2016—Acquisitions
strengthen growth segments
Pleasing volume trend

Driven by good demand for our products worldwide, all
­segments registered pleasing volume growth. However, there
was a substantial reduction in selling prices, partly because
lower raw material prices were passed on to customers.
Overall, sales declined 6 percent to € 12,732 million.

Adjusted EBITDA at a good level

Adjusted EBITDA was € 2,165 million, down 12 percent from
the high prior-year figure. The main reasons for this decline
were lower selling prices, while higher volumes and lower
raw material costs had a positive effect. The adjusted EBITDA
margin was good at 17.0 percent (2015: 18.2 percent).

Another very good return on capital employed

Within our value-oriented management approach, our success
is measured principally by ROCE, which was 14.0 percent in
2016 and therefore well above our cost of capital. In our regular review of the cost of capital, this was confirmed as being
unchanged at 10.5 percent before taxes in 2016.

Total value added

Value added is calculated from sales and other revenues less
the cost of materials, depreciation and amortization and
other expenses. Overall, value added declined 5 percent to
€ 4,616 million. The largest share of value added—68 percent
(2015: 65 percent)—went to our employees. 9 percent (2015:
10 percent) was paid to the state in income and other taxes.
A further 5 percent (2015: 5 percent) went on interest payments. Shareholders of Evonik Industries AG received 18 percent of value-added, compared with 20 percent in the previous year.

Evaluation based on groups for which analyzable results were obtained.

On May 6, 2016 Evonik signed an agreement to purchase the
specialty additives business of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.,
Allentown (Pennsylvania, USA) for US$3.8 billion (approximately € 3.5 billion). The acquisition was closed on January 3,
2017 following the approval of the relevant antitrust authorities. The two businesses are an ideal fit: Evonik and the Air
Products specialty additives business target the same customers
in their core markets, but with different and complementary
products. The new business will be integrated into our Nutrition
& Care and Resource Efficiency growth segments.
On December 9, 2016 Evonik signed an agreement to
acquire the global silica business of J. M. Huber Corporation,
Atlanta (Georgia, USA), for US$630 million. In this way, we
aim to strengthen our position in this profitable, low-cyclical
business, especially in North America and Asia. The transaction
is contingent upon the approval of the antitrust authorities
but is expected to be completed in the second half of 2017.
We intend to integrate the business we are acquiring into our
Resource Efficiency growth segment.
You can find further information on fiscal 2016 in our
Annual Report 2016.

Creating extensive value

Our innovations enrich and simplify people’s daily lives in
many different ways. At the same time, we help secure the
basis of life for the growing world population. The chart
“Evonik’s resources and value contributed in 2016“ on the
next page shows how we create value for our customers,
society, the environment and our company.

Materiality analysis
Our materiality analysis

Our sustainability activities are based on our materiality
­analysis. In our materiality analysis in October 2015, we identified and prioritized the key sustainability topics for Evonik.
We surveyed around 500 representatives of stakeholder
groups of relevance for Evonik. They included customers,
suppliers, local residents around our sites, analysts, investors,
and representatives of universities, research institutes, professional associations, political parties, non-governmental
organizations and the media. The stakeholders were selected by
Evonik experts who are in close contact with the respective
stakeholder groups.1 Evonik employees took part in the survey
on the intranet. In a second step, we included selected sustainability experts within the Evonik Group, representatives of relevant corporate functions and representatives of the workforce.

The results of the materiality analysis performed in 2015 are
grouped in six areas of action. To drive forward development
of the reporting process, the allocation of the various topics
to the areas of action and their names were modified in 2016

(see footnotes to chart C04). This sharpens the focus of our
reporting on materiality and enhances the consistency of the
report, which is now systematically structured on the basis of
these six areas of action.

and solutions” has been renamed “value chain and products”.
The following sustainability topics have been allocated to other areas of action: “innovations/technologies” (from “strategy and growth” to “value chain and products”),
“­customer satisfaction” (from “strategy and growth” to “value chain and products”), “sustainability management in the supply chain (standards)” (from “governance and
­compliance” to “value chain and products”).
In view of the way in which we manage sustainability topics, we have separated morals and ethics (in business)/sustainability management in the supply chain (standards), which
were bundled together in the Sustainability Report 2015. Morals and ethics (in business) has been assigned to “governance and compliance”, while sustainability m
­ anagement in
the supply chain (standards) has been assigned to “value chain and products”. As a result, the number of sustainability topics identified has increased from 18 to 19.
Topics 17 (growth markets), 23 (health), and 24 (population growth) have been combined in topic 17 “growth markets “(previously “particular challenges and business options”).

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016

EVONIK INDUSTRIES

In 2016, our activities focused on the operational alignment
of our Corporate Responsibility structures, and on optimizing stakeholder management. This comprised the following
­measures:
•	Systematic identification of the stakeholder groups of
­relevance for Evonik
•	A deeper insight into sustainability issues in dialogue with
stakeholders
•	Systematic involvement of Evonik’s regions and their
diverse contacts to stakeholders in the dialogue on sustainability issues

Stakeholder management

timely identification of future trends and requirements. In
2016, we reviewed and systematically classified the stakeholder groups of relevance for us. In view of their importance, local residents around Evonik’s sites are now classed as
a separate stakeholder group. The stakeholder groups were
then bundled on the basis of issues and further differentiated
according to whether they have a direct or indirect influence
on Evonik.
Dialogue with our stakeholders takes place both at operational level—for example, with customers and suppliers—and
at Group level through associations and advocacy groups.
The format varies depending on the target group and issue.

More intensive dialogue in 2016

G4-18
G4-24
G4-25
G4-26

In 2016, we stepped up our dialogue with stakeholders
in order to take a deeper look at certain sustainability
topics. For this purpose, we specifically contacted
stakeholder groups that were underrepresented in our
materiality analysis in 2015, such as politicians and non-­
governmental organizations. Key stakeholder dialogues
in 2016 included:
•	“Healthy nutrition for a sustainable world”, organized by the Corporate Responsibility division in
collaboration with the Animal Nutrition Business
Line in November 2016. This event was deliberately
dialogue-oriented, with a panel discussion, marketplaces on various topics, and opportunities for
online interaction. In addition, Evonik employees
could follow it in real time via a live blog. The findings from this stakeholder dialogue are used directly
in sustainability activities, especially by the Animal
Nutrition Business Line.
•	
Future food production was also the central focus of a
brainstorming workshop organized by our Corporate
Office in Brussels in fall 2016. Around 25 representatives of EU institutions, national representative
offices, associations and companies were invited to
attend.
•	The Evonik meets Science forum has been tailored
to contact with universities and research institutes
for many years. The focus of the forum held in Bonn
2016 was “New materials for sustainable innovation.”

Advocacy

Evonik plays an active part in many societal debates and is a
partner in opinion-forming processes at regional, national,
European, and international level. Our offices in Berlin and
Brussels are important interfaces for dialogue between representatives of politics and public life. Our employees there
network closely with politicians, trade associations and the
general public, support them in shaping political conditions,
and take up issues in the areas of digitalization, energy and
climate protection, the environment, sustainability, research
& development, and labor market and trade policy.
We took part in consultations, hearings, and discussions. In
addition, we follow legislation in the area of employment and
social policy with particular interest, most recently on issues
such as the minimum wage, temporary staffing, and workplace
regulations.

Since 2016, the Evonik regions with their wide-ranging
contact to stakeholders have been integrated more
closely into the dialogue on sustainability issues. The
focus varies, depending on the cultural specifics of each
region. Overarching topics such as education and training, and activities to strengthen local cohesion and
infrastructure have proven particularly important. Our
goal is to further extend collaboration with the regions
on sustainability.

G4-27

The stakeholder dialogue “Healthy nutrition for a sustainable world”
was held in Berlin in November 2016.

Trustful collaboration

Trustful collaboration between representatives of the management and employees is vital for Evonik’s success. This collaboration takes account of operating conditions and the laws
applicable in the various countries.
In Germany, the fundamental rights of our employees and
their representatives to be consulted are anchored in statutory
regulations such as the Codetermination Act and the legislation
on executive staff councils. There are elected bodies representing our employees at all sites in Germany. Works Councils
represent exempt and non-exempt employees, while executive
staff councils represent our executives. Timely discussion of
all major changes with these bodies is ensured. The time
prior to the implementation of such measures is several
weeks or months, depending on the significance of the
upcoming changes. Where necessary, during this period

G4-26

ANNEX

Strategy and growth

G4-26

written agreements are made on the upcoming measures and
their impact on employees. There are comparable rules on
the type and scope of consultation and negotiation in many
other regions where Evonik has employees.
The information and consultation rights of employees on
cross-border European issues are represented by the Evonik
Europa Forum, which is composed of employee and employer
representatives.
At company level in Germany, employees’ interests are
represented by employee representatives on the Supervisory
Board.
Evonik does not restrict employees’ rights to freedom of
assembly or the right to collective bargaining. These rights
are also ensured in countries where freedom of association is
not protected by the state. This is shown by the fact that,
based on our sites worldwide, there are employee representatives for about 84 percent of our employees.

Sustainability management
Organization of sustainability management

The Executive Board bears overall responsibility for sustainability at Evonik, and direct responsibility is assigned to the
Chief Human Resources Officer, who is also responsible for all
climate-related aspects at Evonik. The Corporate Responsibility (CR) division bundles the strategic framework, in close
collaboration with other central functions and the operational
segments, and coordinates the Group-wide implementation
of sustainability activities.
Responsibility for sustainability management in the
Evonik Group is set out in a corporate policy. The revised
edition came into effect at the start of 2017.
The global strategy for sustainability issues is adopted by
the HR Executive Committee, which comprises the Chief
Human Resources Officer, the human resources officers of
the segments, and the heads of Corporate ESHQ, Corporate
Responsibility, and Human Resources.

Decision-making competence for Group-wide sustainability
projects is delegated to the CR Panel, which is chaired by the
Head of Corporate Responsibility. The members are the strategic CR Partners of the segments, the corporate functions,
and representatives of the workforce. The CR Panel meets at
least twice a year.
While the CR Panel has a strategic focus, the Global Corporate Responsibility Committee concentrates on operational
realization and on supporting the segments and corporate
functions in these topics.
Operational support is provided by project-related
CR Expert Circles. In 2016, CR Expert Circles were set up on
“sustainability labeling of Evonik products,” and “low carbon
technologies.”

Our targets for 2017

•	Ongoing development of methods and indicators for
­sustainable portfolio management
•	
Analysis of sustainability requirements in individual markets
and regions
•	
Harmonization of internal sustainability reporting processes
and monitoring systems

Accolades for our sustainability performance

Evonik was included in the important Dow Jones Sustainability
Index World and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index Europe
for the first time in 2016. We achieved particularly high
scores for all environmentally related criteria.
Evonik is also included in the sustainability-oriented index
families FTSE4Good Global and STOXX® Global ESG Leaders.
Important sustainability rating agencies such as Oekom
Research and Sustainalytics also rank us among the leaders in
the chemical sector.
In addition, our work received two accolades from the
German Sustainability Award 2016—one in the research
­category, and as one of the five most sustainable large corporations in Germany.

HOW WE IMPLEMENT SUSTAINABILITY

SUSTAINABILITY IN 2016

ANNEX

Governance and compliance

Corporate governance
Good and responsible management of the company is an
important element of Evonik’s corporate philosophy. It also
plays a significant role in our sustainability strategy. The principles of corporate governance relate mainly to collaboration
within the Executive Board and Supervisory Board and between
these two boards. They also include the relationship between
Evonik and its shareholders, and other people and organizations
that have a business relationship with the company.
Evonik's Executive Board and Supervisory Board are
explicitly committed to responsible corporate governance and
identify with the goals of the German Corporate Governance
Code. As provided for by the foreword to the Corporate
Governance Code, this includes scope to deviate from its recommendations if this is necessary to reflect enterprise-­
specific requirements. The latest declaration of conformity
with the requirements of the German Corporate Governance
Code has been published on our website.1 According to the
declaration of conformity as of December 2016, there are
only two deviations from the Corporate Governance Code.
These relate to transmission of the Annual Shareholders’
Meeting via modern communication media and the availability
of voting proxies during the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting.
Both exceptions are based mainly on organizational reasons.

Executive Board

The Executive Board of Evonik Industries AG is responsible
for running the company in the company’s interests, taking
into account the interests of the shareholders, employees and
other stakeholders. For details of the Executive Board’s general
responsibility for sustainability topics see “Strategy and growth”,
page 25. The Executive Board discusses sustainability, especially
aspects relating to the environment, safety and society, several
times a year at its meetings.

Percentage of women on the Executive Board
and in management

The Supervisory Board has set a target of at least 20 percent
female members of the Executive Board by June 30, 2017.
The Executive Board satisfies this requirement as it comprises
one woman and four men. For the period from July 1, 2017 to
June 30, 2022, the Supervisory Board has raised the target for
the proportion of women on the Executive Board to 25 percent.

1	

For the period from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2019,
the Executive Board has set a target of 20 percent female
managers at the first two management levels below the Executive Board. So far, the targets were 8.0 percent for the first
management level and 18.8 percent for the second management
level. The key reason for selecting a three-year period instead
of the statutory maximum of five years is that it is easier to
predict the number of staff leaving and the succession constellation, allowing timely scope for fine-tuning where necessary. At the end of December 2016 the proportion of
female managers was 16.7 percent at the first management
level and 19.5 percent at the second management level.

Supervisory Board

The Supervisory Board advises and supervises the Executive
Board. It appoints the members of the Executive Board and
names one member as the Chairman of the Executive Board.
It also decides on the remuneration of the members of the
Executive Board. The Supervisory Board examines the company’s annual financial statements, the Executive Board’s proposal for the distribution of the profit, the consolidated financial
statements for the Group and the combined management
report. The Executive Board is required to obtain the approval
of the Supervisory Board on decisions of fundamental importance, which are defined in a separate list. The Supervisory
Board has the following committees: an Executive Committee,
an Audit Committee, a Finance and Investment Committee, a
Nomination Committee and a Mediation Committee in
accordance with the German Codetermination Act of 1976.2
The Executive Board provides regular, timely and extensive
information for the Supervisory Board on all matters of relevance for the company. Major sustainability aspects are included
in context. On this basis, Evonik’s sustainability activities are
also discussed at meetings of the Supervisory Board. For
example, the Executive Board’s report to the Supervisory
Board meeting in fall 2016 included Evonik's sustainability
strategy.

Composition of the Supervisory Board

In accordance with the provisions of the German Codetermination Act, the Supervisory Board comprises twenty members,
ten representatives of the shareholders and ten representatives
of the workforce. The Supervisory Board regularly reviews
the efficiency of its work and reports on this in the Report of
the Supervisory Board, which is contained in Evonik’s Annual
Report 2016. Annual training sessions are held for members
of the Supervisory Board to ensure they can meet the rising
demands made on the Supervisory Board.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016

EVONIK INDUSTRIES

The German law on equal participation of women and men in
management positions in the private and public sectors came
into force in spring 2015. In compliance with the statutory
requirements and its own targets, Evonik’s Supervisory Board
comprises at least 30 percent women and at least 30 percent
men. At present, the Supervisory Board comprises seven
women and thirteen men. To ensure the independence of
members of the Supervisory Board, Section 5.4.2 of the German
Corporate Governance Code specifies that a Supervisory
Board member should not have any personal or business
­relations with the company, its executive bodies, a controlling
shareholder or an enterprise associated with the latter which
may cause a substantial and not merely temporary conflict of
interests. The Supervisory Board considers all current members
to be independent because, in its view, election as an
employee representative does not conflict with such independence.
Further information on corporate governance at Evonik can
be found in the corporate governance report, which is available
on our website and is also part of the Annual Report 2016.

Performance-oriented remuneration
of senior management

The Supervisory Board is responsible for the contracts of
employment with the members of the Executive Board. It sets
the total remuneration package for each member of the Executive Board, comprising a basic salary, variable short- and
long-term components, pension benefits, the reimbursement
of expenses, insurance, and various other fringe benefits. The
contracts with members of the Executive Board and all executives include remuneration elements based on personal

­ erformance and the overall performance of the Group. As
p
one of our significant sustainability topics, occupational
safety (accident indicator) influences the remuneration of the
Executive Board.
The remuneration report in the Annual Report 2016
­contains further information on the remuneration of the
Executive Board and Supervisory Board.

Opportunities and risks
As a specialty chemicals company with a presence throughout
the world, Evonik is exposed to a range of influences that may
constitute either opportunities or risks. Timely identification
and mitigation of risks is therefore the basis of our extensive
risk and opportunity management.
At Group level, risk management is assigned to the Chief
Financial Officer and is organized on a decentralized basis in
line with Evonik’s organizational structure. The corporate
divisions, segments and service units bear prime responsibility
for risk management. They are responsible for early identification of risks, estimating their implications, introducing suitable preventive and control measures, and the related internal
communication. Their risk officers coordinate the relevant
risk management activities. A central Corporate Risk Officer
coordinates and oversees the processes and systems. Validation of the Group-wide risk situation and verification that
risks have been taken into account appropriately in figures
is undertaken by the Risk Committee, which is comprised
of representatives of the corporate divisions and chaired
by the Chief Financial Officer. The risk management system

is overseen by the Supervisory Board, especially the Audit
Committee.
In line with our mid-term planning, risks are evaluated
over a period of three years. Opportunities and risks are
defined as positive or negative deviations from the plan. We
evaluate risks on the basis of our risk catalogue using the
COSO enterprise management model. The organizational
units conduct an extensive annual risk inventory. This is
­supplemented by quarterly reviews of all opportunities and
risks relating to the present year to spot changes in the
opportunities and risks that have already been identified and
identify new risks and opportunities.
The opportunity and risk report in Evonik’s Annual Report
2016 provides information on risks and opportunities relating
to sustainability such as environmental risks and legal/compliance risks. To supplement this, this section lists the risks and
opportunities associated with sustainability that our experience shows are of particular interest to sustainability analysts
and investors and to sustainability rating agencies. In the
future, we intend to link these more closely with the opportunities and risks that Evonik already identifies through its
established opportunity and risk management process.

Fighting corruption and the Code of Conduct

Human rights

Evonik monitors the observance of human rights along its
value chain. We have established several policies and processes to minimize the associated risks. Our commitment is
underpinned by the Policy Statement on Human Rights adopted
by the Executive Board in summer 2016. See page 36.

Supply chain

As a specialty chemicals company, Evonik needs a broad
spectrum of raw materials. The increasing volatility of procurement entails both opportunities and risks. This applies, in
particular, to renewable raw materials, whose availability and
market price are influenced by climate factors. We align our
procurement strategy and procurement management to
warding off bottlenecks and risks, for example, the purchase
of conflict minerals. Moreover, we expect our suppliers to
share our principles of entrepreneurial responsibility and to
accept their own responsibility towards their employees,
business partners, society and the environment. If our suppliers
violate these principles, Evonik is exposed to reputational and
financial risks. To prevent this, we have introduced our own
Code of Conduct for Suppliers, supplemented by stringent
supplier assessments. See “Value chain and products”, page 49.

All Evonik employees are required to act lawfully in a business
environment. The rules are set out in our new Code of Conduct. Failure to comply with this obligation can result in risks
for the company. Training helps raise employees’ awareness.
One focus is on fighting corruption. To report misconduct in
the Group, employees have access, among other things, to a
worldwide hotline. See page 32.

Sustainability analysis of our business

Employees

We actively manage risks to people and the environment at our
production sites by steadily optimizing occupational and plant
safety and product stewardship. We identify risks at all levels of
the organization and have policies and management systems
to address them. Compliance is monitored regularly by internal
and external audits. We have anchored a common safety culture
throughout the Group. A Global Process Safety Competence
Center operating from locations in Germany, China and the
USA analyzes potential process risks around the world to
guarantee high standards of process safety. For further information see “The environment” and “Safety”.
Further information can be found in the opportunity and
risk report in the Annual Report 2016.

The expertise and commitment of our employees are important
factors in our business success. Losing high performers and
bottlenecks in gaining qualified staff are potential risk factors.
To counter this, our Human Resources division uses a range of
measures to attract and retain employees. Our sustainability
activities are another benefit in the competition for talented
employees because they help raise our profile as an attractive
employer. See “Employees”, page 38.

Our sustainability analysis identifies additional opportunities
and risks in our business. The key elements in the list of criteria
used for this analysis are ecological and societal sustainability
aspects from our materiality analysis. See “Value chain and
products”, page 56.

Compliance

House of Compliance

“Responsible action” is one of our corporate values. Observing
compliance rules strengthens the trust of our business partners,
shareholders and general public in Evonik and its employees.
Therefore, every employee is required to respect our compliance rules. That includes compliance with the applicable laws,
internal regulations and binding voluntary commitments. The
main compliance requirements are set out in our Code of
Conduct.

The compliance areas of specific relevance to Evonik are bundled in a House of Compliance. They include antitrust law,
fighting corruption, the Code of Conduct, foreign trade and
customs law, capital market law, data protection, taxes and
human resources. Corporate Audit has an advisory function.
Environment, safety, health and quality are bundled in a separate corporate division with the same name, which has functional responsibility for these topics (see “The environment”
and “Safety”). Other areas of relevance for compliance are
corporate security and IT security.

Compliance Management System

The role of the House of Compliance is to define minimum
Group-wide standards for the compliance management systems
for these areas and ensure that they are implemented. The
process of forming a consensus, sharing experience and
­coordinating joint activities takes place in the Compliance
Committee, which is composed of the heads of the respective
units, who have independent responsibility for their areas, and
the Head of Corporate Audit. The Compliance Committee is
chaired by the Head of Antitrust Law & Compliance.

Compliance Management System

The compliance organization is headed by the Chief Compliance Officer, who reports to the Executive Board member with
responsibility for compliance. The compliance organization is
responsible for fighting corruption and for all aspects set
forth in the Code of Conduct that are not allocated to any
other corporate division. The Compliance Team, which is
headed at Group level by the Head of Antitrust Law & Compliance focuses principally on strategic issues and is also in

charge of developing and implementing the related concepts
and standards for the Evonik Group. At decentralized level,
the Business Compliance Officers and Regional Compliance
Officers perform the operational compliance functions for
the segments and business lines. The Business Compliance
Officers also provide legal advice for the operational units.
The minimum Group-wide standards for the organizational units’ compliance management systems are set out in
the Compliance Policy. Every organizational unit has specified the minimum standards for its area and established the
tools and processes shown in the next chart on the basis of
defined values and specific targets. The necessary measures are
in place to avoid compliance risks and systematic misconduct,
identify infringement of the rules, apply appropriate sanctions, and correct faulty processes.

Risk analysis

To identify potential risks as early as possible, every unit is
required to perform regular risk analyses. They take up the
relevant rules and voluntary commitments entered into by
Evonik that affect their area of operation and ensure timely
identification and implementation of the relevant changes.
Based on the results of this risk analysis and other findings,
each organizational unit issues binding general standards as
applicable, along with instructions on the precautions to be
taken for business activities where there are special compliance risks.
Risk analyses on fighting corruption and antitrust law were
performed in all operating units in the Evonik Group in 2015
and 2016. On this basis, a risk roadmap was drawn up to fight
corruption in each business line. The results have been discussed individually with the heads of the business lines and
measures to minimize risks have been defined. Some of these
will be specified in more detail in 2017 and will then be
implemented. One focus will be business relations with stateowned companies and dealing with officials. Other topics are
working with sales intermediaries and consultants, and
implementing compliance rules in joint ventures in which
Evonik has a stake.

Training

Training concepts have been developed for all aspects bundled
in the House of Compliance. They also define the type,
­frequency and content of training, and the target groups.
Each organizational unit is responsible for their realization.
We pay special attention to training in the areas of antitrust
law, fighting corruption, and the Code of Conduct. Based on
a uniform Group-wide training concept, the target groups for
these issues are defined by function and hierarchical level and
allocated to the relevant training levels using a risk-based

approach. All administration is handled via our IT-based Future
Zone platform. The relevant employees will be selected automatically via SAP and individually flagged up for the next date.
Training frequency is defined on the basis of risk and is
every two or three years. Alternating face-to-face and online
training is planned for everyone in the target groups. Training
for the other target groups on the issues covered by the Code
of Conduct is exclusively online. Completion of the training
sessions is monitored by the administration system. Groupwide, training is carried out by compliance officers using
­uniform training materials, which are adapted as necessary to
take account of regional factors.

Raising awareness and providing advice

Every organizational unit is responsible for raising employees’
awareness of the importance and scope of the rules on each
compliance issue. That includes advising and supporting them
in questions relating to a particular issue. This allows timely
identification and evaluation of risks. The aim is to ensure that
Evonik’s business decisions and activities meet the applicable
compliance rules. In our training sessions, we inform employees
where they can get advice.

Internal investigations

Internal investigations into alleged compliance violations,
along with possible improvements and sanctions, are based
on uniform principles and standards. They are applicable for
all units that perform internal investigations, not just those in
the House of Compliance.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016

EVONIK INDUSTRIES

In the reporting period, 33 internal investigations were conducted by the compliance units in the House of Compliance
into suspected violations of rules. 21 allegations were received
via internal reporting channels (e. g., email, phone), while
twelve were received via external channels (e. g., email, letter).
The following measures were taken on the basis of these
internal investigations: The employment contracts with four
employees were terminated. Six employees received a warning
or reprimand and one employee was transferred
to a different position. In six cases, further measures were
taken, e. g., training or awareness raising.
No significant fines and no non-monetary penalties were
imposed on Evonik in 2016 for failure to comply with laws or
regulations.1

Whistleblower system

Every employee is required to report possible or actual violations of the Code of Conduct to the responsible department or
Compliance Officer without delay, regardless whether they
relate to the employee or to his/her colleagues. In such cases,
employees can contact the following persons or organizations:
•	Their line manager
• The Chief Compliance Officer or Head of Compliance
• The head of the responsible organizational unit
•	The Legal & Compliance division or the Business or
Regional Compliance Officer by phone or email
• The hotline via an intranet form
The hotline is monitored by the Legal & Compliance division,
which treats all allegations received as absolutely confidential
if requested to do so. External third parties can submit allegations to the Chief Compliance Officer anonymously by letter
or by email. Employees are informed of the whistle­blower
system and contact channels in training sessions.
We investigate all alleged violations and treat all information
with the greatest possible confidentiality. Evonik does not
tolerate any disadvantage to employees who report possible or
actual violations or cooperate in the investigation of such violations—except if the allegations comprise an abuse of the
whistleblower system.

Compliance reporting

In the annual compliance report to the Executive Board, the
Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board (condensed version) and the segment boards, the specialist departments
report on the major risks, events and measures relating to the
compliance management systems for which they are responsible. Each unit reports directly to the regional head and the
other responsible members of the management.

The units notify the Head of Antitrust Law & Compliance or
the Chief Compliance Officer of material risks and violations of
the rules, and of the results of investigations and the measures
derived from them as soon as they become aware of them.

Review of the compliance management system

Every organizational unit must regularly check the appropriateness and effectiveness of its compliance management system.
In addition, regular checks are performed by Corporate
Audit. In 2016 the compliance management system for fighting
corruption and the Code of Conduct was audited in conformance with audit standard 980 of the German Institute of
Auditors (IDW PS 980).

The pillars of the House of Compliance
Antitrust law

Fair competition provides an incentive for innovation and
high-quality products for the benefit of consumers. Evonik
fosters fair competition and complies with antitrust and competition law. All employees are required to abide strictly by
antitrust law and the related internal regulations.
The global Antitrust Law team is led by the Head of Antitrust Law & Compliance, who reports to the Head of the
Legal & Compliance division. It is composed of a corporate
team that advises the operating units on both strategic and
antitrust issues. In addition, the global team includes lawyers
in North America, Latin America, China and Russia who specialize in antitrust law.
The following training sessions on antitrust law were held

HOW WE IMPLEMENT SUSTAINABILITY

SUSTAINABILITY IN 2016

ANNEX

Governance and compliance

Targets

•	Complete the risk analysis, draft a risk roadmap for each
business line, discuss the results with the heads of the
­relevant business lines and define action to minimize
the risks
•	Train Evonik’s lawyers in Germany in the revised rules on
dealing with investigations by authorities
•	Update the training materials for specific target groups,
e. g., sales support staff

Code of conduct and fighting corruption

Evonik is committed to fair competition for the benefit of its
customers, shareholders and other stakeholders. In addition,
we respect the independence of officials. Therefore, we ban
all forms of corruption, including “facilitation payments”. We
deliberately set stricter standards than the law in some countries. Evonik forbids all forms of corruption and has a zero
tolerance principle. Our rules on preventing corruption are
summarized in section 9 of the Code of Conduct, the Master
Gifts and Hospitality Policy, together with regional implementation regulations, and the Policy for the Use of External
Third Parties for Distribution and Dealing with Authorities
(Policy on External Intermediaries). Every employee can
access checklists on the compliance site on the intranet. These
contain the key points of each policy. The corruption-related
risks inherent in donations and sponsorship are explained at
training sessions with the aid of specific examples.
The new Code of Conduct contains extensive rules on conflicts
of interest in the following cases:
• Secondary employment
•	Financial interests in competitors, business partners or
other companies connected to Evonik
•	Business transactions and decisions involving relatives and
other related parties
Unless statutory provisions rule otherwise, employees must
report all incidents to their supervisor and the responsible HR
department, which is required to make a prompt decision on
each case.
Our activities in 2016 focused on completely revising the
Code of Conduct and continuing the risk analysis on fighting
corruption.
The updated Code of Conduct comes into force in spring
2017 on the basis of a resolution of the Executive Board and
is applicable for the Evonik Group worldwide. When implementing the Code of Conduct in the future, we will ensure
that it is effective and enforceable for all employees in all

countries affected. The Code of Conduct sets minimum standards and takes precedence over less stringent national laws.
In the event of conflict, mandatory national laws take precedence.
The Code of Conduct will be available online in 27 languages as soon as it is introduced. It applies to all Evonik
employees, the Executive Board and the governance bodies
of all Evonik companies. They are required to comply with
the rules set forth in the Code of Conduct, to ensure they are
familiar with its content, and to take part in the relevant training.
All managers and supervisors are required to set an example.
They therefore have a special responsibility and must ensure
that their employees observe the rules of this Code of Conduct.

Compliance rules for business partners
Evonik has issued a special code of conduct for suppliers, setting
out binding requirements for these business partners. See
“Value chain and products”, page 49.
Intermediaries, above all sales intermediaries, are subject to
a compliance check before the establishment of the business
relationship and every five years thereafter. Intermediaries
also have to sign a compliance declaration.
Risk-based compliance checks (due diligence) and any
necessary measures are also applied to business partners
involved in acquisitions, joint ventures, corporate venture
projects and major investment projects. These are based on
uniform rules for the Evonik Group.

system operated by an external provider

Foreign trade and customs law

Every employee is required to observe the applicable foreign
trade and customs regulations. The provisions of the corporate
policy on the House of Compliance and the compliance management system, and the rules on compliance with global trade
regulations are designed to ensure compliance with applicable
trade regulations. Our trade compliance organization comprises a special department with Group-wide responsibility,
a special IT system and a Group-wide network of around
70 people, including the trade compliance officers responsible
for the operating units.

Capital market law

As a publicly listed company, we are subject to a large number
of capital market regulations. Compliance with these is supported by our capital markets compliance officer. Evonik has
issued Group-wide operating procedures to ensure capital
market compliance. These provide an overview of the regulations and obligations that have to be observed by Evonik and
its employees. They include, in particular, a ban on insider
trading and unlawful disclosure of insider information, regulations on own-account trading by managers, and the obligation to disclose insider information. The operating procedures
also define standards of behavior for employees and their

accountability in this area. Supported by training, all relevant
employees and governance bodies receive an in-depth insight
into the regulations of the EU Market Abuse Regulation and
the German Securities Trading Act.
In 2016 the focus was on implementing the extensive new
regulations of the EU Market Abuse Regulation, which came
into effect on July 3, 2016. This included, in particular, the
legal requirement to provide information for members of the
Executive Board and Supervisory Board of Evonik on the new
obligations relating to directors’ dealings. In addition, the system
used for the insider list was modified and the capital market
compliance instructions were revised.

Data protection

The organization of data protection and rules on reliable processing of personal data are set out, among other things, in
the Compliance Policy and a separate data protection regulation.
The Corporate Data Protection Officer monitors observance
of these requirements and assists the organizational units in
implementation. In particular, his role is to monitor correct
usage of information processing programs that handle personal data. Increasing global data sharing requires additional
technical and organizational security measures. These are
monitored continuously. Web-based training programs are
mandatory for all employees. Information on the relevant
requirements and responsibilities was made available to
employees on the intranet. A challenge at present is implementing the new European data protection law, which comes into
effect in May 2018, and integrating it into the established
data protection management system.

Taxes

The corporate policy on taxation defines responsibilities for
taxes. Procedural rules and training programs for the Tax
department and, above all, other units raise awareness of this
issue and the need to comply with tax law. In view of the wide
range of national tax regulations, Evonik has issued uniform
internal rules to standardize cross-border measures. These
take precedence over less stringent national tax regulations.

HOW WE IMPLEMENT SUSTAINABILITY

SUSTAINABILITY IN 2016

ANNEX

Governance and compliance

Human resources

Evonik aims to ensure that all employees act in accordance
with the principal labor and social standards and respect
internationally recognized human rights. The goal of our
human resources and social policy is therefore to offer a
working environment that respects the individuality of all
employees and encourages their initiative. We create the
basis for good and trustful collaboration, where performance
and rights are recognized. All employees should have the
opportunity to develop their potential. Therefore, we have
given an undertaking to observe internationally recognized
standards of conduct such as the Guidelines for Multinational
Enterprises issued by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the International Labour
Standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO).
We immediately take counteraction if these are not observed.

Corporate Audit

Corporate Audit supports the Executive Board and subsequent
management levels in the performance of their supervisory
duties and continuous improvement of business processes by
performing independent, objective audits. This is part of
Evonik’s worldwide internal control system (ICS). A targeted,
systematic approach is used to evaluate a range of issues and
processes to check that they are correct, reliable, effective and
cost-efficient, protect assets, and comply with laws and regulations. The role, powers and responsibilities of Corporate
Audit are defined in a corporate policy.
A key focus is auditing the internal control system and the
risk management system. To reduce risks, eliminate shortcomings and weaknesses, and improve processes, relevant
measures are then agreed with the unit audited.

Other compliance-related activities
Corporate security

Protecting our employees, sites, plants and shipments from
criminal acts has top priority for us. Moreover, protecting our
know-how is a key success factor.
The corporate policy on Security and the related regulations form the basis for timely identification of major risks, so
action can be taken to reduce them. Implementation is the
responsibility of the operational units under the strategic
leadership of the Corporate Security division. Where necessary,
the regional security organization can provide support.

Through our presence in growth markets, we operate in
regions and countries where there are heightened security
risks. We conduct specific risk analyses to address these.
Information is provided for employees on business trips
on the security situation at their destination. In addition, we
issue recommendations on conduct and travel guidelines, and
provide support in emergencies.

IT compliance

Binding Group-wide policies and regulations outline the safe
use of information systems. The responsible unit monitors
implementation of the legal and in-house compliance
requirements. In the reporting period, the internal control
system was extended and the related processes were automated. The IT Compliance Index, which measures compliance
with the relevant rules, remained at a good level in 2016,
although the requirements increased.
State-of-the-art information security and data protection
technologies are used throughout the Group. In addition, a
special cybersecurity program was taken into service in 2016.
Optimized systems management constantly improves operational security, especially the security of critical IT systems. In
view of the continuously rising threats, we regularly review our
security measures, and implement and proactively adapt riskbased countermeasures.
Training, including compulsory training in some cases,
and constant information (e.g., via the intranet and internal
social networking platforms) ensure that employees are always
aware of the need for IT compliance.

Voluntary commitments
We are convinced that reliable and responsible management
of the company is the basis for Evonik’s long-term business
success and acceptance by society.
We have therefore given undertakings to comply with
internationally recognized standards, and more far-reaching
internal guidelines and principles of conduct.

The starting point for responsible corporate management at
Evonik is the Code of Conduct, together with the Global
Social Policy and our values for the Environment, Safety,
Health and Quality (ESHQ). In summer 2016 the Executive
Board adopted a Policy Statement on Human Rights. As an
important issue, human rights are included in the updated
Code of Conduct that comes into effect in spring 2017.
In the Global Social Policy, Evonik defines the principle of
social responsibility to its employees. This includes a commitment to comply with internationally recognized standards of
conduct. See page 35.
By joining the UN Global Compact, Evonik gave an undertaking that, within its sphere of influence, it would respect
and promote labor rights and human rights, avoid discrimination, protect people and the environment, and fight against
corruption. As a member of the Global Compact, we also
want to make a contribution to achieving the 17 sustainable
development goals. Our sustainability activities support these
in many areas.
Evonik is committed to the Code of Responsible Conduct
for Business, which includes fair competition, social partnership,
the merit principle and sustainability.

As a signatory to the chemical industry’s Responsible Care®
Global Charter, we also have an obligation to continuously
improve our performance in health protection, environmental
protection, product stewardship and safety. Our ESHQ Values
define protecting people and the environment as core elements
of our actions. They outline Evonik’s understanding of ESHQ.
Together with more detailed guidelines and procedures, they
form Evonik’s ESHQ regulations.
For information on our Code of Conduct for Suppliers
and our activities as a founding member of the chemical
industry’s Together for Sustainability initiative, see “Value
chain and products”, page 50.
Evonik is involved in many competency networks on sustainability, both nationally and internationally. These include
econsense, an association of leading German companies that
operate in the global arena, and Chemie³, the sustainability
initiative of the German chemical industry. In addition, Evonik
is a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable
Development (WBCSD) and is committed to its Vision 2050:
“9 billion people living well, within the limits of the planet.”
We are also committed to the WBCSD’s climate initiative, the
Low Carbon Technology Partnerships Initiative. Evonik regularly reports on its climate performance as part of the Carbon
Disclosure Project (CDP). See “Environment”, page 64.
We are a member of the Global Reporting Initiative’s
Gold Community and our reporting complies with the GRI
G4 Guidelines, core level.

Governance and compliance

Human rights

Donations and sponsorship

We undertake to respect human rights. The basis for this
comprises our Code of Conduct, the Code of Conduct for
Suppliers, our Global Social Policy, and the Policy Statement
on Human Rights adopted in 2016.

The Executive Board defines the aims and conditions for the
Group’s donations and sponsorship. It has delegated coordination and monitoring to the Board Office/Communications
division on the basis of specific policies and guidelines. For
example, individual donations of supra-regional significance
and sponsorship from a threshold of € 100,000 require the
approval of the Executive Board. The segments and regions
can decide on regional and site-specific activities within an
annual budget approved by the Executive Board. In the
Evonik Foundation, the management is responsible for coordinating and supervising donations. The Executive Board of the
Evonik Foundation defines the areas of focus.
In 2016, the Evonik Group was once again involved in
many donations and sponsorship projects (see “Society”,
page 78). These included donations totaling € 220,000 to
political parties in Germany. Of this amount, € 90,000 was
donated to the CDU/CSU, € 90,000 to the SPD, € 20,000 to
Bündnis 90/Die Grünen, and € 20,000 to the FDP.
In 2016, Evonik renewed and refined its entry in the joint
list of lobbyists maintained by the European Commission and
European Parliament.

Discrimination

Our Code of Conduct and Global Social Policy forbid discrimination on the basis of origin, race, religion, age, gender,
sexual orientation or disability. Employees who feel they have
been discriminated against have a right to lodge a complaint.
Contacts for reporting cases of discrimination are available at
all sites.
Information on the complaints procedure is provided in
internal media and in many cases in personal discussions.
Moreover, appropriate measures and activities have been
established in all regions to avoid discrimination. These are
accessible to all employees and reach over 90 percent of our
workforce. Eight cases of discrimination were reported in
2016. They were followed up and action was taken to eliminate
discrimination.

ANNEX

Employees

G4-26

As a specialty chemicals company, Evonik’s goal is profitable
growth worldwide. The excellent level of our employees’
skills and their high motivation are essential for our success in
demanding markets. Consequently, it is important how we
attract, develop and retain our employees. The results of our
materiality analysis confirm the significance of being an
attractive employer, and of our employees’ skills, vocational
training and continuing professional development. Managing
diversity is another focal area of human resources management
at Evonik.
We engage in regular exchange with our stakeholders to
check the internal and external perception of our market
positioning and our global employer brand. Other indicators
are employer rankings and selective surveys of our target
groups. Within Evonik, our most important tool is the global
employee survey, which is held regularly every three years. We
pay especial attention to employee satisfaction, the level of
employee turnover and the average length of service in the
Group.
In view of the rapid pace of change in our markets and
our goal of continuous improvement, skills, vocational training

and continuing professional development are important topics
at Evonik. We specifically prepare our employees for ongoing
changes and new market trends. This is ensured by a wide
range of development programs and individual training for
employees, from new hires to Group executives. The success
of these measures is reflected both in our very good scores
for employee satisfaction, and in the intensive use of our talent
pool to fill internal vacancies. Further indicators are total
spending on training activities and—in Germany—the high
pass rate at the end of vocational training.
For us, diversity means utilizing the entire spectrum of
experience, competencies and viewpoints that our employees
contribute in their daily work. As a reflection of the varied
requirements, attitudes and perspectives found in society and
our markets, diversity is an important driver of our competitiveness and innovative capability.
The project to define a system of key performance indicators to guide and optimize our global HR work was successfully completed in 2016. Tracking of these indicators will start
in 2017.

EVONIK INDUSTRIES

Our human resources strategy
The basic elements of Evonik’s human resources strategy are
positioning the company as an attractive employer, training
and continuing professional development, and corporate
diversity. To drive our continuous development in line with
this, we have defined five areas of action:
• Attract (discovering.together.)
• Develop (progressing.together.)
• Perform (performing.together.)
• Retain (connecting.together.)
• Lead (leading.together.)
Our annual strategy process ensures continuous development
of our HR activities in all of these areas.

HR organization and management
The Executive Committee HR is the highest decision-making
body for HR. It adopts the global HR strategy and takes decisions on the Group-wide HR organization. This committee
comprises the Chief Human Resources Officer of Evonik
Industries AG, the human resources officers of the segments,
and the Head of Corporate Human Resources. The Global
HR Committee supports the Executive Committee HR in
defining the global HR strategy and takes further decisions
on its implementation in the Group. The permanent members
of the Global HR Committee are representatives of the HR
departments in the segments, regions, corporate functions
and service units. Operational support comes from HR
Expert Circles comprising specialists on specific issues.

Attracting employees

Evonik wants to offer its employees an attractive working
environment that encourages ideas, rewards commitment,
and maintains their physical and mental capabilities. We also
incorporate these dimensions into our employer branding in
order to attract the most talented employees and managers to
Evonik.
In 2016, our employer branding activities included:
•	Employee roadshows at our sites to foster identification
and team spirit
•	
A solar-operated fish farm project with the Enactus student
network. Students from RWTH Aachen, the not-forprofit organization Utho Ngathi Südliches Afrika e. V., and
our Animal Nutrition Business Line helped people in Zambia
learn fish farming and use it as an additional source of
income
•	The annual Evonik Student Network Day, which brings us
into contact with relevant universities and student networks
• Internships to enable students to get to know Evonik better
•	The Evonik Perspectives program to maintain contact
with students whose performance is above average
Evonik regularly achieves very good scores in employer rankings. This documents the success of our employer branding
activities. In the ranking by Focus magazine in cooperation
with the kununu employer assessment portal, we once again
secured a position among the top 10 in the Chemical & Pharmaceuticals category in 2016.
Similarly, in a study conducted by DEUTSCHLAND TEST
and Focus Money, Evonik was ranked as the best company in
the German chemical industry for vocational training. In
China, we were included in the list of the most popular
employers published by the Top Employer Institute in both
2015 and 2016.

Vocational training and continuing
professional development

Our personnel development is geared to the early identification
and development of talented employees and those with
potential. We focus on the individual needs of our employees.
In this way, we lay the foundations for our policy of filling
key positions from within the company.

HOW WE IMPLEMENT SUSTAINABILITY

SUSTAINABILITY IN 2016

ANNEX

Employees

A wide range of training and continuing professional development programs are offered at segment, regional and site
level to ensure that our employees are well prepared for their
work and can build on their skills.
In the reporting period, we focused especially on executive development and extending functional competencies.
Overall, we invested around € 500 per employee 1 in continuing professional development in 2016. The average number
of hours of training is 16 hours per employee per year.2 These
indicators cover 94 percent of employees worldwide.
The Evonik Development Landscape, which is based on
our competency model, provides a wide range of personal
and professional development modules covering leadership
and management, function-specific programs, project management, and personal competencies. The offerings are tailored
to our business requirements and are regularly evaluated by
us. The programs also take account of the regional requirements of our employees. The high quality of the content and
methods used around the world is highlighted by the fact that
our activities are perceived as best practice within the industry.
In Singapore, our Asia Pacific Development Landscape
employee development program received a bronze award in
the HR Excellence Awards 2016.
Important objectives for talent development at Evonik are
personal responsibility, diversity, internationality and entrepreneurship. In 2016, we set up a pilot project on Self Orientation. In addition, we are gaining experience of a cross-company
social entrepreneur leadership program.
Our strong commitment to training and continuing professional development is part of our corporate responsibility in
the areas of social and human resources policy. The number
of apprentices and skilled employees hired at the end of their
training is directly aligned to the personnel requirements of
individual units. In this way, we can offer young people clear
future perspectives when they successfully complete their
training and counter the effects of demographic change.
At year-end 2016, around 1,950 young people were being
trained by Evonik. That figure includes roughly 390 who
were being trained on behalf of other companies. Training
comprised more than 40 recognized vocational training
courses and combined vocational training and study programs
at 17 sites. 51 places for young people who are not yet ready
for an apprenticeship were taken up on the “Start in den
Beruf” pre-training program. This program was specifically
extended to offer eleven places to refugees as part of a project

1	For

organized and financed by the Evonik Foundation. In total,
90 pre-training places have been made available in the
2016/2017 project period, including 20 especially for young
refugees and 20 for young people from Germany who had
not found a vocational training place. About 530 new apprentices, including eleven refugees, started their training at
Evonik in 2016. Apprentices accounted for around 8 percent
of our workforce in Germany, which is still well above the
national average. In all, we invested € 69 million in vocational
training of employees.
Our high commitment to vocational training is also
reflected in the examination results. Over 98 percent of our
apprentices passed their examinations, and around 9 percent
received an overall grade of “very good”.

Performance and remuneration

Fair, market- and performance-oriented remuneration is
anchored in our remuneration policies and human resources
tools worldwide. Our overall remuneration concept is accompanied by Group-wide policies on remuneration and fringe
benefits. In this way, we foster our employees’ motivation
and performance, honor their contribution to Evonik’s success, and underpin our attractiveness as an employer.
Remuneration is set on the basis of objective criteria such as
responsibility, competencies and success. Personal attributes,
such as gender, age, etc., play no part in the process. Collective
agreements on remuneration cover 100 percent of our
employees in Germany and around 75 percent of our employees
worldwide. Around 97 percent of our sites and regions have
performance- or profit-oriented incentive systems. These
systems cover around 99 percent of our employees. They also
apply for part-time employees, provided in some regions that
they meet the prescribed minimum working hours. This is
well received by our workforce, as evidenced by the positive
feedback on remuneration and fringe benefits in our
employee survey.
In 2017 our employee share program “Share” will be
offered for the first time to employees in China and Singapore,
as well as to staff in Germany, Belgium and the USA. The
high participation rates are an expression of our participatory
corporate culture. The participation rate of around 38 percent in
2016 was a new record. Around 10,000 employees, including
apprentices, purchased nearly 380,000 shares through the
“Share” program and were allocated around 130,000 bonus
shares through the company’s subsidy program.

2016, for the first time, we were able to compile worldwide data on continuing professional development. In some cases, the data contains both direct and indirect costs,
e. g., travel expenses in connection with training. Some of the calculations are based on estimates.
the first time, the hours calculated exclude apprentices in Germany. Training courses attended by German apprentices (in parallel with in-house vocational training) in 2016
are included in the data on vocational training.

EVONIK INDUSTRIES

Evonik offers voluntary social benefits to employees in all
regions where it has a presence. These are available to more
than 97 percent of our employees. More than 99 percent of
our employees have statutory or company pension insurance
and health insurance. This also applies for part-time employees,
as long as they work the prescribed minimum number of
hours in some regions.

Following establishment of our Diversity Council in 2016,
diversity is now is now firmly anchored in the organization of
Evonik’s top management. The Diversity Council is a high-­
caliber body comprising members of the Executive Board and
executives from various organizational units. It coordinates
the ongoing development of our diversity strategy and the
implementation of effective measures for the entire Group.
The diversity strategy is also the strategic foundation for
Evonik's resolutions on implementing German legislation on
gender quotas.1 It confirms our intention of stepping up tried
and tested measures to support women in managerial positions. The proportion of female managers 2 has already
increased from 20.1 percent in 2014 to 22.0 in 2016. At the
most senior management level below the Executive Board 3,
the proportion of female executives was stable at around
10 percent in this period.

We see diversity as a key to corporate success. Diversity means

and an established corporate culture ensure high employee
retention at Evonik.
Our diversity strategy includes gender networks, WoMen­
toring, and clear diversity targets for executives. For us,
diversity goes beyond focusing on gender and origin. The
diversity of disciplines pursued during training, experience of
several organizational units or functional areas, and mixedage teams are equally important to us. We regularly evaluate
our employee data on the basis of these criteria.

Employees

We work with staffing agencies in Germany to cover shortterm or temporary bottlenecks. All agencies must provide
evidence of a valid operating permit. If agency staff have been
used for a job for more than six months, we examine whether
it is a permanent job for which a permanent employee can be
hired. Alongside appropriate remuneration, we make sure
that agency staff are covered by the high social and safety
standards applicable for our own staff. Since the chemical
industry requires a large number of highly qualified employees,
fewer agency staff are used than in other sectors of manufacturing industry. Evonik had around 670 agency staff as of
December 31, 2016. That was around 3 percent of our total
workforce in Germany.

In the year under review, we provided Group-wide information
on the results of the employee survey conducted in fall 2015.
By taking part in this survey and utilizing the opportunity for
candid feedback, our employees have actively shaped the
­continuous development of Evonik over the years. The
response rate of 83.9 percent (around 27,700 participants)
was the highest in Evonik’s history. The leadership quality
index scored 143 out of a total 200 points, while the commitment index scored 151 out of 200 points. Although these are
good results overall, they also highlight scope for further
selective improvement.
Following evaluation of the survey, priority is being given
to employee development, leadership, fostering innovation
and change, customer focus, and occupational safety. Going
forward, work on the potential for improvement will be coordinated by an international team comprising project coordinators, HR staff at the management holding company, global HR
Services, the segments and the regions. The time until the next
employee survey in 2018 will be used to implement and evaluate the improvements identified. This will be coordinated by
the staff responsible for the relevant areas of action. Here are
two examples:
•	Employees throughout the Group showed a desire for
better career opportunities for specialists. In response to
this, a team of personnel development experts has drafted
sample career paths for various specialist functions.
Implementation is planned for the first half of 2017.
•	
The survey confirmed that candid communication
between managers and employees is especially important to
foster a high level of personal commitment. Many employees indicated that they would like more and better feedback
from their managers. We therefore commissioned a Group-­
wide team of experts to drive forward the existing leader­
ship model in this respect and to come up with appropriate
recommendations and tools.

been implemented by the end of December 2016. 514 of
them are designed to strengthen communication and cooperation, while 341 focus on employee development.
The Executive Board and Executive Committee receive
regular updates on this project.
Maintaining and promoting the health and employability
of employees is an important element in Evonik’s corporate
responsibility. Our well@work program supports this goal. In
2016 this program focused on three aspects: exercise, a healthy
diet, and career and family.
•	We improve knowledge of exercise through talks and the
intranet, and also offer practical opportunities for exercise
in the workplace. In addition, our employees have access
to a wide range of sports activities.

•	In addition to providing information on healthy eating, we
offer our employees a range of healthy options in our
canteens.
•	Combining work and family life has also been part of our
well@work approach for many years. The review of our
performance and the award of the “berufundfamilie”
certificate by the Hertie Foundation in 2016 documents
our commitment to a family-friendly human resources
policy aligned to different phases of life. Core elements of
this policy are support in caring for children and close
­relatives, and flexible worktime models.
Worldwide, more than 94 percent of our workforce can seek
advice on workplace-related, health, personal or family
­problems from social and employee counseling centers.
Around 93 percent of our employees around the world
have access to initiatives to help them combine working with
family life. Examples in Germany are the provision of a large
number of childcare places, vacation programs for more than
800 children, and extensive support on issues related to
­caring for elderly and sick relatives.
In Germany, there were 621 employees on parental leave
in 2016. Nearly one third of them were already on parental
leave at the turn of 2015/2016. The proportion of male
employees on parental leave was 41 percent. In 2016 they
took an average of 1.6 months parental leave, while female
employees took an average of 6.9 months. Apart from a few
exceptions, all employees who returned to work after parental
leave in 2015 were still working for us a year later.
The regular, contractually defined working hours for
approximately 78 percent of our employees are based on collective agreements. We are not aware of any fines imposed
on the company in 2016 for exceeding statutory working
hours. We limit employees' regular working hours to 48 hours
a week unless shorter working hours are applicable. That also
applies when integrating new entities such as Evonik Catalysts
Pvt. Ltd. in India, which was acquired in mid-2015. About one
in ten employees at this company had not yet been transitioned to this aspect of our Global Social Policy at year-end
2016. The transition process will be completed in the course
of 2017. More than 83 percent of our employees benefit from
annual vacation rules that exceed the statutory provisions in
their country. Since there are no statutory rulings in the USA
and the United Arab Emirates, the situation there is based on
customary regional practice.

Leadership

Evonik strives for a uniform Group-wide understanding of
leadership centering on a trustful relationship between
employees and managers. That includes:
•	A clearly defined common understanding of values that is
implemented through uniform processes and binding
standards
•	An institutionalized dialogue on leadership issues and
goals across all levels
•	Employee objectives that are derived from the overriding
corporate objectives and broken down to each employee’s
individual working environment
A global IT platform assists us in implementing our common
understanding of leadership in our day-to-day work. The
corresponding technology was installed in 2016 for around
11,000 employees with a view to further digitization of HR.
Employees and their managers now have access to a flexible
and transparent tool to agree, fine-tune and evaluate objectives.

The system can also be used for the annual employee development reviews, where employees and their line managers
discuss individual goals, potential and development. In the
reporting period, more than 5,000 employees and managers
in China and North America used this system for development
reviews. Other countries are to be rolled in during 2017.
Committed leaders are essential for value-oriented
­management of the company. In 2016 a further 25 corporate
talents therefore made a contribution to a not-for-profit
housing construction project in Vietnam in collaboration with
Habitat for Humanity. Habitat for Humanity is an international charity that uses donations to build housing for families
and other needy persons around the world. In addition, as
part of our talent development activities, around 30 corporate
talents discussed topics such as ethics, values and morality
with representatives of the protestant and catholic churches.
This program was also piloted with an international group of
about 15 participants from around the world.

Targets

•	Establish a learning strategy for the ongoing development
of various employee groups
•	Roll out our updated employer branding campaign (internally and externally)
• Conduct a pulse check on employee satisfaction

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016

EVONIK INDUSTRIES

Progressive climate change, feeding the growing world population, and using limited resources responsibly are some of
the global challenges addressed by the United Nations’
­sustainable development goals. Our products and solutions
provide important answers to future-oriented questions like
these.
All Evonik’s business processes are based on the principle
of responsible management. Our approach to sustainability
therefore includes the entire value chain. That means: In
addition to our own production and business processes and
the products we market (gate to gate), we always consider the
supply chain for our raw materials, goods and services
(upstream) and the product benefits for our direct customers
and their applications in their end-markets (downstream).
We have observed growing demand from customers for
products for energy- and resource-efficient applications. In
response to this interest, we provide innovative solutions that
utilize our expertise as a world-leading specialty chemicals
company. Our special strength is working in close partnership
with our customers. That gives us a good strategic basis so we
can ensure timely identification of promising developments in
our markets and gain access to new growth areas.
Evonik’s product portfolio ranges from high-quality intermediates to complex formulations and system solutions. Our
markets cover a balanced and diverse spectrum, including
pharmaceuticals, consumer and care products, food and
­animal feed, paints and coatings, the automotive industry,
mechanical engineering, and construction. None of the end
markets that we supply accounts for more than 20 percent of
our sales.

Evonik uses a wide range of raw materials in the production of
its products. Along with technical goods and services, they are
sourced from a variety of suppliers. We have central positions
in important value chains—because we process substances,
and provide functional specialty chemical products and innovative system solutions based on them.
The global focus of our business is evident from the fact
that 81 percent of our sales are generated outside Germany. We
have production facilities in 25 countries on five continents
and are therefore close to our markets and our customers.
Our activities along the value chain are split into six areas
of action, which are derived from our materiality analysis.
“Governance and compliance” covers the entire value chain.
Focal areas are sustainability management in the supply chain,
efficient use of scarce resources/materials, innovations/­
technologies, customer satisfaction, more sustainable products,
and products and solutions/life cycle considerations.

Upstream: supply chain and raw materials
Evonik has a significant influence on society and the environment through its procurement volume. We are aware of this
responsibility. By selecting suppliers carefully, we do not simply
secure and increase their sustainability standards, we also
enhance the quality of the entire value chain. We therefore
focus on validation and evaluation of suppliers. In addition,
we specifically monitor certain raw materials. These include
renewable raw materials, and raw materials where there is a
potential supply risk or reputational risk, for example, conflict
minerals.

SUSTAINABILITY IN 2016

ANNEX

Value chain and products

Procurement and sourcing

Our goal is an efficient procurement organization to guarantee
long-term reliability of supply for the production of Evonik
products and, at the same time, to secure competitive advantages for our operating businesses.
Procurement is organized globally at Evonik and comprises
direct procurement (raw materials, logistics and packaging)
and indirect procurement (general and technical goods and
services). Both are subdivided into strategic and operational
procurement activities. Global procurement is managed from
Germany, with the support of regional units in Asia and in
North and South America.
Alongside economic requirements, our procurement
strategy takes account of sustainability aspects such as health,
quality, safety, social factors and environmental protection. In
addition, we are a member of the UN Global Compact, which
imposes binding principles.
Validation and evaluation of our suppliers is an integral
part of sustainable supply chain management at Evonik. We
therefore work systematically both to extend strategic relationships with suppliers and to validate new suppliers. Validation
is the first step in every new supply relationship. It comprises
economic and quality-related requirements as well as environmental, social and corporate governance aspects. We expect
our suppliers to share our principles and to act correctly in all
respects, which means accepting the responsibility towards
their employees, business partners, society and the environment.
These requirements are documented in our Code of Conduct for Suppliers, which is based on our corporate values,
the principles of the UN Global Compact, the International
Labour Standards issued by the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the topics addressed by the Responsible
Care® initiative.
Tools used to evaluate suppliers include the system developed by Together for Sustainability (TfS), an initiative established by the chemical industry to foster sustainability in the
supply chain (see page 50). Here, we pay special attention to
our strategic suppliers and suppliers of strategic raw materials.

1

Our goal is to drive forward transparency and sustainability
along the supply chain and bring about further improvements.
If suppliers have particularly serious shortcomings and no
improvement can be identified, we reserve the right to end
our collaboration with them.
As part of our strategic supplier management, we have
set the following targets, which are applicable throughout
the Evonik Group:
•	Conduct at least 20 supplier sustainability audits under
the shared audit principle of the Together for Sustainability
initiative.
•	Continue the analysis of suppliers of critical raw materials
through TfS self-assessments.
•	Evaluate the sustainability performance of 90 percent of
suppliers of critical raw materials by 2020 (status at yearend 2016: > 70 percent).

Validation and evaluation of suppliers

Suppliers are evaluated using a method that identifies and
quantifies risk factors. The aim is to safeguard the supply of
raw materials and technical goods to Evonik and gain access
to new procurement markets and suppliers.
In 2016 we extended our validation process for new suppliers. Alongside quality, environmental protection, safety,
health and energy management, the routine assessment of all
potential suppliers now also includes antitrust law and fighting
corruption, labor and social standards, human rights, conflict
minerals, and responsibility within the supply chain. In all,
around 1,000 new suppliers of raw materials, technical goods
and services were evaluated using these c­ riteria.
The principles are also used to evaluate existing suppliers.
Strategic suppliers are checked regularly, and improvement
measures are adopted, depending on the outcome of the
assessment. Eleven suppliers were dropped in 2016. In one
case, we were able to reactivate the supply relationship
­following successful improvements.
To minimize the risk to Evonik, evidence and self-assessments on compliance with the relevant German legislation
(MiLOG, AEntG, SGB and HwO) were obtained from more
than 1,000 suppliers and evaluated.1

EVONIK INDUSTRIES

Together for Sustainability
Harmonization of global standards in the supply chain creates
transparency and makes it easier for both suppliers and customers to assess and evaluate sustainability performance. The
chemical industry set up the Together for Sustainability (TfS)
initiative for this purpose in 2011. Evonik is one of six founding members. The aim of TfS is the joint development and
implementation of a global assessment and audit program for
responsible procurement of goods and services. In this context,
TfS helps make environmental and social standards measurable
and implement specific improvements. The initiative had
19 members at the end of 2016. The member companies have
already initiated more than 720 audits and 6,300 assessments
worldwide.
In 2016, we evaluated over 70 percent of suppliers of
­critical raw materials using sustainability criteria. These criteria
include country risks, the supply situation and market availability. In addition, we reviewed the sustainability performance
of other significant suppliers.
A particular focus for us in 2016 was the process for following up on audits and assessments. Corrective measures
were initiated with 46 suppliers, where major or critical deviations were identified during audits. In 68 cases, supplier
assessments showed that insufficient attention had been
paid to sustainability aspects. Here too, corrective action was
initiated.
In addition, we initiated reassessments and re-audits of
suppliers initially audited or assessed in 2012 and 2013. These
covered 38 assessment candidates and twelve audit candidates.
In 2016 we audited sustainability standards at 29 supplier
sites and arranged for 145 sustainability assessments to be
conducted by an external service provider.
Another TfS conference was held in 2016. The venue this
time was India. With 500 participants, the turnout was even
higher than at the previous conferences in China and Brazil.
A range of talks showed the participants the enormous
importance of sustainable supply chains. The focus on sustainability aspects in India is increasing with the region's
growing importance for the global chemical industry.

In October 2016, the Chinese Petroleum and Chemical Industry Federation (CPCIF) and TfS signed an agreement on closer
cooperation. CPCIF gave an undertaking that it would
strengthen the industry in China and step up international
exchange. The aim of the agreement is to extend joint activities
in the area of sustainability. The agreement includes organizing
appropriate seminars and, above all, encouraging sustainability
in the supply chain. In addition, the aim is to acquire Chinese
companies as members of TfS. The responsible departments at
both organizations will hold regular talks on possible additional activities in the future.
As a member of the initiative, Evonik is also subject to TfS
assessments. At the start of 2016, we received a gold rating
for the third time in succession, ranking us among the top
2 percent of the companies assessed.
To further increase the procurement-specific and general
competencies of our employees, we continued our Shaping
Procurement and Developing Excellence (SPADE) vocational
training and continuing professional development program.
This also helps to promote international and interdisciplinary
sharing of experience. The training modules build on each
other and are supplemented by units that examine specific
aspects in greater depth. A new modular learning catalog has
been developed. It contains around 20 relevant modules,
which can be presented as webinars or face-to-face training
sessions. This supplements the SPADE Advanced training
module. In the reporting period, around 69 percent of procurement staff took part in these and other training programs
that include sustainability issues.

Procurement in 2016

In 2016 we sourced raw materials and supplies, technical
goods, services, energy and other operating supplies with a
total value of around € 7.6 billion (2015: € 8.3 billion) from
around 31,000 suppliers. Local sourcing accounted for around
77 percent of this amount (2015: 75 percent). We define local
sourcing as deliberate procurement from sources which are
geographically close to our production site. Raw materials
and supplies make up 59.3 percent of procurement volume
(2015: 59.0 percent). Spending on petrochemical feedstocks
was around € 3 billion and accounted for 65 percent of our
raw material base.

HOW WE IMPLEMENT SUSTAINABILITY

SUSTAINABILITY IN 2016

Value chain and products

Raw materials
Conflict minerals
In view of its very broad product portfolio, Evonik procures a
wide range of different raw materials. We have implemented
strategic procurement concepts and management systems for
“critical raw materials”, whose availability is vital for our production processes.
The Dodd-Frank Act requires companies listed on the US
stock market to disclose whether their products contain
potential conflict minerals. These are mineral raw materials
from the Democratic Republic of Congo and its neighboring
countries. Evonik is not listed on US stock exchanges and
therefore has no legal obligation to comply with the reporting requirements of the US stock market regulator. At the
same time, as a responsible company, Evonik meets its duty
of care with regard to conflict minerals in the supply chain
and checks the origin of such substances. Moreover, since the
start of 2016 we have required new suppliers to provide evidence of origin in the pre-qualification process. In our checks
up to year-end 2016 we did not identify any use of conflict
minerals in Evonik products.

Gate to gate: production and processes
Many of our products are based on the use of advanced processes and technologies, which we are continuously improving.
At many of our sites, we have backwardly integrated production complexes where key precursors are produced in adjacent
production facilities. The benefit for our customers is the
extremely high reliability of supply. Our world-scale facilities
are also a high entry barrier for potential competitors.

Efficient production facilities and a well-stocked innovation
pipeline are crucial elements in Evonik’s business model.
Continuous improvements in both areas are therefore a matter
of course to us. In many cases, we develop and use in-house
production processes that have a technological edge in order to
ensure production is both resource-efficient and profitable.
Our largest production sites—Marl, Wesseling and Rhein­
felden (Germany), Antwerp (Belgium), Mobile (Alabama,
USA), Shanghai (China) and Singapore—have integrated
technology platforms used by various units. This results in
valuable economies of scale and maximizes the use of material
flows because by-products from one production line can be
used as starting products on others.
Continuous process optimization has always been very
important for Evonik. The associated expertise is provided,
first and foremost, by our Process Technology unit and the
Simplification, Excellence, Empowerment and Cooperation
(SEEC) team. SEEC brings together process and technology
experts from various organizational units with a wide range of
knowledge. It is supported by the company improvements and
suggestion program. For the targets for resource efficiency in
production, see “The environment”, page 57.
Research and development is another important driver of
our profitable growth. Innovations strengthen our leading
market and technology positions and give us access to new,
high-growth businesses. Evonik’s innovative capability is evidenced, for example, by the number of patents. See page 53.

Production inputs and output

Production inputs increased from 8.66 million metric tons to

EVONIK INDUSTRIES

Renewable raw materials
Using renewable resources remains very important to Evonik.
In 2016, they accounted for around 9 percent of production
inputs (2015: around 9 percent). The vast majority comprised
dextrose and saccharose, which were used as substrates in
fermentative production of amino acids. Natural fats and oils
and their derivatives are used to produce precursors for the
cosmetics, detergents and cleaning agents industry, and in
technical processing aids. We endeavor to raise the proportion
of renewable raw materials wherever this makes sense from
a technical, economic, ecological and social perspective.
Palm oil
A small proportion of palm oil and palm oil derivatives are
used in our production processes. Evonik has been a member
of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) since
2010 and publishes its targets for palm oil in the RSPO’s
annual progress report. The RSPO was set up to place global
production of palm oil on a sustainable long-term basis.
Evonik supports this process.
Our Personal Care business has now had all nine sites that
use palm oil derivatives certified by an external auditor. This
shows that our organizational structure at these sites meets
the RSPO requirements. Our Personal Care business therefore achieved the target set for 2016, and has created the
basis for a continuous transition to certified raw materials.
In addition, more than 50 personal and household care
products have been switched to RSPO-certified palm oil
derivatives. In collaboration with our customers and suppliers,
we aim to extend our portfolio of certified products further
in 2017.

Research & development

High innovative capability is essential for Evonik. It is an
important driver of profitable growth and strengthens our
leading market and technology positions. As a company, we are
proud of our culture of innovation, which is firmly established
in our innovation management and management development.
The vision underlying our research & development (R&D) is
“Evonik is one of the most innovative companies in the world.”
In the light of this, in 2016 we took an important step to pave
the way for the future. We restructured our innovation portfolio and now focus on six growth fields with above-average
growth rates:
•	
Sustainable Nutrition: Establishing additional products
and services for sustainable nutrition of livestock and people
•	
Healthcare Solutions: Developing new materials for
implants, as components of cell culture media, and for
custom-tailored, innovative drug formulations
•	
Advanced Food Ingredients: Creating a portfolio of
health-enhancing substances and nutritional supplements
as a contribution to healthy nutrition
•	
Membranes: Extending SEPURAN® technology for efficient gas separation to further applications
•	
Cosmetic Solutions: Developing further products based
on natural sources for cosmetics and sensorially optimized
formulations for skin care products
•	
Smart Materials: Developing products and technologies
for additive manufacturing, electronic applications, and
thermal insulation systems.

HOW WE IMPLEMENT SUSTAINABILITY

ANNEX

Value chain and products

We have set ambitious targets for our R&D:
•	We aim to generate more than €1 billion in additional
sales in the six growth fields by 2025.
•	Sales generated with products and applications that are
less the five years old should increase from 10 percent
(2016) to 16 percent in the mid term.
Evonik has an extensive patent strategy to protect new
­products and processes.
Around 90 percent of our R&D is performed by our segments. That includes, first and foremost, research geared specifically to their core technologies and markets, and the
development of new business. The Nutrition & Care and
Resource Efficiency growth segments receive an above-average
share of our R&D funds. By contrast, the Performance Materials
segment focuses on optimizing processes and products.
Our strategic innovation unit, Creavis, concentrates on
mid- and long-term projects that support Evonik’s growth
and sustainability strategy and open up new business options.
On the basis of the identified potential in the strategic
growth fields, Creavis sets up project houses, which spend
three years exploring an area of innovation in conjunction
with the segments and external experts.
For example, the Medical Devices Project House is currently
working on new solutions for medical technology and
extending Evonik’s competence in biomaterials and polymers.
In particular, it is addressing applications in implantology. The
Composites Project House ended in spring 2016 and was
integrated into the Resource Efficiency and Performance
Materials segments. Notable successes were materials and
processes that enable automated production of composites at
competitive prices.

Facts and figures 2016
The value and quality of our patent portfolio have increased
steadily in recent years. In 2016, patent-driven sales accounted
for 56 percent of total sales in the Evonik Group.

Our innovation pipeline is well stocked. It comprises a balanced
mixture of well over 500 projects. In 2016 we fine-tuned the
nature and scope of our innovation projects as part of the
realignment of our innovation portfolio. Since then, greater
priority has been given to larger mid- and long-term projects.
In the reporting period, some of our projects were again
funded by the European Union or the Federal Republic of
Germany. In all, we received around € 2.9 million for this.
In view of the strategic importance of R&D, we have
raised R&D expenses by an average of 4 percent since 2011.
In 2016, R&D expenses totaled € 438 million, a rise of 1 percent
year-on-year. The ratio of R&D expenses to sales was 3.4 percent (2015: 3.2 percent). In view of our growth strategy, we
aim to retain this ambitious level and to invest more than
€ 4 billion in R&D up to 2025. We are therefore sticking to
the target we set in 2015.
In the past three years, Evonik has also spent € 158 million
on the construction of laboratory capacity and pilot plants.
Examples are the new competence center for silanes at the
Rheinfelden site in Germany, and the composites pilot plant
for the Crosslinkers Business Line in Marl (Germany).

Open innovation as a success factor
Evonik’s global R&D network comprises 35 locations with
approximately 2,700 R&D employees. Key success factors for
our R&D are close collaboration with customers and
extended networking with external partners. The Industry
Cross Innovation department brokers contact to new markets
of potential interest for Evonik. In this way, new, market-­
driven projects are identified in collaboration with sectors
with which we do not yet have direct customer relationships.
New alliances were established with a range of companies in
2016. These show how we can use cross-sector collaboration
and bundle competences along the value chain to tap into
marketable solutions with and for our partners.
In addition, our corporate venture capital activities give us
an insight into innovative technologies and emerging business activities. We invest in specialized technology funds and
startups that are a good fit with our growth strategy. In this
way, we speed up the pace of innovation. One example from
2016 is the US start-up Nanotech Industrial Solutions, Inc.,
which provides a new technology platform for lubricant additives. This is an attractive complement to our competencies as
the technology leader in oil additives.
Focus on sustainability
Sustainability is an important element in our corporate culture and our innovation culture. As a specialty chemicals
company, we want to provide solutions that balance social,
ecological and economic aspects—in collaboration with our
customers. Our market-oriented R&D plays a key role in
improving the ecological footprint of our customers still further and differentiating us from our global competitors. We
are therefore increasingly focusing our innovation pipeline on
products for applications that make efficient and environmentally compatible use of resources. That is demonstrated,
for example, by our internal Innovation Award, which honors

outstanding research achievements. All nominations in the
category “New Products/System Solutions” in 2016 were for
products with particularly sustainable applications. These
were:
•	An environment- and skin-tolerant biosurfactant that is
produced entirely from renewable regional resources
(REWOFERM®)
•	
An additive that is used in combination with silica and silanes
to reduce the rolling resistance of tires. This brings a further
significant reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions (POLYVEST® ST)
•	A synthetic base fluid for wind turbine gears, which
increases their energy efficiency and service life
(­VISCOBASE® 11-522)
Our innovation unit, Creavis, manages its portfolio using the
Idea-to-People-Planet-Profit (I2P3) process. Each strategic
research project is assessed on the basis of environmental
influences (planet) and societal aspects (people) as well as
economic criteria (profit). I2P3 was developed jointly by our
strategic research, the Life Cycle Management group, and the
Innovation Excellence group, with external support from the
renowned Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and
Energy.
Evonik also received the prestigious German Sustainability Award in 2016 for its innovative capability. The award in
the research category went to a Creavis project: A new production process for thermoelectric generators (TEGs) to utilize
exhaust heat, which was developed in collaboration with
Process Technology. This reduces the production cost of
TEGs by up to 70 percent. TEGs can help improve fuel economy
in vehicles by enhancing the efficiency of alternators. In the
steel, aluminum and glass industries, TEGs can harvest heat
radiated by semi-finished products and exhaust gas systems.

Downstream: customers and
end-customer applications
Evonik’s customers are mainly industrial companies that use
our intermediates in their own products and solutions. Our
operating segments make a key contribution to enhancing the
product benefits that differentiate our customers in the market and make them successful in global competition.

Our products and markets

Working closely with our customers, we extend our solid
knowledge of their requirements, markets and trends. That
helps us tailor products to their specific needs. Regional
­specifics are taken into account through our numerous technology and competence centers.

Value chain and products

Alongside products and solutions, many of our businesses
sell services along the entire value chain. A good example is
our Animal Nutrition Business Line, with its broad range of
­specialist services.
At Evonik, the operating businesses are responsible for
customer relationship management, which is aligned to market
and customer needs on a decentralized basis by our segments
and business lines. Alongside competence centers and
­customer-focused development centers, all employees play a
part in this through their high expertise and professionalism.
Overall, we have observed that customers increasingly
value products and solutions that make a contribution to
­sustainable development. That applies, for example, to the
desire for improved resource efficiency.
To make the sustainability performance of our products
transparent, we have intensified and driven forward the
methodology used for the related analyses. The process has
been performed repeatedly in all business lines since 2013.
For a more detailed overview of our progress in 2016, see
inside front cover.

Evonik’s resource-efficient products

Evonik helps its customers meet the rising sustainability
requirements on the world’s markets. In particular, we use
the Evonik Carbon Footprint to assess products that are
resource- and energy-efficient in the application phase.
Examples are amino acids for animal nutrition, silica-silane
technology for “green” tires, additives for hydraulic fluids,
and functional silanes to protect building facades. For further
information, see the Evonik Carbon Footprint brochure on
our website at www.evonik.com/responsibility.
Evonik also provides renewable raw materials as a basis
for future-oriented solutions for modern wind turbines, additives for environment-friendly water-based paints, and ingredients for the cosmetics industry.
REWOFERM® SL 446, a new sophorolipid-based bio­
surfactant from the Nutrition & Care segment, received two
awards in 2016. REWOFERM® SL 446 is 100 percent bio-based.
Alongside very good cleaning properties, it has an excellent
toxicological and ecological profile and is fully biodegradable.

The membranes business is one of our growth fields and
shows how our innovative products give us access to new
markets. SEPURAN® membranes developed by the Resource
Efficiency segment allow particularly efficient separation of
methane, nitrogen or hydrogen from gas mixtures. The
­SEPURAN® product family, which has been systematically
extended in recent years, now comprises membranes for the
treatment of biogas, the separation of nitrogen, and the treatment of helium and hydrogen. In fall 2016 we held the
groundbreaking ceremony for a further production complex
for membrane modules in Schörfling (Austria).

Customer satisfaction

Leading market positions account for around 80 percent of
Evonik’s sales. Our aim is to be integrated into our customers’
supply chains where possible. That allows optimal alignment
of our research & development, production, marketing and
distribution workflows to our customers’ requirements.
High customer satisfaction is very important to maintain
and extend our operating business. This is illustrated by the
high priority accorded to this in our materiality analysis.
At Group level, we have a Marketing & Sales Excellence
(MSE) team that offers special staff training and management
tools to support the continuous development and positioning
of our segments through customer focus.
Customer satisfaction analyses are an example. MSE
­bundles Group-wide customer surveys and provides the tools
and expertise needed to conduct such surveys. The aim is to
regularly measure customer satisfaction in order to define
measures that raise customer loyalty across the board and
identify scope for improvement in the development of
­products and services. The focus is on a holistic view of
­customer relationships, including product quality, product
development, pricing, service, communication, logistics, and
complaints management.
Evonik’s ten industry teams also make a cross-business
contribution to this. These teams pool solutions expertise for
specific sectors or markets and provide a Group-wide
­communication platform for dialogue with customers. In this
way, we build expertise and at the same time increase our
visibility in our key markets. Examples of the present industry
teams are Automotive, and Paints & Coatings.

Methodology
Our aim is to gain the most accurate possible insight into the
sustainability challenges and opportunities of our business.
We focus especially on market trends and future market
developments along the value chain. The sustainability analysis
of our business has therefore been driven forward and external
validation of the methodology has been undertaken. We
have therefore achieved the target we set ourselves for 2016.
Our sustainability analysis is based on a method focusing
on the value chains of our businesses and takes account of
criteria from the supply chain through production to subsequent use. The list of criteria reflects key ecological and societal
aspects of our materiality analysis. On this basis, we again
worked with all three chemical segments in 2016. The
­sustainability analysis now covers around 94 percent of our
Group sales. The result is a structured presentation of the
sustainability performance of all our businesses, which we
want to report on more extensively in 2017.
Life cycle analyses
Life cycle analyses are a focal area of our sustainability analysis.
The high expertise and strong operational involvement of the
Life Cycle Management group play a key role in ensuring that
Evonik has wide-ranging knowledge of the environmental
impact of its operations and is able to quantify this. We performed further life cycle analyses in 2016, for example for the
silica-silane technology used in “green” tires. Around 70 percent of the external sales of our chemical segments has now
been covered. In the mid term, we aim to extend this to around
80 percent of the external sales of our chemical segments.
Evonik’s procedure comprises a broad spectrum of methods,
including life cycle assessments (LCA), which comprise either
a cradle-to-gate analysis, covering all stages from product
development through raw material and energy inputs to production, or a cradle-to-grave analysis covering the entire life
cycle including subsequent use and disposal. Another tool is
the life cycle-based calculation of the carbon footprint of our
products. In addition, we use cross-referencing approaches,
where findings, for example from existing LCAs, are used to
evaluate similar products.

Resource-saving solutions
Evonik products offer customers resource-saving and energy-­
efficient solutions for a wide range of applications. In this
way, we play a part in meeting the rising sustainability
requirements of our markets. At the same time, we are
­continuing to develop our business opportunities in these
markets. See page 55.
Our sustainability analysis includes an extensive analysis
of the contribution made by our products to improving
resource efficiency in their respective applications. This
­covers energy savings and the reduction in greenhouse gas
emissions, water consumption and the use of raw materials.
The results confirm that in 2016 around 50 percent of the
sales generated by our chemical segments once again came
from products that make a measurable contribution to
improving the resource efficiency of their applications.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016

EVONIK INDUSTRIES

Protecting our environment and the climate are major global
challenges of our age. Maintaining the natural basis of life for
future generations is part of our corporate responsibility.
That includes steadily reducing emissions, continuous
improvements in the efficient use of materials and resources,
and developing products that help us forge a link between
economic success and ecological progress.
We have defined Environment, Safety, Health and Quality
(ESHQ) Values, which address our responsibility for the
environment and our endeavors to continuously improve our
products, processes and systems. For further information see
“Value chain and products”.
Our materiality analysis provides further insight into
issues of relevance for the environment area of action: climate
change, emissions into the air, water management, and waste
management. In these areas, we pay especial attention to
monitoring, analyzing and managing developments.
We have set demanding environmental targets for the
period 2013 – 2020 (reference base: 2012). These provide
valuable guidance for a continuous improvement in our performance in protecting the climate and our environment.
Their development is monitored and reported in detail.
Our central quantitative targets are reducing specific
greenhouse gases by 12 percent and reducing specific water
intake by 10 percent. Both of these targets are per metric ton
of output. Our aim is 80 percent attainment of these targets
by 2018. In addition, we want to achieve a further reduction
in hazardous production waste by setting a qualitative target
for this.

Our management system
The basis for our actions is an extensive, integrated management system that is aligned to our corporate structure. The
Corporate ESHQ division pools all Group-wide strategic
management and coordination tasks relating to the environment. The head of the Corporate ESHQ division reports
directly to the relevant member of the Executive Board (Chief
Human Resources Officer).
The structure of the management system is based on legal
requirements and internal regulations such as policies and
standard operating procedures. This supports a process of
continuous improvement in environmental performance and
compliance.

Corporate ESHQ uses a central audit system to regularly
monitor implementation of the binding Group-wide strategy
and the management system. Based on the findings and analysis
of our internal and external audits, site inspections and reviews,
talks are held on possible improvements and how to implement them. The Executive Board is informed annually of the
outcome of the audits.
Our management parameters are monitored regularly via a
central sustainability reporting system (SuRe), which contains
a wide range of data on climate change, emissions into the
air, water management, and waste management.
Overall, we compile more than 50 production- and
plant-related sustainability indicators. These are captured
locally on a plant-specific basis and can be evaluated via the
reporting system on the basis of management units, legal
structures or regions. The data capture and processing methods
are explained regularly at training sessions and are subject to
internal and external audits. In 2016 we successfully introduced
a technically upgraded version of our central reporting system
(SuRe 2.0). The new system allows additional evaluations
and is more user-friendly.

Organization

The global ESHQ strategy is adopted by the Executive Committee HR. Decisions on ESHQ issues relating to implementation of this strategy are taken by the ESHQ Panel, which is
composed of representatives of the segments, regions and the
Technical Committee, and employee representatives. It is
chaired by the head of the Corporate ESHQ division.
The role of the Global ESHQ Committee is to regularly
discuss ESHQ issues and prepare decisions to be taken by the
ESHQ Panel. This committee comprises representatives of
the relevant functions in the segments and the heads of the
regions.
Specialist knowledge of selected issues is bundled in ESHQ
Expert Circles, which are convened as required and are
responsible for implementing specific environmental requirements in the operational units. For example, there are Expert
Circles on climate strategy, environmental protection, and
management & audits.
The operational segments and site services define the
business-specific implementation of the decisions taken. The
Corporate ESHQ division ensures cross-segment rules on the
relevant processes.

Our activities in 2016

Our management system for the environment, safety, health
and quality applies to the entire Evonik Group. In addition,
we require our manufacturing sites to be validated as conforming to ISO 14001, the internationally recognized environmental management standard. As a result of the necessary
start-­­up and preparatory phase for new units, the proportion

of output covered by ISO 14001 validation varies. However,
it is always between 95 and 100 percent. Audits are conducted to monitor implementation by the segments, regions
and sites. Alongside audits on specific issues, we conducted
60 ESHQ audits worldwide in 2016.
We made successful progress with our environmental
­targets in 2016. Specific greenhouse gas emissions and specific water intake both declined significantly, by 6 percentage
points and 13 percentage points respectively. As well as
­targeted measures to raise energy efficiency and save water,
the reductions mainly come from structural upgrades at Marl
Chemical Park in Germany. The highly efficient new gas and
steam turbine power plant, which has replaced the old
­coal-fired plant, has high fuel efficiency, resulting in the
avoidance of considerable amounts of CO2 emissions each
year. In addition, specific CO2 emissions from natural gas,
which is the primary energy source, are far lower than from
coal. The water data are also very positive. Unlike its predecessor, the gas and steam turbine power plant is cooled via
a cooling circuit with recooling facilities rather than by oncethrough cooling. The replacement of once-through cooling
by closed-circuit cooling systems at our site in Kaba
(­Hungary) also led to a considerable reduction in the use of
freshwater.

Climate change and emissions into the air
Energy inputs

We regard responsible use of energy as equally important on
ecological and economic grounds. We use a broad spectrum of
technical and organizational measures to raise energy efficiency, including co-generation plants and expansion of integrated structures linking chemical production and energy
generation. Third-party production facilities are included in
these measures. We also consider using renewable energies.
Important criteria for assessing whether we can include them

in our energy mix are reliability of supply and cost-efficiency.
Many of our energy management systems meet the high
standards of ISO 50001.
In our reporting, we distinguish between primary energy
inputs, normally fossil fuels used to generate electricity and
steam, and secondary inputs, i. e., purchased electricity and
steam. We also use secondary fuels such as thermal processing
of by-products from production, waste and sewage sludge.
Substitute fuels accounted for around 9 percent of total
energy inputs in 2016, the same proportion as in 2015.

Differences between the data and totals are due to rounding differences.

Alongside a large number of specific measures, the changes in
Evonik’s energy mix and the reduction in total energy inputs
were driven principally by the replacement of a coal-fired
power plant by a highly efficient gas and steam turbine plant
in Marl (Germany). The slight reduction in the sale of power
and steam to third parties was partly due to the shutdown of
a third-party production facility at Marl Chemical Park and
the associated change in the customer structure.

Greenhouse gas emissions

Emitting greenhouse gases into the air is a side-effect of all
production processes. Use of efficient technologies and production processes will help us achieve our goal of reducing
specific greenhouse gas emissions by 12 percent by 2020
(reference base 2012 = 100).

The carbon footprint shows the volume of greenhouse gas
emissions of a company, process or individual product in CO2
equivalents, in other words, CO2 and the other greenhouse
gases defined in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol),
CH4, N2O, SF6, HFCs, PFCs and NF3.
The standard used to report our greenhouse gas emissions is the GHG Protocol. This includes direct CO2 emissions
(Scope 1 emissions) from energy generation and production,
and indirect CO2 emissions (Scope 2 emissions) from purchased energy. Together with other greenhouse gases, the
total is expressed as CO2 equivalents.

HOW WE IMPLEMENT SUSTAINABILITY

SUSTAINABILITY IN 2016

ANNEX

The environment

Scope 2 emissions were calculated in the past using the location-­
based method, which includes regional emission factors.
Since 2015, the majority of our sites around the world have
also calculated Scope 2 emissions using the market-based
method, which takes account of the specific emissions of
individual suppliers and market participants. This enhances
accuracy and also enables us to meet the requirements of the
GHG Protocol. In some cases, the data available is not sufficient for this method. We therefore use established factors

from the International Energy Agency in certain cases. To
ensure comparability, for 2016 the CO2 contribution to Scope 2
emissions is therefore reported using both methods. In addition, we have recalculated our Scope 2 emissions retroactively from 2012 using the market-based method. These data
are used to determine the specific GHG emissions for our
CO2 target. The new method covered more than 95 percent
of our power-related Scope 2 emissions in 2016, and around
77 percent of external steam inputs.

Total Scope 2 = Power and steam sourced externally less power and steam supplied to third parties. The table shows the CO2 emissions associated with the purchase of electricity

eliminate the proportion of energy-related CO2 emissions attributable to third parties at our large multi-user sites and generate company-specific indicators.

Greenhouse gases are clearly dominated by CO2 emissions. In
line with Evonik’s fuel mix, most Scope 1 CO2 emissions
(72 percent) are due to the combustion of coal and natural
gas. Due to the structural modernization of the power plants
in Marl (Germany), the proportion of coal-based CO2 emissions at Evonik declined to 28 percent in 2016 (2015: 33 percent), while the proportion of gas-based CO2 emissions
increased to 44 percent (2015: 39 percent). The high fuel
efficiency (89 percent) of the state-of-the-art gas and steam
turbine power plant in Marl and realization of specific measures to raise energy efficiency resulted in far lower greenhouse gas emissions in 2016. Both gross and net greenhouse

gas emissions declined by 3 percent despite a slight rise in
output. Relative to output, net greenhouse gas emissions
were 6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The 30 European facilities operated by Evonik that fall
within the scope of the European Union's Emissions Trading
System (EU ETS),1 emitted 3.7 million metric tons of CO2 in
2016. The reduction of 0.3 million metric tons CO2 compared
with 2015 was mainly due to the new gas and steam turbine
power plant in Marl (Germany).

EVONIK INDUSTRIES

Responsible use of energy is a priority at all of our sites on
ecological and economic grounds. We therefore constantly
strive to make the provision of energy more efficient,
improve energy generation still further, and optimize the
structure of our integrated energy management systems. Our
commitment in this area is shown by the fact that many of our
sites have obtained or are preparing to obtain validation
under ISO 50001, a global standard for energy management
systems. As well as reducing pressure on resources by using
co-generation plants at several of our large sites, we have
established many integrated structures linking chemical production and energy generation. For example, large amounts
of steam generated in exothermic processes at various production facilities are supplied to other plants via steam networks. This reduces steam production in our power plants,
which in turn reduces consumption of fossil fuels. Another
example is the use of liquid and gaseous by-products from
production as substitute fuels for energy generation. These
include hydrogen and propene from the production of prussic
acid, acrolein and acrylic acid. We also generate steam from
the exhaust heat from various incineration plants for waste,
sewage sludge, exhaust gases and wastewater.
Apart from CO2 emissions from fuels, only N2O emissions
(expressed in greenhouse gas equivalents) are of significance at
Evonik. Although they account for less than 1 percent of total
GHG emissions, fluctuations in these emissions are not insignificant for the overall development of our GHG emissions
because of their high greenhouse gas potential. N2O is only
emitted by a few production processes and measures have
been implemented to reduce these emissions.

Evonik Carbon Footprint 1
By paying special attention to the distribution of emissions
among the various sources along the value chain, we are able to
provide an extensive overview of greenhouse gas emissions—
from the extraction of raw materials through production to
disposal of the products. These data have been reported since
2008.
The key parameter is the carbon footprint (CO2eq footprint). The table below shows the development of greenhouse gas emissions for Evonik's products, based on the confirmed data for 2015, excluding the usage phase. The data
cover Evonik’s direct energy and process emissions (Scope
1), emissions from purchased electricity and heat (Scope 2),
and categories 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 12 from Scope 3.
These include emissions from the production of purchased
raw materials, packaging materials, capital goods, energy-­
related emissions outside Scope 1 and 2, emissions from
inbound transportation of raw materials, from the disposal of
production waste, business trips, commuting by employees,
Evonik’s fleet of vehicles, energy requirements for offices,
and emissions from the disposal and recycling of products
sold. The reported data exclude, among other things, the
usage phase of Evonik’s products.
The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions shown by the
Evonik Carbon Footprint from 25.7 to 24.7 million metric tons
CO2eq between 2014 and 2015 is principally due to the routine
updating of emissions factors. This takes place every two
years and resulted in a reduction in emissions this time. As a
consequence, emissions from purchased raw materials
decreased despite a slight rise in volumes. Moreover, the
updated emissions factors resulted in a reduction in emissions
from waste disposal and the disposal of purchased products.

CO2eq avoided by using Evonik products

Evonik markets a variety of products whose use makes a positive contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions
­compared to conventional alternatives. The avoidance of
greenhouse gases shown here results from applications for
the following five products: “green” tire technology, amino
acids for animal nutrition, foam stabilizers for insulating
materials, specialty oxides for energy-saving light bulbs, and
oil additives for hydraulic fluids. The amounts stated are
avoided over the usage life cycle of the products, based on
volume sales of the products manufactured by Evonik in the
year given. The method used to compile the data is the WBCSD
Avoided Emissions Guidance published in October 2013.

The increase in avoided emissions between 2011 and 2013 was
mainly due to an increase in sales volumes. The significant
increase in avoided greenhouse gas emissions in 2014 was
essentially due to a modified data basis for amino acids in
animal nutrition. The underlying life cycle analysis was updated
in 2014. In the recalculation process, production data for
amino acids and the production of representative feed formulations were adjusted. In addition, an increase in sales volumes
of other products increased avoided greenhouse gas emissions
in 2014.
Despite higher output in 2015, avoided greenhouse gas
emissions were around the same as in 2014. This was mainly
because the underlying life cycle analysis for “green” tires
was updated in 2015, resulting in lower specific avoidance of
greenhouse gases.

Carbon Disclosure Project—Climate reporting
at a high level

Evonik constantly strives to improve its reporting on key
environmental indicators and is engaged in intensive
exchange with rating agencies such as the Carbon Disclosure
Project. The CDP compiles detailed annual data on the
greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption of companies worldwide. It also evaluates the opportunities and
risks of climate change for their business activities and how
the management takes them into account in its strategy. The
CDP currently meets the information needs of more than 800
institutional investors with assets under management of over
US$ 100 trillion. The investors use the data to derive a climate
risk profile for the companies, which they then use in their
investment decisions.
In 2016, we were able to build on the very good results
obtained in 2015. With a score of “A –” for climate change
reporting, Evonik attained the status of an index/country
leader in the MDAX, which positions it among the top 15
percent of the MDAX companies.

Other emissions into the air

Alongside emissions of greenhouse gases as reported above,
energy generation and industrial production result in further
emissions into the air. Our goal is a further reduction and
greater control of such emissions. To achieve this, we use a
range of technical and organizational measures. Our environmental management systems set the framework for us to
achieve the statutory thresholds. Relevant sources of emissions
are constantly monitored in accordance with statutory
requirements. Our production and exhaust gas treatment
facilities are fitted with emissions monitoring devices. Action
includes returning exhaust gases to production processes and
thermal processing of residual gases with a high calorific
value as a substitute for natural gas. We also take the emissions profile into account through state-of-the art technical
design and planning of new facilities.

depletion potential (ODP) is a relative parameter indicating how dangerous substances are for the ozone layer compared with the reference substance, fluorinated

SOx emissions predominantly come from energy generation
and the recycling of sulfuric acid. The decline in 2016 was
mainly due to the replacement of a power plant block in Marl
(Germany) by a new gas and steam turbine power plant with
lower emissions. Although coal inputs at the power plants
were lower overall, heavy metal emissions increased as a
result of the different composition of imported coal. This was
the reason for the Group-wide increase in emissions of heavy
metals 2016. NOx emissions increased slightly in 2016, largely
due to the rise in coal inputs as a result of higher production
output in Nanping (China), and changes in the fuel mix in
Hanau (Germany). Changes in the product mix, higher output and one-off factors were the principal reasons for the rise
in NMVOC and particulate emissions in 2016.

Water management
We are committed to responsible use of water, want to save
water wherever possible and achieve a further reduction in
our emissions into water. A good water supply is crucial for
smooth production processes because water is one of the most
important auxiliaries used in the chemical industry. Our goal
is to reduce specific water intake, i. e., intake per metric ton of
output, by 10 percent by 2020 (reference base 2012 = 100). We
take into account surface water, ground­water and drinking
water to reflect the special significance of freshwater.

HOW WE IMPLEMENT SUSTAINABILITY

SUSTAINABILITY IN 2016

ANNEX

The environment

Evonik mainly uses water for cooling and for process purposes in production facilities, to generate steam in power
plants, and for sanitary requirements. To reduce the use of
freshwater, we have established integrated supply systems
with graduated water qualities. For example, we use water that
is no longer suitable for cooling purposes to rinse filters or in
industrial cleaning processes. In addition, the water that evaporates from cooling circuits is often replaced by condensate
or recycled drinking water. In accordance with ISO 14046, the
intake of sea water for cooling purposes at our methionine
facility in Singapore is not taken into account in our overview
of our water footprint; however, it is reported separately.

Consumption of freshwater dropped substantially, by 10 percent, from 474.6 to 429.1 million m3 in 2016. This was mainly
because a coal-fired power plant block in Marl (Germany)
was replaced by a modern gas and steam turbine power
plant. Unlike its predecessor, the new plant is cooled using a
closed-circuit system with recooling facilities. Similarly, at the
site in Kaba (Hungary), once-through cooling was replaced
by closed-circuit cooling, thus saving freshwater.
The sea water required for once-through cooling of our
world-scale DL-methionine plant in Singapore increased significantly in 2016 because—unlike 2015—this was the first full
year of operation.

About 77 percent of the freshwater used in 2016 was surface
water, mainly from rivers. Just under 1 percent comprised
­recycled water and rainwater.
Most of our total water intake (around 96 percent) is used
for cooling purposes in energy generation and production.
For this, we mainly use surface water and sea water. Around
67 percent of the groundwater intake is also used for cooling.

Water used in closed cooling circuits is included when calculating the proportion of total water that is used for cooling. In
2016, nearly 72 percent of cooling of production facilities
used closed-circuit systems with recooling facilities. The
remainder were cooled using once-through systems. Only
4 percent of the freshwater used is required for production
purposes.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016

EVONIK INDUSTRIES

The difference between water intake and once-through cooling
water is due to the use of water, among other things, to produce
steam, in production, to cover evaporation losses and as process water. In 2016 the difference was 65.7 million m3 (2015:
71.3 million m3).

Emissions into water

Our sites aim to make a contribution to protecting natural
water resources. The basic principles of the management of
our industrial wastewater are the same as for waste management: “avoidance before reuse/recycling before disposal.”
When planning new production plants, we therefore consider the use of processes that generate little or no waste­
water. That takes pressure off the environment and reduces
the cost of water treatment. We continue these efforts in the
operational phase. We also have high technology standards
and infrastructure for the disposal of wastewater at our sites.

Production effluent undergoes multi-step chemical and physical
treatment in our wastewater treatment facilities. Separate
drainage systems prevent production effluent and cooling
water becoming mixed. This means that cooling water can be
discharged into rivers with rainwater without treatment. We
have also built high-performance collector systems as part of
our water protection measures. These are used for intermediate storage of peak wastewater loads which could overburden
the wastewater treatment facilities. In this way, wastewater
can subsequently be fed gradually to the treatment plants.
We also incinerate some sewage sludge in our own facilities,
and use the heat from the resulting incineration gases to generate steam. Wastewater discharged from our sites is carefully monitored by regular sampling and continuous measuring
equipment. In addition to in-house monitoring, we are subject
to supervision by the authorities in the form of unannounced
control visits to verify compliance with discharge limits.

The data on wastewater loads comprise all direct discharges into receiving water and proportionate indirect discharges.

Chemical oxygen demand (COD) accounts for the highest
proportion of wastewater loads. This is the concentration of
all substances in the wastewater that can be oxidized under
certain conditions. The reduction in the COD and total nitrogen
loads was mainly attributable to local production fluctuations
and to process optimization. The increase in the total phosphorus load (phosphates expressed as phosphorus) was principally due to an increase in the use of phosphoric acid as a
product stabilizer.
The rise in adsorbable organic halogen compounds (AOX
load) is essentially within the analytical variation for the
­measuring method because in many cases the values obtained
are only slightly above the detection threshold. Heavy metal
emissions were unchanged from the prior-year level.

Waste management
In line with sustainable development, we are constantly
endeavoring to improve waste integration and material flow
management. The following priorities have been set for
waste management at Evonik: The first priority is to avoid
waste through continuous process improvements and by
extending integrated production systems. If this is not possible,
waste should be recycled or used to generate energy, and as
a last resort, it should be disposed of safely.

HOW WE IMPLEMENT SUSTAINABILITY

SUSTAINABILITY IN 2016

ANNEX

The environment

We use catalysts to increase yields and reduce side reactions.
Integrated material flows also make a contribution. The benefits of integrated production sites and systems are also used
for systematic waste management, for example in Marl (Germany), which is our largest site. Here, hydrocarbon residues
are used as a substitute for heating oil in the synthesis gas
plant, and waste sulfuric acid in the sulfuric acid plant is
reprocessed. Sewage sludge can also be reused within the

integrated production structure. Dewatering is followed by
thermal reprocessing by incinerating it in a separate incineration plant with integrated flue gas treatment. Some of the
exhaust gases from the production plants are used as substitute
fuels in this process. The incineration gases are then used to
generate 20 bar steam. To conserve resources, at many of our
sites we use substitute fuels such as liquid residues from
­production processes.

Differences between the data and totals are due to rounding differences.

The total amount of waste decreased by 3 percent from
455,000 metric tons to 438,000 metric tons in 2016, but the
development differed by category. Hazardous production
waste was 7 percent higher than in 2015 due to expansion of
capacity, new facilities, and increased disposal of sewage
sludge. However, relative to output, hazardous production
waste in 2016 was 9 percentage points lower than in 2012

(2012 = 100 percent). By contrast, the amount of non-hazardous
production waste was 29,000 metric tons lower than in 2015.
Considerably less recyclable biomass waste was recorded. This
was primarily attributable to a drop in demand for certain
products.
Building and demolition rubble can fluctuate considerably
between years because it depends on specific projects. In
2016 it declined by 3,000 metric tons (3 percent).

EVONIK INDUSTRIES

The percentage of waste reprocessed comprises recycled
substances, incineration with recycling of heat energy, and
other disposal methods. In 2016 it declined by 7 percentage
points year-on-year to 59 percent, mainly because of the
reduction in biomass waste. Evonik develops methods of
recycling waste in accordance with the statutory framework.
For example, we recycle or re-use precious metal catalysts
and industrial packaging.

As of 2015.

In 2015, five sites were adjacent to conservation areas that are
protected by the European Union's Directive on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora (Council
Directive 92/43/EEC). Six further sites are adjacent to conservation areas that are regulated by country-specific legislation.
The next update of these data is scheduled for 2017.
Our site in Mobile (Alabama, USA) is close to the Fowl
River. Members of the local management team belong to the
Fowl River Forever steering committee that is working on a
plan to protect the water quality. All stakeholders are
involved in order to describe the present situation, identify
problems, define targets, and develop strategies. As members
of the steering committee, Evonik employees met with stakeholders several times in 2016 and played a part in shaping the
planning process.
A 4 km2 wildlife habitat area borders our site in Lafayette
(Indiana, USA). Every year, Evonik organizes a butterfly
encounter in collaboration with the Purdue University
Department of Entomology. The general public is invited to
identify and photograph regional butterflies. Entomologists
also discuss the significance of the habitat for protecting
endangered species and other aspects of biodiversity. Purdue
University publishes an annual report on the results of the
species count in the Evonik Wildlife Habitat Area.

An Evonik product for the treatment of ballast water makes a
practical contribution to maintaining biodiversity. Modern
cargo ships take up to 100,000 metric tons of ballast water
on board to minimize the risk of capsizing during the voyage.
In this way, many foreign organisms get into local ecosystems.
This can cause a dramatic reduction in the original local biodiversity, resulting in economic, ecological and health problems.
Our scientists have developed the PERACLEAN® Ocean
process to remove potential foreign organisms. The active
substances decompose into substances that are ecologically
safe so the treated ballast water can be discharged without
damaging ecosystems. Extensive testing in normal shipping
operations started in 2016. All international tests will be completed by mid-2017 and type approval by the US Coast Guard
is expected for early 2018.

EVONIK INDUSTRIES

Occupational and plant safety
Safety and health protection have priority over sales and
profits at Evonik. This is confirmed by our materiality analysis
and regular discussions with our stakeholders. Protecting the
health and employability of our employees, and preventing
accidents and incidents at work, in the operation of our production facilities, during transportation and on the way to and
from work are of central importance to Evonik. We take an
all-round approach to safety, covering employees, their
working situation, products and the general working environment.
In the Evonik Group this is ensured by globally valid policies
and operating procedures that are firmly anchored in an integrated management system. Observance of these rules is monitored via a central audit system. At operational level, business-­
specific implementation is defined by the segments. Steering
bodies at Group level ensure that mission-critical processes
are implemented across the segments (see “The environment”,
Structure of the ESHQ steering bodies, page 59).
We analyze incidents carefully so we can learn from
them. The lessons learned are communicated in our regular
global newsletter “Learning from one another”, which
reports on topical safety issues. Our binding targets and key
performance indicators are used to check implementation of
the requirements and identify the need for further action.
The relevant parameters are accident frequency as a measure
of occupational safety and incident frequency as an indicator
of plant safety.
Our crisis and incident management ensures that in the
event of accidents and incidents everything is done to prevent
and limit damage. We also play an active part in the relevant
national and international associations.
The Safety at Evonik initiative is firmly established throughout the Group as a fundamental management approach geared

to implementing a safety culture in all areas of occupational and
transportation safety. In 2014 we developed binding principles
of action, which are grouped in four themes. They define the
appropriate behaviors and provide clear and measurable guidance for the personal conduct and leadership of all groups of
employees, from local personnel to our management. All
employees worldwide receive training in this.

Occupational and plant safety in 2016

To review the effectiveness of our safety culture, we asked
our employees for feedback by including a special safety-­
related set of questions in our Group-wide employee survey
in 2015. The results were available at the start of 2016 and
were intensively analyzed and discussed within the Group.
They showed that safety is well-established as a topic
throughout the Group and is regarded as very important. No
significant differences were identified between the various
Evonik locations. Potential was identified for communication
and involving employees in work on safety issues. To improve
these aspects, we have introduced a new Safety at Evonik
Toolbox to give our plants access to best practices from
around the Group. Practical work with the toolbox is planned
for 2017.
We stepped up process safety by integrating the Global
Process Safety Competence Center (GPSC) into the Technology & Infrastructure unit. A new risk matrix has been developed as a central measure. This defines a uniform procedure for
technical process safety analyses. To guarantee a uniformly
high standard for safety concepts on preventing the release of
substances, fires and explosions around the world, analyses
are systematic and risk-based. Support is provided by
selected, experienced safety experts from the GPSC and the
Global Safety Expert Network, which is under the functional
leadership of the GPSC.

Health protection
Global management of health protection and promotion at
Evonik takes a long-term, holistic approach, covering
employees, the working situation, products and the general
working environment. This approach includes high-quality
medical care where necessary, applying ergonomic and
health-related measures to structure working conditions, and
a functioning emergency management system at plant level.
In addition, we offer a selective range of health promotion
measures, which are bundled in the Group-wide well@work
initiative. In this way, we help our employees adopt a healthy
lifestyle.

60

100

The key objectives and aspects of our occupational health
strategy are described in the Evonik Guidelines for Health
Protection and Promotion. The corporate policy Occupational
Health and Health Promotion sets binding worldwide standards for assessing health hazards, occupational medicine,
emergency medical response, preventive check-ups, workplace ergonomics, rehabilitation and reintegration, health
promotion in the workplace, and dealing with alcohol and
drug abuse.
There are works agreements on health topics at many of
our sites, especially in Germany. In line with statutory requirements, at our German sites we have Occupational Safety
Committees that meet at least four times a year to discuss
issues relating to occupational safety and the protection of
health. They are composed of employer and employee representatives, safety specialists, safety officers and occupational
medicine specialists, and cover more than 99 percent of our
employees in Germany. There are also comparable bodies at
sites outside Germany.
Fulfillment of the requirements is checked regularly by
corporate audits and regional environment, safety and health
(ESH) audits, and through an extensive occupational health
reporting system. Action is taken if there are indications of
scope for improvement or deviations from the applicable
guidelines. Where necessary, improvements are suggested or
required. As an overriding indicator, we have established an
Occupational Health Performance Index.

HOW WE IMPLEMENT SUSTAINABILITY

SUSTAINABILITY IN 2016

ANNEX

Safety

Emergency medical management

The Group-wide standard on Medical Incident and Emergency Management defines binding basic requirements for
emergency medical management at Evonik’s sites. The exact
equipment and human resources required at each site depend
on production-related risks and the availability and quality of
local infrastructure (e. g., emergency services and hospitals).
Specific procedures have been defined for accidents
where employees come into contact with chemicals and
require special medical treatment. Emergency medical management also includes pandemic plans and regular training
exercises. An extensive preventive program is in place for
employees on business trips and foreign assignments, including
a global emergency management system for medical problems
and risks to personal safety.

In the intermediate term, we aim to establish programs in
these five basic areas at all sites. There are already health promotion offerings and measures of various types at almost all
sites around the world.
These basic programs are supplemented by campaigns,
which concentrate on different topics each year, and general
medical check-ups to screen for treatable risk factors and
­diseases. The combined focus of the campaigns at our German
sites in the reporting period were diabetes, breast cancer and
early diagnosis of breast cancer, and eyes and eye ­diseases.
The North America region also ran a region-wide campaign
on the prevention and early diagnosis of diabetes.
At all of our German sites there are interdisciplinary
health task forces that concentrate on implementing health
management as part of the Group-wide well@work initiative.

Workplace-related preventive healthcare

Occupational Health Performance Index

The results of our hazard assessment help us take suitable
preventive measures to avoid work-related illnesses and
health problems. Where we identify a heightened risk for
specific employees, technical and organizational measures
have priority over the use of personal protective equipment.
Information and training of employees in risks and preventive
measures play an important part in avoiding health impairments. At preventive medical check-ups, employees receive
advice on their individual health risks and, where necessary,
appropriate precautions.
Evonik regularly reports on occupational illnesses. The
indicator used for this is the Occupational Disease Rate
(ODR), which is defined as the number of newly identified
cases of occupational illnesses per 1 million working hours.
The calculation includes all cases recognized in the reporting
period, including latent illnesses (i.e., those where the causes
lie well in the past). The ODR was 0.36 in 2016 (2015: 0.30).

The well@work company health
management ­program

In the area of health promotion, Evonik supports long-term
programs on exercise, diet, stress and work-life balance,
­substance abuse and avoiding infections. The aim is to
encourage employees to adopt a healthy lifestyle. We also
offer our employees fit-for-life seminars. These run over several
days and focus on a healthy lifestyle and maintaining longterm well-being and employability.

The Occupational Health Performance Index comprises six
parameters—two from each of the following areas: occupational medicine, health promotion and emergency medical
management—which we consider especially significant for
occupational health management. The index also takes
account of the scope and quality of the measures implemented. It shows the extent to which internal requirements
and targets have been implemented and enables us to measure progress in the area of occupational health and drive
forward continuous improvement. The index is calculated
annually. To maintain constant awareness of these issues, in
2016 we decided to define a long-term annual target of ≥ 5.0
for this index. In 2016 the performance index was 5.5 compared
with 5.3 in 2015 (maximum: 6.0).
The Occupational Health Performance Index is currently
calculated for 64 sites around the world, which employ
87 percent of Evonik’s workforce. For Germany, we also
­calculate a health ratio, which was 95.3 percent in 2016
(2105: 95.4 percent). This is the ratio of target working hours
less sickness-related hours lost to target working hours.

Safe transportation of goods is extremely important for us.
We use a uniform process to select logistics service providers
for transportation. We also regularly review their performance. In keeping with our understanding of sustainability,
that includes evaluating the Responsible Care® performance
of all transportation providers. Our aim is to minimize risk at
all stages, from loading through transportation to unloading.
Risk assessment is an important tool for managing the risks
involved in transportation.
The standards we set for the transportation of dangerous
goods are even higher than the national and international regulations. In order to be registered by our logistics procurement
unit for transportation, all logistics service providers have to
recognize and acknowledge our requirements. These specify
that, as well as ensuring safety, the transportation of goods
must be sustainable, and the provider must meet its ecological
as well as social responsibility and comply with all statutory
provisions. Further, we have defined minimum requirements
for customers who collect goods themselves or use their own
logistics service providers.
In addition, Evonik maintains a close and constant dialogue
with other chemical companies and with logistics service providers to draw joint lessons from incidents and recommend
precautionary measures.

Activities in 2016

Our regular truck inspection day, which is not pre-announced,
contributes to a continuous reduction in safety shortcomings.
For the third time, extensive checks were carried out on
trucks at 13 sites. The checks included technical condition,
personal protective equipment, securing of loads, labeling
and drivers.
Safety and care also have top priority at interfaces
between production (storage tanks) and transportation
(tankers and containers). To avoid product spillages, which
could result in accidents, environmental damage or traffic
incidents, it is important to ensure that the numerous filling
and emptying processes in our plants are carried out safely. A
regular week-long campaign on safe filling and emptying
processes is therefore held at our sites. Regular training of
employees to raise awareness of hazardous goods and help
them meet statutory requirements in the transportation of
such goods is essential and forms an integral part of Evonik’s
safety culture.
Securing loads correctly is another important aspect. This
covers both the operational process of physically securing
loads and developing a strategy to harmonize and standardize
the procedure for securing loads and the equipment required.
The aim is to use certified equipment for all types of cargo

transport units on all means of transportation to ensure validated safety for everyone involved. In 2016 we introduced
best practice workshops and thus established a uniform
­procedure for securing our products during transportation.
In addition, Evonik has started to implement the CTU
Code.1 This comes into force on December 1, 2018, along
with the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code, but
is already mandatory for the transportation of dangerous
goods in Germany.
Our experts analyze the transportation risks of products
with elevated risk potential to identify and evaluate safety
and environmental risks and introduce measures to minimize
them. Transportation risk analyses are examples of how
Evonik puts safe transportation into practice. Alongside a
number of analyses in Germany and elsewhere in Europe in
2016, we conducted analyses in the USA, Mexico and China.
The concept for analyzing supply chains includes the following points:
• Identifying critical substances/products
• Identifying supply chains to be analyzed
• Pre-assessment to evaluate supply chains
• Transportation risk analyses
• Monitoring “critical” supply chains and regions

ANNEX

Safety

The data on the shipment of goods in 2016 differ from those
in 2015 as a result of internal harmonization of reporting. As
a consequence, goods collected by customers and internal
shipments via pipeline are no longer included.
We are using tracking and tracing systems in selected
pilot projects. As well as allowing complete monitoring of all
stages in the transportation of hazardous goods, these systems
can monitor pressure and product temperature, and respond
to leaks. Safety-related data allow preventive action to be
taken quickly to avoid transportation accidents.
We use uniform Responsible Care® criteria to evaluate
transportation incidents. There were no reportable incidents
in the shipment of goods in 2016.
In January 2016 we started to introduce a global transport
management system in the Evonik Group. The benefits are
more flexible planning and greater transparency of process
workflows, bringing greater flexibility for our customers as
well. At the same time, freight, process and network costs
can be reduced.

Sustainability in transportation and logistics

The principal ecological impact of the transportation of
goods is the use of fossil fuels. We therefore keep a close eye
on protecting the climate and the environment in the transportation of goods. In collaboration with Procurement, our
operational logistics staff regularly examine ways of reducing
the number of road shipments by optimizing capacity and
using multimodal shipment by rail, inland waterway or ocean
freight. This also reduces the impact on communities around
our sites, for example, as a result of noise, exhaust fumes and
vibrations. In 2016, this was aided by improved transportation
concepts, load optimization and pre-loading concepts. In
addition, further action was taken in the area of sustainability.
For example, strategic suppliers were selected for road transport of packaged goods. We are successfully shifting shipment
of packaged goods to intermodal transportation. Another
example of the measures to enhance sustainability is aligning
the size of ships used to transport gaseous chemicals to
demand.

Targets for 2017

•	Identify critical products and drive forward the development of safety standards for their transportation
•	Develop a training concept to implement the CTU Code
•	Check products for potential classification as polymerizable substances

REACH = Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals.

Product stewardship
In the chemical industry, product stewardship ranks alongside
plant, occupational and transportation safety as a vital
­precondition for doing business. It is our “license to operate”.
Evonik is no exception, as confirmed by the results of our
materiality ­analysis.
Through our products and solutions, we aim to make a
measurable contribution to avoiding environmental impact
and enhancing people’s quality of life. That includes timely
identification and evaluation of the potential health and environmental risks in our portfolio. We therefore examine the
entire value chain of each of our products—from procurement
of the raw materials to delivery to our industrial customers,
who receive all relevant information on the handling and
­disposal of our products. That includes, for example, safety
data sheets and technical information sheets.
As well as complying with all statutory requirements, such
as the European Chemicals Regulation REACH 1 and the
Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of
Chemicals (GHS), product stewardship at Evonik includes
­voluntary commitments that go beyond these regulations.
We have been committed for many years to the international Responsible Care® initiative and the Responsible Care®
Global Charter of the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA), which includes the Global Product Strategy
(GPS). Our long-standing commitment to this was renewed in
2014 by the signature of the Chairman of the Executive Board.
The key elements of our product stewardship have been
defined in a Product Policy. To supplement this, an operating
procedure that was revised in 2016 defines how these commitments are to be implemented within Evonik, together with
control mechanisms to monitor their observance.

Responsible handling of chemicals

In light of the global trade in chemicals and chemical products,
it is important to encourage broad communication on their
safe handling and use. We ensure this through an extensive
worldwide information system. This includes information
portals, safety data sheets—not just for dangerous products—in more than 30 languages, technical data sheets, GPS
Safety Summaries, and extensive information on our website.
There are also 24/7 emergency hotlines, including a translation
service, and email addresses.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016

EVONIK INDUSTRIES

Trustful collaboration with our customers

The life cycle of a product starts with research & development
and ends with recycling or safe disposal. Our specialist
departments provide advice for our customers at all stages in
the product life cycle, from selection of the raw materials
through dealing with possible toxicological, ecotoxicological
and physical chemistry risks and the resulting exposure-based
risks, regulatory requirements relating to the planned application, right up to transportation and disposal. Where necessary,
we give customers training in how to handle our products.

Our chemicals management systems

We evaluate all substances placed on the market (>1 metric
ton p. a.). Particularly dangerous substances are included
from lower tonnages. That allows a soundly based assessment
of the risks. Where necessary, restrictions are placed on certain
usage patterns or, in extreme cases, a complete ban is issued
on use in certain products.
Evonik evaluates its substances using its own Chemicals
Management System (CMS). This system, which was developed in-house, supports us in global product evaluation,
analogously to a life cycle analysis. The content of the CMS
has been harmonized with the GPS requirements. Two-thirds
of assessments had been completed by the end of 2016, and
GPS Safety Summaries for more than 150 substances had
been made available on our website and the ICCA portal. The
summaries are in English; some are also available in Japanese,
Korean and Chinese. Following the completion of REACH on
schedule in May 2018, we will focus on publishing further
GPS Safety Summaries. Cefic is working to simplify the
preparation of these Safety Summaries and Evonik is playing
an active part in this.
As an extension of the CMS, our Chemicals Management
SystemPLUS is used for products containing substances of very
high concern. These are subject to a more detailed examination
to bring about a further reduction in the negative impact on
people and the environment. In the reporting period, around
1 percent of our products met the criteria for evaluation on
the basis of CMSPLUS.
In addition, we play an active role in many national and
international associations and initiatives that are driving forward scientifically based risk assessment.

Evonik is systematically implementing REACH

Under REACH, all substances produced, imported or placed
on the market in the EU in quantities of more than 1 metric
ton p. a. have to be registered. Evonik supports the aim of
protecting health and the environment in the handling of
chemicals. To implement the complex REACH requirements,
we maintain a close dialogue with our suppliers and customers,
as well as with industry associations and authorities.
So far, nearly 70 percent of the substances identified as
being relevant at present have been registered. We will complete all necessary REACH registrations on schedule by the
end of May 2018.
Alongside registration, evaluating dossiers and substances, restriction and authorization are becoming more
important. We constantly compare the substance lists published by the authorities with our own portfolio to ensure
timely identification of any of our substances that are
affected. If such substances are identified, we examine suitable measures. We also collaborate closely with our customers
to work out the next steps. In addition, we examine the raw
materials we procure. If any substances are categorized as
being of very high concern or are on the list of potential candidates, we discuss the steps to be taken with our suppliers or
look for alternatives. We have set up email addresses for all
REACH-related inquiries from customers and suppliers to
ensure they receive timely and full replies.
REACH will be a focal area of our activities in 2017. We
assume that there will be a significant increase in the number
of our substances registered under REACH until complete
fulfillment of the requirements in May 2018. In addition,
­follow-on activities are required for those substances that
have already been registered (test proposals, evaluations, etc.).
The regulatory requirements for chemicals are also rising
steadily in many other regions. The Evonik Group will therefore be driving forward global product stewardship through
its own task force.

The Globally Harmonized System (GHS)

The Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) initiated by the United Nations classifies dangerous goods and substances for labeling on packaging and in safety data sheets. Evonik ensured timely implementation of the GHS requirements in the European Union in
2015. The GHS is still not applied uniformly around the
world. We have therefore set up an in-house database to
gather information on progress, changes and national
requirements for internal communication.

Safety

Nanotechnology

Nanotechnology is a generic term for a wide range of developments and innovations. Their common feature is the investigation, production and use of minute structures measuring
around 1 to 100 nanometers. Evonik has decades of experience
of producing nanostructured materials. We handle the associated technologies responsibly and utilize the possibilities
they offer. Nanomaterials can make a substantial contribution
to environmental protection and climate protection through
new products and efficient system solutions for our customers.
For example, we see considerable opportunities in new
materials for high-end batteries and energy-saving applications
in the construction sector.
In our measures to protect employees, customers and
consumers when handling nanomaterials, we are guided by
the latest scientific research findings on hazards and risk evaluation and by epidemiological and toxicological studies.
Evonik also supports the establishment of new methods of
investigation aligned to the specific effects of nanomaterials,
which refine the evaluation of risks. For example, we are
involved in the OECD Working Party on Manufactured
Nanomaterials, where we work closely with leading research
institutes. We are also involved in various research projects
such as NanoScreen and NanoToxClass. These are investigating, for example, the potential impact of the release of nanomaterials from products. In this context, we are working with
the ECETOC 1 Nano Task Force. We are also continuously
investigating the potential hazards and safe handling of these
materials. The results of our research are communicated
openly and transparently to our stakeholders. Representatives
of Evonik take part in the German government's NanoDialog,
where experts from industry, science, authorities and industry
associations discuss the opportunities and risks of nanotechnology.

Biotechnology

Evonik utilizes the opportunities offered by biotechnology
for efficient and environmentally compatible production processes and innovative products. We use micro-organisms for
biocatalysis processes and fermentative production processes.
Biotechnology is used to produce essential amino acids, probiotics, nutritional supplements and pharmaceutical and cosmetic ingredients that are difficult or impossible to access

CMR = carcinogenic, mutagenic, toxic for reproduction.
PBT = persistent, bioaccumulative, toxic.

through conventional chemical synthesis. Such products have
to be registered before they can be produced and placed on
the market. That requires detailed explanations of the production processes and the micro-organisms used as well as safety
aspects. We have issued guidelines on safe and responsible
use of biotechnology. In this way, we meet demands of our
customers and the general public for transparent action and
communication, and stringent risk prevention.

Animal protection

We need toxicological and ecotoxicological data to assess the
safety of our products. As the first step, we examine all alternatives in detail (QSAR, read-across, literature, non-animal
testing). Various task forces have therefore been set up, for
example to pool expertise in in-silico methods and evaluate
in-vitro methods for the skin sensitization endpoint. For
instance, in 2016 we entered into a cooperation agreement
with Epithelix for the development of an in-vitro method for
the respiratory sensitization endpoint.
Despite this, from a scientific and legal perspective, tests
on animals are often the only way to meet the necessary data
requirements. Evonik only arranges for animal tests to be
performed by test institutes that are validated in accordance
with the applicable national and international legal provisions
and ensures that they meet animal protection standards. As a
responsible company, we have also drawn up our own animal
protection guidelines.

Targets

We have set the following targets for product stewardship
for the period up to 2020:
•	Establish a risk estimate for > 99% of substances that are
placed on the market in quantities of >1 metric ton p. a.
(Chemicals Management System, CMS).
•	Make GPS Safety Summaries for these substances available via the Evonik website and the ICCA’s GPS portal
(CMS).
•	Conduct a more far-reaching assessment using defined
criteria for all products containing >0.1% hazardous
chemicals of high concern (hChC), for example, CMR 2
1A/1B chemicals and PBT 3 chemicals (CMSPLUS).

HOW WE IMPLEMENT SUSTAINABILITY

SUSTAINABILITY IN 2016

Society

Social commitment has a firm place in Evonik’s corporate culture and our understanding of values. We regard it as our
contribution to the sustainable development of society.
Essentially, we make a distinction between donations and
sponsorship activities.1 Our active responsibility and the personal commitment of our employees around the world provide
important social impetus in and around our sites.

How we live our social commitment
Our sponsorship is aligned to Evonik’s four core competencies—creativity, specialization, self-renewal, and reliability.
We normally only sponsor projects and initiatives that fit our
core brand. Moreover, our aim is to foster the positive development of society through our sites around the world. Within
binding strategic guidelines, our operating units therefore
support projects tailored to the regions and sites where they
operate.
The work of the Evonik Foundation is an important element in how we put our social responsibility into practice. In
keeping with its mission, this company-related foundation
focuses its activities on four principal themes: young people,
science, Germany, and integration. The Evonik Foundation
only provides scholarships and donations for projects and
organizations based in Germany. In addition to this, it implements its own projects.
Overall, Evonik concentrates its social commitment on the
following areas:

•	Education & science
	
Education and science are prerequisites for the progress

and prosperity of society as a whole. Evonik and the Evonik
Foundation therefore support education at all levels—from
preschool, elementary and secondary schools to university
degrees (including doctoral degrees), as well as vocational
and specialist training. For many years, we have also been
involved in programs that give young people opportunities
to prepare for work.

1	Further

•	Social projects
	
Intact communities and solidarity make societies viable and
worth living in. One special goal is therefore supporting
people in difficult circumstances. We therefore provide
funding for the Evonik Foundation, for example, to enable it
to initiate and support projects and initiatives for refugees.
In addition, the Evonik Group provides humanitarian assistance in the wake of natural catastrophes.

• The arts

	Our commitment to culture and the arts has grown out of
our core competency “creativity”. We are convinced that
encounters with culture and the arts contribute to the
ongoing development of society, and foster diversity and
an open and tolerant co-existence—values that we live
daily in our company.

• Sport

	Sport creates bonds that transcend cultural, social and
­language barriers. It fosters tolerance and respect and
therefore makes a contribution to peaceful coexistence.
Evonik therefore supports both popular sports activities,
and elite sports.

The Evonik Group
Our social commitment creates social values. In the long
term, we expect this to be beneficial for our company.

Education & science

Our goal is to interest young people, in particular, in science.
That is why we set up the Young Spirit program: Evonik
employees visit preschools and elementary schools to interest
children in scientific phenomena through hands-on experiments. More than 200 employees take part in this initiative.
In view of its success in Germany, we have now extended the
Young Spirit program to many other regions.

EVONIK INDUSTRIES

Another high-profile educational project is the Evonik Cyber
Classroom. Our partner schools around the world use this
virtual classroom to make scientific relationships clearer with
the aid of 3D technology. In 2016, we upgraded and improved
the technical basis for internet access to the content, which is
available in ten languages. In addition, Evonik presented the
Cyber Classroom at Nauka 0 +, the Russian science festival
for children and young people in Moscow, which attracted
around 800,000 visitors. In 2017, the Cyber Classroom will
be introduced at various partner schools in China.
In the USA, Evonik supported the You Be The Chemist
program run by the Chemical Educational Foundation (CEF),
which is also aimed at school kids. In Belgium, we supported
the Brainshake 2016 knowledge quiz organized by Antwerp
universities and colleges.

Social projects

Evonik’s social commitment has two main focuses. On the
one hand, we want to be a reliable partner and good neighbor for the communities around our sites. We therefore get
involved with schools and local welfare projects. In the state of
Louisiana (USA), where Evonik has two production facilities,
we supported the victims of a catastrophic flood that left
many people homeless in 2016. Alongside all of this, Evonik
has set up a large number of projects around the world to
improve environmental quality around our sites. For example,
employees at our Map Ta Phut site in Thailand regularly help
clean local beaches.
Our activities also include projects with broad social relevance. Since 2016 Evonik has provided support for the extension and conversion of the Jewish Museum in Frankfurt
(­Germany). In parallel with this, collaboration with the Jewish
museums in Berlin and Frankfurt was stepped up. That
included presenting a book about Jewish soccer clubs in the
Nazi era, and readings by actors Johanna Wokalek and Joachim
Król from the “Ma’asse” book. We also agreed free tours of
both museums for fans of the Borussia Dortmund soccer
team. In this way, we support our sponsorship partner’s work
to counter right-wing radicalism.

The arts

Evonik fosters diversity in society through a wide range of
cultural projects. In 2016, we agreed a five-year partnership
with the conductor Thomas Hengelbrock and the Balthasar-­
Neumann choir and ensemble. Moreover, we donated a
statue of the composer Ludwig van Beethoven by the sculptor
Markus Lüpertz to Singapore. We also continued our traditional partnerships, for example with the Ruhr Festival in
Recklinghausen, the Küppersmühle museum in Duisburg, and
the intonations chamber music festival in Berlin. In addition,
we supported the film of Ralf Rothmann’s novel “Young
Light”.

Sport

In the spirit of good neighborly relations, Evonik promotes
sport at many of its sites around the world. One example is
the Evonik Sportpark in Marl (Germany), which was opened
in 2016. This modern sports complex is used by local clubs as
well as by company employees who take advantage of our
sports and health promotion programs.
As a sponsor of the German professional soccer club
Borussia Dortmund, we are particularly interested in projects
that combine sports and culture. In the light of this, we supported the production of the cinema documentary “You’ll
never walk alone”, which looks at the Jewish cultural history
behind this well-known soccer anthem.

Evonik Foundation
The Evonik Foundation is based in Essen (Germany). Established in 2009 as the successor to the former Degussa
­Foundation, its roots lie in providing support for the development of young scientists. The Evonik Foundation’s statutes
were extended in September 2015 and it can now support
charitable and church-related undertakings as well as not-forprofit activities.
One focus of the Evonik Foundation is granting scholarships for scientific research, especially doctoral degrees. Its
scholarships have an excellent reputation—especially because
they foster a close link between scientific theory and practice.
Elements include regular meetings for scholarship students,
scientific colloquia, and a mentoring program. In 2016, the
Evonik Foundation supported 18 particularly gifted and committed science students at 16 universities in Germany and in
collaboration with foreign universities.

HOW WE IMPLEMENT SUSTAINABILITY

SUSTAINABILITY IN 2016

Society

Another key project is the Germany Scholarship program.
The Evonik Foundation finances 200 scholarships, making it
one of the biggest sponsors of this program, which was initiated by the German Ministry of Education and Research.
Scholarships are awarded to support students who demonstrate strong social commitment as well as a good academic
record.
In addition, the Evonik Foundation awards scholarships
specifically to refugees in cooperation with the Ruhr University
in Bochum (RUB). This program targets young men and
women who wish to embark on a degree course in engineering,
science or business studies at RUB, or to continue a course
they had started in their home country. They receive monthly
financial support to enable them to obtain a bachelor's or
master’s degree. The Evonik Foundation also pays their social
security contributions and the cost of educational materials.
This is the first project of its kind in Germany.
The Evonik Foundation is also involved in a wide range of
other integration projects for refugees. With the support of
Evonik’s sites, the Evonik Foundation has so far reached out
to more than 13,000 refugees through some 90 projects.
Examples include funding to upgrade the outdoor area at
a housing facility for asylum seekers in Haltern am See
(­Germany). Thanks to the project, the area has been turned
into a versatile space that fosters communication and encounters between residents and the local community. In Hanau
(Germany), the Evonik Foundation supports the OASE café,
which was opened at the end of 2015 as a meeting point for
refugees and local inhabitants. In December 2016 the project
was presented with the Hanau municipality’s integration

1	Further

award. The variety of the projects for refugees shows what
successful integration in schools, universities, companies, and
the local community can look like.1
Enthusiasm and enjoyment of science can be awakened in
children at elementary school. Some years ago, the Evonik
Foundation therefore launched Professor Proto’s Fantastic
Institute in collaboration with scholarship students. This webbased learning platform has been developed constantly since
then. Professor Proto provides insights into the fascinating
world of chemistry through exciting experiments and videos.
Since 2016, the Evonik Foundation also provided support
for KEMIE, a project organized by RUB where parents and
children experience chemistry together. The aim is to give
children in the third to sixth grades an early introduction to
science. The children visit RUB once a month with one of their
parents and perform experiments under the professional
guidance of educational specialists.
In collaboration with Utho Ngathi Südliches Afrika e. V., a
not-for-profit organization based in Siegen (Germany) and
Johannesburg (South Africa), the Evonik Foundation encourages the integration of young people with disabilities in
southern Africa. Utho Ngathi works with the young people,
their families and village communities to improve their quality
of life. The focus is on economic self-help projects. One of
Utho Ngathi’s key projects is building and operating an inclusive
chicken farm in Macubeni (South Africa).

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016

EVONIK INDUSTRIES

About this report
Evonik’s Sustainability Report 2016

This is the ninth full Sustainability Report published by
Evonik. The report covers the 2016 fiscal year (January 1 to
December 31, 2016), except where otherwise indicated, and
is based on Evonik’s organizational structure in 2016. The aim
is to give our customers, employees, owners and the general
public an insight into how we run our business and live our
values. The Sustainability Report supplements the ecological
and societal aspects included in the Annual Report 2016. The
next Sustainability Report will be published in 2018.

Method
G4-23

G4-22

In this report on 2016, we have once again applied the GRI
G4 Guidelines in accordance with the “core” option. Further,
this report takes account of the ten principles of the UN
Global Compact.
We validated our materiality analysis in 2016 and confirmed its relevance. The scope and depth of this Sustainability
Report are aligned even more systematically to materiality
than in the past. The reporting structure is therefore consistently
based on the six sustainability areas of action derived from
our materiality analysis, which form the basis of our sustainability activities: “strategy and growth”, “governance and
compliance”, “employees”, “value chain and products”, “the
environment”, and “safety”. In view of the increasing significance of governance and compliance, the associated content
has been combined in a separate chapter, supplemented
among other things by comments on sustainability-related
opportunities and risks. These comments supplement the
information in the opportunity and risk report in Evonik’s
Annual Report 2016. Reporting on other, less material elements
has been streamlined. Information about our activities along
the value chain and our products, which was previously
spread throughout the report, is now bundled in a separate
chapter.
The recommendations made in the independent practitioner’s limited assurance report on the Sustainability Report
2015 have been taken up in the structure of our corporate
responsibility steering bodies and optimization of our stakeholder management. Each chapter contains a clearer outline
of our management approach and highlights the targets we
have set. The most important performance indicators for our

six areas of action are summarized in a new overview (“Sustainability indicators for the Evonik Group”), supplemented
by tables showing the attainment of our objectives in 2016 and
our targets for the future (see inside front cover and page 83).
In addition, this report contains more tables and charts than
the previous edition in order to enhance the information content and the transparency of our sustainability activities.
This Sustainability Report is also Evonik’s progress report
for the UN Global Compact.

Scope of reporting, limits and data capture

Our data cover the relevant companies worldwide that were
included in the scope of consolidation for the consolidated
financial statements of Evonik Industries AG for the period
from January 1 through December 31, 2016. The consolidated
financial statements are prepared in accordance with the
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Alongside Evonik Industries AG, they include all material German
and foreign subsidiaries directly or indirectly controlled by
Evonik Industries AG. Joint operations are included on a pro rata
basis. Material associates and joint ventures are recognized at
equity if we are able to exert a significant influence. Initial
consolidation or deconsolidation takes place as of the date on
which the company gains or loses its controlling influence.
In fiscal 2016 the Evonik Group comprised 45 German and
110 foreign companies. Reporting focuses on the continuing
operations. Relevant data on personnel and social indicators
are based largely on the global SAP HR information system. For
supplementary information, we use the HR information
­collector application (SAP notes management). The focus of
our reporting and thus limits of our report are derived principally from the sustainability topics derived from our materiality
analysis and the associated six areas of action.
The ecological data for our specialty chemicals business in
2016 comprise emissions and consumption at 89 production
sites in 25 countries and thus cover over 95 percent of total
output. Occupational safety data include other small sites
(mainly administration), so the data here cover 134 locations
in 42 countries. The data were ­compiled using sustainability
reporting software developed specifically for this purpose
(SuRe 2.0), which was technically updated and successfully
introduced in 2016. The reporting segments reflect Group
and segment interests in order to provide a detailed reflection
of production activities. In some cases, data are reported at
plant level to ensure this.

HOW WE IMPLEMENT SUSTAINABILITY

All reporting units are clearly coded to allocate them to organizational and business entities and geographical region. This
allows consolidation at management and legal entity level as
well as a detailed regional analysis of the data. The ecological
data are updated annually without taking changes in the
Group into account. The prior-year figures are not adjusted for
changes in the portfolio of companies consolidated. The figures
for each company are included in full, without adjustment to
reflect Evonik’s stake in them.
The key data in this report are rounded in line with standard commercial practice. In some cases, this may mean that
individual values do not add up exactly to the totals given and
percentages are not an exact reflection of the values stated.
This report is published in English and German and is posted
on Evonik’s website. To ensure it is up-to-date, we have
included all relevant data available to us as of the editorial
deadline on February 28, 2017.

Major divestments/acquisitions of relevance for
ESH in 2016
G4-22
G4-23

On March 3, 2016 Evonik acquired all shares in MedPalett AS
(MedPalett), Sandnes (Norway) from Biolink Group AS,
Sandnes (Norway). Medpalett specializes in food ingredients
containing anthocyanins, which are known for their natural
antioxidant properties.
On July 4, 2016 Evonik acquired the probiotics business of
NOREL S.A. (NOREL), Madrid (Spain), one of the world’s
leading suppliers of feed additives, through an asset deal. The
acquisition comprises the existing probiotics product portfolio
and the production site in León (Spain). This acquisition positions Evonik as an innovative solution provider in the field of
antibiotic-free animal nutrition.
Effective August 31, 2016, Evonik acquired the business of
biotech company Transferra Nanosciences Inc. (Transferra),
Burnaby (Canada) through an asset deal. Transferra is a contract
development and manufacturing organization that uses its
expertise in liposomal drug delivery systems to provide both
products and services to biotech companies for the development of pharmaceuticals. This acquisition enables Evonik to
extend the portfolio of its Health Care Business Line in the
area of parenteral drug formulation.
These acquisitions have been integrated into the Nutrition
& Care segment. They also had an impact on product streams,
and the emissions and consumption data.

SUSTAINABILITY IN 2016

ANNEX

Acquisitions, capacity expansions and new facilities are recognized as soon as possible. However, if the facilities are only
acquired at the end of a fiscal year or new plants have not yet
come into service or are at an early stage of start-up, inclusion
of environmental aspects in the Sustainability Report can
normally only start in the following year.

Updated data

Our ESH data are constantly checked by a large number of
internal and external audits. In addition, large amounts of
data have to be reported to national authorities. In most cases,
their submission and approval dates are later than the internal
deadline for Evonik’s ESH data. To enhance efficiency, we
endeavor to use a single set of data for both internal and
external reporting. Since internal and external audit findings
are examined for any possible change in ESH indicators, our
databases are naturally subject to dynamic change. If such
adjustments reveal discrepancies of more than 3 percent
compared with published data for prior periods, (principle of
materiality), the data are corrected and indicated accordingly.
If the English version of this report differs from the German
version, the statements and phrasing of the original German
shall prevail.

G4-22

External review

The chapters titled “Strategy and growth”, “Governance and
compliance”, “Employees”, “Value chain and products”, “The
environment” and “Safety” were subject to a limited assurance
review by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschafts­
prüfungsgesellschaft (indicated by ). The independent practitioner’s limited assurance report is printed on page 100.

Ratio of the annual total

highest-paid individual to the
median annual total compensation
for all employees

Evonik believes it is very
­important to offer specialists
and executives market-oriented
and performance-related
­salaries based on uniform global
evaluation criteria. Remuneration
is therefore based on objective
criteria such as the required
knowledge and skills, and
­performance. Personal characteristics do not have any impact.
We do not consider this to
be a relevant indicator to
assess the appropriateness of
our ­remuneration systems and
therefore do not report it.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016

EVONIK INDUSTRIES

Independent Practitioner’s
Limited Assurance Report 1
To Evonik Industries AG, Essen

We have been engaged to perform a limited assurance
engagement on the sections marked with
in the Sustainability Report of Evonik Industries AG, Essen (hereafter the
“Company”) for the period from 1 January to 31 December
2016 (hereafter the “Sustainability Report”).2

Management’s Responsibility

Company’s Management is responsible for the preparation
and presentation of the Sustainability Report in accordance
with the criteria as set out in the G4 Sustainability Reporting
Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) (hereafter
the “GRI-Criteria”) and for the selection of the information to
be assessed.
This responsibility includes the selection and application
of appropriate methods to prepare the Sustainability Report
as well as the use of assumptions and estimates for individual
sustainability disclosures which are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, the responsibility includes designing,
implementing and maintaining systems and processes relevant
for the preparation of the Sustainability Report, which is free
of material misstatements due to intentional or unintentional
errors.

Audit Firm’s Independence and Quality Control

We have complied with the German professional provisions
regarding independence as well as other ethical requirements.
The audit firm applies the national legal requirements and
professional standards – in particular the Professional Code
for German Public Auditors and German Chartered Auditors
(“Berufssatzung für Wirtschaftsprüfer und vereidigte Buchprüfer“: “BS WP/vBP”) as well as the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (“Institute of Public Auditors in Germany; IDW”):
Requirements to quality control for audit firms (“Entwurf

1	Our

eines IdW Qualitätssicherungsstandards 1 „Anforderungen
an die Qualitätssicherung in der Wirtschaftsprüferpraxis”
(IdW EQS 1)”) – and accordingly maintains a comprehensive
system of quality control including documented policies and
procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements,
professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory
requirements.

Practitioner’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the sections
marked with
in the Sustainability Report based on our
work performed.
Within the scope of our engagement we did not perform
an audit on external sources of information or expert opinions,
referred to in the Sustainability Report.
We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000
(Revised): “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or
Reviews of Historical Financial Information” published by
IAASB. This Standard requires that we plan and perform the
assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance whether
any matters have come to our attention that cause us to
believe that the sections marked with
in the Sustainability
Report has not been prepared, in all material respects, in
accordance with the GRI-Criteria.
In a limited assurance engagement the evidence-gathering
procedures are more limited than for a reasonable assurance
engagement and therefore significantly less assurance is
obtained than in a reasonable assurance engagement. The
procedures selected depend on the practitioner’s judgement.
This includes the assessment of the risks of material misstatements of the information marked with
in the Sustainability
Report with regard to the GRI-Criteria.

HOW WE IMPLEMENT SUSTAINABILITY

SUSTAINABILITY IN 2016

Within the scope of our work we performed amongst others
the following procedures:
• Obtaining an understanding of the structure of the sustainability organization and of the stakeholder engagement;
•	Inquiries of personnel involved in the preparation of the
Report regarding the preparation process, the underlying
internal control system and the Sustainability Report sections marked with
;
•	Analytical procedures on selected information of the
­Sustainability Report;
•	Comparison of selected sustainability information with
corresponding data in the consolidated financial statements
and in the group management report;
•	Assessment of the presentation of selected sustainability
information in the Report regarding the sustainability performance;
•	Performance of site visits or web conferences as part of
the inspection of processes for collecting, analyzing and
aggregating selected data at the corporate headquarters in
Essen, as well as at selected sites or group companies in
Darmstadt (Germany), Marl (Germany), Singapore,
Bekasi (Indonesia) and Gibbons (Canada);
•	Gaining further evidence for selected data of the Sustainability Report due to inspection of internal documents,
contracts and invoices/reports from external service
­providers.

Emphasis of Matter – Recommendations

Conclusion

Hendrik Fink
ppa. Dr. Patrick Albrecht
Wirtschaftsprüfer
(German Public Auditor)

Based on our limited assurance engagement, nothing has
come to our attention that causes us to believe that the
­sustainability information marked with
in the Sustainability
Report of the Company for the period from 1 January to
31 December 2016 has not been prepared, in all material
respects, in accordance with the GRI-Criteria.

ANNEX

Without qualifying our conclusion above, we make the
­following recommendations for the further development of
the Company’s sustainability management and sustainability
reporting:
•	Further development of management approach and
reporting for the material sustainability issues, e. g. by
consistently connecting those KPIs with (ideally quantified)
targets as well as with measures for achieving the targets;
•	Further standardization and formalization of the reporting
process and the underlying internal control system for
sustainability information.

Glossary
Audit

Corporate governance

Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)

Diversity

An audit is an investigation used to check that specific products,
sites and/or processes meet certain specified criteria. Audits may
be performed by internal specialists or external auditors, especially if validation in compliance with official standards is required.

The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) is a not-for-profit organization and is currently the world’s largest and most important
­initiative by the financial sector on climate change. It is currently
supported by more than 800 institutional investors with total
assets under management of over US$ 100 trillion. Companies
report data and information on CO2 emissions, climate risks and
reduction targets and strategies to the CDP on a voluntary basis
once a year. Investors use the data to derive a climate risk profile
for companies, which they then use in their investment decisions.

Chemie³

This is a joint initiative of the German Chemical Industry Association (VCI), the German Mining, Chemical and Energy Industrial
Union (IG BCE), and the German Chemical Industry Employers’
Federation (BAVC) to drive forward sustainable development.

CO2 equivalents (CO2eq)

Parameter used to compare the global warming potential of various different greenhouse gases. The reference basis is carbon
dioxide and the abbreviation is CO2eq.

Code of Responsible Conduct for Business

The six principles of the Code of Responsible Conduct for
­Business initiated by the Wittenberg Center for Global Ethics
obligate companies to generate profits without corruption,
exploitation and environmental damage.

Compliance

Compliance refers to all activities to ensure that the conduct of a
company, members of its governance bodies and its employees
respect all applicable mandatory standards such as legal provisions, statutory requirements and prohibitions, in-house policies
and voluntary undertakings.

Conflict minerals

The Dodd-Frank Act defines coltan, cassiterite, wolframite and
their derivatives (tantalum, tin, tungsten), and gold as conflict
minerals if they are used to finance armed conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighboring territories.

Corporate governance comprises all principles on the management
and supervision of a company. As an expression of good and
responsible management, it is therefore a central element in a
company’s management philosophy.

Evonik defines diversity as a balanced employee structure, not
just in terms of gender, but also in relation to specialist areas,
experience of different organizational units and functional areas,
a broad age range and various nationalities, in other words,
diversity across the board.

Dodd-Frank Act, Section 1502

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act (known as the Dodd-Frank Act for short) was adopted
in 2010. Its prime aim is regulation of the US financial market.
­Section 1502 contains disclosure and reporting requirements for
listed US companies on the use of certain minerals originating
from the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighboring states.

econsense – Forum for Sustainable Development of
­German Business

econsense is an association of leading German companies and
organizations that operate in the global arena. It promotes
­sustainable development and corporate social responsibility.

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)

The GRI is a global, network-based not-for-profit organization
based in Amsterdam. It publishes the world’s most commonly
used guidelines on sustainability reporting. The aim is to ensure
the comparability of the economic, ecological, social and societal
performance and impacts of reporting companies. This sustainability report has been prepared on the basis of the specifications
of the GRI G4 Guidelines in accordance with the “core” level.

Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol)

The Greenhouse Gas Protocol is regarded as the most widespread voluntary international standard for calculating and
­compiling data on greenhouse gas emissions from industry. It
was developed by the World Business Council for Sustainable
Development and the World Resources Institute.

International Labor Standards

The International Labour Organization (ILO) and its actions are
defined by four basic principles: freedom of association and the
right to collective bargaining, the elimination of forced labor, the
abandonment of child labor, and the elimination of discrimination
in respect of employment and occupation. These basic principles
are set out in eight conventions with the ILO. These are known
as the international labour standards.

HOW WE IMPLEMENT SUSTAINABILITY

SUSTAINABILITY IN 2016

Life cycle assessment

Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions

Low Carbon Technology Partnerships Initiative (LCTPi)

Stakeholders

A life cycle assessment comprises compiling and assessing the
inputs and outputs and potential environmental impact of a
product system during its life cycle, based on a standardized
international method (DIN EN ISO 14040/44). Alongside life
cycle assessments, Evonik performs life cycle-based analyses
with reduced scope to obtain information on specific environmental impacts (e. g., carbon footprints).

The LCTPi was set up by the World Business Council for
­Sustainable Development to accelerate the development of
low carbon technology solutions. It comprises more than
150 companies with 70 partners who are responding collaboratively to the c­ hallenges of climate change.

Materiality

The GRI G4 Guidelines center on the principle of materiality.
Companies should pay more attention to presenting the material
impacts of their business activities. To do this, they need to
identify their central areas of action using a systematic materiality
analysis. The goal is to evaluate the relevance of these topics
from the viewpoint of stakeholders and the company. A materiality matrix is derived from the expectations of both groups.

Megatrends

Megatrends are long-term, global societal developments which
companies can help to solve through their business activities.
They are far-reaching trends of strategic significance.

OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises

The guidelines issued by the Organisation for Economic
­Cooperation and Development (OECD) are government
­recommendations to multinational enterprises operating
in or from member states. They comprise principles and
­benchmarks for responsible corporate action, but are not
legally binding.

Responsible Care®

Responsible Care® is the global initiative of the chemical industry
to bring about a continuous improvement in environmental protection, health and safety. As well as complying with legislation
and other regulations, the industry cooperates with government
agencies and other stakeholders in various voluntary initiatives.

Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO)

The RSPO was established in 2004 at the initiative of the
WWF. Its aim is to encourage sustainable production of palm
oil and limit environmental damage. Members include non-­
governmental organizations, companies—such as Evonik—and
institutions.

ANNEX

To harmonize international reporting of greenhouse gas
­emissions in the corporate sector, emissions are allocated to
three categories (scopes): direct emissions from a company’s
own plants (Scope 1), indirect emissions from the purchase of
­secondary energy such as electricity and steam (Scope 2), and
emissions from upstream or downstream processes within the
supply chain (Scope 3).

Stakeholders are individuals or groups that have a legitimate
interest in the activities and decisions of a company or organization. They may be, for example, the company’s employees,
­customers, suppliers, people who live close to its production
facilities, non-governmental organizations, associations and the
media.

Sustainable Development Goals

In fall 2015 the United Nations published 17 global sustainable
development goals, to be achieved by 2030. They replace the
eight Millennium Development Goals, which expired in 2015.

Together for Sustainability (TfS)

TfS is an initiative established in 2011 by chemical companies
to drive forward transparency and sustainability in the supply
chain. Evonik was a founding member.

UN Global Compact

The United Nations Global Compact is a strategic initiative for
companies that undertake to align their business operations and
strategies with ten universally recognized principles relating
to human rights, labor standards, environmental protection and
fighting corruption. Companies that join the Global Compact give
an undertaking that they will report annually on their progress.

Vision 2050

The Vision 2050 of the World Business Council for Sustainable
Development describes the pathway to achieving a sustainable
world with around 9 billion people living well within the limits
of the planet by 2050. Companies play a key role in this.

World Business Council for Sustainable Development

The World Business Council for Sustainable Development
(WBCSD) is a CEO-led organization that aims to drive forward
sustainable development worldwide. More than 200 international
enterprises now belong to the WBCSD.
