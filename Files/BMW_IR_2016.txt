INTRODUCTION

PREFACE

Sustainable management
For us, sustainability is about shaping the future of the
BMW Group. In 2016, the company celebrated its 100th
centenary. This important milestone provided a unique
opportunity for us to look to the future and to present
our ideas for the mobility of tomorrow – with our four
Vision Vehicles.
We view sustainability – not just in our vehicles, but
throughout the entire value chain – as a basic require­
ment for tomorrow’s individual mobility and ensuring
its social acceptability.
We believe the only way to achieve success in the long
term is through sustainable action.
We remain committed to the principles of the United
Nations Global Compact and have systematically imple­
mented its Ten Principles at all locations worldwide
since 2001. Our sustainability strategy also supports the
­Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United
Nations in autumn 2015.
Sustainability has not just become a success factor for
business. It is increasingly a question of individual life­
style. A sustainable lifestyle is viewed as a personal en­
richment and represents a conscious decision for many
people worldwide. Today, emissions and the raw mater­
ials and other resources used in production are a con­
sideration in many customer purchases.

Chairman of BMW AG’s Board of Management

The BMW Group has therefore set itself ten long-term sus­
tainability goals encompassing the entire value chain.
Our vehicles with Efficient Dynamics technology, plug-­
in hybrid drivetrain or electric engine – combined with
innovative mobility services – lay the foundation for our
business success. Our production focuses on the efficient
use of resources, which helps the environment and lowers
costs. Our wide variety of different community, social and
cultural projects around the world also make an important
contribution to securing the company’s long-term reputation.
As we work to reduce the CO2 emissions of our vehicle
fleet, electromobility will play a significant role.
Our Strategy NUMBER ONE > NEXT underlines our strong
commitment to electrified drivetrains. We will be increas­
ing the share of electrified models across all brands and
model series. To date, we have already sold more than
100,000 electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. We now aim
to achieve this same figure in 2017 alone. In this way,
we are helping to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and
­improve air quality.
One of our tasks is to rethink urban mobility. For this rea­
son, our experts reached out to stakeholders in different
cities around the globe last year to discuss specific chal­
lenges and possible solutions. Input from our stakehold­
ers is constantly fed into our strategy process.

We are responding to the individual mobility requirements
of people in cities with innovative solutions, like our
DriveNow and ReachNow car-sharing services. These of­
ferings will be expanded as part of Strategy NUMBER
ONE > NEXT.
For the BMW Group, this is “year one” after the centenary.
We aim to succeed with our business model for premium
mobility and premium services in the future. Sustainabil­
ity is therefore an integral part of our thinking and actions.
This approach is in line with our values of trust, openness,
appreciation, responsibility and transparency. It is an­
chored in our Strategy NUMBER ONE > NEXT and re­
flected in our efficient value creation and emotional prod­
ucts – in the interests of our customers, all our associates
and our partners in society and business around the world.

Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG

OUR VISION

We unveiled the new corporate Strategy NUMBER ONE >
NEXT in 2016 in order to set the course for a successful
future. The consistent integration of sustainability in our
strategy is made visible by the activities along the value
chain described in this report – ranging from the sustainability challenges in the procurement process to the design of our products through to the establishment of new
business areas, with sustainability integrated into the relevant business model.

The BMW Group is the world’s most successful and sustainable premium provider of individual mobility.

In order to make sure we are fit for the future, we continu­
ously integrate sustainability into our business model and
consolidate this integration. We see global sustainability
chal­lenges as an opportunity to develop innovative products and services. In this way, sustainability makes a
long-­term contribution to the business success of the
BMW Group. Our innovations are not only developed to
enhance the benefits of our customers – we also want them
to have a positive impact on society and the environment.

Taking social and environmental responsibility for all we
do is an integral part of how we perceive ourselves as a
company. We are convinced that the lasting economic success of any enterprise in today’s world is based increasingly on acting responsibly and ensuring social acceptance.
We want to achieve a clear competitive advantage in the
long term with efficient and resource-friendly production
processes and state-of-the-art solutions for sustainable individual mobility for our customers. For this reason, sustainability is a key component of our corporate Strategy
NUMBER ONE > NEXT.

Sustainability is a key component of the strategic approach
to Strategy NUMBER ONE > NEXT and makes an important contribution towards our competitive edge. The sus­
tain­ability strategy is consistent with the corporate strategy and pursues the thorough integration of sustainability.
The development of our sustainability strategy is based on
the identification of key issues. The results of this materiality analysis are shown in the materiality matrix •. On this
basis, we regularly review our strategic aim as well as our
sustainability targets and measures.
This report expands on the sustainability strategy. The report is structured along the long-term sustainability goals
of the BMW Group. The weighting of topics is based on the
materiality analysis.

Identifying key issues

• see
infobox on
page 15

• see
figure 1.02

• see
infobox on
page 14

In order to identify in good time which topics may bring
opportunities and risks to our business today or in the future, and to focus our activities accordingly, we use an
“environmental radar” to scan external trends on an ongoing basis. In doing so, we observe both the public discourse and the political agenda, for example the World
Climate Conference • and the Sustainable Development
Goals •. In addition, we regularly carry out a materiality
analysis in order to identify relevant issues. To do this,
we analyse the importance of current sustainability topics,
both from the perspective of different stakeholder groups
as well as that of the company. The changes picked up by
the environmental radar form the basis for identifying
topics and validating the results of the materiality process.

The analysis was accompanied by an internal document
analysis of the sustainability context. To get an update
from an internal perspective, we carried out a materiality
workshop and prioritised relevant sustainability topics
from the perspective of the BMW Group. The relevant corporate areas (including strategy departments of the div­
isions) as well as corresponding executives subsequently
validated the materiality matrix. • GRI G4-18

Materiality analysis
In 2015, a survey was carried out among internal experts,
and telephone interviews were held with 13 representative
stakeholders as part of the review process to get an update
on how the topics are seen from an external perspective.
Customers, suppliers, investors, authorities, NGOs and scientists from different regions of the world were among
the interviewees. In addition, the topics were reviewed by
internal BMW Group experts who are in regular contact
with the main stakeholders. The list of topics for evalu­
ation was updated based on the BMW Group’s list of topics
from 2013, the stakeholder dialogues, the • GRI G4 Guidelines,
the • UN Global Compact, the main topics of the • Sustainability
Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the • UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).

The review process resulted in the revised materiality mat­
rix. Topics that both stakeholders and the BMW Group considered highly material were rated in the matrix as highly
relevant. Furthermore, topics considered to be among the
three most important by one of the stakeholder groups
surveyed were also included. These additionally included
topics are marked in the materiality matrix with an asterisk. All in all, the analysis identified 19 topics as highly
material •. • GRI G4-19, GRI G4-26, GRI G4-27 These topics were also
valid in 2016. Selected topics from this list were discussed
in dialogue with our stakeholders •.

Our vision of being the most successful and sustainable
premium provider of individual mobility sets out the
framework for our goals and measures: the BMW Group
integrates sustainability along the entire value chain and
into all basic processes – thus creating added value for the
company, the environment and society. • GRI G4-14
Aside from our ten long-term goals, we continuously address the existing sustainability issues and challenges that
are topics of much discussion among the general public.
Some examples of this would be our positions on the global

Sustainability goals of the BMW Group
­contribute to Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs)
In autumn 2015, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted
the • Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs are at the
core of the 2030 Agenda, a global action plan with the aim of shaping
economic progress in an ecologically compatible manner and in accordance with social equity. The BMW Group welcomes the SDGs and
is committed to supporting the goals formulated within them as part of
its sustainability strategy, with a focus on its value chain.
We are convinced that companies, governments and other organisations
can make a positive contribution towards the attainment of the SDGs.

Further key indicators
GRI G4 Content Index
Appendix

On the basis of our materiality matrix in 2016, we have analysed which
SDGs are a priority for the BMW Group. The following Sustainable
­Development Goals currently have the highest level of priority in our
strategic orientation: SDG 13 – Climate Action, SDG 11 – Sustainable
­Cities and Communities and SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption and

regulation of CO2 and contaminants • and on positive
framework conditions for electromobility •. We also consider the results of our materiality analysis in the con­tinued
development of the sustainability goals. The 2015 materiality analysis confirmed that we are covering the relevant
topics with our long-term sustainability goals. We will consider new topics in the matrix such as “autonomous driving”
more closely in future. The challenge is to master the ability to keep long-term goals in focus, while new topics increasingly gain more relevance.

Below are some selected examples:
– SDG 13 – Climate Action: we continuously reduce the CO2 emissions
of our vehicle fleet. Electromobility is an essential component of our
CO2 strategy. We continuously increase the proportion of electrified
drive systems in our model range and therefore not only make a
contribution towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions,
but also towards improved air quality in urban areas.
– SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities: with our integrated
mobility services, we want to change mobility trends in selected
metropolitan areas in a sustainable way. We provide innovative solutions to improve urban mobility. These include our car-sharing
services DriveNow and ReachNow, which increasingly include electric vehicles, as well as the electric scooter especially designed for
commuter traffic in cities. Furthermore, we specifically promote the
development of other innovations in the context of urban mobility,
for example as part of the new accelerator URBAN-X which supports
young companies with solutions for large cities.
– SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production: we continuously reduce CO2 emissions and resource usage per vehicle produced. In supplying our locations worldwide, we are increasingly
­focusing on renewable energy, among other things, and are also
trying to increase resource efficiency with our supplier network.

BMW Group and the Climate Conference
in Marrakech

We integrate sustainability into our corporate strategy,
business model and value chain at all levels to ensure success in the long term, extending from the design of ve­
hicles and services across the supply chain, production and
responsibility for our employees, the use of products and
services by our customers, through to recycling of vehicles.
Moreover, sustainability is deeply embedded in our com­
pany culture. One of our values is taking responsibility –
for ourselves, for others, for the company and for society.
In light of this, a group of employees founded the
BMW Group Connected Culture Club, a voluntary initiative to shape the company culture of the BMW Group in a
sustainable way, through their own efforts.

The 22nd UN Climate Change Conference took place in Marrakech in
November 2016. At the last climate summit in Paris, 195 countries
committed to operating without a negative effect on the climate in the
second half of this century.
Following this success, the task in Marrakech was to bring the agreements to life. To this end, a schedule for the implementation of the Paris
Agreement was worked out in the course of the conference. Developed
and developing countries formed a partnership to foster more climate
protection.
The BMW Group actively participated in numerous discussions and side
events during COP22 (COP, Conference of the Parties). High-level company representatives discussed challenges and possible solutions for
urban mobility in the Sustainable Innovation Forum 2016. The BMW Group
has been contributing to world climate conferences with its expertise
since 1992. It will also advocate the development of sustainable mobility across the globe in the future.

Examples of integrating sustainability
into the company
The following sections and chapters will provide some examples that describe in more detail how sustainability contributes towards the business success of the BMW Group.

Investments in innovative mobility concepts made
a considerable contribution towards the c­ ompany’s
business success in 2016. One indicator that this is
the case is that 25,528 BMW i3 and 3,752 BMW i8 vehicles were sold in the year under report. A total of
100,000 electric vehicles (hybrid electric and plug-in
vehicles) were sold between 2013 and 2016. At the
end of 2016, just over 853,000 customers (2015: 579,000)
were registered with our car-sharing services

DriveNow (worldwide) and ReachNow (in the USA) –
an increase of around 47 %. With these products and
solutions, the BMW Group also puts our fleet customers in a better position to reach their CO2 targets •.
– Reducing costs through resource efficiency
Efficient use of resources reduces risks that can be
generated by availability bottlenecks and fluctuations
in price. In addition, it makes a direct contribution
towards the result by reducing costs, while at the same
time being good for the environment. Between 2006
and 2016, we were able to significantly reduce energy
and water consumption, waste and VOC emissions
per vehicle produced in the BMW Group’s worldwide
production network. Although additional costs totalling € 2.8 million were generated due to a slight
increase in energy and water consumption during
the reporting period, we have achieved cost savings
of € 155.3 million since 2006 •.
– Remaining competitive through
sustainable HR policies
In 2016, the BMW Group was able to further consolidate its position as one of the most attractive employers
worldwide. Our leading role in the area of sustain­
ability ensures that our employees are satisfied and
boosts their identification with the company and its
products. The resulting low attrition rate enables us to
keep HR recruitment costs low. In addition, it is our
experience that a satisfied workforce leads to higher
levels of productivity •.

Involving employees and
fostering innovation
• see
chapter 2

The BMW Group encourages employees to realise their own ideas and
develop internal innovations. As part of the Innovationswerk accelerator programme, they get the chance to generate new products, services
and business models. Employees can introduce their ideas via a crowdsourcing platform and have cross-functional discussions. The programme
promotes teambuilding in order to create internal start-ups.
Promising teams are supported in the Innovationswerk accelerator programme for twelve weeks, each with a trainer, mentors as well as internal and external experts on start-up strategies. The accelerator offers
employees the chance to make their own ideas a reality. Furthermore,
future executives will be trained to take agile approaches in order to
work more innovatively. In 2016, the Innovationswerk accelerator streamlined seven teams and their ideas and contributed towards the development of an “agile innovation culture” in the BMW Group.

What challenges does an automotive company with
a global reach have to face in today’s world?
Globalisation has been the defining trend for the global
economy in recent decades. Now, it seems the political
conditions underlying economic activity are harder to
predict, which demands huge flexibility on the part of
companies operating at a global level. And it has become
all the more important for them to stay on track with
regard to one of the most important challenges, regardless of the passage of time: climate change. If global
­warming is to be kept to less than 2 °C higher than preindustrial levels, as has now been set down in law,
transportation will have to be decarbonised in future.
Plainly and simply, this means that automotive companies
must realign their business models. Zero-emission
vehicles will be the only way to remain competitive in
future, together with mobility services in particular.
The yardstick will be the ability to offer climate-neutral
kilometres as a service. The privately owned car as a
product will become less important, at least in cities.
In your view, why must carmakers focus on
“sustainable mobility” for the long term?
Sustainable mobility can mean only one thing: respecting the non-negotiable limits that are imposed on our
mobility and traffic behaviours by the earth’s ability to
cope. Most industrialised countries exceed these ­limits,
partly because combustion engines that rely on fossil
fuels are themselves not sustainable. Vehicles will use

different operating systems in future, making use of
green electricity either directly or indirectly. It’s possible
that different technological options will prove beneficial
in different segments of the transport market, but as
things stand, those who choose not to go along with the
trend toward zero emissions will find themselves, their
sharehold­ers and their employees in serious difficulties.
The competition never sleeps.
How do you feel the BMW Group is placed to deal with
these challenges?
The future itself will be less challenging than the process
of getting there. Just like other carmakers, BMW must
rely on using today’s profits to develop tomorrow’s mobility services and products. While the strategy may be
clear, it requires time, and there is always the risk of losing
ground. The competition – in China or California, say –
gets its funding for investment in R&D not from ongoing
business but from the financial market; in some respects,
that gives them a structural advantage, since limitations
on how fast we can act make it harder for us to produce
the innovations we need to compete for the markets of
the future.

 MISSIONS OF CO2
AND POLLUTANTS

The BMW Group is addressing the challenge of reducing
CO2 and pollutant emissions in order to protect the climate and air quality. Our portfolio’s move towards lower-­
emission, more fuel-efficient vehicles is in line with the
wishes of many of our customers. Our customers in turn
base their purchasing decisions, among other things, on
financial and non-financial government incentives – for
example motor vehicle taxes as well as control and facilitation of traffic volume.

Climate change and the burdens placed on air quality, es‑
pecially in cities, are some of the key challenges we face as
a carmaker. Our range of efficiency technologies represents
the first and currently most effective contribution towards
re­ducing emissions of CO2 and pollutants. We pursue our
reduction targets from the product development stage on‑
wards. • GRI G4-EC2

Environmental and societal challenges are also reflected in
changing mobility patterns. Car-sharing and/or ride-sharing models, for example, as well as the use of inter-modal
transport, are becoming increasingly popular worldwide,
especially in large cities.

The life cycle of our products includes the development of
vehicles and services, the supply chain, production and
responsibility towards our employees, customers as users
of our products and services, and vehicle recyc­l ing. •.
The environmental and societal impact a vehicle has during its life cycle is primarily determined during the development phase. Some decisive influencing factors are the
choice of material, production technologies, supplier selec­
tion, drivetrain types as well as recyclability of the vehicle’s
components. Challenging sustainability goals are therefore
just as much part of the development process of the vehicle
as, for example, cost or weight criteria.

• see
chapter 2.2

Life Cycle Engineering helps us integrate environmental
aspects into the design and development of our products.
And we carry out holistic assessments to facilitate this pro­
cess, aiming to achieve a substantial improvement from
one vehicle generation to the next. We manage the im­
plementation of the goals and evaluation of progress by
apply­ing the Life Cycle Assessment in accordance with
ISO 14040/44. In line with our principle of Design for Recycling, we create our vehicles in such a way that their
­components can largely be reused or recycled efficiently
throughout the life cycle. One example would be the 25 %
improvement in the environmental footprint of the current BMW 7 Series model compared to its predecessor.
This approach has been implemented most consistently
in our BMW i products •.

Saving fuel and reducing emissions through
efficient dynamics technologies
In March 2007, we started to integrate our Efficient Dynamics technologies, and today they are features of almost all
of our vehicles. These include efficient engines and gearboxes, optimised aerodynamics (air flap control, air curtain /breather, Aero wheel rims), intelligent energy management, light-weight design and tyres with reduced rolling
resistance. Additional efficiency potential has also steadily
been tapped through the early implementation of energy
recovery in low-voltage vehicle electricity systems, Active
Coasting, and uncoupling of the engine from the gearbox
when not in use. In 2007, the BMW Group was one of the
first carmakers to roll out the Auto Start Stop function on
a broad basis. We also introduced at an early stage the
Active Coasting function, in which the vehicle is delayed
according to the resistance level, made possible by the Proactive Driving Assistant in 2012 and later augmented with
Speed Limit Assist. Starting with the new BMW 5 Series,
the BMW Group is offering an improved smart Auto Start

Stop function that uses environmental sensors to avoid inefficient and uncomfortably brief stops. In the next few
years, 12 V systems in smaller vehicles and 48 V systems
in medium and larger vehicles will increase the recovery
and coasting potential through a more efficient electrical
system to achieve a CO2 reduction of 5 – 7 %.
Additional contributions are made by our Connectivity Ser­
vices. They identify the fastest and most efficient routes,
simplifying the search for a parking place, for example – an
activity that currently still accounts for about 30 % of city
traffic.
To complement our resource efficiency solutions, we have
expanded our product portfolio to include electric vehicles.
In addition to the i3 that has been available since 2013 and
the i8 model, introduced soon after in 2014, iPerformance
models have been available since 2015 with plug-in hybrid
drivetrains for the 2 Series, 3 Series, 7 Series and the X5.

The BMW Group reduced CO2 emissions of its newly sold
vehicles in Europe by around 41 % between 1995 and 2016.
Our European vehicle fleet (EU -28) had an average fuel
consumption of 4.6 l of diesel /100 km or 5.6 l of petrol per
100 km and average CO2 emissions of 124 g /km (internal
calculation). Our goal is to reduce CO2 emissions by at least
50 % between 1995 and 2020. These calculations are based
on the specifications and assumptions of the New European Driving Cycle, before the introduction of which the
calculations were based on the ACEA self-commitment
(European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association).

Comprehensive reduction in pollutant emissions
As well as reducing the carbon emissions of our cars, we
are constantly working to bring down other emissions. The
Euro 6 standards call for a further reduction in nitrogen
oxide levels for diesel vehicles (NO X emissions). We apply
tailored solutions to reduce emissions in accordance with
the specific requirements of the vehicles, engines and respective markets. Depending on the vehicle concept, we
use the maintenance-free NO X catalytic converter or Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) using urea (also known as
AdBlue) or a combination of both systems.
In addition to the potential savings generated by Efficient
Dynamics Technologies, the specific fuel consumption and
the resulting CO2 and pollutant emissions depend on how
the individual driver uses the vehicle (driving style, capacity utilisation, fuel quality).

In 2016, 28 of the vehicles we sold had maximum CO2 emissions of 100 g / km. This means that we have similar fuel
consumption and CO2 emissions to a number of other large
carmakers in Europe. The average fleet CO2 emissions per
kilometre worldwide decreased in 2016 by 2 % to 144 g
CO2 / km (2015: 147 g CO2 / km). Average CO2 emissions in
the USA were 173 g CO2 /km (internal BMW calculation •)
and 164 g CO2 / km in China. The regional differences in
fleet use are a result of differing consumer behaviour,
which is in turn due to a variety of factors. These include
differing tax situations for different types of vehicle engines, as well as local consumer preferences for diesel vehicles or specific types of vehicles such as SUVs (Sport
Utility Vehicles). • GRI G4-EN19
The drop in fuel prices and the accompanying changes in
customer demand will present some new challenges with
regard to achieving the 2020 fleet targets.
Another factor influencing purchasing decisions is motor
vehicle taxes, which differ greatly from country to country.
Changes in taxation, for example for diesel fuels or diesel
vehicles (since 2016 in France for example) can lead in the
long term to fewer diesel vehicles in the fleet mix. This will
in turn negatively impact average CO2 emissions.

Pollutant emissions of our vehicles
To receive type approval and vehicle registration, vehicles
must comply with the latest pollutant regulations. The legal
requirements (limits for individual pollutant elements) are
different according to region, e. g. EU, China and USA and
must generally be fulfilled regardless of vehicle model. At
the beginning of the 1990s, the first cycle-based emissions
laws were passed in the EU. Since then, the limits for nitrogen oxide (NO X) and particulate matter (PM), both for
diesel and petrol-fuelled vehicles, have become increasingly stringent •.

ongoing criticism of the automotive industry, especially in Europe and
the USA.
In the course of this discussion, the impression was often created that
almost all manufacturers had manipulated exhaust data.
For the BMW Group, compliance with legal requirements, including
l­ocal test requirements, has top priority. The BMW Group has corresponding Compliance Management Systems to ensure that legal requirements
are met. Clear and binding specifications and processes are installed
throughout the development processes of the BMW Group in order to
prevent any breaches occurring. We are willing to explain our test procedures to the relevant authorities and to make our vehicles available
for examination at any time.
Manipulation of our vehicles and breaches of legislation are not compatible with the corporate culture of the BMW Group.
The ongoing criticism of companies in the automotive sector shows that
the image of the German automotive industry has suffered consid­
erably in the past year. Even though the BMW Group has repeatedly

emphasised that it has not manipulated its vehicles, the company sees
a need to collaborate with other carmakers to regain trust in the industry. In view of the challenges we will be facing – increasing urbanisation,
digitalisation and automation – this is in the interest of society. Carmakers will make their contribution towards shaping the future of mobility by providing their expertise and solutions competency.
The BMW Group is of the opinion that diesel cars continue to have a future. Against the backdrop of air quality impact in high-traffic city centres, which is partly also due to NO X emissions from diesel vehicles,
legislators have been working since 2010 on regulating this, creating in
2015 the effective Real Driving Emission (RDE) law for cars. The RDE
law already requires type testing to include monitoring and transparency of emission deviations between the testing facility and ac­tual road
driving. In addition, as of September 2017 binding limits must be complied with, which will be further intensified in a second step as of 2020.
The BMW Group took early action to keep NO X emissions as low as possible through the entire life cycle by further refining its ­diesel exhaust
treatment systems. The BMW Group implemented a combination of
NOx catalytic converter (NSC) and Selective Catalytic R
­ eduction (SCR)
in Europe and later also in the USA. This allows for the respectively better system to be used at low speeds and city traffic as well as during
motorway driving with high loads.

The USA has also set fuel efficiency and CO2
targets to be fulfilled by 2025. Based on a
gradual reduction starting in model year 2012,
the new vehicle fleet of all manufacturers must
achieve an average of 250 g CO 2 / mile (155 g
CO 2 / km) by model year 2016 and 163 g
CO 2 / mile (101 g CO 2 / km) by model year 2025.

Japan also set ambitious targets for reducing
fuel consumption. For 2020, they have a consumption target of 20.3 km / l – this is equivalent to a CO 2 emissions limit of 117 g CO 2 / km.

In China, the fuel efficiency of the vehicle fleet
is regulated. For 2020, an average consumption target of 5 l / 100 km has been set. Talks
about subsequent regulation have already
begun. In addition, weight-based consumption
limits have been set for individual vehicles.
­Initial introduction of a NEV mandate is
expected, although a finalised legal standard
has not yet been presented.

The WLTP test procedure will initially be introduced for exhaust emissions as of 2018; it is
not expected to be legislated for until after
2020 for fuel consumption. The decision to
introduce RDE legislation for pollutant emissions will probably be made in 2017.

With regard to exhaust emissions, China will
introduce a two-phase intensification of
requirements (phase 1 in 2020, phase 2 in
2023). From phase 2 onwards, compliance
with RDE is required in addition to the
WLTP cycle requirements. Certain regions
such as Beijing will probably introduce
­measures at an earlier stage.

REGULATORY APPROACH
All manufacturers will be required by the EU
to reduce CO 2 emissions of the new vehicle
fleet in Europe to an average of 95 g / km by
2020 (based on NEDC).

The European limits for exhaust elements
stated in the standards refer to the standardised test cycle NEDC (New European Driving

NEDC will be replaced by the WLTPs (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test
­Procedure).

The reduction targets for pollutant emissions
have been defined through to 2025 and must
be complied with in different cycles and
­driving conditions. The annual reduction targets are specified for the entire vehicle fleet
and thus allow for flexibility in terms of the
­individual models.

Medium- to long-term government targets to reduce fuel consumption and
CO2 emissions from vehicles have already been set in Europe, North America, Japan, China and other countries. However, the targets cannot be dir­
ectly compared internationally, as the calculation cycles are different from
country to country, and segment and drivetrain mixes also tend to differ
considerably.

Above and beyond national regulations, measures are increasingly being
taken on regional and municipal levels. Varying requirements for drivetrain
technologies, in particular, will start to have considerable influence on
product strategy (e.g. the Californian Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) programme
or registration plate restrictions in Chinese metropolises).
The BMW Group fundamentally supports the examples of worldwide trends
in regulation described above, both in terms of combating climate change
and improving air quality. The diversity and lack of harmonisation of different regulations at the national and supranational level is a fundamental
challenge for us as a globally active group. We assume that governments
will further intensify limit regulations based on different analyses conducted by scientists and NGOs as well as what is technologically possible.
These future limits are expected to be very ambitious and will entail considerable investment and development work for the manufacturers.

Depending on the driving style (crawling, normal or aggressive), the condition of the vehicle (e.g. load factor) and the prevailing surrounding conditions (e.g. temperature and altitude), actual vehicle emissions can deviate
to a greater or lesser degree from the cycle limit. For this reason, compliance with cycle limits should also be tested in real conditions in future. Accordingly, RDE (Real Driving Emissions) legislation will be introduced in
September 2017 in two phases (phase 1 to take effect as of 2017, phase 2
as of 2020). We support these new regulations as we believe they will create transparency for consumers and for the industry as soon as possible.

Since 2016, new customers can opt for a longer-range BMW i3 model
with higher battery capacity (33 kWh/94 ampere hours), thus achieving
a higher electric range of 300 km (NEDC). The 33 kWh/94 Ah battery is
offered to BMW i3 (60 Ah) customers as an update. Both BMW i3 model
versions are also available with a Range Extender that offers an additional 150 km in normal daily operation. Recharging is possible within
around 40 minutes at high-performance direct current (DC) charging
points. The new BMW i Wallbox allows the BMW i3 (33 kWh / 94 Ah) to
recharge at home in less than three hours using three-phase charging
with alternating current (AC). Information on the ChargeNow service of
the BMW Group • chapter 2.3.

In order to further reduce CO2 emissions in our new vehicle
fleet, to improve air quality in cities and, in particular, to
be able to offer our customers an entirely new, dynamic
driving experience based on innovative technologies, we
are adding further electric vehicles to our model range. Our
BMW i range of electric vehicles are environmentally opti‑
mised along their entire life cycle – from the selection of
raw materials through to battery recycling.

The electromobility market is starting to show clear signs
of growth in a number of regions. The BMW Group aims
to increase sales of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles to
100,000 in 2017 and wants to continue to contribute to the
market with its vehicle models and investment in infrastructure: we introduced the fully electric BMW i3 as far
back as 2013 and plan to launch further electric vehicles.
Customer surveys have shown that interest in electric vehicles is growing in our key markets •. To familiarise customers as well as possible with electromobility, we have
been expanding our product range step by step since 2015,
adding new plug-in hybrid models and offering the BMW i3
as part of our DriveNow car-sharing programme •.
Achieving longer range, shorter charging periods as well
as simplification of access to charging points and billing
is essential in order to increase demand for electric vehicles.
When developing its vehicles and charging stations, the
BMW Group works very hard to fulfil these customer expectations •.

In general, the carbon footprint of an electric vehicle deteriorates with
increased range due to higher battery capacity. The BMW Group conducts life cycle analyses to find out what opportunities can be exploited without increasing resource consumption and emissions caused by
battery production.

Expansion of the charging infrastructure as well as positive
political framework conditions can also make an important
contribution towards a breakthrough for electromobility.
This has become clear in fast-growing markets for electro­
mobility such as Norway and California. Customers only
switch to electric cars if they can rely on an adequate charging infrastructure for every­day driving. Ideally, non-financial incentives such as parking privileges can also acceler­
ate adoption. • Positive framework conditions for electromobility.

BMW i electromobility – securing

The benefits of electromobility
With regard to the challenges presented by urban mobility, electric
drivetrains enable new vehicle interior concepts to be realised. The fast
acceleration of the electric engine offers a further benefit for the user
in that it offers driving enjoyment. Electric vehicles are also consider­
ably more silent than combustion engines and make a clear contribution
towards reducing traffic noise.
Electric vehicles have the potential to significantly reduce emissions of
pollutants and CO2. However, this potential can only be tapped if reduction targets are taken into account in the design, selection of raw materials and in production. Here, battery production, recycling and reuse
play a particularly important role.
It is also essential to a good carbon footprint that the vehicles be powered with clean, green electricity. In order to make electromobility e­ ntirely
sustainable, it is therefore of the utmost importance that the energy
transition succeed worldwide. Electric vehicles can also play a supporting role in stabilising the electricity grids by acting as interim storage
devices. They can help to balance out fluctuations in renewable energy
caused by the weather and the time of day.

Ensuring sustainability in design, raw materials
and ­production
From the very beginning, we planned new and independent vehicle concepts (purpose-built approach) for the BMW i
models in order to exploit the full potential of the new
drivetrain technology and make it practicable for customers. This includes intelligent lightweight design using
carbon-­fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) and a host of new
renewable raw materials, as well as highly resource-efficient and at the same time environmentally friendly production methods. The BMW i value chain stands out for its
consistent use of renewable energy sources – from the
manufacture of energy-intensive materials such as CFRP,
to vehicle production, right up to the BMW Green Energy
package we offer our customers when they purchase their
vehicle. This is how BMW i creates the basis for a considerable reduction in CO2 emissions throughout the entire
product life cycle.

Using renewable energy to charge electric vehicles
An electric car can only reach its full potential in terms of
sustainability when it runs on electricity that is as carbon-­
neutral as possible. As part of BMW i 360° ELECTRIC we
now offer our customers green energy products with electricity from renewable sources in 15 countries. Ten providers of green energy are among the companies the
BMW Group has partnerships with in this area. In addition

we collaborate with four manufacturers of solar energy systems for car ports as well as house and garage roofs. This
allows customers to produce carbon-free green energy in
their own homes to recharge their BMW i3, BMW i8 or
BMW iPerformance plug-in hybrid vehicle.

Reuse and recycling of batteries to improve our
­carbon footprint
Batteries that are too old for continued application in the
vehicle are reused if possible, gaining a second life that
enables them to help integrate renewable energy into the
electricity grid and to reduce energy costs in general. The
BMW Group has demonstrated the technical and economic feasibility of this approach by introducing a large number of pilot systems in Europe, Asia and the USA. In September 2016, in collaboration with Vattenfall and Bosch,
we went live in Hamburg / DE with a large-scale second-life
storage unit with 104 used batteries from former BMW
Active E and BMW i3 prototype and development vehicles.
This storage unit will provide standby power and will thus
be able to balance out fluctuations that are created, for
example, when renewable energy is fed into the grid.
After a long vehicle life and subsequent use as a stationary
storage unit, we aim to achieve the highest possible rate of
recycling of the valuable parts. In collaboration with the
university TU Bergakademie Freiberg, the BMW Group
has developed a procedure by which we can achieve a recycling rate of around 70 –75 %. This is much higher than
the conventional rate of just over 50 % and will reduce the
carbon footprint of the recycling process by around half.
We have already found a company that is interested in
implementing the procedure on an industrial level. The
recycling procedure will be further refined in order to replace some of the more energy-intensive steps and thus
further reduce the carbon footprint. • GRI G4-EN27

Carbon footprint of vehicles
The carbon footprints of our electric and hybrid vehicles document the
environmental impact the vehicle and its components have throughout
their entire life cycle. The predecessor/successor comparison provides
transparency with regard to improvements made to reduce environmental impact. In addition, the results serve as a basis for the further
refinement and optimisation of the next vehicle generation and help us
to set further goals.

Integrating electrification into the entire
drivetrain strategy
The technological competence BMW i has already feeds
into the electrification of further models. By leveraging
future technological advances, we will be at the forefront
in the medium term of bringing fully electric vehicles with
a large range onto the market.

Leveraging further potential with hybrid
iPerformance vehicles
One result of this technology transfer is the BMW i Performance models with plug-in hybrid drivetrains. Since 2015,
the BMW Group has expanded its product range step by
step to now include the BMW 2 Series, BMW 3 Series,
BMW 7 Series and BMW X5 iPerfor­man­ce. Short- and
medium-range journeys can be covered in electric mode

needed. In AUTO eDRIVE mode, intelligent energy management determines the most efficient combination of electric and combustion engine – depending on driving speed
and battery level. Plug-in hybrid models use up to 50 % less
fuel than their combustion-powered equivalents. Typical
commutes during the week, for example, could be driven
in electric mode, while longer journeys can also be undertaken using the combustion engine. The BMW 740 e, for
instance, has a range of up to 48 km in fully electric mode.

Electric scooters for more sustainable city mobility
In 2014, we launched our C Evolution electric scooter. The
Long Range model of the fully electrically powered scooter
has 48 HP at peak performance and a range of up to 160 km.
It is designed to be a commuting vehicle, particularly for
travel between the outskirts and the city centre. The main
focus here is on two requirements: firstly, that performance is comparable to that of a combustion-powered
maxi-­scoot­er, and secondly, that it has a long range in real-­
life conditions.

Increasing range with hydrogen and fuel cells
As an alternative to developing purely electric drivetrains,
we are also doing research into hydrogen fuel cell technology. Here, hydrogen is used as an energy source that is
converted by the fuel cell into electricity and water by
drawing on the oxygen in the surrounding air. In the long
run, we want to develop further solutions for emissionsfree driving with a greater range. The test vehicles already
have a range of up to 700 km.
The launch of fuel cell technology on a broader scale also
calls for the corresponding refuelling infrastructure to be
installed. For this purpose, the BMW Group has joined
forces with four other carmakers to form the European
“HyFIVE Project”. This is one of the largest projects in Eur­
ope dedicated to promoting fuel-cell-driven vehicles. As
part of the project, the BMW Group, in cooperation with
TOTAL , opened one of the first public hydrogen filling
stations in the summer of 2015, offering two alternative
refuelling options. In addition, the BMW Group is an associated partner of H2 MOBILITY Deutschland GmbH &
Co. KG, which was founded in 2015. We also offer expert
advice in the process of expanding the infrastructure for
hydrogen, which is a viable fuel of the future.

Supporting positive framework conditions
for electromobility
Subsidisation has proven conducive to the successful in­
tro­duction of new technologies. For this reason, the
BMW Group seeks out dialogue with policy-makers regarding the consistency of policy measures, both on the
supply and the demand side. In particular, we discuss
measures to promote electromobility, whether by way of
financial support or non-monetary packages of measures
(for example the use of bus lanes or the introduction of
dedicated lanes, or preferential parking).
Perfect city vehicle: the BMW i3.

One challenge in this connection is the wide variation in
the intensity and type of promotional measures from country to country, region to region, and city to city. Even within the same community, municipal and non-municipal
institutions may pursue divergent and possibly even conflicting goals.
In addition, customers currently react very quickly when
incentives are removed (e.g. tax incentives). This is reflected in a reduction in demand.
The BMW Group is involved, for example, in the • Nationale
Plattform Elektromobilität (NPE) in Germany, in the Foreign
Expert Panel of a high-level advisory committee for the
Chinese central government as well as in the • Plug-In
Electric Vehicle Collaborative in California, which addresses
issues around market access and of which BMW was a
founding member.
We would like to see all markets take similarly effective
measures to promote electromobility, such as those already
in place in Japan, China and California.

In addition, the BMW Group is involved in local partnerships with other companies and policy-makers: we established an e-alliance partnership, for instance, with the German city of Munich, which will take strategic approaches
towards improving the framework conditions necessary
for the long-term market success of electromobility. The
city’s declared targets, for example the reduction of NO X
emissions or single-occupant traffic provide the impetus
for joint measures. The BMW Group has taken on the role
of initiator in promoting the expansion and operation of
charging stations as part of public infrastructure, and is
implementing these projects in collaboration with further
electromobility stakeholders in the form of public /private
partnerships.
In addition, the BMW Group is incrementally electrifying
and expanding its DriveNow fleet. This is how we aim to
solve the issues around available charging infrastructure
for electric vehicles as well as to increase the visibility and
accessibility of electromobility for people in their day-today lives. The corresponding action plans were developed
and implemented in 2016. In addition, further talks are
being planned with other cities in Europe and beyond.

The BMW Group is supporting the expansion of charging infrastructure
for electromobility worldwide – both for private customers as well as in
the public sphere. Since 2014, the BMW Group has taken on the role of
an initiator with regard to the expansion of charging infrastructure in
public spaces. In collaboration with other carmakers, charging station
operators, energy suppliers and grid operators, the BMW Group is
working to lower the entry barriers that charging infrastructure faces
and initiate new projects. The BMW Group supports this process by
providing expertise and financing. The company was active in over 20
countries in 2016 and supported the expansion of over 3,000 DC and
2,000 AC charging stations.
Furthermore, in collaboration with carmakers Daimler, Ford, VW and
the brands Porsche and AUDI, the BMW Group is planning a joint venture to set up and operate a high-performance rapid-charging network
along major transport axes in Europe.
In addition, as part of the BMW 360° ELECTRIC portfolio, we offer
p­ rivate and fleet customers state-of-the-art charging solutions (wall
boxes, charging stations). Furthermore, the BMW Group’s charging
service ChargeNow is constantly being further refined and expanded

The BMW Group is working worldwide to expand charging infrastructure
for ­electromobility.

Light & Charge
Light & Charge is a cost-saving alternative to conventional
charging stations that integrates the charging point into
existing urban infrastructure, for example street lamps,
and thus requires no structural intervention. The use of this
technology makes sense particularly in residential areas
where people park on the street and rely on an ad­equate
charging infrastructure for charging their vehicles overnight. Thanks to the small dimensions of the charging stations, the visual interference in the public space is mini­mal.

Forecast
We will continue to offer innovative solutions for the di‑
verse mobility needs of our customers. We are deliberately
focusing our efforts on building a broad technology base
so that in the coming years we can offer tailored solutions
for different needs worldwide. We expect that, in the future,
a number of different drivetrain types will exist in parallel.

The BMW Group offers its customers premium quality in‑
dividual mobility. The focus is always on driving enjoy‑
ment. This brand promise has become a challenge, in par‑
ticular in densely populated urban spaces, but also on the
motorways around large cities. The increasing volume of
traffic in cities often goes hand in hand with a significant
rise in noise and air pollution, consumption of space as
well as increased risk of accidents. To counteract these ef‑
fects, we make increasing use of the technologies around
connected mobility and automatic driving. Building on this,
we develop and establish innovative vehicles and services
that have the potential to counteract the rising volume of
traffic. In this process, we guarantee the highest standards
of vehicle safety and data security.

In 2016, the BMW Group engaged in dialogue with a var­
iety of stakeholders at a number of events addressing the
future of mobility. The aim was to generate input from
these stakeholders regarding the challenges facing the
automotive industry. The schedule of events included our
Future Mobility Days in Beijing, London and Santa Monica,
California. Some of the central findings in the course of
these exchanges were:
– Integration of cars into an inter-modal, increasingly
digital transport system – especially in urban areas –
is seen as a key and necessary competency.

– Carmakers such as the BMW Group are currently
confronted with changes to their business environment and must fundamentally change themselves in
order to continue to be sucessful in the future.
The technological shift towards electrification and
simultaneous digitalisation are changing the sector.
New providers of mobility services are stepping up
the competition.
Against this backdrop, we see three key areas of action
when it comes to individual mobility:
– Mobility services
– Vehicle connectivity
– Automated driving
Digitalisation opens up new opportunities in terms of
safety, convenience and sustainability – for example
through less time spent searching for parking spaces,
better flow of traffic and inter-modal solutions. However,
it also brings new challenges, for example in the area of
data privacy, machine ethics, manipulation protection as
well as legal and liability issues for companies. Active, open
and balanced consideration of these topics is a key component of our management approach towards the digitalisation of individual mobility.
We take an integrated perspective when it comes to this
task. We aim to reach the next milestones at the beginning
of the coming decade with a new BMW i model that will
raise individual premium mobility to a whole new level.
BMW i NEXT is the name the BMW Group has given to its
project that aims to set new standards in how people ex­
perience mobility: in the next generation, we will combine
new forms of automated driving and digital connectivity
with state-of-the-art interiors, design and lightweight construction.

Offering innovative mobility services
for urban areas
Around 60 % of the world’s population is expected to live
in cities by the year 2030. What is the future of indi­v idual
mobility in cities with increasingly dense populations?
What concepts are needed in order to make t­ raffic climate-­
friendly and easy on resources? The BMW Group is involved in dialogue and research projects that work to find
answers to these questions and develop adequate solutions.
We founded the competence centre for urban mobility in
2015 to engage in dialogue with various local stakeholders
with a view to developing a common vision of cities that
will offer quality of life. It also initiates pilot projects to
directly implement planned solutions at a local level. In addition, an urban mobility workgroup was initiated within
the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA)
and its goals are being actively pursued. The workgroup
includes both VDA member companies as well as seven
large German cities. We work together to identify the key
goals for cities and industries, derive areas to be addressed
and specify measures that are then integrated into pilot
projects. This is how we ensure that we are as efficient and
as fast as possible in finding scalable solutions for urban
traffic.

In 2016, the BMW Group launched pilot projects in two districts of Munich and
of Hamburg that allow residents to test alternative mobility solutions such as car-­
sharing and e-vehicles for their usefulness in everyday conditions. The aim is to
reduce emissions in the cities and to enhance quality of life in the city.

In 2016, the • Institute for Mobility Research (ifmo), which belongs
to the BMW Group, carried out a project to analyse mobility patterns in different urban spaces in China. New solutions and business models, developed to shape mobility
more efficiently in Chinese cities, are emerging extremely
quickly. Research projects that analyse such changes help
the BMW Group to develop sustainable solutions for the
future of urban spaces.

Alphabet
Solutions for fleet customers are taking on increasing importance. This is the specialty of Alphabet Fuhrpark­man­
agement GmbH, the BMW Group company that provides
leasing and fleet management services. Energy efficiency
and a sustainable fleet are today the main focuses for many
of our fleet customers and are often required by their own
car policies. In consultation with the customer, we try to
determine how to develop a more eco-friendly fleet. Driver training courses in eco-friendly driving habits as well
as a sustainable drivetrain mix are possible ­solutions. For
example, depending on how the fleet is used, hybrid and
electric cars can be a very good alternative to conventional fleet vehicles.

2.1	Emissions of CO2
and pollutants

Car-sharing makes it possible to be mobile without having to own a car.
Free-floating car-sharing in particular offers the possibility of using a
vehicle “as if it were your own”. A number of studies have been carried
out to investigate the effect this will have on the vehicle fleet and kilometres travelled. The “Evaluation CarSharing EVA-CS”, conducted by
the state capital city of Munich concluded that the some 860 vehicles
in the car-sharing fleet had reduced the number of vehicles in Munich/
DE by around 1,500 and that the number of vehicle kilometres driven
had decreased by 41.2 million. Both have a direct positive impact on the
goals of the city with regard to emissions and traffic congestion. Better
framework conditions for car-sharing and the larger fleet that would result would probably lead to significantly more impactful results.

Since 2011, the BMW Group and Sixt SE have been offering their joint venture car-sharing service • DriveNow. ­Today,
DriveNow is available in eleven European cities, having
most recently been launched in Milan in 2016. The DriveNow fleet currently comprises more than 5,400 vehicles, of
which around 15.4 % are fully electric BMW i3 vehicles. By
31 December 2016, DriveNow had a total of some 607,000
customers in Germany and around 815,000 Europe-wide
(in 2015: over 580,000 Europe-wide). In Germany, DriveNow is one of the main drivers of electromobility. To date,
around 190,000 customers have driven some 6.5 million
carbon-free kilometres using DriveNow’s BMW i3 electric
vehicles. This means that 11.4 % of the journeys were completed ­electrically.

With BMWi and “NOW mobility services”, the BMW Group
has laid the foundation for individual mobility solutions
that place particular focus on the challenges of urban development worldwide. With offerings such as DriveNow
(free-floating car-sharing), ReachNow (on-demand mobility services), ParkNow (digital parking service) and
ChargeNow (charging network for electric vehicles), we
started early on to direct our efforts towards the increasing
importance of digital services. This is a key factor that will
determine our future business s­ uccess.

Offering additional mobility services
with ReachNow USA
On 8 April 2016, the BMW Group launched an advanced
car-­sharing programme in the USA under the name
• ReachNow. To date, ReachNow is available in ­Seattle,
Portland and Brooklyn. ReachNow currently has around
38,000 customers and a fleet of over 1,400 vehicles. Since
the end of 2016, ReachNow has been piloting innovative
services in addition to the classical car-sharing programme.
Additional services include personal drivers (“Ride”) as
well as a reservation and delivery service for vehicles that
are rented for longer periods of 2–5 days (“Reserve”).
“Fleet Solutions” targets companies and ReachNow members in selected residential areas. They can have exclusive
use of a fleet of premium vehicles that are permanently
parked nearby. Another pilot being tested by ReachNow
is the opportunity to rent out your own car to the fleet
(“Share”).

Building convenient electromobility with
BMW i 360° ELECTRIC and ChargeNow

Introduction

One example of our holistic approach to electromobility
is our 360° ELECTRIC package of products and services.
It includes recharging both at home with the BMW i Wallbox and on the go at public charging points that accept
• ChargeNow – a recharge card that enables access and payment at around 62,800 public charging points installed by
various providers. It is available in 26 countries worldwide
and includes a cashless payment system.

In 2016, the BMW Group launched a new BMW i Wallbox
generation. The benefits of the BMW i Wallbox lie in the
faster charging time – it charges up to six times faster than
the charging cable provided as a series component. In addition, several users can set up a personal profile for the
BMW i Wallbox Plus and BMW i Wallbox Connect models,
to generate individual invoices.

Creating sustainable parking patterns with ParkNow
• ParkNow is an app- and web-based service that enables
digital payment of parking spaces on streets and in car
parks. Cashless and ticketless parking is now possible in
over 38 cities: this reduces the volume of traffic engaged
in searching for parking spaces. Since November 2016,
ParkNow has given users the option to pay for parking
spaces without leaving their BMW vehicles (first launched
in the new BMW 5 Series). So far, ParkNow has been integrated into vehicles in Germany, Austria and the USA.

The BMW Group also offers an installation service that
checks which BMW i Wallbox can be installed at the customer’s home. If requested, the qualified on-site electrician
from our partner installation company can also deliver,
install, start up and provide instructions on how to use
the system. 360° ELECTRIC also includes Assistance Services with ConnectedDrive products designed specifically
for electromobility, as well as further service and repair
offerings.

Vehicle connectivity for enhanced
inter-modal mobility

In this way, the digital services provided by BMW Connected simplify day-to-day planning of journeys and appointments. Depending on the devices that are connected,
BMW Connected identifies mobility-relevant information
such as addresses in calendar entries and passes these on
directly to the vehicle. Users are alerted in advance by
their smartphones of the ideal time to start their journey,
based on real-time traffic information. In addition, frequent destinations and the user’s personal mobility patterns are automatically saved, thus providing additional
support to the driver.

Global migration to large cities continues unabated. As
there is little room for expanding the existing traffic
routes in the cities, the existing infrastructure has to deal
with ever increasing traffic volumes. This leads to more
traffic jams and more dissatisfaction among road users.
That’s why we need vehicle connectivity concepts that are
designed for sharing, especially in urban areas. Our experience with DriveNow is a clear indication that car-sharing
customers use more modes of transport than others. That’s
why vehicle connectivity is already a decisive purchasing
factor, both for fleet operators and for private buyers.

Automated driving for more convenience,
safety and efficiency

We already offer a traffic jam avoidance service, RTTI (Real
Time Traffic Information). In addition, BMW i ConnectedDrive Services include intermodal routing and integration
of public transport, vacant parking space searches close to
the respective public transport stop and bicycle availability
by Call a Bike – the bike rental system of German rail company Deutsche Bahn AG. In this way, the BMW Group
makes an active contribution towards increasing intermodal mobility in cities.

With project i (BMW i), the BMW Group was an early mover
in actively engaging with the topic of electromobility and
developing solutions for application on an industrial level.
The project i 2.0 is now taking the same approach for automated and fully connected vehicles. Our focus here is on
high-precision digital cards, sensor technology, cloud technology and artificial intelligence, all of which will make a
decisive contribution towards our success in this segment.

BMW Connected – personalising and
simplifying ­mobility
In 2016, we launched BMW Connected in the USA and
Europe – a holistic digital concept that provides seamless
support for individual mobility.
The BMW Connected digital mobility assistant has a large
number of functions that support day-to-day mobility
needs. For example, based on the flexible platform Open
Mobility Cloud, a range of devices such as smartphones
and smartwatches can be connected with the ­vehicle. The
user’s self-learning digital BMW-ID enables BMW Connected to provide personalised experiences across a large
number of “touchpoints”.

Under the umbrella of BMW Personal CoPilot, the
BMW Group brings together the technologies and systems
that will support us on our way towards autonomous
driving: from the already available driver assistance systems right through to highly- or fully-automated and final­
ly to the autonomous driving that will be with us in the
future •. By 2021, we aim to have mastered the initial
quantum leap from partially- to highly-automated motorway driving.

In the future, we want to enable our customers to partially
or fully delegate driving to the vehicle in non-challenging
situations, for example in traffic jams or in stop-start traffic. The basic principle is that it is the driver who decides
whether the vehicle should switch to a more automated
mode or not. Although this involves a number of regulatory and societal challenges, it is a great opportunity in

terms of revolutionising mobility: in addition to the safety
aspects, we also see there being a considerable gain in
terms of time and convenience for our customers – as
well as improved driving efficiency. This creates significant
freedom for our customers to use their time as they see fit
while the vehicle does the driving.

Experiencing modern assistance systems
with the BMW 5 and 7 Series
Equipped with a stereo camera and five radar sensors, the
BMW 7 Series stays in its motorway lane and keeps its
distance to the vehicle ahead, even at high speeds. And
thanks to Remote Control Parking, the BMW 7 Series finds
its way into the garage, at the push of a button. The BMW
flagship is already the benchmark in the areas of connectivity and operation when it comes to comprehensively integrating gesture control. In addition, driver assistance has
been taken to the next level in the new 2016 BMW 5 Series:
new features include partially automated lane changing on
motorways and the emergency steer assist that uses precise,
highly dynamic steering support to give the driver additional safety during critical manoeuvres. These active assistance systems are helping to gradually make vehicle
traffic safer. This ­applies not only to the driver but also to
all other road users. The BMW Group finds it particularly
important that these support mechanisms always make the
driver aware of the system's limits so that he is not unconsciously distracted from the traffic situation. Assistance

systems require the driver's full attention and should not
be confused with a high degree of – or full – automation
that in some cases allows the driver to actively turn their
attention away from traffic.

Setting new standards for automated driving
with BMW iNEXT
The BMW Group wants to lead the way in automated
driving and will continue to work hard on further developing the associated technologies in the coming years.
New sensors and higher performance software as well as
clear advances in artificial intelligence research make it
possible to move forward dynamically with the next steps
in automated driving. With our planned BMW iNext model, we want to set new standards in this area by 2021. In
this process, we are relying both on our own technological
strength as well as on pooling our expertise in collaboration with innovative partners.
The first milestone was reached at the end of 2015, when
the BMW Group and other carmakers purchased the navigation service HERE, benefitting from this company’s
extensive portfolio of maps, pioneering understanding of
locally focussed services and secure data processing that
complies with data privacy legislation.
A further important partnership on the road to automated
driving is our collaboration with Intel and Mobileye. This
partnership brings together three leading companies from
the automotive, technology and computer vision and machine learning industries. Our common goal is to develop
an open industrial standard for autonomous driving (a
“non-­exclusive industry platform”). Together, we aim to
bring solutions for highly – and possibly even fully – auto­
mated driving into series production by 2021.

mation in urban areas, traffic management and driving
safety systems as well as technical solutions. This includes
safe return to the driver, addressing disruptions and barriers as well as predictive driving. The first automated research vehicles are to be tested not only on motorways
but also in Munich /DE, in order to test the vehicles in
city traffic conditions. In the automated test vehicles, a
driver will be present who can take over control in any
situation.

Autonomous driving – pooling capacities within the
development centre
In 2017, the BMW Group will pool and further expand its
capacities within a new development centre for autonomous driving. The new centre will require a total of around
2,000 employees, creating a large number of new jobs. By
taking this step we are preparing for the technical challenges we face as we gradually introduce automation.
What is important to us in this context is to make sure
our communications with customers and the public are
based on the facts alone. Therefore, we continue to present
a clear picture of the degree of automation and do not
promise customers more than our systems can provide.

In another project, the ifmo research institute is currently
investigating the long-term effects of autonomous vehicles
on mobility patterns. The results indicate that autonomous
vehicles could increase the number of kilometres covered
by cars. However, any future offering of autonomous carsharing fleets as part of public transport systems has the
potential to reduce traffic volumes in urban areas.

The BMW Group will start series production of solutions for highly
and fully ­automated driving by 2021.

Mastering the challenges of digitalisation
and automation
The focus of the technological changes is on the safety of
the driver, vehicle occupants and pedestrians. Autonomous
driving technology has not yet reached maturity. Furthermore, clear legal framework conditions need to accompany
the introduction of this technology. The data transfer that
accompanies the developments in digitalisation and automation also necessitates an intensification of the requirements placed on aspects of manipulation and data privacy.

Preventing manipulation
The advance of digitalisation requires additional measures
to protect against unauthorised access to the ­vehicles. In
order to protect our systems from manipulation, we have
a clear procedure in place that forms an integral part of
our development work. Methodically executed penetration
tests identify potential weak points and close security gaps
even before the respective components are approved. We
turn newly emerging knowledge into binding standards
on an ongoing basis. In this way, the BMW Group aims to
offer its ­customers the utmost in manipulation protection
and to ensure that there is no unauthorised access to control devices or vehicle interfaces.
Non-discriminatory vehicle data will in future be made
available to authorised applicants via a manufacturer
backend system. This enables simple and secure sharing
of vehicle data with third-party service providers via a
standardised interface. If our customers so wish, we can
use this interface to transfer, for example, personal ­d river
profile data to insurance companies to calculate pay-asyou-drive insurance fees. By using a backend s­ ystem for
data transfer, the BMW Group minimises the vulnerability
of the vehicle fleet to hacking attacks, as direct and often
unprotected data connections between the vehicle and
third parties can be avoided.

Systematically securing data protection
The BMW Group is committed to the principles of data
processing transparency and data minimisation. In 2014,
we were the first carmaker worldwide to successfully
complete the validation process for the Binding Corporate
Rules (BCR) scheme. The BCR regulation guarantees a
data protection standard that is to be upheld and maintained by BMW AG and all its subsidiaries. This ensures
that in the BMW Group, personal data is always handled
at a uniformly high security level, regardless of whether
the data is processed for example in Europe, Asia or
America. An international network of local data protection coordinators ensures compliance with the Binding
Corporate Rules.
Protection of information and data is an integral part of
the business processes at the BMW Group, and we comply
with the international security standard ISO /IEC 27001.
In the field of vehicle communication (BMW ConnectedDrive) and also digitalisation, transparent for the customer as well as data security and prevention of misuse are
key concerns. Personal data is only collected, processed or
used if this is legally permissible and granted with the
consent of the person in question. In addition, we invest
in technical measures to protect the data. If customers or
prospective customers lodge any complaints regarding
data protection, for example with respect to advertising
campaigns, such complaints are addressed promptly.

Taking account of registration and liability legislation
There are still a number of hurdles to overcome on the path
to automation: In addition to the Vienna Convention of
1968, there are also issues regarding registration and liability-related legislation, which still make it difficult to
introduce automated road traffic driving. There must be
clarity regarding which traffic situations a highly automated vehicle has to recognise independently. With regard to
liability issues, a “black box” is required that stores certain
data necessary to sort out ­accident liability. This data storage unit can contribute towards allocating responsibility
between human and machine when accidents happen.

broad network of established brands.
Some of the investments of BMW i Ventures include:
– • Zendrive for more economical road driving
Drawing upon mobile technologies and large data
volumes, Zendrive provides driver-specific analyses
of the economy of the driving style, for example.
The driver can access these analyses at any time.
– Intermodal route planning with • Moovit
The Moovit app integrates comprehensive information on the bus, tram and subway schedules of local
transport companies by using their timetable data
as well as real-time information from the “Moovit
Community”.
– • ZIRX on-demand parking service
Users can enter their destination into the ZIRX
smartphone app. When they arrive, a ZIRX agent will
be there to park the car. While the car is parked,
users can book additional services via the ZIRX app.

SUSAN DREYER
CDP,
Country Director Germany

What challenges does a globally operating automotive group
currently have to face in decarbonising its value chain?
Driving down CO2 emissions along the automotive value
chain has systemic impacts on car design, with conse­
quences for the production system, industry structure and
the viability of current business models. The industry is
thus required to rethink its business model at large, as a
more radical design philosophy would question core elem­
ents of the product. Similarly, the complex and sometimes
opaque supply chains of global automotive groups carry
sustainability challenges, resource risks, and efficiency
opportunities. Another challenge is getting BMW’s suppliers
to engage with their own suppliers. On average supply
chain emissions are many times greater than those from
direct operations – so it’s crucial that engagement cascades
down the supply chain.
Why do automotive manufacturers have to rely on “sustain­
able mobility and sustainable production” in the long term?
At a European level, ELV (end of life of vehicles) legislation
already stipulates an 85 % recycling rate. So it’s important
for automakers to work closely with vehicle dismantlers,
shredders and recyclers to ascertain the best methods for
high value extraction of mechanical parts. Additionally,
auto manufacturers are increasingly investigating the
potential for circular economy realisation across the entire
value chain. The Paris Agreement and adoption of SDGs
are the beginning of a new era in which businesses must
develop innovative strategies to survive in a low-carbon

economy. It can no longer be business as usual, with 83 %
of BMW suppliers that are reporting into CDP already
identifying climate-related risks, increasing pressure on
resource availability, impending shifts in regulation and
changing consumer expectations. As such, the industry
will be expected to innovate and experiment.
How does the BMW Group face the challenges from
your point of view?
Car companies will be able to identify and capitalise on
the risks and opportunities on their path towards sustain­
able mobility and production by valuing non-financial
reporting and encouraging their suppliers to do the same.
BMW Group has integrated sustainability into its supply
chain strategy and targets. Among other things, the com­
pany is assessing its top 100 suppliers against key indica­
tors such as emission targets, reduction initiatives and
changes in absolute emissions. This allows the company to
track annual performance, develop competitive bench­
marks and inform its future supplier engagement strategy.
As a result, BMW Group was able to initiate pilot projects
for emission reductions in collaboration with key suppliers,
and covers 69 % of its procurement overall spend, among
the largest coverage known to us. BMW’s sustainability work
has made it one of only two companies worldwide (out of
5,800 who reported to CDP in 2016) to achieve an A score
in CDP ’s Climate Change programme for seven years
in a row.

RELEVANCE
FOR BMW GROUP
Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing society
today. Negative impacts on particularly vulnerable areas and
populations can already be seen. At the same time, the world
population is growing and with it the consumption of resources.
CO2 and pollutant emissions are also increasing due to the
­production of consumer goods. In order to fulfil our vision of
being the most sustainable premium manufacturer, we are
continuously reducing CO2 emissions and resources used per
vehicle produced. We are increasingly using renewable energies
at our locations worldwide. In addition, we foster the implementation of social and environmental standards as well as
transparency and resource efficiency in our supply chain.
These measures are becoming increasingly important in the
development of electromobility. We are therefore making a
contribution towards solving the challenges faced by society,
and are reducing both risk and production costs.

CONSUMPTION OF RESOURCES
The BMW Group will reduce its resource
consumption (energy, water, waste, solvents)
per vehicle produced by 45% by 2020
(base year 2006).

State-of-the-art technology ensures BMW Group paint shops
are clean and use resources efficiently.

CONSUMPTION
OF RESOURCES

Further improving the good figures achieved in recent
years is a major challenge for our environmental manage­
ment system. We continuously work on this at all existing
and new locations. On the one hand, we want to achieve
our internal goals through our environmental management
system. On the other hand, it is important to respond to
external trends, such as increasing prices of raw materials
or growing involvement of our locations in urban metro­
politan areas, which requires further reduction of environ­
mental impacts.

Our company is facing the challenge of conserving re­
sources and tackling climate change. This is also very
relevant for the production processes of the BMW Group.
We require resources for the production of our vehicles and
the energy we consume generates emissions. What is more,
production can be impaired by the impacts of climate
change. For this reason, we continuously increase our ener­
gy and resource efficiency and minimise CO2 and pollutant
emissions from our production. We see this as the most
important component of responsible business management.
In addition, our measures help reduce production costs,
meet the needs of our customers and stakeholders and
prepare for new legal requirements.

Since 2006, we have reduced our use of energy and water,
waste and waste water as well as solvents and CO2 emis­
sions from vehicle production per vehicle produced by an
average of 50 % •. In 2016, utilisation of resources and
emissions per vehicle produced were reduced by an aver­
age of 4.9 % compared with the previous year.

We are among the leading automobile manufacturers in
the areas of emissions, waste and process waste water and
have also already achieved our internal objectives. We will
continue our efforts to make further improvements in
these areas. Our main focus is now on energy and water
consumption, where there have been slight increases in
the reporting period and we are yet to achieve our objec­
tives. In this area we systematically follow our reduction
plans and continue to work on achieving our objectives.

We have thus established environmental management sys­
tems at all existing production plants, with plans to install
them at all future locations. With the exception of motor­
cycle production in Manaus / BR and Hosur/IN, all of our
production locations, German dealerships, as well as six
others in Eur­ope (Vienna / AT, Zurich / CH, Rome / IT, Milan /
IT, Madrid / ES and Barcelona / ES) are now certified ac­
cording to ISO 14001 •. After the standard was revised in
2015, we are now implementing the environmental man­
agement systems at our locations in line with the changes.
The newly set priorities include greater involvement of
stakeholders and consideration of the entire life cycle of
our products and services. Most of these changes corre­
spond to our long-standing practice. However, they must
also be integrated into our management system check ac­
cording to ISO 14001:2015.
Our six competence centres (for water, waste, energy, emis­
sions, training and environmental management system)
are staffed by environmental experts from the different
plants and by specialists from Corporate Environmental
Protection. They discuss legal requirements and best-prac­
tice solutions with technology experts from the production
plants and develop reference systems on which to base
future planning and process improvements. Environmen­
tal improvements that have been effective at one location
are implemented at other locations wherever possible. Both
existing and new locations benefit from this, such as our
future plant in San Luis Potosí / MX. Furthermore, we pass
on our experiences to our suppliers in order to improve
sustainability in our supply chain where possible •.

Optimising energy efficiency

Further
key indicators

In 2016, energy consumption from our vehicle production
slightly increased to 2.21 MW h per vehicle produced com­
pared to the previous year (2015: 2.19 MW h) •. This can
essentially be attributed to the launch of the new engine
plant in Shenyang /CN and the construction of a new, ef­
fi­cient paint shop in Munich /DE . As soon as the new,
highly efficient plants and production facilities are under­
way, the old facilities that they replace will be deactivated.
In line with this, we expect energy consumption to decline
as soon as 2017. We are coming closer to our goal of reduc­
ing consumption per vehicle by 45 % by 2020 compared to
2006. A number of measures are already planned to help
us achieve this, including heat regeneration, the compre­
hensive use of LEDs and further increases in efficiency at
paint shops using integrated painting processes. So far, we
have achieved a reduction of 35.4 % compared to the base
year of 2006. • GRI G4-EN5, GRI G4-EN6

Smart management of energy data
The BMW Group continuously takes measures which help
save energy and reduce CO2 emissions at the same time.
For instance, a forecast-based building control system was
installed in the IT centre of the Munich / DE location, which
uses weather forecasts, a building structure simulation as
well as regular measurement data to optimise energy con­
sumption for the ventilation and heating of the office build­
ing with a surface area of almost 60,000 m² and 3,000 em­
ployees. The system was planned there as a pilot. It not
only reduces the heat consumption by 1,200 MW h, but also
increases convenience of use for employees. After this suc­
cessful pilot project, there are now plans to implement the
concept at other locations.
At our branch in Stuttgart /DE, energy costs were reduced
by 40 % through the use of the energy management system
“Emsyst 4.0”. The system uses sensors to record all con­
sumption and controls it so that heating is turned down,
for instance, when windows are open.
In April 2016, the BMW Group was selected as one of just
nine companies to take part in the North American Energy
Management Pilot Program (NAEMPP). This programme
fosters exchange between participants in the USA, Canada
and Mexico and therefore supports the faster implementa­
tion of the ISO 50001 standard and the Superior Energy
Performance® certificate of the U. S. Department of Energy
to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The
project began in 2016 and will end in mid-2017 with an
evaluation and assessment including best practice transfer.
Specific measures include the creation of an inter-disci­
plinary energy management team, the formulation and
approval of a plant energy policy with long-term energy
planning, as well as the identification of statistics which
further increase transparency for targeted energy con­
sumption.

Systematically reducing CO2 emissions
In light of climate change, the reduction of CO2 emissions
is highly relevant for the BMW Group. Reducing CO2 emis­
sions not only makes environmental sense – it is also a
business opportunity for the company. Fewer CO2 emis­
sions mean cost savings and competitive advantage due to
less energy consumption and avoidance of CO2 levies. In
addition, many of our fleet customers have high expecta­
tions with regard to green car policies. So we are reducing
CO2 emissions both in our own production as well as along
the value chain.

Minimising CO2 emissions at company locations

CO2 emissions at the BMW Group locations are generated
directly from burning fossil fuels (Scope 1 emissions) and
indirectly through the company’s electricity and heat con­
sumption (Scope 2 emissions). We focus on reducing CO2
emissions from our production facilities, which account
for around 90 % of these Scope 1 and 2 emissions. We are
pursuing our vision of carbon-free energy supply at all
locations.

Through our measures to increase energy efficiency, as
well as the use of electricity from renewable sources at our
production plants, CO2 emissions from vehicle production
per vehicle produced decreased in the reporting period
by another 5.3 % to 0.54 t compared to the previous year
(2015: 0.57 t CO2 per vehicle).
To increase energy efficiency, we are currently developing
CHP systems at seven locations. These highly efficient new
systems quadruple the production capacity of the eight sys­
tems that we currently have.

Another example of the increase in energy efficiency and
the associated reduction of CO2 emissions is the exten­
sive replacement of lights by LEDs, a process which the
BMW Group began in 2016. Around 115,000 lights were
replaced in total. As a result, a reduction in the energy
demand amounting to 6,848 MW h was achieved in 2016,
which meant that we were able to avoid CO2 emissions of
around 2,800 t.

Reducing CO2 emissions in the value chain

In 2016, emissions in our production network amounted
to 1,254,961 t CO2 (2015: 1,267,485 t). This means that, in
spite of an increase in production volume, we achieved a
decrease in overall CO2 emissions in this area for the sec­
ond year in a row. This was possible thanks to a steady
increase in the amount of green electricity purchased. We
see the consistent decrease in CO2 emissions per vehicle
produced in recent years as confirmation of the effective­
ness of our measures •. • GRI G4-EN18, GRI G4-EN19

• see
Further
key indicators

• see
table 3.03

Both upstream and downstream in the value chain, we
continually reduce emissions caused by the use and dis­
posal of our products, in our supply chain, in transport
logistics and by employees commuting to and from work
(Scope 3 emissions). Around 70 % of these Scope 3 emis­
sions are generated during utilisation of the vehicles sold.
The emissions generated during fuel production are not
counted here. With our Efficient Dynamics technologies,
we are continually reducing the average fleet emissions
of CO2 per kilometre worldwide – in 2016 by 2 % to 144 g
CO2 / km (2015: 147 g CO2 /km) •.
Around a fifth of Scope 3 emissions were generated in the
upstream supply chain. We constantly work with our sup­
pliers to look for further possibilities to use resources more
efficiently •.
Furthermore, around 2 % of Scope 3 emissions are caused
by the global transport volume required to supply our pro­
duction plants with materials, to deliver our vehicles and
to supply spare parts to the markets. In order to keep these
CO2 emissions to an absolute minimum, we work on the
principle “production follows the market”. We also con­
tinually increase the share of low-carbon modes of trans­
port. Increasing rail transport is a measure to reduce CO2
emissions. For instance, we were able to keep the number
of new vehicles that leave our plants by rail at the high
level of 59.7 % (2015: 63.1 %). The small decrease is due to
a slightly altered regional distribution of our production
•. Rail also plays an important role in supplying the plants
with production material. For example, a train with vehicle
components runs on the Trans-Siberian railway from Ger­
many to China twice a week. Furthermore, in cooperation
with logistics service providers we are deploying the first
all-electric lorries in the transport of goods near the plants.

60
Introduction

With Design for Recycling, we ensure that as many of the
components as possible flow back into the materials cycle
once the vehicle has reached the end of its life cycle. This
leads to lower CO2 emissions in the value chain •.

At some BMW Group locations, the BMW Group has been
using “balancing energy” since 2015 to sell its flexible ca­
pacity from the heat and power it generates in-house.

BMW Energy Services – developing business models
for the energy transition
The newly created business unit BMW Energy Services
operates a number of digital business models that aim to
participate in the energy market of the future and help
drive the energy transition.
In 2015, we founded “Digital Energy Solutions”, a joint ven­
ture company in collaboration with Viessmann. The digital­
ly-based services of Digital Energy Solutions are designed
for small and medium-sized enterprises from trade and
industry. One of the key aims of the business model is to
identify and utilise the potential presented by energy flex­
ibility. Another goal is to effectively use excess volumes of
power – particularly from renewable energy sources – to
bundle the synergies that can be found between the elec­
tricity, heat /cooling and mobility sectors. For example, ex­
cess power from a photovoltaic system can be used to
­d irectly charge the electric vehicle fleet. Customers ben­
efit from this service in three ways: their energy costs are
­ ptimised holistically, their carbon footprint is reduced
o
sus­tainably and they can be sure of improved security of
supply at their company locations. The overall aim of the
joint venture is to achieve the CO2 emissions targets in the
energy, heat and transport sector at low cost, in particular
in Germany and Austria.

In addition, we implement solutions based on used vehicle
battery storage, storing environmentally-friendly but vola­
tile solar and wind energy to be used when required •.

Using raw materials intelligently

• see

Further
key indicators

The environmentally friendly use of raw materials is taken
into account as early as the vehicle development phase via
Life Cycle Engineering •. We shape our supply chain and
material cycles accordingly, allowing us to gradually in­
crease the use of secondary raw materials in our vehicles.
Up to 20 % of the thermoplastic materials in our vehicles
are now made from recyclates (2013 to 2016: up to 20 %).
These materials account for an average of 12 % of vehicle
weight •. We use up to 50 % secondary aluminium in high-­
strength cast aluminium parts. • GRI G4-EN2 Wherever it
makes technical, business and environmental sense and is
socially viable, we replace artificial materials with renew­
able materials. For example, we replaced supports of door
trim panels with natural fibres. These are used in the
BMW i3, BMW 7 and BMW 5 models, among others. This
way, we make a significant contribution towards resource
efficiency.

We carefully consider weight, function and costs in the
use of rare earths. Rare earths are key raw materials for a
number of components in modern vehicles. How we use
rare earths can contribute towards reducing fuel consump­
tion, for example by increasing the efficiency of electrical
systems. In some components, such as the engine fan, we
have completely replaced rare-earth elements that are po­
tentially critical to supply.

End-of-life vehicle recovery and recycling
We do not consider end-of-life vehicles as waste to be dis­
posed of, but rather as a secondary source of raw materials.
Established recovery systems for end-of-life vehicles, com­
ponents and materials ensure that they are reintegrated
into the raw materials cycle.

All BMW Group vehicles brought onto the market since
2008 meet the strictest global requirements set for the re­
cycling of end-of-life vehicles, components and materials
(95 % total recycling, 85 % reuse and material recycling).
At our recycling and dismantling centre (RDZ), we test
new recycling concepts for innovative vehicle components
on an ongoing basis. Furthermore, we promote the imple­
mentation of new recycling technologies, such as the re­
cycling of high-voltage batteries and carbon fibre compo­
nents through cooperation with research institutes and
suppliers. We also intend to close the material cycles in
this area by using secondary raw materials in the produc­
tion of lithium-ion batteries.
In September 2016, we founded the Joint Venture Encory
together with the ALBA Group, which recovers, prepares
and sells used automotive parts. The goal of the company
is to increase recycling of high-quality vehicle parts, as well
as to effectively and efficiently organise the collection and
preparation of used parts.

Avoiding and recycling production waste

Reducing water consumption and waste water

We have already achieved our goal of reducing waste vol­
ume in vehicle production by 45 % by 2020 compared to
the base year 2006. In spite of this, we continue to mini­
mise the amount of waste for disposal, and integrate as
many residual materials as possible into a complete life
cycle management system. We achieve this by improving
our waste separation processes and working hard to find
further recycling and reuse options for the individual
waste types. In 2016, we obtained an official permit for the
Tiexi plant in Shenyang /CN for the recycling of material
from dry separation. The permit makes it possible to use
the material for recycling in a cement plant.

We work on an ongoing basis to reduce our water consump­
tion. In doing so, we place a special focus on production
plants in countries with an increased water risk such as
South Africa, the USA or China. There are currently no
water supply risks at our production plants.

The waste from production that cannot be recycled was
further reduced in 2016 to 3.51 kg per vehicle produced
(– 12.3 % compared to 2015 •). We see this as an indicator
of the effectiveness of our reduction efforts.

• see
table 3.05

The three largest water consumers at the BMW Group are
the sanitary facilities for our workforce (47 %), evaporation,
mainly at cooling towers (around 34 %) and the production
processes, in particular at the paint shops (around 19 %).
We are continuously improving our resource efficiency in
all three areas. During the reporting period, we reduced the
water consumption of our plants in Munich /DE, Regens­
burg /DE and Rosslyn /ZA by optimising processes and
upgrading paint shop facilities as well as by reusing water
from wastewater treatment for production and cooling.

Water consumption per vehicle produced was maintained
roughly at the level of the previous year in 2016 despite
worldwide temperature records with long hot spells (2016:
2.25 m 3, 2015: 2.24 m 3). Energy consumption was reduced
by 31% compared to the base year 2006 •.

Minimising solvents
In our Group-wide environmental efforts, we also aim to
minimise the impact of our emissions of volatile organic
compounds (VOC) on the environment. These are primari­
ly generated in our paint shops. By the end of 2016, VOC
emissions from vehicle production per vehicle produced
had been reduced by 54.6 % compared to 2006, signifi­
cantly exceeding the goal we had set ourselves of a 45 %
reduction by 2020.

With an average of 1.14 kg VOC emissions per vehicle pro­
duced, we are below the stringent maximum levels stipu­
lated in Germany at almost all plants worldwide. The
paint shop is being refurbished at the location in Rosslyn /
ZA, which is the last one that does not yet comply with
the maximum levels stipulated in Germany. According to
predictions, we will also be below these maximum levels
there after the upgrade. The maximum levels stipulated by
the individual countries are also complied with at all pro­
duction locations. VOC emissions per vehicle produced
dropped by 6.6 % in 2016 compared to 2015 •. This was
achieved by implementing further post-combustion meas­
ures as well as through improved process technology (for
example, use of robots at the paint shop in Rosslyn /ZA) in
the global production network, although VOC emissions
increased slightly at two locations due to the introduction
of new processes.

In the coming years, we will continue to pursue our efforts
to increase resource efficiency and in doing so pay particu­
lar attention to the materials needed to expand electromo­
bility. The Group-wide conversion of the environmental
management system according to the revised ISO 14001:
2015 standard will remain a priority.
The new paint shop in our plant in Munich /DE will be
fully operational in the third quarter of 2017. It will con­
tribute towards the reduction in energy and water con­
sumption. Other energy- and water-saving measures are
planned for various locations: for example, a new wastewa­
ter plant at the Regensburg /DE plant, the completion of
the modification of the paint shop in Dingolfing /DE , a
process change in the foundry in Landshut / DE, the comple­
tion of the factory refurbishment in Rosslyn /ZA and the
plant expansion in Shenyang /CN.
From 2019 onwards, our new plant in Mexico, which is
currently under construction, will make a significant con­
tribution to our resource efficiency. From its first full pro­
duction year, it is expected to become the most resourceefficient plant of the BMW Group.

Renewable energy plays a crucial role in the reduction of
CO2 emissions. In order to tackle the effects of climate
change, we are expanding our own production of renew­
able electricity at our locations and increasingly using
electricity from renewable sources on a global scale. This
way, we improve our environmental performance, support
the development of sustainable energy generation and
contribute towards protecting the climate. Last but not
least, this approach is consistent with our understanding
of sustainable mobility with vehicles that are produced with
the lowest emissions possible. Our commitment is also fi­
nancially sound, since green energy is becoming increas­
ingly cheaper thanks to technological advancements.

We are increasingly using renewable energy along the en­
tire value chain. Besides promoting renewable energy in
vehicle utilisation •, our main focus is on our own plants.
A large share of CO2 emissions in the manufacture of our
products is generated by our suppliers. That’s why we sup­
port the use of renewable energy in our supply chain, too.
In 2016, we continued to expand our use of renewable en­
ergy to 63 % •. The steady increase in green electricity
shows that our measures are taking effect. The changing
political and economic situation prevent an even quicker
expansion at many locations. In this regard, we continu­
ously strive to find technically as well as economically and
politically viable solutions.

We decide at each location which form of renewable en­
ergy makes the most sense in view of local conditions.
A number of different technologies are therefore used to
generate energy at our locations.
We make producing our own renewable energy a priority.
If this is not possible due to prevailing conditions, we pur­
chase green electricity locally as far as possible. At all lo­
cations we continuously work on increasing the amount of
electricity from renewable sources. For this purpose, we
conduct regular country analyses in which we regularly
assess the political and economic conditions. This regular­
ity is necessary as local legislations regarding renewable
energy are amended continually. We have already conclud­
ed these for Germany and the UK and are implementing
appropriate measures. We started assessing the situation
in the USA in 2016.

As far as possible at new plants, we integrate renewable en­
ergy into planning from the start. An example of this is
our plant in Mexico, which is currently under construction.
We cover the basic load of the plant with photovoltaic
electricity from our own solar energy facility. Grounds for
the building of photovoltaic systems were first earmarked
in the initial planning stage.

to achieve the highest level of transparency with regard to
energy consumption. These measures enabled us to reduce
peak electricity consumption of the building by 30 % com­
pared to the condition before the renovation. Our own
photovoltaic system covers a major part of the remaining
electricity demand.

One of our measures of the previous year took full effect
in our plant in South Africa: the Bio2Watt system, which
is operated with biogas from cow and chicken farm waste
as well as food production waste and has supplied our
plant in Rosslyn /ZA with CO2 -free electricity since 2015,
had its first full operational year in 2016. In total, it sup­
plied 15,844 MW h electricity, which corresponds to 25 %
of the total electricity requirement of the plant.

The new computer centre, which is built in Aschheim /DE
outside of Munich /DE and used by the BMW Group as a

the final expansion. A sophisticated cooling concept ­using
very efficient air/air-heat exchangers provides ­climate con­
trol with the lowest electricity consumption possible.

Computer centres also require great quantities of electric­
ity. We therefore pay attention to energy efficiency, use the
highest possible amount of green electricity and also try to
find climate-neutral solutions in the creation of conditions.
For example, we cool our computer centre in ­Munich /DE
with groundwater from wells along the M
­ unich metro
line. In this way, no CO2 emissions are generated through
cooling.

Using renewable energies: hydropower plants on the Columbia River
­supply the Moses Lake facility.

Besides production plants, we are also active in our office
buildings. We have extensively renovated our new BMW
Classic building in Munich /DE and equipped it with a
photovoltaic system. Furthermore, we carried out energy-­
based refurbishment in our Head Office in South Africa
and achieved a 5 -star rating from the Green Building
Council SA (GBCSA). The building received the highest
scores in the area of energy, based on the photovoltaic
system installed on the roof of the building, among other
things. Moreover, electricity meters were installed in order

Like our plants in Germany, our computer centres here are
also operated with a mix of energy, of which the share of
green electricity is a lot higher than that of the German
electricity network. In 2016, our plants and computer
centres in Germany were supplied with more than 80 %
green electricity.
Another computer centre of the BMW Group is located in
Iceland, where the entire electricity demand is covered by
geothermal energy and water power.

Promoting renewable energy in the
supply chain
We also promote the use of renewable energy in our supply
chain. Our work begins at the strategic level: based on
information we draw from our suppliers as part of the
• Supply Chain Programmes (CDP) •, we reach agreements with
our suppliers that they will increase the share of renew­
able energy they use. We assess the CO2 performance as
part of annual Supplier Performance Reviews for our top
100 suppliers. The share of renewable energy is one of the
ten points that are relevant for the BMW Group. This
means that the reported share of renewable energy is
compared to that of a reference group, and required a­ ction
is derived on this basis. We regularly come to agreements
with clients on how to increase this share. A particularly
outstanding example from 2016 is the DRÄXLMAIER
Group, a family-owned enterprise and one of the top 100
automotive providers worldwide with the focus area of
vehicle electrical and interior systems. The DRÄXLMAIER
Group agreed to switch to renewable gas and electricity
for all locations in Germany and Austria, and then imple­
mented this in 2016. In addition, the BMW Group has com­
municated science-based targets in its own public CDP
reporting – and a complete shift to renewable energy is
required to achieve these. We ask all suppliers involved in
the CDP Supply Chain Programme to check that their
emission goals for the reporting period of 2017 are com­
pliant and to formulate their own science-based targets.
This process cannot be implemented without a clear strat­
egy change towards renewable energy.

Forecast
In the coming years, we will examine the conditions for the
expansion of renewable energy in other countries and take
appropriate measures.
• see
chapter 3.3

For example, as of 2017, 30 % of the electricity requirements
of our branch in Stuttgart /DE will be met by a photovoltaic
system. In Mexico, the construction of the solar energy fa­
cility in the new plant in San Luis Potosí is scheduled so
that carbon-free energy will be available to the plant at the
start of production in 2018.
In addition, we will continue to move forward with our
strategic analyses for the best solution for carbon-free ener­
gy supply in the USA as an important market with one of
the largest production plants of the BMW Group.
Aside from the use of green electricity, we work on de­
veloping strategies to meet the future heat and energy re­
quirements of our locations worldwide without generating
emissions.

Much of the value added is created by our suppliers. The
global growth of the BMW Group creates ever more com­
plex supply chains. The implementation of environmental
and social standards along the entire value chain is one of
our greatest challenges. We work closely with our suppli­
ers to increase transparency and resource efficiency in the
supply chain and ensure that sustainability standards are
complied with. Only by fulfilling our social and environ­
mental responsibility can we secure the sustainability of
our business model.

The basis for increasing transparency and resource efficien­
cy is our • BMW Group Supplier Sustainability Standards, which
establish social and environmental criteria for our sup­
pliers as well as their suppliers. The minimum require­
ments to be satisfied by all suppliers are complemented by
specific requirements for selected projects.
In order to ensure compliance with the sustainability re­
quirements, we use an industry-wide sustainability ques­
tionnaire as part of our risk management process. The
resulting evaluation of our suppliers is a crucial criterion
for order placement. The individual production plants of
the supplier are taken into account in this – not just the
headquarters. Together with our suppliers, we develop
approaches for more efficient handling of resources. We
also analyse the impact of selected raw materials or mater­
ials along the entire supply chain and support specific
initiatives to increase sustainability.

The BMW Group works with over 12,000 direct suppliers.

We were able to make significant progress in 2016:
– During the reporting period, 5,616 (2015: 1,900)
potential and existing supplier locations were evaluated
via a sustainability questionnaire. The evaluated
­sustainability is a tendering criteria for almost all our
parts suppliers • Retrieve self-assessment questionnaire.
– More and more suppliers are now satisfying our
­m inimum requirements at the time of commission­
ing. 38 % of suppliers commissioned in 2016 already
had ISO 14001 certification. We demand that desig­
nated supplier locations comply with minimum
requirements by the start of production or agreed
target date at the latest.
– Suppliers who took part in the Supply Chain Pro­
gramme of the CDP in 2016 made up 69 % of the
BMW Group purchasing volume in 2016 (2015: 53 %).
This meant that transparency concerning CO2 emis­
sions in the supplier chain was significantly increased.
Suppliers taking part in the programme reported
an overall reduction of around 36 million tonnes in
CO2 emissions (2015: 35 million t). In addition, we
have started to reach agreements with individual
suppliers on pilot projects to reduce emissions on
this basis.

We aim to train as many of our purchasers as possible.
During the reporting period, 156 purchasers took part in
a face-to-face training course in sustainability which in­
cludes social, ecological and governance topics. 53 pur­
chasers underwent specific training in administration of
the sustainability questionnaire.

Principles and standards for suppliers
For the BMW Group, it is essential that our business part­
ners meet the same environmental and social standards
we have set ourselves. The BMW Group Supplier Sustain­
ability Standards stipulate compliance with internationally
recognised human rights as well as environmental, labour
and social standards for all suppliers of the BMW Group.
The BMW Group Sustainability Standard is an integral
part of the request for proposal documentation for new
suppliers and is thus a key tool in the integration of sus­
tainability aspects into the procurement process.

We also provided training to 25 of our suppliers as part of
a two-day certificate course (2015: 20) and carried out
cross-­industry training courses for BMW suppliers with
identifiable sustainability deficits in China and the Czech
Republic. More than 120 employees of our suppliers were
trained on the topic of sustainability, with a focus on social
standards. Another area of focus was raising awareness
among 17 BMW Group logistics providers at an industrywide event. In addition, we held a two-day basic training
programme on sustainability as part of the Supplier Train­
ing Days in Mexico City in June.

Each potential new supplier must take into consideration
the BMW Group sustainability requirements when submit­
ting a proposal. All agreements concluded by BMW AG
with its suppliers contain clauses based on the principles
of the • UN Global Compact and the • International Labour Orga­
nization (ILO). These agreements also specify that a contrac­
tual commitment must be made to comply with human
rights, labour and social standards as well as to implement
environmental management systems and specific environ­
mental protection measures • BMW Group website on supplier

In January 2016, we used the industry-wide event “Auto­
motive Supply Chain Forum – Enhancing Sustainability
Through OEM – Supplier Collaboration” in Shanghai /CN
to train top managers and operations employees of 33 of
our suppliers onsite on specific requirements of the
BMW Group.

network.

When they sign the contract, our suppliers also commit to
ensuring that their suppliers in turn comply with these
agreements. Accordingly, our suppliers are instructed to
ensure that sustainability criteria are also met in the up­
stream supply chain.

In order to identify risks, we use a BMW Group-specific
sustainability risk filter. This filter takes account of both
regional and product-specific risks. This includes, for in­
stance, an assessment of social risks in certain countries,
such as child labour or forced labour. However, we also
consider process materials containing substances that can
be hazardous to health and environmental risks such as
damage to nature and emissions.

2. Retrieve self-assessment questionnaire
Before nomination, each production and distribution loca­
tion of the supplier must provide information about how
they implement environmental, social and governance
standards in an industry-specific sustainability question­
naire. Information regarding observance of human rights
and bans on forced labour, resource-conserving material
use, as well as ISO 14001 or EMAS environmental man­
agement systems is collected. • GRI G4-EN32, GRI G4-LA14, GRI G4‑HR10,

By establishing sustainability requirements in the tender­
ing process, a number of our suppliers have taken decisive
measures to better integrate sustainability into the organi­
sation and processes of their companies. Specific measures,
such as a comprehensive changeover to renewable energy,
have already been initiated •.
If a low sustainability level is identified on a supplier’s
questionnaire, we communicate the industry-wide stand­
ard recommendations to them. In order to ensure that
such a supplier qualifies for nomination in the tendering
process, the BMW AG purchaser requires that improve­
ment measures be implemented by start of production at
the latest. If required, we supplement the supply agree­
ments with corrective action plans and binding rules, such
as the certification of the health and safety management
system. This ensures that all sustainability requirements
are met by the time the supplier begins providing services.

3. Carry out assessments and audits
If the sustainability risk filter, media screening and /or sus­
tainability questionnaire identify selected supplier loca­
tions that demonstrate an increased risk of non-compliance
with sustainability standards, they are checked and quali­
fied by independent sustainability audits or BMW Group
sustainability assessments. The sustainability audits are
carried out by external auditors, while the sustainability
assessments are implemented by employees of the
BMW Group. In 2016, 15 audits (2015: 11) and 28 (2015: 2)
assessments were conducted. Sustainability assessments
have been carried out since the end of 2015. Crucial areas
of action identified by audits and assessments have been
highlighted, particularly in the areas of hazardous sub­
stance management, waste management and general work­
ing conditions.

During the reporting period, our employees from procure­
ment introduced the process for identifying and evaluating
sustainability risks at 5,616 potential and existing supplier
locations related to production and relevant sub-supplier
locations (2015: 1,900). Sustainability deficits were identi­
fied at 3,368 potential and existing supplier locations and
corrective measures to remedy the sustainability deficits
were defined for 2,353 (2015: around 400). The key correc­
tive measures from the perspective of the • UN Global Compact
were related to implementation of the following aspects:

If the results of an audit or assessment show non-compli­
ance or potential for improvement, we work with the sup­
plier to develop a specific plan of action and provide as
much assistance as possible with implementation, which
generally must take place before start of production. If the
supplier is uncooperative or in breach of a fundamental
BMW Group sustainability clause, the contract may not
be granted or termination of business relations may follow.
Our goal, however, is to determine the majority of risks
during the first two stages, to manage these risks and to
help suppliers raise their sustainability standards.

779 supplier locations implemented the corrective meas­
ures by the end of 2016. Confirmation that the corrective
measures have been implemented by the supplier is a pre­
requisite for commissioning. 650 supplier locations were
not commissioned because they did not meet the sustain­
ability requirements of the BMW Group, among other
things. We have not, however, terminated any existing
cooperation. We regard this as confirmation of the success
of our risk management approach of addressing and de­
manding sustainability requirements early on in the pro­
curement process. • GRI G4-EN33, GRI G4-LA15, GRI G4-HR11, GRI G4-SO10

Our Supply Chain Response Team responds to indications
of potential non-compliance with our sustainability prin­
ciples. The team is made up of a representative from Opera­
tional and Strategic Purchasing, Corporate Strategy (sus­
tainability experts), Corporate Communications as well as
the works council. In 2016, the Supply Chain Response
Team follows up three indications of three potential breach­
es of sustainability requirements, which were related to
non-compliance with freedom of association, child labour
as well as inappropriate treatment of animals. These cases
are currently being reviewed and processed. • GRI G4-EN33,

Improving resource efficiency
In addition to our sustainability risk management system,
we use the Supply Chain Programme of the • CDP to in­
crease resource efficiency and transparency in the supply
chain.
We have been involved in the Supply Chain Programme of
the CDP since 2014. With a coverage rate of 69 %, we have
already achieved our goal of having significantly more than
50 % of our production-related purchasing volume covered
by the CDP reporting of our suppliers by 2016. In the
coming years we will be placing the focus on stabilising the
participating supplier group, increasing transparency and
implementing measures to reduce emissions.
Within the CDP, participating suppliers report on their
CO2 status and, if applicable, the water consumption sta­
tus of the respective reporting period. The Supply Chain
Report answers a number of qualitative and quantitative
questions: from targets and initiatives, to risk management,
through to integration into the corporate strategy, from
CO2 emissions through to the share of renewable energy.
An overall evaluation verifies the completeness and content
of the answers. The results are fed into the purchasing
strategies of the relevant departments and a competitive
comparison is played back to the key suppliers during their
annual supplier development interviews. During these
interviews we discuss the action required with the top
managers of our suppliers and agree on specific improve­
ment measures. In the reporting period this included fur­
ther increase in transparency, particularly in the area of
indirect emissions, and – in the case that this has already
been achieved – measures to reduce emissions, for example
by increasing the percentage of renewable energy.

Given the intermediate trade and processing stages and
commodities trading on the stock exchange, implement­
ing sustainability standards as early as the raw materials
ex­t raction stage is quite a challenge for both us and our
suppliers.

Resource-efficient 40-tonner: the electric trucks that drive to BMW Group plants
­produce 21 tonnes less CO2 per year than a diesel truck.

Of the 163 BMW suppliers participating in the CDP in 2016
(2015: 99), 83 % (2015: 84 %) integrated measures to combat
climate change into their corporate strategy and 68 % (2015:
64 %) also set themselves corresponding targets. 81 % (2015:
80 %) of participating suppliers already reported reduced
emissions for individual projects and 45 % (2015: 35 %) were
even able to keep their overall CO2 emissions constant or
reduce them. Savings of around 36 million tonnes of CO2
equivalent were reported to us from our supplier network
for the year 2016 (2015: 35 million t). These savings mainly
resulted from an increase in energy efficiency in production
processes and from optimisation of transport processes.
The rising number of suppliers in the CDP and the positive
results that have been achieved thus far would seem to
indicate that our efforts to increase transparency and re­
source efficiency in the supply chain are effective.

The BMW Group Supplier Sustainability Standards oblige
our suppliers to ensure that their own suppliers also com­
ply with our sustainability requirements. Furthermore, our
potential influence on sub-suppliers is restricted given the
number of global suppliers.
We have identified particularly critical raw materials in our
material strategy. For these, we analyse the relevant need
for action and derive the procedure as well as specific meas­
ures for joint implementation with our supplier network.
In terms of quantity and costs, steel is one of the main raw
materials used in production by the BMW Group. Due to
this particular relevance, we aim to gradually increase
transparency in steel supply chains. We therefore exam­
ined supply chains from the mine to production and de­
termined such factors as the CO2 emissions of the suppli­
ers as part of a pilot study. The result revealed that the
CO2 emissions of individual BMW suppliers per tonne of
steel are substantially lower compared to the previously
known and used average industrial values.
Aluminium is another main raw material of the BMW Group.
Besides increasing the amount of secondary aluminium, we
are committed to establishing a certification standard for
aluminium along the value chain. In addition, as a found­
ing member of the • Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI), the
BMW Group is active in both its Board of Management and
standards committee. In 2016, the necessary governance
structures of the ASI as an independent institution were
developed, the member base significantly enlarged and
public consultation on the traceability report, the so-called
Chain-of-Custody Standard, carried out.

Another relevant raw material is cobalt which is used in
batteries, among other things. We are aware of the risks
involved in extracting cobalt and receive many requests
from interested parties regarding this. In order to ensure
respect of human rights and due diligence, we are in con­
stant contact with our suppliers. For some years now, we
have asked our suppliers to disclose the origin of this raw
material. As cobalt is a raw material involving high risks
in terms of human rights, we also work on establishing a
transparent supply chain. Individual companies alone can­
not reduce the human rights risks of cobalt extraction.
For this reason, we initiated an exchange with suppliers,
other companies and representatives of civil society and
organised a round table on the topic of cobalt in coopera­
tion with CSR Europe in November 2016.

Since 2009, every supplier has had to complete a sustainability questionnaire
before being awarded a new contract.

We invited key players to discuss potential further steps
with us and find practical approaches. We also have an
active role in the Responsible Cobalt Initiative (RCI). At
the same time, we have commissioned a scientific study
together with other companies, in which households, min­
ers as well as other figures involved in the Democratic
Republic of Congo were surveyed. The goal is to better
understand the lead-ups to the current situation in order
to derive appropriate measures.
As regards the supply chain of the natural fibre kenaf,
which is used for the interior equipment of the BMW i3, we
are working in Bangladesh together with our suppliers, the
DRÄXLMAIER Group, to ensure sustainable production.
The programme includes training activities for farmers in
order to increase cultivation efficiency and fibre quality.
960 farmers have taken part in these activities so far. De­
velopment of a more transparent and leaner supply chain
as well as implementation of measures to increase sustain­
ability in the supply chain are also part of the programme.
Within our sustainability questionnaire, all of our suppliers
are systematically consulted about conflict minerals and
asked to report back on their status regarding absence of
conflict. This way, sustainability criteria on raw materials
extraction flow into our supplier selection process. We
there­fore work continuously on improving transparency
in order to ensure far-reaching absence of conflict in the
supply chains.

We are incrementally implementing our new material strat­
egy in the selection of materials for our future vehicle pro­
duction. As of 2017, there will be new BMW Group speci­
fications for suppliers on supply chain transparency. The
objective is to create traceability right through to the rele­
vant sub-suppliers, particularly for critical supply chains.
With the inclusion of sub-suppliers, we strive to significant­
ly increase transparency in our supply chain even further
in the coming years.
In addition, the rise in energy efficiency and increase in the
share of renewable energy in the supply chain will con­
tribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions. Membership of
CDP enabled us to integrate CO2 scoring of our suppliers
into the supplier strategy of our procurement departments.
We are currently working on joint measures with CDP
within the automotive industry in order to strengthen this
approach.

What are the main challenges nowadays for a global
­company acting across different cultures ?
Every organisation operating at a global level faces the
challenge of balance. The influence of cultural norms
applies to those you serve and your staff. The best global
organisations are constantly learning how best to
­balance core values of the organisation with the values
of the societies in which they work. Integrating those
values effectively leads to success.

Initiatives such as the Business Call to Action and the
UN Global Compact provide direct linkages between the
private sector and the UN. The public sector can develop
strategic goals and targets to measure progress to those
goals, but cannot reach them without a broader partnership. The private sector has the ability to use innovation,
increased efficiencies, and rapidly improving technology
to reach these objectives. Doing good while doing well –
this is the essence of corporate social responsibility.

What do you think a company needs to do to promote
diversity within its organisation?
Diversity is a core value. Greater inclusion is good for an
organisation as it expands on the sources of talent it can
access. It is also good for society as it expands opportunity
for those who might otherwise be left out. Recruitment,
promotion and retention processes need to reflect that
core value.

How do you view the BMW Group’s approach on
­sustainability?
BMW Group has been comprehensive in its approach,
addressing the products they make as well as the way in
which they make those products. More electric vehicles,
increasing use of renewable energy sources, reducing the
amount of hazardous materials created during construction, these are core elements of sustainability. BMW Group
has also recognised diversity as part of this equation, a
concept reflected in its human resource policies and
through its support to intercultural understanding through
the Intercultural Innovation Award in collaboration with
the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC).

How can the private sector contribute to the achievement
of the UN Sustainability Goals?
The Sustainable Development Goals are a universal call
to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure
that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. They represent
a common plan to address the world’s most pressing
problems. They point the way to peaceful, inclusive societies, which, in turn, provide the healthiest environments
for business. The UN recognises the need to connect its
efforts with the complimentary efforts of the private sector.

RELEVANCE
FOR BMW GROUP
Foresight and flexibility is called for when it comes to the
increasing average age of the world population, far-reaching
changes in the working world brought about by digitalisation
and automation coupled with a greater diversity of lifestyles
and cultures among employees. As a company that is currently
active in over 150 countries, the BMW Group is responding
to these developments worldwide. By helping our employees
to acquire the relevant expertise and skill sets, we provide the
flexibility and capabilities to successfully master these trends.
We therefore offer employees personal development oppor­tu­
nities over the course of their entire career. In this way, we
foster their diverse talents and help them to develop their potential so that we can lay the groundwork for our future success.

In an ageing society, we can only be successful in the long
term if we contribute towards ensuring that our employees
remain healthy. Maintaining the health and performance
of our employees is therefore a top priority at BMW. Our
occupational health and safety concept provides for a holis­
tic health management programme with a focus on healthy
canteen meals, integrated management of work safety and
ergonomics as well as ageing-appropriate work systems.

The measures we have implemented have enabled us to
avoid occupational accidents and reduce absenteeism as
well as health-related costs. With fewer absences and more
motivated employees, the BMW Group is able to keep its
HR costs competitive. Our health promotion activities also
pay off in other ways as they lead to more creativity, prod­
uctivity and innovation. The success of our efforts is demonstrated by the low rate of absenteeism due to illness,
which last year was again below the industry average.

Fostering health and performance
in a holistic manner
We foster our employees’ health and performance holistic­
ally through the BMW Group Health Initiative. The initia­
tive raises greater awareness for the importance of health
with offerings ranging all the way from general medical
check-ups and targeted physiotherapy, nutritional advice
and relaxation exercises to dialogue-based events and
manager training courses.
We also offer an extensive prevention and rehabilitation
programme. This includes fitness courses and other sports
activities as well as nutrition seminars and courses on
work safety as well as ergonomics and stress management.
The current international campaigns “Healthy drinking”,
“Safe walking” and “Mental resilience” show employees
how even small changes can improve their everyday lives.
Regular special events draw attention to important topics
such as resilience, cancer prevention and addiction hazards. They are designed to motivate employees and execu­
tives to become proactive in these areas.

Health Management 2020: promoting
­personal ­responsibility
The “Health Management 2020” programme is a holistic,
internationally focused approach to fostering the long-term
health and performance of our employees throughout their
working life.
The programme follows a cycle of four stages:
1. Building knowledge about health, for example through
information, talks, seminars and training courses
2. Identifying health issues by means of a questionnaire
and thorough medical check-up

3. Deriving and developing needs-based measures, both
individually (on the basis of the personal health reports
and medical consultations provided) and at the departmental level
4. A repeat check-up to evaluate improvements in health
associated with the programme

Since the introduction of the “Health Management 2020”
programme in 2014, over 47,000 BMW Group employees
have taken part, including 15,000 in 2016 alone. This corresponds to around 42 %, or 13 % of the core workforce
worldwide. All participants receive a personal health report, which gives the employee an easy-to-understand
summary of his or her medical and work-related param­
eters. In the subsequent medical consultation, prevention
measures can be derived based on individual needs.
At departmental level, approximately 200 reports were
compiled in 2016, identifying a range of strengths and potential improvements in the areas of health promotion and
the working environment. Possible measures range from
helping employees in the process of better reconciling fami­
ly life and career to ergonomic improvements. The programme thus contributes both to reinforcing individuals’
sense of personal responsibility and to designing a healthy
­working environment. In 2017, the first departments will
have completed the evaluation cycle. We will then use the
results to comprehensively assess the impact of the programme.

Working with new technologies
Working with new technologies and increasing automation presents
the company with new challenges in terms of occupational health and
safety. For example, the BMW Group is taking a very close look at the
area of human-machine collaboration, with one focus in 2016 being to
ensure the safe operation of autonomous tugger trains. We collaborated here with the professionals in the occupational safety association as
well as the manufacturers. Now that the pilot applications have been
tested in Dingolfing, Regensburg and Leipzig, the tugger trains are ready
for productive use in further BMW Group locations in the coming year.

Integrated health and safety management
At present, 28 of our 31 production locations have occupational health and safety management systems ­certified
according to the OHRIS (Occupational Health and Risk
Management System) or OHSAS (Occupational Health and
Safety Assessment Series). We plan to certify the plant we
are building in Mexico according to OHSAS 18001 by 2020.
In addition, active occupational health and safety committees with representation from both the employer and employee sides, in particular works councils, are at work at
almost all BMW Group locations making continuous improvements in health and safety at the workplace. • GRI G4-LA8
Well over 90 % of employees are represented on these health
and safety committees by union representatives (works
councils). This figure also includes temporary workers, interns, thesis students working at the company as well as
doctoral candidates. • GRI G4-LA5

There have been no fatal accidents at the BMW Group for
the last eleven years. • GRI G4-LA7 In 2011, we set ourselves
the target of reducing the accident frequency rate worldwide to below 4.5 accidents per one million hours worked
by 2020. This is a decrease of around 50 % compared to the
rate in 2010. This figure includes all accidents that lead
to at least one day of absence from work. Continuous improvement of occupational health and safety systems and
workplace safety conditions as well as dedicated safety
training courses already helped us to beat this target in
2015. In 2016, we worked even more closely together within our global network by way of workshops and expert
groups as well as on the BMW Group’s own social platform in order to further improve work safety. In addition,
we were able for the first time to record accidents across
the entire BMW Group. The accident frequency rate at
the BMW Group was 4.0 accidents per one million hours
worked. • This represents a further improvement over the
previous year.
The accident frequency rates recorded differ worldwide,
due in part to varying legal and insurance-related requirements in the respective countries. In some cases, the differences are also due to regional variations in how the
applicable management system standards are applied.
Particularly in our plants in South America and Asia, we
were able in some cases to realise a rate of fewer than two
accidents per one million hours worked last year. To
achieve this low rate, work safety experts are working
hand-in-hand with colleagues from the corporate departments of the BMW Group to develop management systems
ensuring that existing knowledge is put to ­effective use.

Demographic change is a challenge that we at the
BMW Group are actively addressing. We have been developing constructive responses to this trend for many years
now in our “Today for Tomorrow” programme. We aim to
create working conditions worldwide in which young employees can remain healthy as they grow older, while older
employees can contribute their particular strengths. The
BMW Group therefore speaks not of age-appropriate but
of ageing-appropriate working conditions that preserve
employee health and performance.

As a global enterprise, the BMW Group must observe varying requirements with regard to assessing the workplace for potential hazards
from the point of view of ergonomics and safety. We met this challenge
in 2016 by introducing SERA (Safety and Ergonomics Risk Assessment).
The system replaces the former ABATech system for analysing potential health and safety risks as well as other methods previously used in
the BMW Group. The introduction of SERA simplifies the procedure for
assessing hazards and exposure in production, in production-related
areas, in development and in the BMW Group service ­garages, thus offering a comprehensive solution. The user selects a specific workplace
on the tablet-optimised interface and all working steps for that activity
are then assessed. The system captures and evaluates for example the
forces required for the individual work steps as well as their duration
and the posture adopted by the worker. After a workplace has been assessed using SERA, the office for health and safety and ergonomics then
advises on how excessive stress and strain can be minimised by modifying the technical conditions, altering the work step or by staff rotation.
SERA was introduced at five German locations in 2016. Training sessions lasting 1.5 days familiarise those in charge with the new system.
The entire new vehicle development process is already being assessed
with the help of SERA and the international rollout is planned for 2017.

table 4.02

At our plants, we make every effort to provide long-term
job security to employees with debilitating health issues.
And last year we continued to develop our BMW Group
strategy for integrating employees with newly restricted
capabilities. Such employees are no longer able to do the
work they once did following an illness or accident. The
share of BMW AG employees with severe disabilities was
again 6.4 % in 2016 •.

Due to its success, the “Health Management 2020 ” pro­
gramme will continue to be implemented and evaluated
internationally in 2017. The campaigns launched in 2015
and 2016 as part of the “Health Initiative” will likewise
continue in 2017 and new campaigns are also being pre­
pared. We will continue to meet the challenge of integrat­
ing the varying worldwide requirements and standards
into our BMW Group management approach. In future,
our target agreements will also be drafted in a similar way
worldwide. The global rollout of the SERA system in 2017
will be a major step toward ensuring uniform internatio­
nal safety and prevention standards. Through innovative
measuring techniques such as motion capture, digitalisa­
tion can help employees to keep ergonomic factors in mind
as they work. We will focus on driving further digitalisa­
tion of measurements and measuring technology in the
future. Human-machine collaborations will increase in the
coming years. Occupational safety and health systems will
then face the challenge of technically assessing the impact
of these new processes.

 T he share of employees with severe disabilities is based on the statutory requirements in
accordance with the German Social Code (SGB IX). In addition, the BMW Group awarded
contracts amounting to around €35.6 million to workshops for the severely disabled in
­G ermany in 2016, of which around €10.5 million can be written off in accordance with the
compensatory levy act. The BMW Group thus makes a considerable contribution towards
securing the livelihood of the severely disabled individuals at these workshops.

As one of the world’s most attractive employers, the
BMW Group has a decisive advantage in the competition
for skilled workers. This is demonstrated, for example, by
studies on the attractiveness of employers conducted by
Trendence and Universum, in which we were once again
given top ratings in 2016.

table 4.03

Offering fair pay and attractive social benefits

Satisfied and motivated employees are a key success factor
for the BMW Group. Job security is therefore a high priority for us. We pay above-average compensation and give
our employees a range of options to help them find the
right work-life balance. The BMW Group also attaches
great importance to the training and further education of
our employees •. This is essential for keeping pace with
the rapid technological advances in the automotive industry. Increasing digitalisation, for example, calls for new
skills in fields including artificial intelligence, Big Data ana­
lytics and Industry 4.0. The BMW Group thus consistently
pursues the concept of life-long learning.

The BMW Group policies for remuneration and additional
benefits apply for all of our companies and regardless of
employees’ gender, religion, origin, age, disability, sexual
orientation or country-specific characteristics. We follow
the guiding principle that the total remuneration package
must be above the average for the respective labour market. We thus conduct annual compensation studies worldwide to determine our current market positioning and
ensure that every employee receives compensation commensurate with the relevant labour market. • GRI G4-LA13

The total remuneration package is made up of the monthly fixed salary, a variable share in the company’s profits and
a wide range of social benefits, for example a company pension. This enables us to reward personal performance in
a fair manner while continuously promoting employee
motivation. Our remuneration policy is thus an integral
part of a consistent and transparent process of employee
development. • GRI G4-LA2 In 2016, BMW AG received the
HR Excellence Award in the digitalisation category for its
company pension portal and app.
In order to ensure that remuneration is not only marketneutral but also gender-neutral, the BMW Group has established a multidimensional monitoring process to annually
assess the previous year’s salaries. The monthly salaries of
women and men are compared, taking into account the
dimensions of full- or part-time work, pay grade and age.
The analysis carried out in 2016 for the year 2015 found no
significant differences between the base salaries of women
and men. • GRI G4-LA13

Through the concept of the working time account, all employees can exert some influence over their working hours.
Office employees can take advantage of flextime, for example, or production staff can trade shifts or reduce their
hours to gain some free days. In addition to statutory working time arrangements in some countries such as part-time
work or parental or caregiver leave, the BMW Group also
offers employees options such as sabbaticals or the “Vollzeit
Select” (Full-time Select) scheme to provide further attractive ways to individually plan working hours. Sabbaticals
can be arranged by employees worldwide, and our “Vollzeit
Select” working time tool allows employees in Germany
and Austria to take 20 additional days of leave each year
with corresponding adjustments to their salaries, without
any complicated red tape. Demand for these options continued to grow in 2016 •. The offer of flexible working
time arrangements thus meets a real need and will therefore continue to be developed further.

The working hours that function best for employees vary
depending on what phase of life they are in, their individual life plans and their work situation. To enable the best
possible work-life balance, the BMW Group offers its employees a wide range of flexible modules so they can tailor
their working hours and locations to their personal needs.

• see
table 4.04

In 2015, some 25,000 employees, or around 50 % of those
working outside the direct production areas, chose to work
at least one partial and / or full day on a mobile basis. This
value was then already exceeded in the second quarter of
2016 •. Mobile working does not change the volume of
work but allows for a more flexible organisation of existing
working hours. Childcare or caring for dependents, for
example, can then be better integrated into the everyday
work routine. The employee and manager agree in advance
to what extent the employee will be accessible or not. Outside of agreed working hours, employees have the right
to switch off and be unavailable. Mobile working at the
BMW Group stands for a culture of trust and relies on constructive dialogue.

Fostering talent and training employees

Supporting parents through childcare
The BMW Group has been offering its employees family
support services for many years. In 2016, we launched a
collaboration with the parent support service of the Arbei­
terwohlfahrt (Workers’ Welfare Association, AWO) in Germany. Experts from the AWO’s parent support service are
available to help employees in Germany organise childcare
and care for dependents as well as arranging household
services. A hotline is also available to employees around
the clock, offering quick help in case of emergency. Through
services like these, we ease life’s burdens on our employees
and contribute to their long-term performance.
In addition, we have established childcare services at
many of our German locations. With the support of parents’ initiatives, we were able to accommodate over 460
children aged zero to six years at our German sites as of
the end of 2016.

In a dynamic and fast-changing environment, life-long
learning takes on tremendous importance. We therefore
invest in training our employees and fostering their talents
on an ongoing basis. This helps them keep up with the
latest advances and gives them the skills they need to master the demands of new fields such as Industry 4.0 and
digitalisation. The BMW Group’s global package of measures ranges from vocational training and young talent programmes for student target groups to specialised training
and high-potential programmes for future managers.

• see
table 4.05

The BMW Group continued to invest substantially in training and further education in 2016, with expenditure of
€ 352 million (2015: € 352 million). On average, our employees participated in 3.8 days of further training in
2016 •. • GRI G4-LA9 This puts us in the upper range for our
industry. Furthermore, every BMW Group employee receives a consistent and comprehensive individual perform­
ance and career development review at least once a year.

With a greater number of employees taking part in vocational training at plants in locations including the USA
and Thailand, the BMW Group further expanded its international training activities in 2016. The number of
people starting their careers at the company’s German
training centres remained constant, at 1,200. On the reporting date, 4,613 young people had vocational training
contracts or were employed in young talent promotion
programmes (2015: 4,700) •. We use the dual vocational
training system in China, the USA, South Africa and the

Digitalisation changes the characteristics of products and
services and influences how they are developed, manufactured and deployed. Production processes are obviously
being transformed, but the BMW Group is also developing
new, digitally networked automobiles that will one day be
able to drive completely autonomously. These changes will
inevitably affect the way our employees work. Our goal is
therefore to equip existing employees with the required
knowledge as well as to recruit new “digital talents”.

Developing leadership skills
Our Group-wide “Corporate Leadership Programme” offers our managers a wide range of advanced training opportunities. The programme promotes the further development of strengths-based leadership skills at all hierarchy
levels.
To foster international young talent, the BMW Group developed the “Global Leader Development Programme”.
Integral components of the programme are various practical phases in Germany and abroad, targeted training
measures, and diverse networking and exchange opportunities. Special emphasis is placed on developing intercultural competence. • GRI G4-LA10

Achieving a low attrition rate
In 2016, the employee attrition rate rose compared to the
previous year, to 2.70 % •. This was mainly due to more
employees retiring in 2016 •. If figures for retirement,
pre-­retirement and death are excluded, the attrition rate
for 2016 was 1.13 %. This low rate demonstrates the effect­
iveness of the BMW Group’s proven programmes and
measures geared toward increasing its attractiveness as an
employer.

regards an intercultural workforce, an appropriate gender
balance and a good age mix as beneficial to our business.
We are convinced that a diverse workforce increases our
innovative strength and further enhances our competi­
tiveness, for example by helping us to better understand
customers’ needs.

Each and every one of our employees, in all their diversity,
is accorded equal levels of appreciation, respect and opportunity. To further promote diversity among our workforce, the Board of Management passed a Diversity Concept
in 2010, defining three dimensions where diversity is to be
strengthened throughout the BMW Group: gender, cultural background, age and experience – taking due consideration of local conditions.

The BMW Group’s declared goal is to promote human diversity in the company worldwide, because employees’
unique and different talents and personalities are a valuable resource. The BMW Group Legal Compliance Code
prohibits discrimination of any sort. At all of our locations,
we seek to prevent discrimination on the grounds of gender, age, sexual orientation, religion, disability or origin.
Employees can address any queries in connection with
this to their own managers, the relevant offices of the
BMW Group, the HR department or the works council.
The BMW Group SpeakUP Line furthermore gives all employees worldwide a way to anonymously and confidentially report possible breaches of this principle. • GRI G4-HR3

• see
table 4.08

The BMW Group’s Diversity Concept aims to bring the
share of women in management positions into line with
the overall employee structure. With a ratio of 30 % women on the Supervisory Board, we are complying with the
recommendation of the German Corporate Governance
Code. In 2011, together with the other DAX 30 companies,
we made a commitment to increase the share of females
in management positions. We were able to further raise the
proportion of women in management positions as well as
youth training programmes during the reporting period •.
The ratio of female employees in the total BMW Group
workforce, at 18.7 % (BMW AG: 15.8 %), is now above our
self-imposed target range of 15 –17 %. The share of female
managers in the BMW Group worldwide rose to 15.3 %
(BMW AG: 13.3 %). In the vocational training programmes,
the ratio of women in the year under review was around
44 % for the trainee programme and about 29 % for the aca­
demic youth talent programmes.

To further promote an international perspective and inter­

Our goal is to take early action – including in more indirect
ways – to ensure sound ageing management while encouraging a lively exchange between the generations. In
addition to safeguarding knowledge that comes from long
years of experience, we want to make sure young and old
work together productively and that each employee can
optimally realise their potential.

Taking account of age diversity
At the BMW Group, we take into consideration the diversity of ages represented in our workforce so we can focus
on tapping into the specific strengths of different age
groups while avoiding age structure issues. When setting
up new locations or divisions we recruit people from a
range of age groups. Since 2013, the share of BMW Group
employees aged between 30 and 50 years has been steadily decreasing. At the same time, the proportion of those
over 50 years of age has grown.

The number of years each employee works for the
BMW Group is increasing. This is a result of earlier entry
into the company and later exit, due for example to rising
retirement ages. To maintain employees’ performance as
the workforce ages, we introduced the “Today for Tomorrow programme” • To complement this, we raise awareness among managers of the challenges posed by mixedage teams.

In 2016, the BMW Group once again took part in the activities for German Diversity Day, which helps businesses
and institutions raise awareness of diversity issues and
show how diversity makes them stronger. A special highlight this year was the Diversity Parcours, an interactive
exhibition that was on view for two weeks at the BMW
Research and Innovation Center in Munich and which
informed employees about cultural diversity and the importance of exchanges between generations and genders.
In order to better understand the needs of older employees,
we conducted a workshop series over the past one and and
a half years with employees aged over 50. Participants
worked together to draft new approaches to topics such
as “Knowledge Sharing” and “Reverse Mentoring” (younger employees advising older ones). The workshop series
was accompanied by a scientific paper that defined fields
where the BMW Group can take action on these issues,
proposing concrete measures to be taken.

Forecast
In the coming years we intend to integrate our Diversity
and Inclusion Concept even more thoroughly in the entire
BMW Group. We will focus on carrying on our event and
dialogue formats to raise awareness of diversity issues
among managers and employees. In addition, we will sus­
tainably implement our ongoing recruitment and human
resources development measures throughout the organ­
isation, while fostering formats geared toward different
target groups in our divisions and departments. Central
to these efforts is the responsibility assumed by our man­
agers with their function as role models.

The BMW Group works in a complex, fast-changing en­
vironment. Our success depends not only on our own per­
formance and innovative strength, but also on the impact
of developments in society and our interaction with a va­
riety of stakeholders. With our commitment to improving
intercultural understanding, we want to create added value
for society. This lays the cornerstone for our future viabil­
ity, because only companies that are relevant to society have
a chance at long-term success.

Effective corporate citizenship forms an integral part of the
BMW Group’s vision of itself as a business enterprise. We
attach particular importance to knowledge transfer and to
ensuring that our support measures help people to help
themselves in the long run. We therefore inaugurated a
more professional approach to our corporate citizenship
efforts in 2016, focusing on social projects with a measurable impact. In order to place our initiatives and projects
on a sound institutional footing, we pursued collaborations
worldwide, including with universities, and also initiated
the establishment of not-for-profit organisations such as
foundations.

Promoting intercultural understanding and
social inclusion
As a global corporation with a multinational workforce, the
BMW Group has been working for many years now to
promote understanding between different nations, religions and ethnic groups. We set ourselves the goal of reaching out to a total of one million people by 2020 with our
activities in the areas of intercultural understanding and
social inclusion. This goal was, however, achieved much
sooner: by the end of 2015, we had already reached out
to more than one million people worldwide through exchange programmes, online platforms, educational projects, and in particular through the • Intercultural Innovation
Award. According to a survey by the United Nations Alliance
of Civilizations, the number had reached over 1.2 million
by the end of 2016. The activities vary from country to
country and are geared toward local needs.
We have been bestowing the Intercultural Innovation
Award since 2011, in collaboration with the • United Nations
Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC). The award recognises innovative projects that set an example with their approaches to
solving intercultural tensions and conflict. The special
added value is that selected projects receive comprehensive
advisory support from the BMW Group and the UN-AOC.
The finalists receive a grant of $100,000 for their project
and can also participate in workshops on topics such as
strategy and planning, implementation analysis and media
training.

Rewarding volunteer work by employees
The BMW Group has been recognising the volunteer efforts of its employees every year since 2011 with a “Social
Responsibility Award”, under the auspices of Board of
Management member Milagros Caiña Carreiro-­A ndree.
The jury selects three projects that have created exceptional added value for society. An additional special prize
awarded by the Doppelfeld Foundation recognises the
efforts of younger employees. In the past several years we
have received nearly 600 applications from a wide range
of countries and sectors. The diverse projects range from

refugee assistance to capacity building in developing
countries and also include support projects for disadvantaged or disabled children and young people. In 2017,
four projects will once again be recognised with project
grants of € 5,000 each. The four winners will be selected
by a BMW Group jury and presented at a festive gala in
May 2017.

Integrating refugees
The initiative “WORK HERE!” was launched in 2015. It is
a collaboration between the BMW Group, the German
Federal Employment Agency and the local job centres that
offers motivated refugees the opportunity to take part in
a six- to nine-week course of practical training in various
departments. The programme helps refugees find their
way in the German labour market. The participants are
mentored by BMW Group employees and also receive
daily German language lessons and integration training.
The project was extended to six locations in Germany in
2016. For younger refugees, there is a programme offering
a six-month “starter qualification” preparing them for the
job of production mechanic.

Adapting global commitment to local needs
With 31 manufacturing and assembly plants and a network
of over 150 national sales companies in countries around
the world, the BMW Group is a truly global enterprise. In
addition to our focus on intercultural understanding, we
also develop specific educational offerings and corporate
citizenship projects for our various locations. We believe
it is possible to successfully shape a society that is based
on social cohesion and innovation if the competencies
and skills of each individual are harnessed for the general
good and used to implement social change.
Before we launch a project, we examine the social challenges faced at the local level. The key question we ask
ourselves is whether and how the expertise we provide
can actually improve local conditions. We also benefit as
a company from our corporate citizenship activities. For
example, we become more familiar with local social
structures, we learn to see things from an alternative perspective, and on this basis we are able to reach new target
groups.

4.3 Diversity

Appendix

A total of over 300 refugees participated in “WORK HERE!”
or the starter qualification in 2016, and we were in fact
unable to allocate all available programme spaces. The
participants’ experiences up to now have shown that language skills, cultural understanding and technical proficiency are the key factors for integration into German
working life. Despite the many challenges posed by these
areas, we will push forward with our integration programme for refugees in 2017.

More than 300 refugees have taken part in the BMW Group’s
work ­experience ­programme “WORK HERE!” so far.

In order to make our corporate citizenship efforts even
more focused and effective, in 2015, we conducted a field
analysis of the programmes being implemented at the
BMW Group locations with the following results:
– Corporate citizenship mainly takes the form of support for existing programmes.
– The BMW Group is perceived as a sponsor of social
activities rather than as a local stakeholder responsible
for its own projects.
– There is no uniform understanding of corporate
citizen­ship within the company and in most cases no
involvement of dealerships, customers and partners.

Two good examples of strategic corporate citizenship at the
BMW Group are the BMW Warm Heart Fund in China and
the BMW Korea Future Fund. Both funds offer a platform
that enables the BMW Group, its workforce, dealerships
and customers to make a contribution towards improving
society in the respective countries. In Beijing, ten teams
of talented young people from universities and research
institutes presented their ideas for the urban mobility of
the future at the “BMW Next Mobility Youth Camp 2016”.
In South Korea, the “Young Engineer Dream Project”, a
one-­year mentoring programme, supports disadvantaged
students at technical schools. BMW Group technicians
from nearby company locations help the young people in
planning their education and careers.

Based on this analysis, we developed a roadmap for the
strategic further development of corporate citizenship at
the BMW Group, and in 2016 the following measures were
initiated:
– A local foundation was set up in India with the
involvement of dealerships, customers and employees.
– A strategic approach was drafted to position the
BMW Group as a socially responsible local company
in South Africa, Brazil, Mexico and Thailand.
– Corporate citizenship in the UK, Japan and Russia was
given a more strategic orientation, and educational
projects were developed in the fields of mathematics,
information technology, natural sciences and tech­
nology.

Since 2013, BMW Korea’s “Young Engineer Dream” project has been supporting underprivileged university students, with BMW and MINI volunteer technicians mentoring them
for a year. 131 students and 48 mentors have participated in the project so far.

The BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt inspires leaders
from all sectors of society to exercise their social responsibility in both the private and professional context. Through
the global Responsible Leaders Network, it campaigns
across national, cultural and sector boundaries for positive
social change. The framework for these efforts is provided
by the Agenda 2030 adopted by the United Nations and by
its Sustainable Development Goals. The goal of the foundation is to stimulate socially relevant processes and to
provide lasting support for innovative organisations and
initiatives. In short: to promote concrete commitment by
responsible leaders all over the world.

The BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt can also make a
difference through so-called “impact investing”. It thus
pursues its objectives not only with proceeds from its endowment but also by investing through the Eberhard von
Kuenheim Fund a significant share of its core assets in
organisations with high social impact as well as promoting
national and international exchange via socially positive
forms of investment.

BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt: helping to
improve society
The work of foundations associated with the BMW Group
provides an important source of inspiration for our corporate citizenship endeavours and the establishment of
initiatives. On the occasion of the centenary of BMW AG
in March 2016, the decision was made to pool the strengths
and resources of the two corporate foundations, the BMW
Foundation Herbert Quandt and the Eberhard von Kuenheim Foundation. The BMW Group doubled the capital
of the BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt from € 50 to
€ 100 mil­lion and plans to support its ongoing activities
with annual donations.

RELEVANCE
FOR BMW GROUP
The BMW Group manages its business in accordance with the
principles of sustainable and responsible Corporate Governance. This includes lawful conduct, observing sustainability
criteria and respecting human rights along the entire value
chain. We also maintain an ongoing dialogue with our stakeholders and integrate sustainability as a watchword for all
we do into our corporate structure, culture and processes. In
this way, we are able to increase customer satisfaction and
ensure the long-term competitiveness of the BMW Group. At
the same time, we contribute to value creation and the advancement of society. We comprehensively inform our customers
about the proper use of our products and ensure the protection
of health and the environment through active and passive
safety systems as well as by selecting at an early development
phase safe materials for use in production.

109
Introduction

5.1
CUSTOMER SATISFACTION

As many different factors go into the decision to purchase
a particular vehicle, there are sometimes contradictions
between our customers’ expectations of sustainability and
their individual preferences. For example, short-term trends
such as low fuel costs may reduce demand for the most
fuel-efficient vehicle types. Purchasing decisions by fleet
customers, by contrast, are much more likely to reflect an
interest in sustainability. For these customers, fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions are crucial criteria.

The right approach to sustainability is taking on increasing
importance for product design and the overall image of a
company, together with classical factors such as product and
service quality. The BMW Group has therefore made sustainability one of the fundamental principles of its brands.
Various aspects of sustainability are also addressed in our
customer surveys, the results of which we incorporate into
our decisions. This is because satisfied customers are essential to the long-term success of the company.

Responding to customer expectations
We conduct annual surveys to enable us to optimise our
products, services and support according to the needs and
expectations of our customers. We also continuously measure customer satisfaction on the basis of uniform global
standards.

Most customers hold the companies they purchase from
responsible for developing their products and services in
a sustainable manner. They expect sustainability to be an
integral part of the business model. This is a stable trend
that has been identified in all areas, not just among customers with a special awareness of sustainability.
Our brands address sustainability in multiple ways, from
the development of fuel-efficient and electric drivetrains to
the use of renewable raw materials in the vehicle interior
all the way to our mobility services. With our sub-brand
BMW i, developed as a mobility solution integrating all
aspects of sustainability, we aspire to take on a pioneering
role in the automotive sector •.

The results of the surveys are evaluated both at the
BMW Group level and also at our subsidiaries and dealerships so that we can respond quickly and in a targeted
manner to customer wishes. Recent surveys have shown
that customer satisfaction is at a constant good level and
is continuing to improve even more. We see this as proof
of the effectiveness of our ongoing efforts. At the same
time, it is evident that our customers’ needs can vary considerably from country to country. We take these national
and cultural differences into account in our decisions.

A customer survey conducted in the spring of 2016 in

systems including electric mobility provided valuable insights for the further development of our product and

Customer satisfaction

The survey showed that the interest in electric vehicles increased overall in the participating countries from 2014 to
2016. In all three countries, environmental considerations
and low running costs were cited as motives for purchasing an electric vehicle. In addition, customers in Germany
also mentioned enthusiasm for the new technology and
driving enjoyment as decisive factors, while for drivers in
China state subsidies played a major role.
Nearly all of the respondents who already own an electric
vehicle indicated that they would purchase one again in
future. Among the drivers of plug-in hybrids, about half
would buy one again while almost one third would like to
switch to an electric vehicle next time. Customers driving
conventional premium cars said it was important to them
that switching to a plug-in hybrid or electric vehicle would
entail no restrictions with respect to range and the selection of models available. • GRI G4-PR5
The sales organisations in our largest markets (such as the
USA, China and Germany) report regularly on customer
satisfaction to a specially established committee that includes members of the Board of Management. In addition,
specific customer concerns are analysed at the management
level to identify potential process weaknesses and develop
appropriate solutions.

Focus on the customer: picking up a vehicle at the BMW World in Munich.

Experiencing sustainability in
sales and services
To drive sales of sustainable vehicles, it is vital that our
customers have the necessary information available to them.
Our goal is therefore for the sales staff at our dealerships
to be so well-informed that they are able to answer almost
any question customers may have about the BMW Group’s
products and sustainability activities.
Aspects of sustainability are an integral part of our sales
training, and all sales staff are trained on the theme of
sustainability from the very start of their career. Training
for staff dealing with the BMW i series includes particularly extensive information about how these vehicles contribute to sustainability. We also carry out special trainthe-trainer qualifications for multipliers in sales in which
we go into topics such as our vehicles’ CO2 emissions
throughout the product life cycle, safety and environmental protection in aftersales as well as the sustainability strategy practised by the BMW Group. Besides helping
employees to understand what the concept of sustainability is all about, this training is also designed to demonstrate the benefits a sustainable approach can bring for
our business.

As a provider of premium products, the BMW Group views
safety as fundamental to its sense of product responsibility. By incorporating active and passive safety systems in
our vehicles, we reduce the accident risk for both our customers and other road users. In addition, driving safety
training helps drivers to avoid dangerous situations in
the first place. We provide our customers with extensive
information on the proper use of our products and services. In the early development phase, we evaluate the potential materials to be used in a product in order to determine their possible effects on health and the environment
and eliminate any problematic materials from the outset.

Promoting safety in all areas and keeping
customers informed
We actively communicate our safety concepts by holding
joint events as needed with fire departments, rescue forces
and salvage operations. Our general and specialised driver safety training also plays a part in improving the safety
of our customers and other road users. Customers learn
how to handle certain dangerous situations that may arise.
The BMW Group has been offering driver safety training
for 40 years.
Today, the BMW and MINI Driving Experience programme
offers various training courses in over 30 countries worldwide for BMW and MINI cars and BMW motorcycles. In
2016, over 25,000 participants took part in this programme
in Germany and at international training locations.

All BMW Group products are developed and manufactured
in strict compliance with quality management systems.
The BMW Group monitors its products on the market and
examines all feedback on the topic of safety. If necessary,
the responsible authorities are informed without delay and
all measures that serve customer safety are initiated. The
BMW Group has established the relevant committees,
processes and organisations for this purpose. • GRI G4-PR1

Reducing accidents and their consequences through
active and passive safety systems

Guaranteeing product and service information
for customers

BMW Group vehicles are equipped with active and passive
safety systems that meet the highest quality standards.
Active safety includes perfect chassis tuning, optimal traction and effective brakes. Electronic chassis control systems
as well as a range of driver assistance systems also contribute towards preventing accidents. In addition, a number
of passive safety systems installed in our vehicles minimise the consequences of an accident. These include energy-absorbing crumple zones, safety passenger cells, belt
systems and airbags.

Information on the safety of our vehicles and on protecting the health of our customers can be found in the in-­
vehicle operating manuals, in printed form or as an app.
These manuals are also available on the Internet. This is
complemented by vehicle signage and additional background information on services, accessories and compon­
ents.

Vehicle recall at the first sign of a problem –
Takata airbags as an example
The BMW Group aims to ensure through product recalls that product
defects do not lead to any harm. Recalls are organised as a precaution
in the event of a suspected defect and communicated to the public.
The BMW Group organised the replacement of airbags supplied by
Takata purely as a precaution. A few cases became known among our
competitors in which faulty triggering of the airbags led to occupant injury and even a few fatalities when the gas generator ruptured. No such
case is known in BMW Group vehicles. As a precautionary measure,
BMW decided in 2013 to launch an initial recall to exchange the affected airbags. At that time, 237,000 BMW 3 series vehicles (E46) were affected worldwide. In the course of further investigations and contacts
with the authorities in various markets, BMW organised additional recalls for over 6 million vehicles worldwide. Vehicles affected by these
precautionary recalls are mainly those in the BMW 3 series, BMW 5 ser­
ies and the BMW X5 as well as a few other models with driver and front
passenger airbags from the model years 2000–2012.

The BMW Group is obliged by the applicable legislation
to inform customers about the proper use of its products
and services as well as any potential risks and hazards. A
technical and legal assessment during the release process
ensures that product and service information for customers (manuals in particular) meets all legal requirements
with regard to product liability. Each component of our
vehicles can be tracked back to the supplier via the part
number. The BMW Group complies with the reporting
requirements for all products and services. For example,
information on fuel consumption and CO2 emissions for
each vehicle model is published on the websites of the individual brands. • GRI G4-PR3

Using safe materials

Ensuring high air quality in the vehicle interior

In the early development phase, we evaluate the potential
materials to be used in a product in order to determine
their risk potential and eliminate any problematic mater­
ials from the outset. This ensures worldwide compliance
with all legislation concerning product safety, health and
the environment for every phase of the vehicle life cycle
(from development to utilisation, and right up to the recycling stage). We observe here not only the strict European
Union legislation, for example REACH (registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals), but also
other regulations in effect at our production and sales locations. People with nickel allergies, for example, will be
happy to hear that there are no exposed nickel surfaces in
current BMW vehicles.

Due to our internal commitment to Responsible Care, the
BMW Group has been collaborating with independent
toxicologists since the 1990s to measure emissions in vehicle interiors, in order to ensure that the targets set by
the experts are met in all new vehicles. Our own emissions
test benches test our vehicle interiors applying various
user profiles to make sure they meet the most recent inter­
national standards. The BMW Group also requires component suppliers to meet component emissions targets,
compliance with which is tested during the development
process. In addition, all BMW / MINI / Rolls Royce vehicles
come equipped with cabin air filters. Outside air is filtered
in three ways (mechanically, electrostatically, and optionally also with activated charcoal) before it enters the vehicle. This almost completely filters out particles such as dust,
pollen and pollutants from the outside air.

We regard lawful conduct and respect for human rights as
fundamental prerequisites for fair competition and good
corporate citizenship. As an international enterprise with
highly complex supply chains, the BMW Group is exposed
to increased risk of being associated directly or indirectly
with legal or human rights violations. We therefore treat
compliance with legal provisions and the protection of
human rights as top priorities and require our business
partners to do the same.

Responsible and lawful behaviour is an integral part of
our corporate culture and is the reason why customers,
shareholders, business partners and the general public
place their trust in us.

Managing compliance
In order to protect the company systematically against compliance-related and reputational risks, the Board of Management set up a Compliance Committee in 2007. The
BMW Group Compliance Management System has been
continuously developed further since then, in 2016 notably
through the establishment of local compliance functions.
These take on many of the compliance management tasks
and are better able to identify and take into account local
risks.
Our updated Compliance Management System “Compliance” covers a broad range of topics. The current focus
is on compliance with anti-trust regulations, corruption
prevention and the protection of human rights.
The extent and intensity of our compliance activities are
based on an annually updated Group-wide compliance risk
assessment covering more than 300 BMW Group business
units and functions worldwide. These compliance activities
include training and communication measures, individual
counselling, consistent follow-up on cases of non-compliance as well as the management of compliance-relevant
processes and controls. The Compliance Committee carries
out several Compliance Spot Checks each year based on
the top 50 risks on the risk list. The spot checks are carried
out jointly with an external service provider to monitor
compliance with legal requirements. • GRI G4-SO3
The • BMW Group Legal Compliance Code, which was updated in
2016, is the cornerstone of the Group’s Compliance Management System, spelling out the Board of Management’s
acknowledgement of the fact that compliance is a joint
responsibility. In our • Annual Report 2016, we provide comprehensive information on the actions we take to ensure responsible and lawful conduct throughout the BMW Group.

Training employees in compliance
and human rights
Fair competition is the basis for all of our business dealings.
We have therefore further refined our Compliance Management System to place emphasis on preventing corruption as well as compliance with anti-trust law. In classroom and online training, we teach our employees a basic
understanding of this topic. The training courses are tailored to the needs of the respective divisions, for example
research and development. Around 17,000 managers and
employees have completed one of these training courses
since 2011.
More than 32,500 managers and staff worldwide have received training in compliance and anti-corruption basics
since the introduction of the BMW Group Compliance
Management System in 2008. As part of the training, participants work on case studies on the topic of corporate
hospitality and gifts. Training in the BMW Group Policy
of “Corruption Prevention” also looks at additional financial and in-kind gifts relevant to the Group business
model, for example vehicle donations, sponsorship, monetary donations and memberships. Participation in the
training programme is mandatory for all BMW Group
managers. Compliance training is also available to all
other employees throughout the BMW Group. • GRI G4-SO3,

In addition, we educate our employees on the specific requirements with regard to human rights in business operations. The training is geared in particular toward managers and focus groups, for example in Purchasing. The
participants are informed of what they have to be aware
of in their daily actions and whom they can turn to for
questions.

• see
chapter 3.3

In the reporting period, 156 purchasing employees took
part in classroom training on sustainability, which also
includes human rights requirements. 53 of them went
through special training on how to use the OEM sustainability questionnaire •. The issue of human rights was
also part of the classroom training in compliance offered
in 2016. As we update our compliance training in the
coming year, this subject will also be incorporated in the
compulsory employee training for all managers. • GRI G4-HR2

Ensuring due diligence with regard to
human rights
Our due diligence process for human rights is modelled
on the • UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. In
particular, we expect our employees to respect human
rights and protect them in their daily actions. We also require our business partners to respect human rights.
By integrating human rights requirements into our global
Compliance Management System, they can be entrenched
even more firmly in existing processes at all of our locations and closely monitored. • GRI G4-HR9 Implementation is
also ensured through a Compliance Management Manual.
A special focus in 2016 was preparing for reporting in accordance with the UK Modern Slavery Act, which will be
published for the first time in 2017. For this purpose, we
examined the relevant suppliers, initiated any necessary
improvement measures and conducted appropriate staff
training.

If employees have any questions regarding human rights,
they can ask their line managers or the BMW Group Compliance Contact helpline. Employees also have the opportunity to submit information about possible human
rights violations within the company via the BMW Group
SpeakUP Line – anonymously and confidentially. In add­
ition, our annual compliance questionnaire, which must
be filled out by all BMW Group companies, includes a
question for local risk assessment of possible human
rights violations. The answers are used to derive further
local measures for minimising risk.

The Supply Chain Response Team responds to reports of
possible human rights abuses in the supply chain •. In
2016, the Supply Chain Response Team received two notifications of potential human rights violations concerning non-compliance with freedom of association and an
alleged incidence of child labour. These cases are currently being investigated. • GRI G4-HR12
Local assessments of the risk of possible human rights
violations also become part of Group-wide annual compliance reporting, from which further local risk reduction
measures are derived.

Obliging business partners to observe
human rights
We expect our business partners along the entire supply
chain to consistently observe human rights and we see this
as an important criterion for long-term business relations.
The international value creation processes in the automotive industry and the division of labour it entails lead
to risks, particularly in the supply chain. We thus ensure
our suppliers’ commitment to respecting human rights via
our risk management process •.
We also take human rights requirements into account in
investment decisions and the choice of company sites. In
2016, 100 % of the order volume for our material investments in property, plant and equipment (including production equipment and buildings) were covered by human
rights clauses. • GRI G4-HR1
Both our international purchasing conditions and also all
dealership contracts in Europe as well as Korea, Thailand,
Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, along with all contracts
with importers worldwide, currently contain a binding
human rights clause. We intend to gradually integrate this
clause into all dealership contracts worldwide.
We see the integration of human rights clauses into contracts with business partners as an important step in establishing human rights requirements in the value chain,
and as an indicator of growing awareness on the part of
our partners.

has remained at a constant high level. The bulk of the net
value added is applied to employees (2016: 48.8 %, 2015:

The BMW Group currently employs 124,729 people (2015:
122,244) and is training 4,613 young people at its worldwide locations (2015: 4,700). The purchase of intermediate
products also secures jobs worldwide in our supply chains.
Because we source the main components for vehicle production locally whenever possible, our business activities
create jobs and increase prosperity at our locations. • G4-EC8
By paying income taxes, and indirectly through taxes paid
by our employees and suppliers, we boost the tax revenues
of the regions where we operate. In 2016, the BMW Group

As the BMW Group is a global corporation, both our manu­
facturing activities and our products have an effect on the
environment as well as on diverse groups of stakeholders.
At the same time, the viewpoints, decisions and actions of
our stakeholders have a decisive impact on the success of
our enterprise. The BMW Group therefore engages in ongoing dialogue with its stakeholders at all its locations
and in relevant markets.

By fostering dialogue with our stakeholders, we want to
build trust, gain a better understanding of each other’s
positions, identify trends and consolidate partnerships.
This helps us to understand better what steps are needed
and expected from us next in the various fields of activity.
At the same time, the exchanges give us an opportunity to
clearly and transparently explain the extent of our potential influence on social and environmental issues and what
prerequisites and framework conditions are important for us.

Our • Stakeholder Engagement Policy forms the basis for continuous dialogue. It defines the goals of the dialogue, sets
the criteria for identifying and prioritising our stakeholders, and provides a template for a range of suitable dialogue
formats and communication channels. • GRI G4-25

Regular and systematic dialogue
with stakeholders
Our subsidiaries, our political offices in the different markets and the representatives from our plants engage in
regular dialogue with local stakeholders on relevant topics. A range of committees and channels allow our different corporate departments to contact relevant stakeholder
groups directly.
One of the cornerstones of this dialogue is our ongoing
and systematic identification and prioritisation of stakeholders and their topics of interest. To this end, we regularly map out stakeholder groups that are involved in
strategically important topics at all relevant locations.
Our basic goal is to host at least one multi-stakeholder dia­
logue per year in our primary sales regions in Europe,
Asia and North America respectively. We set the themes for
these stakeholder dialogues according to how topical they
are and how well they lend themselves to comparing and
contrasting the different regions. In 2016, we c­onducted
stakeholder dialogues on the topic of urban mobility in
Seattle / USA, Boston / USA, Madrid / ES, ­Tokyo / JP and
Barcelona / ES. In the coming year, urban mobility will once
again be on the agenda, along with other key issues such
as digitalisation.

In addition to these events, we also have direct contact with
individual stakeholders on occasions when special topics
arise (for example, in 2016 there were many requests for information on environmental protection and the observance
of human rights in the supply chain). To respond to our
stakeholders’ interest in these issues, the BMW Group held

two dialogue events in Berlin (in July and December 2016)
at which we presented the general sustainability standards
in the BMW Group supply chain and discussed in greater
depth projects and measures being undertaken with regard
to the raw materials kenaf and cobalt.

­into the company’s strategy. On the other hand, the stakeholders become familiar with the BMW Group’s views and
positions on certain topics and can take account of these

In 2016, various media and NGOs alerted us to possible
human rights violations in our supply chain. As stipulated
in our corporate processes, our Supply Chain Response
Team looked into each case within a matter of days, asking
the management of the supplier company to respond to the
specific issue or case. If we still had doubts, we intensified
our investigation and sent someone to look into things on
site. In one case, information provided by our stakeholders
led us to work with our suppliers to restructure a supply
chain so as to rule out any potential future risk.

STAKEHOLDER PERCEPTIONS
Greater policy support possible for BMW
e-mobility and car-sharing p­ rogrammes
through the integration of ­connectivity and
automation, e.g.:
– delivering real time data on parking,
infrastructure and traffic conditions,
– new services for physically challenged
groups,
– supporting a stable energy infrastructure
and integration of electric vehicles into
existing networks.
The BMW Group's approach to car-sharing is
not fully understood:
– advocating for less cars while selling cars?
– premium is still associated with exclusivity
of ownership.
– Brand is perceived to be less relevant in
sharing schemes.
Connected and autonomous cars
might challenge The BMW Group’s brand DNA
and core competencies
– W hat are the new business models
for the BMW Group?
– How is the organisational change being
managed?

• GRI G4-27

STAKEHOLDER RECOMMENDATIONS
Zeitgeist is focused on breakthrough innov­
ation rather than gradual change. Thus, systemic approaches to energy transition are
attractive (battery, charging, energy gener­
ation and storage).

Some competitors don’t have “legacy automotive business”, which allows them to focus
resources within R&D and manufacturing as
well as to execute a stronger marketing
­strategy.

Increase availability of car-sharing through
reward schemes, e.g.:
– gamification and loyalty programmes.
– flexible pricing to incentivise ride-sharing
and sharing of private parking spaces, for
example.

Strengthen car as private space e.g. through:
– tailored interior design,
– advanced entertainment solutions,
– assuring confidentiality of private
communication,
– developing more ideas for stationary use.

Foster vehicle-to-grid integration to promote
decentralised energy systems that support
– disaster resilience,
– and energy transition through storage and
bi-directional charging,
– also provides further options to reduce
TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) of electric
vehicles.

I ncrease digital availability of cars and
services in cutting-edge digital market
platforms (own, partner, external).

Use car-sharing as an introductory platform
for premium/advanced technology, e.g.
regarding electrification and connectivity.
Premium data privacy i.e. trust in responsible
handling of data, full control of privacy
­settings and reward schemes for sharing of
data could be essential USP for BMW.

In dialogue with investors

In dialogue with political decision-makers

Engaging in a regular and intensive dialogue with the
capital market has always been a high priority for the
BMW Group. When making their decisions, investors
are increasingly focusing on how the BMW Group integrates aspects such as the environment, society and corporate governance into its business model, products and
activities. This is particularly true of institutional investors
with long-term strategies.

By engaging in regular, active and open dialogue with
political decision-makers, union representatives and associations as well as non-governmental organisations
(NGOs), we play a constructive and transparent role in
shaping the general political framework for our business
activities. We offer our expertise to help promote fair
competition for all involved and find sustainable solutions.
We regard this as an important aspect of our corporate
responsibility.

In 2016, we continued to maintain and expand our contacts with sustainability-oriented investors and analysts.
In a number of individual and group discussions at SRI
roadshows and conferences (SRI = Socially Responsible
Investment) in Europe’s financial centres and the USA,
visitors were informed of our current progress in the area
of sustainability and the focus topics in our Strategy
NUMBER ONE > NEXT. We also conducted another Perception Study to determine how investors view the financial aspects of sustainability communications and integrated the results into the further development of our SRI
communications.

Fundamentals
5.1 Customer satisfaction

Our political offices concern themselves with public affairs
as they affect environmental, financial and socio-political
topics and deal with relevant economic policy and industry-­
specific issues. In the period under report, the main topics
in this regard were how to put emissions regulations into
practice, how to deal with trade barriers, fair taxation
­legislation, changes brought about by digitalisation, the
challenges of urban mobility as well as international regulations on measuring emissions.
We take a public stand on the issues and report on our
positions on important policy developments and legislative initiatives.

Position on the implementation of the EU
CSR Directive in Germany

Taking a stand on emissions regulation
Legal regulations on emissions are becoming increasingly
stringent worldwide, continually posing new chal­lenges to
the automotive industry. As early as 2000, the BMW Group
set the course for reducing fuel consumption as well as
CO2 and pollutant emissions with its Efficient Dynamics
Strategy. Electromobility is essential for achieving further
reductions.

The European Union passed a directive on CSR reporting
in 2014 that is to be implemented in the member states as
national law by the end of 2016. With a slight delay, the
law was adopted by the German Bundestag in early 2017,
meaning that the reporting requirement will take effect for
Germany for business year 2017. The companies concerned
must disclose in their management report or a separate
sustainability report non-financial information on their
policies, main risks and outcomes relating to at the minimum environmental matters, social and employee aspects,
respect for human rights, anti-corruption and bribery
issues as well as equal opportunity and diversity in their
board of directors.

Favourable economic conditions have proven conducive
to the successful introduction of new technologies. In the
dialogue with the political stakeholders in the main markets, the following issues are of central importance to the
BMW Group:
– Promoting electromobility
– Not distorting competition according
to market segment
– Supporting new efficiency technologies
– A realistic connection between targets
and measuring methods
– Consistency of supply-side and demand-side policies

After many years of reporting in accordance with the
GRI G4 comprehensive guidelines, the BMW Group is
confident that it will be able to meet the new reporting
obligations without any major changes in its annual
drafting process. The BMW Group supports the new le­
gislation provided that its operational interpretation leads
to greater clarity and focus in the resulting reporting.

Promoting the transatlantic free trade agreement
As a global enterprise, the BMW Group has always supported the further opening of worldwide markets as well
as the continuous reduction of tariff and non-tariff trade
barriers. The BMW Group manufactures vehicles worldwide, takes advantage of global sourcing and is convinced
that free trade is an important component for a sustain­
able growth and employment policy.
Despite increasing globalisation, trade policy has been
characterised for the past several years by a trend toward
greater protectionism. Market entry barriers are on the
rise in many regions of the world. Where tariff trade barriers are abolished, they are often replaced by non-tariffbased obstacles.
The latest developments with regard to the UK's planned
withdrawal from the European Union as well as the trade
policy discussions triggered by the new administration in
the USA can be seen as results of a global trend toward
isolation and disintegration that has been observed for
some time now.
The BMW Group approaches its investment decisions with
sustainability in mind. Long-term investments are the result of careful consideration and strategic planning processes. In particular in countries such as the UK and the
USA, where changes in trade policy are now being discussed, we are firmly established partners in the local
economy and wish to remain so. Our future involvement
in Mexico is likewise more than a pure investment decision. It also reflects our sense of responsibility for the
jobs being created there as well as our social and cultural
commitment.

The BMW Group therefore hopes that its sustainable
global investment and sales planning will be flanked by
responsible policy decisions designed to maintain the
growth, prosperity and employment brought by open
markets and international integration.

Supporting democratic parties
The BMW Group supports the work on social policy carried out by democratic parties in Germany (CDU, CSU,
SPD, FDP and Bündnis90 / Die Grünen). The company
places high value on transparency in this regard and
complies with the relevant legislation. Since 2014, the
BMW Group has supported the work of political parties in
Germany solely through content-based partnerships, for
example by sponsoring public discussion forums and dialogue formats. All partnerships are subject to the clear
sponsorship guidelines of the BMW Group.

The BMW Group manages its business in accordance with
responsible corporate governance principles geared to long-­
term value creation in all areas of the company. To ensure
compliance with these principles, clear lines of accountability have been defined in the BMW Group’s management
system, which are reinforced through guidelines as well as
control and incentive systems.

Managing sustainability

The Board of Management governs the enterprise under its
own responsibility, acting in the interests of the BMW Group
with the aim of achieving sustainable growth in value. It
thus determines the strategic orientation of the enterprise
and ensures its implementation. The Board of Management
is furthermore responsible for compliance with all provisions of the law and internal regulations as well as for adequate risk management and risk controlling. The Supervisory Board advises and supervises the Board of Management in conducting its duties (dual management system).
• GRI G4-34, GRI G4-39

Sustainability is a component of our corporate strategy. For
this reason, our Sustainability and Environmental Protection department has been directly incorporated into our
Corporate Planning and Product Strategy unit since 2007,

Board of Management is represented on the Sustainability
Board, along with the heads of Sustainability and Environmental Protection and of Corporate Communications.
• GRI G4-34 The Sustainability Board convenes twice a year
to assess the company’s progress on economic, environmental and social issues. In particular, it determines the
degree to which sustainability principles have been integrated into the various divisions. • GRI G4-47 The Sustain­
ability Circle, which comprises department heads from all
divisions, meets at least twice a year to draft decisions for
presentation to the Sustainability Board. Given the increasing relevance of the topic of sustainability for the
core business of the BMW Group, a proposal has been
made to integrate the Sustainability Circle into the Strategy Circle. This integration represents a logical next step
toward establishing sustainable business practices as an
integral part of the business model •. • GRI G4-35, GRI G4-36,

Integrating sustainability as a
strategic corporate objective
Sustainability has been integrated “top down” at all corporate levels of the BMW Group since 2009 as a strategic
objective based on specific targets and key performance
indicators. Sustainability is therefore an explicit compon­
ent of the BMW Group’s management system. This means
that every major issue and project must be measurable in
terms of “Sustainability” as a corporate objective, ensuring
that, in addition to economic factors, environmental and
social aspects are also accounted for in the decision-making process.
It also means that sustainability as a corporate objective
is broken down to the level of business areas and div­
isions. As a result, the personal targets set for managers
include sustainability aspects and criteria that have an effect on their performance-based remuneration.

Rewarding sustainable business success
The Supervisory Board decides on the level of compensation received by members of the Board of Management,
orienting its decisions on the sustainable development of
the BMW Group. Bonuses are also based in part on personal performance, evaluated primarily according to qualitative criteria. These criteria include ecological innovation
(e. g. reduction of CO2 emissions), customer focus, leadership accomplishments and the ability to lead change processes.
Further key performance indicators for measuring contributions made to the sustainable development and future
viability of the company are enhancing its attractiveness
as an employer, progress in the implementation of the
diversity concept, which is presented in a report to the
Supervisory Board, as well as activities that advance corporate citizenship in the BMW Group • Compensation Report

In the reporting period, expenditure on research and development, in particular projects
to safeguard the future, remained at the same level as the previous year at €5,164 million
(2015: €5,169 million). It accounted for 5.5 % of revenues (2015: 5.6 %) thus remaining
virtually unchanged since the previous year.

The BMW Group’s Efficient Dynamics strategy calls for fuel economy technologies to be made accessible to all customers worldwide as soon as possible. Efficient Dynamics are thus part of the standard
­e quipment in our vehicles. The slight decrease is primarily due to the drop in fuel prices and the accompanying increase in customer demand for larger models and more powerful engines.

 To further increase transparency, energy consumption from the corporate functions, development and administration in Munich/DE as well as the motorcycle plant in Berlin/DE were included in the report for
the first time in 2015.
In 2016, the energy consumption of our vehicle production was at 2.21 MWh per vehicle produced, a slight rise compared to the previous year (2015: 2.19 MWh). This is mainly due to the launch of the new engine
plant in Shenyang, China and the installation of a new, more efficient paintshop in Munich /DE, which necessitated operation of two paintshops at the same time.

Total investment by the BMW Group in environmental protection increased considerably
compared to 2015 (2015: €109 million), amounting to €154 million in the reporting period.
This is mainly due to investment in new paintshops. In addition, our implementation of
­e nvironmental management measures meant that there were no significant environmental
incidences in the reporting period. In particular, no penalties had to be paid.

The number of vehicles produced again showed an increase in the reporting period (+3.5 %). On the input side, the shift from steel to aluminium reported in 2015 continued due to the increase in lightweight construction. Aluminium grew by 7.7% (steel: -5%). In addition, the efficiency indicators energy/water consumption, process waste water, waste for disposal, VOC and CO 2 emissions per vehicle improved by an
average of 4.9% compared to 2015.

In general, materials input into waste water should be limited to volumes that will not overtax natural decomposition processes. At all production facilities, BMW-specific waste water standards apply,
some of which significantly exceed local regulations. The significant increase in AOX as well as the total of all heavy metals and heavy metal compounds in 2016 is due to intermittent process difficulties.

 F igures refer to BMW and MINI, excluding Rolls-Royce automobiles. CO 2 emissions calculated in accordance with DIN EN 16258. Since the 2011 financial year, the scope has expanded significantly and currently
comprises: inbound volumes ­(material supplies to plants and spare parts delivery) for BMW and MINI vehicles in Germany, UK, USA, South Africa, China, Thailand, India and CKD/SKD locations as well as for
delivery of spare parts to the parts supply centre ZTA in ­D ingolfing/DE. Outbound volumes (vehicle distribution and spare parts) as far as the distribution centres in the worldwide markets and in certain markets
as far as the dealership.
The increase in transport volume (+2%) and CO 2 emissions (+2.1%) was less than proportional to the year-on-year increase in the number of BMW and MINI vehicles produced (+3.5%). CO 2 emissions fell by
around 2.3% per unit based on the number of vehicles. This is mainly due to the rise in the share of vehicles produced in Europe for the European market and the resulting decrease in export volume. It also led to
slight shifts in shares of modes of transport in transport volume and CO 2 emissions figures.

In 2016, the accident frequency rate at the BMW Group fell by just under 5 % compared to 2015. This is due to continuous improvement processes as well as dedicated safety training courses and ongoing
improvement of technical safety conditions at workstations. In addition to training by the occupational safety association, a large number of internal training courses are carried out, data on which has been
­r epresented since 2011. A total of 8,605 employees of the BMW Group as well as employees of third-party companies took part in internal safety training courses in 2016. In addition 5,525 people underwent
­t raining in first aid in Germany alone.

 N ew employees receive full bonuses after four years of employment.
Since the 2010 financial year (payout in 2011), bonuses at BMW AG have been determined
according to a uniform system across all hierarchical levels. Starting in the 2011 financial
year (payout in 2012), this system was also introduced for employees worldwide as a standardised corporate success component in nearly all BMW Group companies. The consistency
of this component is thus ensured both hierarchically (from production worker to board
member) and geographically (worldwide). This portion of the bonus depends on the earnings performance of the BMW Group and is calculated according to these three parameters:
Group’s earnings after tax, after-tax return on sales, and dividends. Including the post-tax
return on sales in the calculation of bonuses (also for the Board of Management and the
upper executives) in particular ensures an orientation towards the profitable, and hence
sustainable, growth of the BMW Group.

The share of women in the workforce varies strongly in the different functional areas:
the share of women in production-related activities is less than 10 %, while it is over
20 % in sales-related activities. The employee share and share of women is therefore
lower in production-intensive countries.

 From 2012 onwards, all employees in corporate functions as well as the employees at the Goodwood/UK plant were included in this figure.
 Excluding executives.
At the BMW Group, institutionalised co-determination is implemented Group-wide according to the applicable national regulations. At all BMW AG plants and dealerships as well as in Austria and the UK, elected
works councils observe co-determination for the employees. In China and South Africa, employees are represented by local workers’ representatives, while at the company locations in the USA no collective
agreements exist in general.
The BMW Group complies with the ILO Conventions 87 and 98, which guarantee employees the right of association as well as the right to conclude collective bargaining agreements. In addition to the right to
found and become members of independent C93 unions or other organisations that represent interests, this also includes protection against discrimination due to participation in employee representation.
Freedom of association thus forms one of the focal points of the • BMW Group Joint Declaration on Human Rights and Working Conditions. Timely and comprehensive inclusion of employee representatives is guaranteed at the BMW Group both through the parity of membership of the BMW AG Supervisory Board as well as through works' council representatives and local employee representatives.

 BMW Group investments are dependent on current further education and training requirements, which may lead to year-on-year fluctuations.
The BMW Group sees targeted employee training as an investment in the future. For this
reason, investment in eduction and further training remained at the same level as in the previous year. Building up and maintaining skills expertise within the Group’s workforce are key
aspects of strategic corporate governance.

The training academy founded in 2009 coordinates vocational training at Munich/DE as
well as training and further education for all company locations in Germany and the UK
under one umbrella. This facilitates the coordination of training courses and generates
synergies through the use of shared resources. In 2016, the BMW Group’s training offensive provided similar results to the previous year. Both the average amount of time spent
on training as well as expenditure were at a similar level to the previous year. This trend
can be observed throughout the entire company. In addition to classical training courses
and e-learning, brand new education programmes were launched, such as Bachelor's and
master’s degrees in cooperation with universities. In the year under report, the “Sustainable Leadership” programme for established junior and middle managers (programme
with largest number of participants) did not take place, due among other things to the fact
that in the first half of 2016 the new strategy of the BMW Group was announced, making
it necessary to modify the leadership programmes, too. Every manager will therefore
­participate in the one-day dialogue event “Strategy NUMBER ONE Next. Next Experience”.

 F igures exclude suspended employment contracts, employees in non-work phases of
pre-retirement ­p art-time arrangements, trainees, students and low income earners.
Maintaining a competitive level of expenditure on personnel plays a major role in the success of the BMW Group. In addition to focusing on cost, the aim is also to increase efficiency at all levels of the business. The high degree of motivation amongst employees and
the positive approach taken by the company towards the workforce are underscored by
rewards that are determined individually on the basis of performance and success.

The bulk of the agreed pension benefits are covered in full by fund-based pension
­s ystems as well as accounting provisions. Fund assets amounted to €18,315 million in
2016 (2015: €16,930 million). Pension provisions have risen to €4,587 million (2015:
€3,000 ­m illion); this is primarily due to decreased discount rates in Germany and Great
Britain.
From a legal perspective, the BMW Group’s fund assets are managed in trusts, separately
from its corporate assets.

As in the previous years, public sector grants consisted of two parts in 2016. First,
­p roduction costs were reduced due to public subsidies in the form of reduced taxes on
assets and consumption-based taxes amounting to €69 million (2015: €71 million).
­S econd, other operating income at the BMW Group also includes performance-based
public sector grants totalling €126 million (2015: €132 million).

The number of non-managerial staff is subject to
very strong short-term fluctuations particularly in
the summer during the main holiday period of
the core workforce. Statements about the number
of non-managerial staff as well as their composi­
tion by gender are therefore valid only for a very
short time. Freelance staff are not relevant for
most of the work in the BMW Group.

Ratio of the highest annual total compensation
to the median annual total compensation

The BMW Group policies for remuneration and
additional benefits apply for all of our companies,
regardless of gender, religion, origin, age, disabili­
ty, sexual orientation or country-specific character­
istics. We follow the guiding principle that the
total remuneration package must be above the aver­
age for the respective labour market. We conduct
annual compensation studies worldwide to deter­
mine our current market positioning so that we
can continue to align overall compensation with
the market. This ensures that every employee
­receives compensation commensurate with the
relevant labour market.

The ratio of the annual compensation of the high­
est-paid employee to the median level of all
­employees is also in keeping with the market
thanks to our globally applied approach; it can
however vary greatly depending on the market
spread between countries. For this reason, no
­definitive statement can be made. The percentage
increase in annual compensation is decided based
on various factors such as the inflation rate and
in principle follows the market trend.

According to a BMW Group internal standard,
substances with ozone-depleting potential as listed
in the legal provisions are not allowed. The BMW
standard “Prohibited and declarable substances”
contains a ban on chlorofluorocarbons and thus
substances that have a strong ozone-depleting
­potential. The BMW Group thus not only regulates
emissions of these substances but prevents them
from being used at all.

Products: The BMW Group does not take back
any products. Established systems for the recovery
of end-of-life vehicles, components and materials
ensure that they are reintegrated into the raw
mater­ials cycle.
Packaging: Vehicles are delivered to the end
­customer without packaging. We use covered rail
wagons or protective film for transporting ve­
hicles to the dealership. All protective film is recy­
cled after use. When parts are shipped to region­
al distribution centres, any packaging materials
(packaging materials for transport and parts
­protection for separate parts) are professionally
disposed of there. In the further supply chain
from the regional distribution centres to the
BMW Group dealerships, responsibility for dis­
posal of packaging materials lies with the dealership.
Customers who purchase spare parts or lifestyle
articles can return the packaging material to the
BMW Group dealership.

The turnover rate for BMW AG and hence for 70 %
of all employees is recorded centrally. The turnover
rate at individual international locations is also
­recorded, but not consolidated at the BMW Group
level. This is because it is not possible with the
­current system to break down the absolute and per­
centage values for employee hires and resignations
by region and gender. We plan to integrate this

Our principles apply to all employees. There is no

Injuries, occupational diseases, lost days
and work-related fatalities

Occupational diseases are defined differently in
different regions, so that an aggregate statement
for the BMW Group on the frequency and type of
diseases and injuries is not possible. Work-related
diseases are recorded in the English-speaking
countries. In Germany, this is not permitted for
data privacy reasons. Instead, German figures for
occupational diseases are based on the precise
definition in the German Social Insurance Code.
According to this definition, BMW AG has a rate
of occupational diseases in the range of 0.1 per
thousand (cases per employee). Thanks to central
planning based in Germany, the working condi­
tions for handling hazardous substances and the
ergonomic design of workplaces are identical in
all BMW Group plants worldwide. In analogy, it
can be assumed that the rate of occupational dis­
eases abroad is the same as in Germany.

• see chapter 4.1 and Further key indicators, pages 87, 140 –142

With regard to working conditions (occupational
safety), there are no gender-specific differences.
Therefore, no gender-specific analysis is currently
published and none is planned for the future.
The BMW Group does not collect data from con­
tractors active at our locations, as this information
is subject to confidentiality clauses in our con­
tracts. On-site contractors are instructed in occu­
pational health and safety precautions before tak­
ing up their work.
The accident statistics take into account work
­accidents that lead to at least one day of absence
from work.

Occupational health and safety are regulated by

Health Act. There are no formal agreements with
trade unions on occupational health and safety
­issues at any of our worldwide locations. In the
BMW Group, occupational health and safety
topics are regulated in cooperation with the works
councils. For example, company agreements have
been concluded on the following topics:
– Company agreement stipulating medical
screenings for occupational fitness for jobs
involving driving, technical control or
­monitoring activities
– Occupational integration management
for employees
– Step by step occupational reintegration
of employees
– Help for employees at risk of or suffering

Significant investment volumes are investments
that account for at least 95 % of the total invest­
ment in tangible assets reported in the 2016
­A nnual Report.
After the adoption of the UN Guiding Principles
on Business and Human Rights, we informed our
employees via the hierarchy cascade of the BMW
Group’s position and the requirements with re­
gard to human rights. Employees in purchasing
in particular have since then been required to
take part in ongoing compulsory training.
­Human rights are also part of the training for
managers in their capacity as multipliers as well
as being addressed in the introductory seminars
for new employees, in training courses for train­
ees and in Web-based training on sustainability.
In 2016, the issue of human rights was also a
­focus in our classroom training in compliance,
for example at our plant in Thailand and at the
APAC Compliance Conference in February 2016
in Kuala Lumpur.
As human rights are an integral part of the above
training, the actual hours of training are not re­
corded at present.

Operations that have been subject to human
rights reviews
• see chapter 5.3, page 115

Following publication of the UN Guiding Prin­
ciples on Business and Human Rights, we per­
formed a systematic analysis of the rights cited in
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with
regard to their relevance and implications for
­different business units. Based on the results, we
reviewed our strategic alignment and used what
we learned to continuously develop our due
­diligence process for the company and in relation
to our business partners. The international value
creation processes in the automotive industry
and the division of labour they entail lead to risks
above all in the supply chain. For this reason, one
of the focuses of our ongoing risk assessments is
on human rights in this area. Our three-step risk
management process for the supply chain includes
a risk filter, self-disclosure by suppliers and audits.
In 2016, a total of 5,616 nominated, active and
­ otential suppliers were assessed using our OEM
p
questionnaire. This comprised 89 % of BMW AG’s
new suppliers of production-related materials
with a contract value of over € 2 million and 96 %
of new suppliers of non-production-­related
­ aterials with a contract value of over € 5 million.
m
(• chapter 3.3, section on the risk management
process). Human rights are more­over an integral
part of the assessment process for new operation
sites.

In 2016, no such legal violations or infringements
against the rules came to light. Nor were any legal
proceedings concerning corrupt practices conclud­
ed during the reporting period. Currently, the
BMW Group does not have Group-wide informa­
tion about employment-contract sanctions as a re­
sult of breaches of the law. For this reason, this as­
pect of the indicator is not fully reported. Detailed
data on the total number of cases in which con­

due to violations related to corruption are not cur­
rently available. We plan to incorporate this data

The BMW Group Sustainable Value Report (SVR) 2016
has been published to provide stakeholders with comprehensive information about the company’s sustainability
strategy and the progress made in integrating sustainability into its corporate processes. The BMW Group’s Sustainable Value Report 2016 has been compiled in accordance with the “Comprehensive” option of the Global Reporting Initiative ( • GRI G4 ) guidelines. This is the highest
• GRI G4 transparency level.

Reporting period
The reporting period is the 2016 calendar year. The effective date for all figures and facts is 31 December 2016.
• GRI G4-28 The Sustainable Value Report is published annually. • GRI G4-30 The last report was published in March 2016
as an interactive pdf covering financial year 2015. • GRI G4-29

Structure of report
The report is structured along the long-term sustainability goals of the BMW Group. The weighting of the topics
in the report is based on the results of our systematic materiality process •. The scope of the report and the aspect
boundaries are therefore based on those in the Sustainable Value Report 2015. • GRI G4-23
Each chapter starts with a one-page overview of the main
facts. The sub-sections of each chapter are introduced by
a statement of the long-term sustainability goal of the
BMW Group. The report contains the key performance
indicators that control and monitor the BMW Group’s
sustainability performance. Where appropriate, references are also provided to supplementary information in the
Annual Report or on other BMW Group websites.

• see
chapter 1

The statements made in the Sustainable Value Report
2016 about the BMW Group generally refer to the group
of consolidated companies in the 2016 Annual Report.
Any deviations from that are indicated and their scope
specified in the footnotes of the respective tables and
charts. • GRI G4-17 Calculation methods are explained in
footnotes to the respective charts. The “Further key indicators” section generally maps the key indicators for
2012–2016 (with the exception of key figures that only became relevant after 2012). They refer to the entire
BMW Group. There are, however, some exceptions concerning site-specific topics and local sustainability programmes. Wherever this is the case, the entity the figures
apply to is specified accordingly, e. g.: BMW AG. Nothing
significant has changed with regard to the structure of
the supply chain and relationships with suppliers, including the selection and termination of contracts. • GRI G4-13
The BMW Group Sustainable Value Report 2016 will be
published on the BMW Group website. The next Sustainable Value Report will be published in early 2018.

UN Global Compact – communication
on progress
The BMW Group committed to implement the principles
of the United Nations • Global Compact in 2001, and in
this report once again gives account on progress achieved
in complying with these principles. References to the
Global Compact principles have been integrated into the
• GRI G4 Content Index.

Third-party verification
The entire report (the texts of all chapters as well as
­f urther key indicators) was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH, with limited assurance in accordance
with ISAE 3000 (revised) • see Assurance Report. • GRI G4-33
Indicators from the areas of environmental protection and
occupational health and safety were audited by external
auditors and experts in accordance with ISO 14001,
EMAS and OHSAS.
The Corporate Reporting, Corporate Communications
and Policy as well as Corporate Planning and Product
Strategy departments select the external auditors for the
Sustainable Value Report. Ms Ursula Mathar, Head of
Sustainability and Environmental Protection and
Dr Thomas Becker, Vice President of Governmental and
External Affairs are responsible for expert approval of the
SVR. Overall responsibility lies with the Board of the
BMW Group. Third-party auditing enables us to document for the public the reliability and trustworthiness of
the information provided. In addition, we regularly receive impetus for improvement and innovation in the reporting process. • GRI G4-33, GRI G4-48

Forward-looking statements
The BMW Group Sustainable Value Report 2016 contains
various forward-looking statements about future developments which are based on the current status of the
BMW Group’s assumptions and forecasts. They are thus
subject to a variety of predictable and unpredictable risks,
uncertainties and other factors, so that the actual outcome, including the company’s financial and assets pos­
ition, its development or performance could differ considerably. The BMW Group makes no commitment to update such forward-looking statements or to adapt them to
future events or developments.

To BMW AG, Munich

Practitioner’s responsibility

We have been engaged to perform a limited assurance engagement
on the sustainability information in the Sustainable Value Report
2016 of BMW AG, Munich, (hereinafter the “Company”), for the period
1 January to 31 December 2016 (hereinafter the “Sustainable Value
Report”).1

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the sustainability information in the Sustainable Value Report based on our work performed.

Management’s responsibility

We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard
on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information” published by IAASB. This standard requires that we plan and
perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance whether
any matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the
sustainability information in the Sustainable Value Report has not been
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the GRI Criteria.
In a limited assurance engagement the evidence-gathering procedures
are more limited than for a reasonable assurance engagement and
therefore significantly less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable
assurance engagement. The procedures selected depend on the practitioner’s judgement. This includes the assessment of the risks of material
misstatements of the sustainability information in the Sustainable Value
Report with regard to the GRI Criteria.

The Company’s management is responsible for the preparation and
presentation of the Sustainable Value Report in accordance with the
criteria as set out in the G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of the
Global ­Reporting Initiative (GRI) (hereinafter the “GRI Criteria”).
This responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate
methods to prepare the Sustainable Value Report as well as the use of
assumptions and estimates for individual sustainability disclosures
which are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, the responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining systems and
processes relevant for the preparation of the Sustainable Value Report,
which is free of material misstatements due to intentional or unintentional errors.

We have complied with the German professional provisions regarding
independence as well as other ethical requirements.
The audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional
standards – in particular the Professional Code for German Public
Auditors and German Chartered Auditors (“Berufssatzung für
­
Wirtschaftsprüfer und vereidigte Buchprüfer”: “BS WP/vBP”) as well
as the requirements to quality control for audit firms ("Anforderungen
an die Qualitätssicherung in der Wirtschaftsprüferpraxis”: “IDW EQS
1”) of the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in
Germany; IDW) – and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system
of quality control including documented policies and procedures
­regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

 ur engagement applies to the German version of the Sustainable Value
O
Report 2016.

Within the scope of our engagement we did not perform an audit on external sources of information or expert opinions, as referred to in the
Sustainable Value Report.

– Obtaining an understanding of the structure of the sustainability
organisation and of the stakeholder engagement;

Back

– Analytical procedures on selected sustainability information of
the Sustainable Value Report;
– Inquiries of personnel responsible for the reporting of fleet emissions
and fuel consumption, as well as reconciliation of selected data
points regarding fleet emissions and fuel consumptions with the
official information available from the Federal Office for Motor
Traffic of Germany;
– Comparison of selected sustainability information with
­corresponding data in the consolidated financial statements
and in the group management report;
– Assessment of the presentation of selected sustainability information in the Sustainable Value Report regarding the sustainability
performance.

Conclusion
Based on our limited assurance engagement, nothing has come to our
attention that causes us to believe that the sustainability information in
the Sustainable Value Report of the Company for the period 1 January
to 31 December 2016 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in
accordance with the GRI Criteria.

Emphasis of matter – recommendations
Without qualifying our conclusion above, we make the following recommendations for the further development of the Company’s sustainability management and sustainability reporting:
– Stronger formalisation of the internal control system for
­sustainability data;
– Further harmonisation and automation of world-wide reporting
processes for non-financial data.

Restriction on use and distribution
We issue this report on the basis of the engagement agreed with the
Company. The review has been performed for purposes of the Company
and the report is solely intended to inform the Company about the results of the review. The report is not intended for any third parties to base
any (financial) decision thereon. We do not assume any responsibility
towards third parties.
