ZF Future Study – The last mile

Advanced urban vehicle
ZF can demonstrate the potential of intelligent networking between
mechanical components and sensors with its all-electric concept
vehicle.
The basic idea of the smart parker is the perfect interaction between
driveline and chassis, combined with an intelligent system network.
The turning angle of the front wheels is extreme at 75 degrees – and
verges on a right angle of 90 degrees. A specially designed front axle
combined with a customized electric power steering system and other
design changes to the wheel housing made this tight turning angle
possible. Conventionally powered vehicles would be unable to handle
such a tight turning angle – they could not perform it from a standing
start and would literally “trip over” their turned-out front wheels. Not
so with the Advanced Urban Vehicle. The two electric motors integrated in the rear axle mounted near the wheels power the vehicle
with a total of 80 kilowatts of output, delivering a top speed of 93 mph.
The torque vectoring system distributes the torque individually to
each wheel. If the left wheel stops moving while the right wheel
moves forward, the car, including its rear end, moves to the left – and
in doing so, supports the left-hand drive of the tightly turned front
wheels. This interaction between hardware and software, chassis and
steering, drive and system network makes it possible for the 12-foot
Advanced Urban Vehicle to slip into a parking space just over 14 feet
long in a single move. It also has an exceptionally tight turning circle
of 21.33 feet, which means that a quick U-turn on a two-lane road is
no problem at all.

ZF Sustainability Report 2016

In 2016, the Fraunhofer Institute of Material Flow and Logistics (IML), in
cooperation with ZF, conducted a 360-degree study on “last mile” logistics,
focusing on customer expectations, legal and spatial framework conditions as
well as technical trends and their impacts.

Contents

Same-day delivery is already the standard and is trending toward same-hour
delivery. The main customers using e-commerce today are young people in
1- or 2-person households, with this demographic growing continuously. Customers want increasingly fast delivery, and not just for fresh products. These
demands can only be met with shorter and smarter logistics paths. While
intelligent algorithms will be able to anticipate orders and transport requirements, distribution remains challenging.

Company Profile

Findings show that the commercial vehicle industry can lead the way in addressing automotive megatrends such as e-mobility and autonomous driving.
That’s because transport operators need to synchronize customer requirements, framework conditions and available options in a unique way.

Environment

The authors of the ZF Future Study believe that new technologies will enable
innovative forms of transport to emerge, or even make transport superfluous,
thus triggering the greatest changes. For instance, 3D printing will enter the
mainstream. Additive processes can manufacture many goods on the spot,
avoiding time-critical transports. 3D printing shops are one conceivable development, similar to the photocopying shops that thrived back in the days when
not every household owned an ink-jet printer.
The study also identifies a big role for autonomous driving, although drivers
will still be necessary. Their job will change, because the transport vehicle will
automatically follow them from house to house, as an example. In rural areas,
autonomous delivery vehicles can reduce the high cost pressure on logistics
companies struggling with an increasing shortage of drivers. And road-bound
transport robots can also be used for the last mile in urban areas. Researchers
estimate that up to 400 million package deliveries will be made throughout
Germany by 2030. Safety concerns, however, will keep transport drones
restricted to niche activities.

Electric motors will make overnight deliveries possible because they will be
done quickly and quietly on the last mile. However, at least in the near future,
internal combustion engines will remain in use outside the major urban centers. The reasons for this are driving distance and economic constraints.
