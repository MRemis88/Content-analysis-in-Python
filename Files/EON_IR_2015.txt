Foreword to the 2015 E.ON Sustainability Report
Johannes Teyssen (Chairman of the E.ON SE Management
Board and Chief Sustainability Officer)

Dear reader,
Thank you for your interest in E.ON and our Sustainability Report. Those of you who have followed us
in recent years know the challenges we face. At the end of 2014 we decided to divide the E.ON
Group’s businesses into two separate companies. The separation of our businesses is part of our new
strategy. In addition, we’re using the transformation as an opportunity to do an even better job of
integrating sustainability into our business processes.
Two companies promoting a sustainable energy supply
Dividing into two companies will enable us to meet the challenges of the new and conventional energy
worlds, which are very different. Each company will focus on one of these two energy worlds: E.ON on
the new world of renewables, energy networks, and innovative customer solutions, Uniper on the
conventional world of conventional power generation and global energy trading. This will make both
companies more agile and give them the best prospects for becoming leaders in their respective
energy worlds. And it will have advantages for all of our stakeholders: customers, employees,
shareholders, business partners, and society at large.
A sharper focus makes it easier to set clear targets
Dividing into two companies will also sharpen our profile, including from a sustainability perspective.
E.ON and Uniper will focus on different businesses. This will enable them to set clear sustainability
targets and to work toward them systematically. It goes without saying that both E.ON and Uniper will
remain committed to a vision of sustainability that goes beyond merely complying with laws and
regulations. We’ll continue to live up to the sustainability principles, norms, and standards that have
long guided our environmental, social, and governance performance. For example, E.ON remains
committed to the principles of the UN Global Compact and the World Business Council for Sustainable
Development. We’ll also continue our annual sustainability reporting. But E.ON and Uniper will define
their own strategic priorities and set their own targets. We’ll provide more details about this later in the
year.
E.ON: new sustainability strategy in 2016
At the new E.ON our top priorities—customer orientation, energy efficiency, and access to
renewables—are closely aligned with our three core businesses. But we also intend to place a greater
emphasis on other issues, such as becoming an even more attractive employer. Since the start of the
year we once again have an independent sustainability department. Our sustainability team is

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

Declaration by the board

currently working in close consultation with our newly constituted Sustainability Council to design our
new sustainability strategy and sustainability work program. I’ll be able to say more about this in the
months ahead. But we’re already certain that we want our approach to be ambitious. For example, we
intend to get our employees more involved and do more to put sustainability into action at our
company.
We’ll provide our stakeholders with detailed information about the process of designing our new
sustainability strategy. In the second half of 2016 we’ll announce the focus areas and targets of this
strategy on our website. The Sustainability Channel of our website already features stories about
selected projects that illustrate how E.ON addresses social challenges and adds value to the regions
and communities where we operate. We intend to continue and expand these activities.
Looking back on 2015: accomplishments and milestones
This 2015 report encompasses all our businesses, including those that have been part of Uniper since
the start of 2016. The report’s key figures provide readers with a clear and comprehensible picture of
our sustainability performance. In 2015 we successfully completed our most recent sustainability work
program, which had a duration of four years.
Amrumbank West und Humber Gateway offshore wind farms entered service in 2015. This important
accomplishment made us Europe’s second-largest offshore company. We continued to develop
technologies to make all parts of our business environmentally friendlier. We also provided detailed
and transparent information about the climate impact of our business operations. In recognition of our
climate reporting, the Carbon Disclosure Project included us in its Leadership Group. The CDP make
companies’ climate performance more transparent. This provides information for investment decisions,
helping to direct capital at important technologies of the future. We also received recognition from our
customers, whose satisfaction with us increased yet again. This improvement inspires us to work even
harder to put customers at the center of everything we do.
The report will provide you with more information about these and other topics. One thing is certain:
the journey into the energy future will be exciting. We hope you come along. And, as always, we
welcome your suggestions for how we can make our sustainability performance even better.
Best wishes,
Johannes Teyssen

Reporting approach

An overview of our reporting approach
E.ON SE has published an annual Sustainability Report since 2004. We strive to present balanced
reporting of the environmental, social, and economic aspects of our business activities. We select
reporting topics on the basis of a materiality analysis that assesses which topics are most important to
us and our stakeholders. These topics therefore are directly relevant to our business. Our reporting
aims to be transparent and not only presents our strengths but also setbacks.
Since 2008 we have been publishing our Sustainability Report exclusively online. The 2015
Sustainability Report is also available as a pdf file for download at eon.com under the "Sustainability"
tab in the "Sustainability Report" chapter. The reports from previous years can be downloaded from
the archive.
The report and its preparation
The Sustainability Report published in early May 2016 is E.ON SE’s twelfth successive report. It
relates to the reporting period 1 January to 31 December 2015 and to all businesses of E.ON SE,
regardless of whether they are continued in E.ON in the future or are to be imputed to Uniper, which
was initially spun-off as a subsidiary at the start of 2016. The editorial copy deadline was 31 March
2016. E.ON's next Sustainability Report will appear in the second quarter of 2017. The report is
available in both German and English. In favour of readability, we avoid using double-gender
pronouns as well as the company’s full legal designation.
Since 2005 we have prepared our Sustainability Report in accordance with the guidelines of the
"Global Reporting Initiative" (GRI), which are currently existend in Version 4-. The Report also once
again meets the requirements stipulated under the "German Sustainability Code". It also fulfils our
commitment to provide a Communication on Progress in accordance with the United Nations Global
Compact.
Our Sustainability Report primarily addresses the following stakeholders:


Customers



Investors and analysts



Rating and ranking agencies



Sustainability opinion leaders such as policymakers, authorities, civic leaders, and researchers



Current and potential employees

We continually evaluate their feedback and, if necessary, adjust our sustainability and reporting
processes accordingly. For example, over the past several years we have met our stakeholders ’
request for our key performance indicators (KPIs) to focus more on the environmental, social, and
governance (ESG) aspects of our performance.

Reporting approach
General structure of the 2015 Sustainability Report
The chapters "Reporting profile", "Management", "ESG facts and figures" and the ten thematic action
areas attributable to the areas of Environment (E), Social (S) and Governance & Integrity (G) form the
core of this Sustainability Report. The following symbols show how the topics are assigned to the
relevant level:

ESG

ESG

ESG

On the introductory pages of the action areas we explain our management approach in relation to the
key themes and provide information of the goals we have set and the progress we have achieved. The
GRI aspects in the action area that are key to E.ON can be found at the beginning of each introductory
page. On the relevant subpages of the action areas we use key indicators to report on progress in the
reporting period and present current and future projects.
We also report restrictively on topics which have been classified in our materiality analysis as less
relevant for E.ON. Our purpose in doing so is to respond to the many different concerns of our
stakeholders and also to meet the requirements of sustainability rankings and ratings agencies. This
information can be found in the chapter "Further Measures & Performance".
Key indicators on our progress can be found both on the topic pages and also bundled in the chapter
"ESG Facts and Figures“.
Fact Sheet 2015
In addition to the 2015 Sustainability Report we summarise highlights from 2015 as well as our key
indicators in a Fact Sheet which is available separately for download as a PDF file.
Object of the report
Our 2015 Sustainability Report describes the progress we made and the measures we took in all our
operations. It relates to the 2015 calendar year and so the spin-off of Uniper from E.ON which was
completed on 1 January 2016 is not included in the 2015 report.
The subject of the report is E.ON SE, including any share investments it holds directly. The
information in the report always refers to all subsidiaries and power plants in which E.ON has a
majority stake and that are fully consolidated in the E.ON Group ’s financial statements. Any
exceptions are noted accordingly. Industrial safety, for example includes units in which we are
responsible for operational control but do not have a majority holding.
Discontinued activities are not fully reported on in the Annual Report. Key indicators on these are
therefore only included to a limited extent in our reporting systems. For this reason not all information
is available for the activities of the power plants in our regional unit in Italy which were discontinued in
2015; reference is accordingly made to this in footnotes in an effort to explain the discrepancies with
previous years' values.

Reporting profile
Reporting approach
Our data collection focuses on indicators which we consider based on the business activity of the
relevant unit to be relevant and material with regard to its contribution to the overall picture. For
example, we only gather data on radioactive emissions for units with nuclear power stations and we
only gather customer data for companies with sales operations.
Statements about the future development of the E.ON Group and its subsidiaries are estimates based
on the information available at the time of reporting. Actual results may vary.
In addition to the Sustainability Report, we also address sustainability issues in our Annual Report.
Audit of the Sustainability Report
Key parts of the 2015 Sustainability Report have, as in previous years, been subject to a limited
assurance review by PricewaterhouseCoopers AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (PwC). The basis
of this is ISAE 3000 (revised) ("International Standard on Assurance Engagements") of the
International Federation of Accountants. This includes contents of the chapters "Reporting Profile",
"Management", and parts of the ten thematic action areas. The reviewed contents are marked as such
by the logo "Reviewed 2015". The audit is based on the German version of the report.

UN Global Compact
UN Glob al Comp act

Full support of the UN Global Compact
Since 2005 E.ON has been committed to upholding the ten principles of the
United Nations Global Compact. With more than 8,600 participants from over
162 countries, the Global Compact is the world ’s largest sustainability
initiative.
Basis for company policies and standards
As a signatory to the UN Global Compact we affirm our commitment to respect human rights, uphold
labour and environmental protection standards, and fight against corruption. We use the ten principles
to develop our own standards and guidelines. At the same time we align the work program for our
sustainability management, internal compliance systems and the prequalification of new suppliers with
this framework. As a result of our participation in national and international Global Compact networks

– for instance, in Germany and Sweden – we strengthen collaboration across industries.
Reporting on the principles of the Global Compact
Our commitment to the Global Compact includes reporting on the annual progress in implementing the
ten principles (Communication on Progress – COP). We make this part of our Sustainability Report.
The table below specifies which sections of the report address the various principles.

Global Reporting Initiative
Glob al R eporting In itiativ e

Global Reporting Initiative
We prepare our Sustainability Report in accordance with the current "G4" Global Reporting Initiative
guidelines and have done so since 2014. We also include the Electric Utilities Sector Disclosures of
May 2013. In our assessment, our 2015 Report, like the 2014 Report, applies the core of the GRI
guidelines.
Background: Global Reporting Initiative
The GRI was founded in 1997 with the goal of developing internationally recognised guidelines for
organisations to voluntary report on their economic, environmental, and social performance. The GRI
guidelines are the result of a transparent, multi-stakeholder process and consist of performance
indicators for all sectors and all types of organisations.
In addition to a few substantive innovations the new G4 standard primarily enhances the principle of
materiality in the selection and description of the reporting topics. For various sectors –
including companies in the electricity industry – there are also so-called Sector Disclosures. Here,
industry-specific aspects and additional indicators are defined.
GRI content index
In accordance with the GRI G4 guidelines, we selected the contents of this year ’s report once again
on the basis of a materiality analysis. Our GRI content index indicates how our reporting meets GRI
standards. It specifies:


which aspects we classify as material and therefore report on,



whether the aspects are material within or outside the organisation,



which indicators we use (at least one indicator per material aspect) and to what extent,



which indicators have been subject to an assurance review,



which E.ON-specific indicators we use in addition to, or in place of, GRI indicators, and



where indicators and additional information can be found on our company’s website or in our
Annual Report.

The information used to fulfil the indicators can be found on the linked pages and in the Annual
Report. Where an indicator is not completely covered by this information we have included further data
directly in the index or have clearly labelled the gaps as “Omissions”. The complete GRI Index can be
found on pages 190-205.

Independent Practitioner’s Limited Assurance
Report
To E.ON SE, Düsseldorf
We have been engaged to perform a limited assurance engagement on the sustainability information
marked with „Reviewed 2015“ in the Corporate Sustainability Report 2015 of E.ON SE, Düsseldorf,
(hereafter the “Company”) for the period 1 January to 31 December 2015 (hereafter the “Corporate
Sustainability Report”).1
Management’s Responsibility
Company’s Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Corporate
Sustainability Report in accordance with the criteria as set out in the G4 Sustainability Reporting
Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) (hereafter the “GRI-Criteria”) and for the selection of
the information to be assessed.
This responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the
Corporate Sustainability Report as well as the use of assumptions and estimates for individual
sustainability disclosures which are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, the responsibility
includes designing, implementing and maintaining systems and processes relevant for the preparation
of the Corporate Sustainability Report, which is free of material misstatements due to intentional or
unintentional errors.
Audit Firm’s Independence and Quality Control
We have complied with the German professional provisions regarding independence as well as other
ethical requirements.
The audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional standards – in particular the
Professional Code for German Public Auditors and German Chartered Auditors (“Berufssatzung für
Wirtschaftsprüfer und vereidigte Buchprüfer“: “BS WP/vBP”) as well as the joint opinion of the
Wirtschaftsprüferkammer (Chamber of German Public Auditors; WPK) and the Institut der
Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany; IDW): Requirements to quality control for
audit firms (“Gemeinsamen Stellungnahme der WPK und des IDW: Anforderungen an die
Qualitätssicherung in der Wirtschaftsprüferpraxis”: “VO 1/2006”) – and accordingly maintains a
comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding
compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory
requirements.

Assurance Report

Practitioner’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the sustainability information marked with „Reviewed
2015“ in the Corporate Sustainability Report based on our work performed.
Within the scope of our engagement we did not perform an audit on external sources of information or
expert opinions, referred to in the Corporate Sustainability Report.
We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements
(ISAE) 3000 (Revised): “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial
Information” published by IAASB. This Standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance
engagement to obtain limited assurance whether any matters have come to our attention that cause
us to believe that the sustainability information marked with „Reviewed 2015“ in the Corporate
Sustainability Report has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the GRICriteria.
In a limited assurance engagement the evidence-gathering procedures are more limited than for a
reasonable assurance engagement and therefore significantly less assurance is obtained than in a
reasonable assurance engagement. The procedures selected depend on the practitioner's judgement.
This includes the assessment of the risks of material misstatements of the sustainability information
marked with „Reviewed 2015“ in the Corporate Sustainability Report with regard to the GRI-Criteria.
Within the scope of our work we performed amongst others the following procedures:


Obtaining an understanding of the structure of the sustainability organization and of the



Inquiries of personnel involved in the preparation of the Report regarding the preparation

stakeholder engagement
process, the underlying internal control system and selected sustainability information


Performance of site visits as part of the inspection of processes for collecting, analyzing and



Comparison of selected sustainability information with corresponding data in the consolidated
financial statements and in the group management report



Assessment of the presentation of selected sustainability information in the Corporate
Sustainability Report regarding the sustainability performance.

Conclusion
Based on our limited assurance engagement, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to
believe that the sustainability information marked with „Reviewed 2015“ in the Corporate Sustainability
Report of the Company for the period 1 January to 31 December 2015 has not been prepared, in all
material respects, in accordance with the GRI-Criteria.

Emphasis of Matter – Recommendations
Without qualifying our conclusion above, we make the following recommendations for the further
development of the Company's sustainability management and sustainability reporting:


Further standardization and formalization of reporting processes and the internal control
system for sustainability information;



More focused reporting of indicators with high relevance for steering of the company.

Restriction on Use and Distribution

Our strategic focus
Manag em ent
Our strat egic fo cus

E.ON's future: maintain and change
The energy switch has changed considerably in recent years: renewable energies are increasingly
becoming a supporting pillar of the energy system. The share of regenerative power is increasing
continuously. Demand for green power products is also rising. What is more, the digitalisation of
energy services is in full swing. This allows reducing consumption significantly. However, due to the
increase in the global population and the economic development of many countries, global energy
demand continues to be on the rise. Energy is and will remain the basis of our wealth. For that reason,
societies need to be supplied with power and heat in as cost-effective, climate-neutral and reliable a
way as possible.
Due to the changes, the energy world has now split into two worlds. Both of them, the classic and new
energy worlds, will develop further. In this process, however, very different challenges are emerging.
To master this successfully, we have opted for a clear corporate separation of our previous business
areas. This will allow us to apply our long-standing experience and knowledge in an even more
targeted manner in the future.
Two worlds, one aim: to develop efficient, climate-neutral and safe solutions
The future E.ON will focus on three strategic business areas: renewable energies, energy grids and
customer solutions. When it comes to renewables, we rely above all on offshore wind power, but also
on the expansion of onshore wind and solar power. With innovative and efficient energy grids, we are
integrating ever more local power generators in order to enable a secure and stable supply. We will
expand this role in the future and make our girds smarter so that they can respond flexibly to customer
needs and balance the fluctuating nature of renewable energies. Thanks to new solutions and smart
technology, we allow our customers to procure energy very differently, to share it or even to sell it. For
instance, they should be able to generate or store it themselves. In all three above areas, we as the
future E.ON have comprehensive competencies: We develop and operate innovative grids, erect
highly complex offshore wind parks and design new products and services that meet the different
needs of our customers.
The remaining operation and dismantling of the company's own German generation capacity in
nuclear power remain the responsibility of E.ON. However, nuclear energy is no longer a strategic
business area. In the future, it will be controlled by a separate operating unit called PreussenElektra in
Hanover.
The newly established company Uniper has been focusing on the challenges of the classic energy
world in a targeted manner. In this process, the conventional generation from water, natural gas and
coal and global energy trading will be the focus. With its conventional power plant portfolio, which is
becoming increasingly flexible thanks to new technologies, it can absorb greater demand fluctuations,
which result from the irregular power generation from renewable energies. It thereby contributes to
supply security and supports societies in switching to a low carbon future.

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

Management
Our strategic focus
Both companies will continuously aim for improvements in their business areas: we will make
renewable energies more profitable and environmentally friendly and classic generation technologies
release fewer emissions. We will offer our customers more individual options and greater convenience
at affordable prices and support them in the efficient handling of energy. Also as separate units, we
will continue to work hard on sustainably aligning the energy policy target triangle of supply security,
affordability and environmental protection.
Sustainability as a value driver
With our strategic fundamental decision, we are improving the conditions for both companies to create
values for their stakeholders and their own future, and not merely financial, but also non-financial
values. Before the decision, we examined what factors influence the company value and how we can
achieve stable business operations over the long term. We looked at profitability, attractiveness as an
employer, our reputation as well as efficiency and cost reduction potentials, our capacity to innovate
and the regulatory robustness of our activities as key measurement values. The analyses show that all
these values are increasingly being influenced by sustainability subjects. For that reason, they also
play a key role in the realignment.
We are presenting in this sustainability report how we approach these subjects. When selecting the
reporting subjects, we focus on those aspects that are of high relevance for our external and internal
stakeholders and for the company itself. These key subjects have a direct or indirect impact on our
value drivers, both in the positive and in the negative sense. For instance, a careless, unregulated
handling of big data, the increasing data flow within the framework of the digitalisation, can have a
devastating effect on customer trust and therefore on our reputation. At the same time, due to the lack
of trust, the profitability may be jeopardised by a worse sale of smart customer solutions. Big data can,
however, and this is our aim, result in high added value for all parties involved.

Mater ial asp ect s

Focus on what is relevant
What subjects are relevant for E.ON because they have a major impact on our society and business
with leverage? What expectations or concerns of our stakeholders do we need to take into account?
These questions guide us in the selection of the subjects for this sustainability reporting of our Group.
With the use of a systematic materiality analysis, we have been weighing the relevance of individual
aspects for the company or for our stakeholders annually since 2006. Thanks to the current G4 policy
of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the principle of relevance has obtained even greater
significance for the provision of the reporting content.
For that reason, we report in detail for 2015 in our areas of activity on the aspects that are perceived
to be relevant by both E.ON and our stakeholders and on how we control them in our corporate
processes. In addition, information on further subjects is also provided in the areas of activity.
Determining intersections of interests
We determine the aspects material for the current report in a three-level process. In order to identify
the material subjects of the stakeholders, we initially analysed a broad source basis from media
reports, Intranet news and contributions in social media channels. We also integrated the expectations
of rating agencies and standard organisations in this process. Subsequently, we weighted the subjects
determined by factors such as "frequency of mention" and "relevance for the stakeholders". During the
assessment, we also considered what impact different stakeholder groups have on E.ON's value
drivers such as sales, reputation, attractiveness as an employer, efficiency & costs or innovation. In an
internal workshop, we finally verified the results of the analysis. Colleagues from the areas of
Procurement, HR, Policy, Communication, Regional Coordination, Legal & Compliance, Risk
Controlling, Technology & Innovation as well as Sustainability were involved in this process, who can
assess the requirements of the stakeholders due to their day-to-day work. Here, some subjects were
considered to be less relevant and others more relevant, as had become clear form the document
analysis. Overall, 26 subjects were thereby identified as relevant for E.ON.

Risks in sight
Risks in sight

Identifying and limiting risks
Corporate action on a global scale is always also associated with far-ranging risks. Our management
system should identify them and assess them as regards their likelihood and possible loss amount.
In addition to changes in the markets, we, as are other companies, are also affected by global
developments such as less resources, urbanisation and, above all, climate change. To avoid
greenhouse gases, governments are taking numerous regulatory measures that are having an impact
on our business and investments. This gives rise to opportunities for E.ON, on the one hand: state
requirements and social targets are triggering a wave of investments in technologies in order to
reduce greenhouse gases. On the other hand, the political regulation can also come with risks for our
existing plants.
Furthermore, climate change has direct physical effects: the warning of the air close to the ground, for
instance, increases the power required to cool buildings. Changed weather conditions can result in
scarce water supplies and therefore limit the availability of power plants. We consider changes caused
by climate change, such as these, in a large number of risk categories. A detailed explanation of the
risk categories can be found in our 2015 Annual Report.
Systematic risk management
We address possible effects of changed framework conditions on our processes with systematic risk
management. This is in line with the best practice in the industry and shall enable the Group
Management to take suitable measures in good time.
The risk management system is embedded in the entire development and process organisation of
E.ON. It consists of a large number of components, which are explained in our Annual Report in detail.
The following chart offers an initial overview:

Risks in sight
Risk Management System

With this risk management system, we record all fully consolidated Group companies as well as all
companies involved via a holding and joint ventures with a book value of more than EUR 50 million.
This also includes our holding in Turkey as well as consortia for the exploration and production of oil
and gas.
Risk limitation in various dimensions
E.ON is taking various measures to limit risks. As such, we address market risks with hedging
transactions, a comprehensive sales controlling and intensive customer management. We limit
operative risks through grid management and expansion as well the optimal use of our power plants.
In addition, we have integrated the operative and financial effects of environmental risks on our
business in a default planning. They are integrated in the crisis and disruption case scenarios that our
emergency and crisis management teams create for the Group in the operative subsidiaries. Further
measures to limit risks and the current risk situation are explained in the 2015 Annual Report.
Measuring and limiting ESG risks
We not only align our risk instruments towards directly quantifiable risks. Included are also nonfinancial risks, which can be presented only indirectly, partly or not at all in figures. They are, in
particular, risks in the areas of environment, social and governance (ESG), which occur in connection

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

Management
Risks in sight
with our corporate activities, but often have only a longer-term and not an immediate effect. These
ESG risks are difficult to assess with the established systems.
ESG aspects play not only a role in our own risk assessments, but are now also a key component of
the assessment of analysts and investors. The basis is, for instance, the United Nations Principles for
Responsible Investment (UN PRI), an investor initiative in partnership with the environmental
programme and the UN Global Compact. Further measures are the so-called equator principles, a
voluntary book of rules of banks for the observance of environmental and social standards in project
financing. Furthermore, ever more major corporate customers of E.ON are developing own
requirements regarding transparency and sustainability of the supply chain. Governments are also
calling on companies around the world to measure and disclose their performance in the areas of
environment and social.

Our targets
Our t arg ets

Our 2012-2015 working programme
We have been regularly drawing up a binding sustainability working programme applicable across the
Group since 2005. We thereby provide a clear overview of our targets in the area of sustainability and
the planned measures for target achievement. From dialogue with internal and external stakeholders,
we gain material suggestions for the enhancement of our working programme.
We are completing our 2012-2015 working programme with the 2015 reporting year. Some targets
were reached early in recent years, others no longer seem ambitious enough today and will need to
be redefined. Our CO2 reduction target, for instance, was exceeded thanks to the increasing share of
renewable energies. In the area of occupational safety, we managed to strongly exceed early our
target of reducing the total number of all accidents of E.ON employees and partner companies
recorded.
Due to the split in the future E.ON and Uniper, a fundamental strategic new alignment is taking place.
Both companies will develop their own targets for the coming years and communicate them. Still in
2016, they will define their future strategic focuses, targets and time frames. The targets will be guided
by the relevant business areas of the two companies and the requirements of their stakeholders. It is
already becoming clear that specific CO2 reduction targets and efficiency gains will remain key areas
of work. Health and safety will also continue to play a major role in the two companies across all levels
of our current and future value-added chain. With key indicators such as the Net Promoter Score
(NPS) – the measurement figure for customer loyalty – we will make our customer focus measurable.

1. CO2 reduction (power generation)
Reduction of the CO2 emissions of our power generation in Europe and use of the best technologies in
the markets, in which we are active, in order to reduce costs from CO2 auctioning and to establish a
future-enabled generation portfolio that takes into account the changed market conditions
Target
Reduction of the CO2 emissions by improving the conventional generation portfolio of E.ON and the
expansion of renewable energies
Halving the CO2 intensity of our power generation in Europe by 2025 (compared to the benchmark
year of 1990) by improving our conventional generation portfolio and expansion of renewable energies
(due to the phasing out of nuclear power in Germany being five years later than originally scheduled)
Assessment criterion and target


Criterion: CO2 intensity (t/MWh) of power generation in Europe



Target: Reduction by 50 per cent by 2025 (benchmark year 1990)

Process/project continuing:

CO2/MWh
The CO2 intensity in Europe has fallen further and is at 0.35 t of
CO₂/MWh in 2015. Our original target for 2015 was therefore
exceeded. This is mainly thanks to portfolio measures such as the
closing of numerous coal power plants. Furthermore, the share of
renewable energies in our power generation has increased.
Compared to the benchmark year of 1990 (0.63 CO₂/MWh), we
reduced our direct CO2 emissions by about 45 per cent. We may
therefore achieve our reduction target for 2025 earlier than
planned.

2. CO2 footprint
Shrinking of the Carbon footprint of the day-to-day business activities of E.ON not directly associated
with power generation with the aim of implementing efficiency gains and thereby cutting costs.
Target
Definition of energy efficiency standards for new and existing buildings of E.ON, introduction of a CO 2

We have set ourselves the target of reducing the CO2
emissions of our daily business activities not directly linked
to power generation compared to 2010 by 20 per cent by
2020. This affects, in particular, CO2 emissions that result
from business trips, the use of our vehicle fleet or the
transport of fuels.
In the 2015 reporting year, the scope 2 and 3 emissions
fell further to 123.1 million t (2014: 127.6 million t of CO₂
equivalents). The reduction on the previous year is, among
other things, due to the fall in CO2 emissions that result
from business trips, the transport of fuel and sale of power.

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

Management
Our targets

In the future, we will work on increasing our efficiency
further and thereby cutting costs. Due to the operative
separation of E.ON and Uniper, the CO2 figures will,
however, only be comparable to a limited degree in the
future.

3. Water management
Establishment of a water management with the E.ON Group in order to better identify and reduce
future water risks for E.ON (approvals, costs, availability, discharge and supply chain)
Target
Development and rollout of Group-wide qualitative framework conditions for sustainable water
management along the entire value-added chain of our operative business activities by 2015,
including those areas of the supply chain for which significant risks exist (on the basis of requirements
of the non-profit investor association CERES); implementation of methods that create for E.ON the
requirements for membership in the CEO Water Mandate of the United Nations (UN)

Since December 2015, E.ON has been a member of the UN
CEO Water Mandate (UN WM). This means that we are one
of a small number of companies whose water management
meets all requirements of the mandate. We created a key
requirement for the membership with E.ON's Water
Management Corporate Policy, which was adopted at the end
of 2014.

4. Inclusive business
Exploration of possibilities for inclusive businesses in the energy sector in order to develop business
opportunities on a larger scale and to offer people in developing countries sustainable solutions.
Inclusive business is a business model that integrates in the value-added chain of companies
population strata with little market participation and low incomes (buzzword “base of the pyramid”) with
the use of adjusted products.
Target
Support of sustainable energy projects in developing countries (predominantly in rural areas),
contributions to research and development, awareness-raising for opportunities and risks of inclusive
business

In 2013 we started the E.ON Off Grid Solutions inclusive
business project within the framework of our ‘:agile’ innovation
initiative in order to enable people in Africa access to energy.
In 2014 the first project was implemented in Tanzania. By the
end of April 2016, seven further plants came onstream. The
project participants supplied about 420 households with
power at this time.
With the help of the E.ON startup Hydropower Evolutions
(HE), we specialised in applying our expertise in sustainable
hydropower projects in emerging markets. We are thereby
contributing to enabling a clean power generation driven by
sustainability criteria in undersupplied regions. In 2015, HE
won a contract of the International Finance Corporation (IFC)
for the assessment of hydropower projects in Indonesia.

however, quite a bit worse at a value of 1.6, whereas the LTIF of
third-party companies (c) was far better than the requirement at
1.7.
The early fulfilment of our targets for the combined TRIF and for
the LTIF partner companies will be taken into account in the
fresh alignment of our working programme.

7. Health protection
Improvement of the mental and physical health of employees to maintain their capacity for work and
reduce work-related sickness as well as lost working hours; in this process, the balancing of
consequences that result from the demographic development

Since 2014, all units of E.ON are called upon to hold an HSE
day annually. On this event, they present locally relevant
subjects in the areas of nutrition, exercise, addiction prevention
or mental health within the framework of presentations,
workshops and further formats. In 2015 about half of
employees attended the Group-wide HSE day. In addition, our
units offer own health-promoting measures from the range of
subjects specified. However, they were not taken into account
in the key indicator so far.
For the health area, we wish to develop and implement further
key indicators in the future as well as establish clearly
measurable targets for a comprehensive health management.
Our aim to improve the mental and physical health of our
employees continues to apply. Due to different definitions of
risk groups and professional sicknesses in the countries in
which we are active, a percentage recording of the risk groups
participating is not yet possible for the time being.

we are working on a procedure with which we want to analyse
the results of the supplier assessment automatically. To achieve
a further standardisation in the Group, the qualification process
was rolled out across the Group and has been binding for all
Group units since April 2015. In the first quarter of 2015 we
started training sessions for the E.ON employees involved.
Thanks to these measures, we are gradually approaching the
targets set: by the end of 2015, we audited and qualified
numerous suppliers. It will, however, take some time until all
existing suppliers are recorded; we will set a realistic target for
this in our next working programme.

Guidelines
Internal rules for anchoring sustainability
In binding policies, we define operative framework conditions and minimum standards for our business
processes. They have an indicative nature and are verified continuously in order to respond to
changed requirements of our stakeholders.

Group policies - as the name indicates - apply across the E.ON Group. This includes all individual
companies in which we hold a majority stake, as well as projects and partial holdings in which we bear
operating responsibility. Our contracting parties and suppliers are also required to fulfil our minimum
standards. In joint ventures with equivalent partners, the Group policies do not apply automatically;
however, policies adjusted to the local circumstances are issued on their basis. The policies will be
valid from 2016 for both companies, E.ON and Uniper.
The sustainability activities at E.ON are controlled by the following policies in particular:

Cross-Group collaboration
The cross-Group sustainability activities of E.ON are the responsibility of the Chief Sustainability
Officer (CSO). In this process, he can rely to tried-and-tested organisational structures: Two specialist
committees of the top management level support him - the Sustainability Governance Council and the
HSE Governance Council. In this process, the Group functions of Corporate Responsibility (CR) as
well as Health, Safety & Environment (HSE), which are summarised in one area HSSE (Health,
Safety, Security & Environment) & Sustainability, support him. The CSO and chairman of both
councils is Johannes Teyssen, E.ON SE Chairman of the Board.
The Sustainability Governance Council
The central committee for steering and monitoring the sustainability activities at E.ON is the
Sustainability Governance Council (SGC) established in 2013. It has policy competence, decides on
the further development of the sustainability activities, monitors the implementation and drives it. The
aim and purpose of the council as well as the roles and responsibilities are set out in the SGC Code of
Conduct. The SGC meets every other year, where required also more frequently, and reports to the
Board every six months. In 2015 a total of two meetings were held: In addition to the subjects of the
Bettercoal initiative and sustainable procurement, the content enhancement of the sustainability
strategy and its implementation on the basis of the sustainability working programme were discussed
intensively. A key point of debate of the meetings is always the revision of the varied Group policies
already in place.
Represented in the SGC are the Group Management,
the global and regional units as well as the supporting
functions of E.ON by one representative each - as a
result, the entire range of management functions
along the E.ON value-added chain. The members also
suggest subjects on request and report to the SGC on
implementation progresses and suitable methods in
their units. In turn, they act across the Group as
ambassadors for the sustainability understanding of
E.ON.
From 2016, representatives of the operative business
of the three new E.ON business fields are being increasingly included in the SGC at the new E.ON.
Thus we want to integrate the subject of sustainability more strongly in the business processes. Within
the framework of revising the sustainability programme, we also verify what further tasks and
responsibilities the SGC should assume.
Operationalisation of the sustainable development
Our sustainability commitment is supported by a clear commitment of the E.ON Board. The
operationalisation follows the principle of the functional control with a clear distribution of tasks

between the Group Management and globally or regionally acting units. The operating implementation
is "on site" with the line functions.
At the level of the Group Management the Sustainability Office oversees the sustainability subjects. It
advises the Board and is responsible for the preparation of the SGC meetings. Via the working
programme binding across the Group, our CR and HSE units of the Group Management and the
operating line functions are closely interconnected with one another.
The open and transparent dialogue with internal and external stakeholders is a further success factor
of our sustainability management.

Digression: Our HSE organization
In the HSE area, we look back on an organisational structure that has grown over many years and is
set out in the HSE Group policies. For all Group parts, framework requirements apply that were
created with the HSE committees and expert teams on site; the latter also control the operative
implementation. As well as the SGC, the HSE Governance Council reports directly to the Board and
advises it.
The following interactive chart shows how the individual HSE functions and committees interact with
one another.

Understanding and involving stakeholders
E.ON acts in an area of tension between different requirements and interests of social groups
(stakeholders) - both globally and regionally. Our top aim is to offer our customers innovative,
sustainable solutions and products and to thereby secure our business success. This is the only way
we can meet the expectations of our customers, employees, investors and other stakeholders.
We consider maintaining our stakeholder relationships to be part of the risk management: in dialogue,
we identify early before decision-making processes possible conflict subjects, but also opportunities
for new business areas. This gives us more security for long-term investments and enables us to act
quickly and with a view to the future in strategic action areas.

Expansion of the dialogues
The constructive and solution-driven dialogue with different stakeholders is part of our day-to-day
business processes. To promote a sustainable development, we have made stakeholder management
a core process of business management. In our working programme for 2015, we set ourselves the
target of carrying out at least 3 dialogue events. We have met this target.
Framework for stakeholder management
Our Group policy stakeholder management governs as a unified framework the handling of employees
and external stakeholders (except investors). It applies for so-called management units, i.e. Group
Management and global units as well as for regional units, support functions and majority holdings.
The tasks and responsibilities are clearly separated between them.

Promoting a climate-friendly future
There is broad consensus among scientists that global warming must be limited to 2ºC at the most.
Only in this way can risks be contained that are associated with the climate change. Nevertheless, for
a long time, a mandatory international framework for climate protection has been lacking. In 2015,
there were encouraging signals: At the Paris Climate Summit (COP21) in December, for the first time,
195 states committed themselves to climate protection. The agreement entails the ambitious goal of
limiting the Earth’s warming to a value clearly under 2ºC. In connection with this, there is the issue of
what role conventional sources such as coal, oil and gas will play within the scope of Europe’s energy
supply in the coming decades.
Even before Paris, as a company that supplies energy, we have been aware that a particular
responsibility rests with us with regard to climate protection. Both the procurement and generation as
well as the transport and consumption of power result in large quantities of climate-impacting gases
being released, in particular carbon dioxide (CO 2). Climate change is primarily affected by
conventional power generation from fossil fuels; at the same time however, climate change can have
negative consequences on the security of supply. For example, extreme weather conditions such as
high quantities of precipitation or longer periods of drought can result in interruptions or failures in the
operation of our power plants due to a lack of cooling water or floods. Strong storms can impair the
operation of wind turbines.

Material aspects
In our materiality analysis we have analysed the expectations of our key stakeholders. The analysis
showed the following key topics of ‘climate protection’:
Expand renewable energies
The rapid and comprehensive expansion of renewable energies is the most important cornerstone of
climate change and remains a central demand of our stakeholders - this concerns not only E.ON, but

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

38

Climate protection

the entire energy industry. To what extent and how quickly we are able to shape and expedite the
transformation of the national and international energy supply markets does not only have an effect on
climate protection but also on our reputation to a great extent. At the same time, the increasing
international expansion of renewable energies holds sales potential for us: Our competence in
developing and executing projects and efficiently operating plants is increasingly in demand. Thereby,
we can secure an important competitive advantage because our practical experience, which is now
quite extensive, makes it possible for us to use technologies that take advantage of renewable
energies in an increasingly more efficient and inexpensive manner. In this way, we are actively
shaping the energy revolution and creating employment opportunities with prospects for the future.
Achieving efficiency improvements for our customers
In the face of rising energy costs for the end customer over the longer term and strict regulatory
requirements, energy efficiency is becoming more and more important. This gives us an important
social mission to achieve, but also a future market: Whether an industrial business or final consumer –
our customers increasingly ask for innovative concepts and offers that help them to save energy.
These include energy-efficient products and services such as energy monitoring or distributed power
and heat generation. By opening up new business fields and sales potential, we can contribute to
reducing our customers’ energy consumption, costs and carbon dioxide emissions at the same time.
Particularly in the field of industry, business and the public sector, the savings potential is high. There,
we would like to establish ourselves as a long-term partner for issues concerning energy
management.
Helping to shape developments regarding climate policy
For companies in the energy industry, decisions regarding climate policy, such as those adopted at
the climate conference in Paris, are of crucial significance. They have an effect on the issue
concerning what source of energy will be relied on in the future and what framework conditions for
investments in low-emission technologies will apply. Therefore, together with national and European
industry associations, we call on governments to develop consensual solutions despite differing
national interests. Already in October 2014, the European Commission, consisting of state and
government heads of EU countries, has given an important signal for a mandatory climate protection
programme: The 2030 EU Climate Change and Energy Package aims to achieve a 40 percent
reduction of EU greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared with a 1990 baseline. Furthermore, we
have been actively involved in CO2 emissions trading (European Emission Trading System – EU ETS)
under European climate change legislation since 2005. At this time, however, the system is not
fulfilling the intended management function due to the low level of certificate prices. Therefore, we
require a functional international framework that offers the necessary incentives for investing in lowemission technologies.
Avoiding carbon-intensive generating technologies in the energy mix
Especially in Germany, but also in other countries, environmental associations, the public and the
media are increasingly demanding a quick exit from carbon-intensive power generation technologies
such as coal. However, against the background of the accelerated phase-out of nuclear energy in
Germany, we believe that we can´t get by in the immediate future without coal or gas-fired plants.
Doing without these would compromise the target triangle between climate protection, supply security
and affordable energy. Opinion polls show that large portions of the population not only place

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

39

Climate protection

importance on renewable energies, but also on affordable energy, which can also result from fossil
fuel sources, such as coal, under certain circumstances. Therefore, we continue to work on energy
improvements for coal and gas-fired stations to reduce our carbon emissions and save costs for fuels
and CO2 certificates. Thereby, we are ensuring the security of supply at the same time.

Management and measures
Our steps toward a more climate-friendly energy supply are primarily managed by two units.
Conventional generation and renewables receive support from a number of entities, including the
Corporate Responsibility team at Group Management, and the E.ON Competence Center for CO2.
The E.ON Competence Center for CO2 collects and manages data such as direct and indirect CO 2
emissions or CO2 certificates within the scope of the European emissions trading system. In this way,
it supports us in fulfilling the EU reporting requirements associated with EU ETS as well as in CO2
reporting.
Take advantage of the growth of renewable energies
It remains a key growth area for E.ON to increase the share of renewable energy sources within the
entire scope of our power generation. Since 2007, we have invested EUR 10 billion in corresponding
projects. Thereby, there has been a particular focus in expanding and increasing onshore and
offshore-wind energy in the gigawatt range as well as solar power. Our global unit, E.ON Climate &
Renewables (EC&R), is responsible for the expansion of renewable energies. However, other regional
units such as E.ON Germany are participating in this.
With its portfolio, EC&R is one of the leading companies: In the ranking list of independent
organisation 4C Offshore for the offshore-wind field, E.ON has just recently moved forward to 2nd
place in a European comparison. E.ON in the United States has built up a strong position in the field of
onshore wind. Thereby, EC&R continues to work on making renewable energy more competitive,
thereby rendering it as inexpensive as possible. At the same time, while expanding renewable
energies, impact on the environment and biodiversity are avoided to the furthest extent possible and
maintained at a low level.
Optimising conventional generation fleet
In addition to the expansion of renewable energies, we operate conventional coal and gas-fired power
plants as environmentally friendly and efficient as possible. In our own power-plant park, we take
advantage of technological improvements and optimum maintenance management in order to reduce
energy consumption and the carbon dioxide emissions associated therewith. In conducting dispatch
planning and operating our power plants, we treat carbon dioxide emissions as a factor of production
which we continually try to use more efficiently, just as we do with other factors of production like
capital and fuel. We evaluate its "use” in an economic manner, taking into consideration profitability,
supply security and climate protection requirements in comparison with one another. We also take
these aspects into account within the scope of our long-term power-plant planning, for investment
decisions and within the scope of risk management. As part of our power-plant renewal programme,
we have taken around 12 GW of power-plant capacity in the field of coal and gas off the grid by the
end of 2015.

Offering energy-efficient solutions for our customers
Distributed power solutions are one of our strategic focuses in Europe. E.ON will continue to invest in
this market segment in the years ahead. Our business unit, E.ON Connecting Energies (ECT), is
already successfully specialised in distributed and integrated energy solutions and energy-efficiency
services. With them, customers from the fields of business, industry and the public sector are able to
reduce their energy consumption considerably. At the same time, ECT allows its customers to produce
electricity, heat, coldness, air pressure or steam directly on site in a cost-efficient manner. ECT
focuses on the markets of Germany, Great Britain, France and Italy. Due to the efficiency measures
carried out by ECT, average cost reductions between 20 and 40 percent are achieved – in part, even
more. Thereby, it has to do with such various fields of application such as the retail business or
shopping centres, assembly plants or production plants, logistics and distribution centres, research
centres, hospitals, office and administration or public buildings. In 2015, ETC strengthened strategic
partnerships with providers for energy-efficiency solutions and established alliances in Italy and
Germany, among other countries. Thereby, we have further expanded our market position in the field
of energy efficiency offers for the commercial, public and industrial sector.
Stand up for reliable framework conditions
We are involved in many rounds of talks with representatives from the political realm, associations,
industry and nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) for the political framework concerning climate
protection. In the run-up of adopting the EU Climate Change and Energy Package, we had
campaigned, for example, to raise the climate protection goal to 45 to 50 percent less greenhouse gas
emissions by 2030 in order to create an ambitious framework for all energy providers. The EU Climate
Change and Energy Package provide the goal to reduce greenhouse gases by 40 percent in
comparison to 1990. In addition, it requires to increase the share of renewable energies within the
scope of energy consumption to at least 27 percent by 2030 and to sink the level of energy
consumption by 27 percent in comparison to the current trend by means of improved energy
efficiency. Against the background of the outcome of the Paris Climate Summit, these goals are
expected to be renegotiated and may be more ambitious. Therefore, we will continue on our path and
continually reduce our carbon dioxide emissions by means of expanding renewable energies and
generating conventional power in an efficient manner.
Furthermore, we will campaign for a considerable strengthening of the European emission trade
system, seeing that the system still does not yet fulfil the intended management function due to the
low certificate prices and lacking investment incentives associated therewith. Only when carbon
dioxide emissions have a noteworthy price will there be sufficient incentives to avoid such emissions
as well as the required investment security required for these measures. In the process, European
commitment alone is not enough: Ultimately, we require international commitment to reduce
subventions for fossil energy sources as well as a global CO 2 market that promotes the best
technologies for avoiding carbon dioxide.

Targets & Performance Review
A central management instrument in the field of climate protection includes the CO 2 reduction goals
defined in our 2012-2015 sustainability work programme. In particular, this includes halving the carbon
dioxide intensity of our power generation in Europe from a baseline of 0.63 metric tons of carbon
dioxide per MWh and increasing the share of renewable energies within the scope of our entire power

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

41

Climate protection

production. Furthermore, we intend to reduce the carbon dioxide footprint of our daily business
activities that are not directly related to power generation by 20 percent by the year 2020 from a 2010
baseline. For example, this concerns carbon dioxide emissions that result from business trips, E.ON
company vehicles, and fuel transport.
Back in 2007 we set the goal of reducing our specific carbon emissions. In 2009, we reinforced this
commitment by joining other companies in our industry in a pledge that 95 percent of the power we
supply will be zero carbon by 2050.

The expansion of our renewables generation and all efficiency measures influence our carbon
intensity. This is a key indicator for judging our efforts in the field of climate protection. We ended our
sustainability work programme in 2015. Until today, we have reduced the CO 2 intensity of power
generation in Europe by almost 45 percent in comparison to the reference year 1990. – In 2015, it was
at 0.35 metric tons of carbon dioxide per MWh. By further developing our generation portfolio, we have
taken an important step toward the target mark specified in our self-commitment: In 2015, the share of
self-generated renewable energies was almost 14 percent.
In 2016, under our new strategy, the conventional power plants and renewable energies (without
hydropower) will each make their contribution to climate protection in the new companies E.ON and
Uniper. For this, both companies will develop new goals. They will move within the scope of the
aforementioned industry commitments and drive on the E.ON goals up until this point in their basic
approach. In this way, our goal to expand renewable energies (20 percent of power generation by
2020) will be replaced by a more ambitious goal for the future E.ON.

Expand renewable energies
Since 2007, we have invested more than EUR 10 billion in renewable energies. In 2015, the share of
renewable energies was almost 14 percent of our total power generation. With them, we make a
considerable contribution to climate protection: Since the founding of the renewable energy sector at
E.ON, more than 60 million metric tons of CO2 have been avoided. For comparison: The city of Berlin
emits around 10 million metric tons of CO2 per year. With its great ecological and economic potential,
renewable energies remain a central growth and investment focus for us.
Michael Lewis, CEO of E.ON Climate & Renewables: “We are proud of what has been achieved. We
will continue to invest and work hard to make renewable energy competitive thereby making it as
inexpensive as possible for our customers."
On a worldwide level, renewable energies must stand their ground in competition with other sources of
energy. In order to continue to bring this effort forward, we had made our goal to reduce the
investment and operation costs by 25 percent for onshore wind, 40 percent for offshore wind, and 35
for photovoltaic power by 2015 (in comparison with the baseline year 2010). To achieve this, we are
focusing mainly on generating cost advantages through the application of new technologies on an
industrial scale. In 2015, we reached the goals specified. We will continue to work to retain our leading
position in the field of offshore wind power in the future.
More wind yield on account of intelligent planning
An important determining factor for reducing costs for on- and offshore-wind farms entails optimal
placement of the turbines. For this reason, in 2015, together with E.ON Technologies, we have
successfully implemented a special IT-supported planning instrument in the field of offshore-wind
power. With it, we reduced the costs for cabling by approximately 2 percent and increased the wind
power yield by around 3 percent. In the future, we would also like to minimise the cost of new onshore
wind farms and use the technology for planning future onshore wind sites globally.
2nd place for wind power at sea
E.ON invests in offshore-wind power on a large scale. The technology is an important cornerstone of
the energy revolution and holds great economic potential. By commissioning the offshore wind farms
Amrumbank West and Humber Gateway, we moved forward to second place in a European
comparison of offshore wind power operators. Amrumbank West lies 35 kilometres north of
Heligoland. With an installed power amounting to 302 MW, the wind farm can supply approximately
300,000 households with renewable energy and avoid more than 740,000 metric tons of CO 2 annually.
Humber Gateway lies 8 kilometres off Britain's East Coast near Yorkshire. It has an installed power of
219 megawatts and can provide about 170,000 households thus with climate-friendly power.
Altogether, we have built, in some cases with partner involvement, nine wind farms in the North Sea,
Baltic Sea, and Irish Sea. At the end of 2015, our offshore generating capacity stood at 1,052 MW
(Accounting View) – 520 MW more than in the previous year. Further expansion is quickly pressing
on: Currently were building the offshore wind farm Rampion with 400 MW of power. It lies in the

English Channel south of Brighton and will save 600,000 metric tons of CO 2 annually after its
completion. We are currently executing another project at the Arkona Basin South-East site, northeast
of the island of Rügen. For all offshore projects, we place a great deal of importance on compromising
the environment as little as possible, thereby maintaining biodiversity.
Establish worldwide in the field of wind power on land
In addition to offshore, E.ON also invests extensively in onshore wind power. Here, since 2007, it has
been possible for us to move to 12th place among leading wind power operators. Especially in the
USA, we have established a strong position due to the development, implementation and operation of
wind farms. As part of a joint venture with General Electric Energy Financial Services, we are building
a 200-MW wind farm in Grandview, east of Amarillo, located in Texas. With the Roscoe complex, we
have furthermore been operating the largest wind farm in the country since 2008 (a total capacity of
782 MW). It stretches across an area that is half as large as New York City. Furthermore, during the
course of the year 2016, we are expecting the investment decision concerning the Afton wind farm (50
MW) in Scotland. At the end of 2015, our total onshore production capacity was at 3,391 MW
(Accounting View), nearly constant in comparison to the previous year.
When building wind turbines, the involvement of citizens plays an important role – as is the case with
all other projects dealing with renewable energies.
Production of solar power systematically further developed
The expansion of photovoltaics (Photovoltaics – PV) is a growth market for E.ON. Therefore, we
systematically research the potential of this technology, with which the radiation power of the sun can
be directly transformed into electricity. At the same time, we are expanding our portfolio of PV plants.
In 2015, we executed a total of 14 projects in Europe and the USA. By the end of the year, the
capacity of the plants reached a value of more than 169 MW in relation to 130 MW in 2014. The
geographical focus is – as is it the case with onshore wind power - in the United States. In 2015, we
have also further reinforced our commitment there. In August, E.ON completed the Alamo solar park
in San Bernardino County located near the city Oro Grande, having a capacity of 20 MW. Immediately
after commissioning, the PV power plant was sold to the company Dominion. At Maricopa West in
Californian Kern County, we connected a 20 MW PV power plant consisting of 89,000 solar modules
to the grid in November. Thereby, we exceeded both the budget as well as the originally planned time
frame.
We are expanding our solar activities in Germany as well. Contrary to the public's perception, there is
still a large market for PV plants there. In 2015, we have concluded contracts for solar parks in
Germany with a total of 11.6 MW. Other solar parks are planned in Germany.
Also homeowners and medium-sized enterprises often use solar energy for generating their own
electricity. Economically interesting potential for distributed-energy storage has resulted from this.
Since this year we offer a storage system for solar energy Together with SOLARWATT GmbH located
in Dresden. It is based on lithium ion technology, can be expanded on a modular basis and has an
extremely high degree of effectiveness. Thereby, the operators can increase their own use of their PV
plants and continually reduce electricity costs. The system can be comfortably monitored and
controlled using the integrated app.

Promoting the energy revolution among
customers
In addition to expanding renewable energies, another important cornerstone for the new energy world
is the distributed production of power. Thereby, the customer is no longer just a consumer, but plays
also an increasing key role as an energy producer. In the future, millions of distributed small plants will
be consolidated and photovoltaic modules, key plants or thermal storage systems will be integrated
into the energy system.
Therefore, it is one of our strategic focuses to face this important trend and offer our customers
distributed-energy solutions. We will continue to invest in this market segment in the coming years.
Our business unit E.ON Connecting Energies (ECT) has already successfully specialised in integrated
energy solutions in the fields of integrated heat production, energy efficiency, flexibility, virtual power
plants and battery storage systems. With this range of solutions, ECT is specifically targeting
customers from the fields of business and industry as well as the public sector.
Savings of more than 40 percent achieved
ECT designs and implements individual measures so that customers can reduce their energy and
operational costs in a sustainable manner. On the average, due to this, ECT customers have been
able to save between 20 and 40 percent of their energy costs during the course of the past years.
Thereby, in 2015, we were able to carry out an extensive energy savings programme in the corporate
division Turbo at Voith GmbH at their Garching location. Due to improvements in heating energy and a
higher level of energy efficiency of ventilation systems and pumps, the customer was able to reduce
more than 40 percent of its building technology energy costs. At the same time, CO 2 emissions were
dropped by 1,000 metric tons annually.
Expanding the cogeneration of heat and power
Combined heat and power plants (CHP plants) can considerably reduce energy consumption and CO 2
emissions by generating electricity and heat at the same time. We are therefore consistently pushing
ahead the expansion of cogeneration technology both by ECT and by the regional units. In this way,
ECT alone expanded cogeneration capacities by almost 30 MW of electrical power in 2015. For
example, highly efficient CHP plants have been built in the factories belonging to BMW in Dingolfing
and Regensburg, which have reduced the carbon emissions from both factories by around 10,000
metric tons annually. For the Italian industrial customer Goglio, ECT has put a gas-powered 4.4 MW
cogeneration plant and a 1.6 MW refrigerator into operation in 2015. Due to this, Goglio, a globally
leading company in the packaging industry has reduced its electricity costs by 30 percent and has
saved 20 percent of its power costs. At the same time, CO 2 emissions are dropped by 6,300 metric
tons on an annual basis. ECT built a cogeneration plant at the German production site Groß-Gerau for
Procter & Gamble (P&G). With this measure, P&G is sinking its annual carbon dioxide emissions by
approximately 3,000 metric tons. A CHP plant also entails the effective use of the process heat
generated during production by means of intelligent thermal recovery. Furthermore, the CHP plant at
the P&G site is going to be part of the virtual power plant (Virtual Power Plant – VPP) operated by

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

46

Climate protection
Efficiency and distributed energy solutions
E.ON, thereby contributing to the overall stability of the energy systems. Another plant with 60 MW of
power is going to be hooked to the grid in Marl in 2016.
Virtual power plants
VPPs make distributed-energy solutions easier to plan and manage. VPPs consist of a cluster of
smaller generating units – such as wind turbines and (micro-)CHP systems– at different locations that
are remotely controlled and dispatched to meet loads if they constituted a single larger unit. Also on
the demand side, flexible consumption systems such as electric ovens, refrigerated warehouses or
heat pumps can be included in the group. This decreases the need for higher peak power production
and the carbon dioxide emissions associated with it.
Virtual power stations open up marketing paths to participants, over the control energy market for
example. Since 2013, E.ON has had a VPP platform called the Control Energy Management System
(CEMS) for decentralised systems and has integrated several steam and combined-cycle gas turbines
(CCGT plants) into it. CEMS enables this capacity to participate in the control energy market, which
provides backup power to maintain grid stability in response to unforeseen occurrences, such as when
a power station has an equipment failure and has to be taken offline. CEMS not only benefits E.ON as
its operator, but also the owners of generating units who receive compensation for their readiness in
participating in it with their plants.
At the end of 2013, E.ON put in place a “VPP engine” in Germany to market the output of smaller
distributed generating units and to provide their owners with individually tailored solutions. The
platform, which has been developed by E.ON in its entirety, consists of IT systems, communications
hardware, links to wholesale power trading floors, products, and contracts.
ECT carefully checks the suitability of possible allied participants. In 2015, for example, the suitability
of four electric arc furnaces belonging to the customer RW Silicium, one of the producers of
metallurgic silicon, could be determined. For this purpose, they were connected with the VPP platform
by ECT and pre-qualified for marketing as a potential provider. The electrical loads of the stoves are
flexibly managed via the platform. Thereby, RW Silicium was able to reduce the load put on its power
system and participated in the market for control energy for power consumption that is too high. The
“VPP engine” was also used for the first time in Great Britain in 2015 and should furthermore be
introduced in other countries gradually.
Long-term partnerships for integrated energy-saving solutions
ECT is forging long-term strategic partnerships to provide distributed-energy and energy-efficiency
solutions to business customers. Among others, partners include METRO Cash & Carry in Germany,
the worldwide leading Italian beverage company, Acqua Minerale San Benedetto, or the material
manufacturer, FRIATEC located in Mannheim. Through long-term energy partnerships, we help our
customers to reduce their energy and operational costs by means of integrated efficiency measures
over the term of several years.
We are building similar partnerships with customers in other countries as well. We are working with
the Dega Group, a leading developer and operator of commercial and industrial parks in Russia, to
design a long-term plan to enhance its energy efficiency. Both partners are building and operating

local power plants to supply the Dega Business Park. In 2015, for example, the industrial park,

Ensure supply with bridging technologies
For the time being, generating capacity in Germany and Europe are sufficient to cover the current
level of demand for electricity. This is achieved through the use of state-backed renewable energies
and the existing conventional generating fleet. Low-carbon dioxide electricity generation using wind
and solar power is, however, not reliably available; its fluctuations must be compensated in order to
ensure a reliable power supply.
For this reason, E.ON relies on conventional power plants and the storage of energy in various forms.
In order to enable an efficient and inexpensive reorganisation of the energy system, flexible
conventional plants will still be necessary over the course of the next decades. Modern gas-fired
plants are especially suited for this, being able to quickly increase and decrease their level of power,
but also with coal and nuclear power plants that have been adjusted with flexible technologies.
Decreasing carbon dioxide emissions from power and heat generation
However, conventional energy generation from coal and gas is responsible for around 96 percent of
our direct CO2 emissions.
Carbon emissions from power and heat generation (in million metric tons)

In 2015, E.ON emitted a total of 76.8 million metric tons of CO2 from power and heat generation, of
which 46.7 million metric tons of CO2 were emitted in EU countries. In comparison with the previous
year, we have shown a considerable decrease by almost 20 percent. This had several causes: In
addition to a lower electricity production, also a low-carbon generation mix contributed to this. While
share of renewable energies increased, power production from coal and gas continued to decline.

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

49

Climate protection
Handling CO2-intensive production
Efficiency increased – excess capacity abolished
Even the most environmentally friendly combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plants cannot be
operated in an economically viable manner currently. This is due to the low wholesale price for
electricity, excess capacities leading to under-utilisation, and the low price of carbon certificates. To
improve the competitiveness of our generation fleet we are continuing to reorganise our conventional
generation portfolio. Besides efficiency improvements, by the end of 2015, we have taken several
power-plant units with a capacity of around 12 GW out of operation under our power-plant renewal
programme, including the coal-fired power station units Karlshamm, Provence 4, as well as Veltheim 3
and 4.
Datteln: Construction permit granted
Our hard coal-fired power plant Datteln 4 in Germany will also – after commissioning – noticeably
improve environmental footprint. With an electrical efficiency of around 45 percent, Datteln 4 is
achieving monthly reductions of around 100,000 metric tons of CO 2 compared to old power plants
which are going to be replaced with this. Furthermore, seeing that it can be ramped up and down more
quickly, Datteln 4 can also prevent network fluctuations. This means the plant can jump into action on
windless, cloudy days. Overall, it will also supply district heating to around 100,000 homes. An
important milestone was achieved in 2015 with the conclusion of the local discussion meeting in the
course of approval procedures. As a result, on 4 March 2016, the district government of Münster
issued the temporary planning and building permit.
Degree of efficiency of the coal and CCGT portfolio increased
Within Europe, the average efficiency of our coal-fired and combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power
plants when generating electricity is currently 39 percent and 53 percent respectively. It is well above
the global average of 33 percent for coal-fired and 45 percent for CCGT power plants. The average
efficiency of our plants measured from 2008 through 2015 has improved by 2 percent compared to the
year before. This was achieved particularly through the decommissioning of older plants.
Coal and CCGT portfolio rejuvenated
By the end of 2015, the average age of our coal-fired power plants fell from 36.5 to 36 years within the
scope of our portfolio rejuvenation. By contrast, the average age of our CCGT power plants, all of
which are still in operation, rose from 22 to 25 years.
Using biomass to achieve carbon reductions
Coal-fired power plants can be converted to co-fire biomass with a few changes to the firing process,
fuel transportation, and storage. To improve our carbon footprint, we are now using this option at
many locations.
Complete conversion to biomass
Our lifecycle analyses show that CO2 emissions can be reduced by around 80 percent through
conversion to biomass firing. This is why we are equipping several of our coal-fired power plants with
the necessary technology for pure biomass operation. For this purpose, the Ironbridge power plant in
the UK has served as a test site from 2013 until the end of its operating life in 2015. The coal-fired
power station, Maasvlakte, which was handed over to the generation fleet in 2015, has been designed
from the start for the co-combustion of up to 22 percent of biomass. In this way, up to 1.4 million

metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions can be avoided annually. In addition, with the support of the
French government we have begun converting unit 4 of our Provence coal-fired power plant to
biomass firing. The wood chips used are sourced from forestry and waste wood. The project includes
new facilities for fuel transport and storage, modification of the firing process, upgrading of the steam
turbines, the integration of a new, air-cooled generator, and measures to extend the operating life of
the power-plant unit by 20 years. After a test phase, the plant with 170 MW of power is going to be
hooked to the grid again. It should provide us with valuable technical experience in the large-scale use
of biomass as a fuel.

Investment security for more climate protection
Making climate protection advancements demands extensive investment in energy-efficient
technologies. This requires an international approach and appropriate framework conditions to offer
investors security.
International climate protection framework: positive signals from Paris and Brussels
E.ON supports global efforts to create a policy framework to establish a climate-friendly energy world.
Together with national and European industry associations we are call on governments to develop a
consensual solution despite differing national interests. We consider the Paris Agreement and the
2030 EU Climate Change and Energy Package to be important cornerstones.
Promising preliminary results were highlighted at the 21st Climate Conference in Paris (COP 21) held
in December 2015: There, 196 parties communicated a new global agreement that should form a
sophisticated climate regime from 2020 on. Furthermore, they have set a limit for the first time; they
want to limit the Earth's warming to considerably under 2°C compared to the preindustrial age. After its
ratification, the agreement shall apply to industrial, emerging and developing countries alike, imposing
climate protection obligations upon them. This includes the demand to design energy supply in the
most climate-neutral way possible in the coming decades. It is E.ON’s view that decisions made in
Paris constitute an important step and must be consequently implemented.
 E.ONs expectations on the Paris international climate agreement
An important incentive for the international Paris Climate Protection Agreement was given by the 2030
EU Climate Change and Energy Package. This was adopted in October 2014 by the European
Commission, consisting of the state and governmental heads of the EU countries. It aims to achieve a
40 percent reduction in EU greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared with a 1990 baseline.
Furthermore, in comparison to 2005, the share of renewable energies within the scope of power
consumption should be increased by at least 27 percent by 2030. At the same time, energy
consumption should be decreased by 27 percent due to optimised efficiency. In March 2016, we
signed the "Statement from the Coalition for Higher Ambition". With this declaration, we together with
power companies, NGOs and other organisations are calling upon EU policy to provide a clear,
mandatory and, above all, aspiring framework for the implementation that will take place in the coming
decades.
Markets for admission rights as important leverage in the field of climate protection
In addition, it is our view that a central component of climate-friendly power in the future is that carbon
is “priced” as stipulated in the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). The Paris
Climate Protection Agreement also mentions emissions trade as an important measure for a climateneutral energy supply.
Since 2005 E.ON has been actively involved in carbon dioxide emissions trading under European
climate change legislation. The key advantage of this climate policy tool is that it offers a structure that
encompasses all countries and economies. At this time, however, the EU ETS is not performing its

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

52

Climate protection
Climate policies and emissions trading
intended function as it does not provide incentives for investment. When the EU ETS was introduced,
the European Commission estimated the price of a metric ton of CO 2 would stabilise at around EUR
30. However, it currently costs less than EUR 7 (as of January 2016). This is because there are too
many certificates in circulation at present.
In order to achieve a price increase by means of their scarcity, the free assignment of CO 2 emission
rights to energy providers was given up in 2013. Since then, we have to buy all emission certificates at
auction or procure them by the market. We are only allocated allowances at no cost for a portion of the
heat we cogenerate. In 2015, we had to provide certificates for our emissions within the EU amounting
to 46.7 million metric tons of CO2. This amount corresponded to a market value of more than EUR 350
million based on the average CO2 price.
However, the price increase endeavoured was not achieved. After many years of discussion, in 2015,
the EU therefore decided to introduce a so-called market stability reserve from 2019 on. That means:
If the entire amount of admission certificates in a single year exceeds a certain threshold, a share of
the certificates will be automatically taken from the market and set into a reserve. In the opposite case,
the certificates are brought to the market again from the reserve. In principle, we support this
measure. In parallel to this, it is estimated that the ambitious European climate goals for 2030 will
contribute to the price of admission certificates recovering over the long-term. In this way, the EU
emissions trade would get back their control function when upgrading European energy systems. In
this way, it would be able to make to provide incentives for investing in low-emission technologies.
Avoiding national unilateral efforts
However, the endeavours to strengthen European emission trade are prevented by the climatepolitical and industrial-political unilateral efforts made by individual states along with the overlapping
regulations at a European level. For example, discussions are currently being held in France, Great
Britain, Germany and the Netherlands on additional climate protection instruments at a national level.
This could burden companies that take part in emission trade – therefore, we are critically observing
related discussions. In the free European emissions rights market that is being strived for, these
initiatives lead to emissions being relocated to other countries. An increase in the CO 2 price in one
country only leads to greater demand for energy from a different EU country where CO2 avoidance
costs are lower. Therefore, we are expressively pleading against related national instruments.
Collecting carbon data centrally
We have centralised data collection of CO2 emissions and certificates at the E.ON Competence
Service Center CO2. This improves the quality of our planning and makes our participation in the EU
ETS more efficient. The Service Center supports our regional units on issues such as carbon
monitoring and verification of the measured values.
Prepared for a CO2 regime in Turkey
CO2 emissions monitoring, reporting, and verification regulations based on EU guidelines have been
agreed in Turkey. The results have to be reported for the first time in 2016. Group Management is
supporting E.ON International Markets in ensuring regulations and methods are implemented correctly
in Turkey.

Dealing with green power certificates
In addition to CO2 emission rights, we also deal with "Renewable Energy Certificates" (RECs). Once
again, E.ON Climate & Renewables (EC&R) participated in the trade of RECs on the United States
market in 2015. In contrast to Europe, different rules apply there. In Europe, RECs certification will be
replaced by an alternative procedure in 2016. Furthermore, we participated in compensation
mechanisms using “Certified Emission Reductions“ (CER). In 2015, we purchased certificates
amounting to around 35,000 metric tons of CO2 within the scope of projects in China and Tunisia.

Reducing our carbon dioxide footprint
Transparent reporting is an essential part on our path to tomorrow's energy world. With it, we are
documenting the credibility of our carbon dioxide reduction goal and are identifying important areas of
action. Since 2004, we have been publishing the CO2 emissions from our power generation at the
independent organisation CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project). Since 2005, we
have been ascertaining and publishing our CO2 intensity, a key metric for our CO2-reduction goal. In
addition, this is now the fifth year we have ascertained the total carbon footprint of the E.ON Group.
Excellent climate reporting
In November 2015, E.ON was awarded by CDP as a leader in the DACH region (Germany, Austria,
Switzerland) for climate reporting. CDP deemed worthy the quality, the process and the transparency
of the data which E. ON publishes as part of the annual CDP Climate Change Report. We received
the highest score “100A” and were accepted into the so-called “Leadership Group”. Only ten percent
of the companies under examination from all industrial sectors were able to manage it into this
leadership index, where we are listed as a leading company in the industry. The good outcome was
also a result of the close cooperation of the national and international teams made up of our IT experts
and specialist employees. The CO2 data that we have made available has been evaluated by an
independent authority.
The annual CDP Climate Change Report can be accessed here.
CDP is one of the largest associations of international investors and works as a non-profit
organisation. Every year, climate data are gathered by publicly listed companies. Using the data, the
investors can ascertain if the company is taking the topic of climate change into consideration in its
decisions and structures to a sufficient extent – according to CDP, a prerequisite for this entails a
company being prepared for changed sustainability requirements brought forth by the markets and
regulators.
Transparency by extensive carbon accounting
When calculating our CO2 emissions, we include the complete value chain – ranging from our
suppliers all the way to our end-consumers. Besides carbon emissions from power and heat
generation, we also take into account the carbon emissions resulting from our daily activities not
directly related to power and heat generation. At the end of 2015, our entire direct and indirect CO 2
emissions were around 200 million metric tons of CO2. This "footprint" provides important knowledge
on how we can further reduce our carbon emissions – either directly or indirectly.

hexafluoride (SF6) or methane (CH4) play a less significant role.
Direct emissions from our power generation (Scope 1)
Scope 1 consists of emissions from our own facilities and plants, for example plants for generating
power; including the carbon dioxide emissions from methane and nitrous oxide (laughing gas) (see
also GRI Content Index G4 EN15). It accounts for the majority of our carbon dioxide emissions.

In 2015, our Scope 1 emissions amounted to a total of 80.1 million metric tons of CO2. With around 47
million metric tons of CO2, the largest part of it can be accounted for in Europe. Developments within
our Scope 1 emissions are often subject to cyclical fluctuations due to a change in power demand. In
total, our Scope 1 emissions in 2015 as well as during the previous year have further decreased – in
comparison to 2014 by around 20 percent. This could be traced back to a low level of power
generation. Additionally, it was composed of a low-carbon-dioxide generation mix with a considerably
increasing share of renewable energies and nuclear power as well as a reduction in power generation
using coal.
Indirect emissions associated with our electricity and heat production (Scope 2)
Scope 2 consists of emissions that we can influence indirectly. These include those that result from
the production of electricity we purchase to run our facilities, from the generation of heat and steam, or
from losses during the distribution of power and natural gas in our own networks.

The values for the upstream CO 2 emissions were calculated by geographical region (“location-based

In 2015, our Scope 2 emissions amounted to 3.6 million metric tons of CO2 slightly under the level of
the previous year (2014: 3.9 million metric tons of CO2). In comparison to our direct or other indirect
emissions, the amount is of little relevance.
According to the “GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance” expanded in 2015, the value for the power
procurement contained in Scope 2 is determined in two ways. As in previous years, the values for the
upstream CO2 emissions were calculated by geographical region ("location-based"); these values are
also shown in the graph and the table. For example, these are based on average emission factors for
certain regions. The second method determines the emissions that truly arise due to the contracts of
energy suppliers ("Market-based"). According to our estimation, the value for related emissions moves
along the same scale seeing that we do not generally have any special contracts for green power
supply and these do not reach any level of magnitude.
Other indirect emissions (Scope 3)
Scope 3 consists of other indirect emissions that occur associated with our business activities. Among
other things, they accrue due to business trips or the electricity or gas consumption of our customers.
The latter causes the largest amount of the Scope 3 emissions.

In 2015, our Scope 3 emissions amounted to a total of 119.6 million metric tons of CO 2. They have
sunk by about 10 percent in comparison with 2014. Among other things, it is the reduction compared
with the previous year can be explained by the drop of carbon dioxide emissions resulting from
business trips, the transport of fuels and electricity sales. In principle, the Scope 3 emissions exceed
our own emissions by more than 35 million metric tons of CO2. By contributing that these are reduced,
we accomplish an important social task and improve our market opportunities. Therefore, we are
developing new products and services with which we support our customers to emit a lower amount of
greenhouse gases. Our unit, E.ON Connecting Energies, for example offers customers from the field
of trade, industry or the public sector individual energy and CO2 savings solutions (see Efficiency and
distributed energy solutions).
We set ourselves the target of achieving a 20 percent reduction of our CO 2 emissions resulting from
everyday business activities not directly associated with power generation by 2020 in comparison with
2010. Since we have set this goal, Scope 2 and 3 emissions are showing a continuous decline. In the
2015 reporting year, these continued to fall from 127.6 million metric tons of CO 2 equivalents in 2014
to 123.1 million metric tons. We are also working to increase our efficiency further and to lower costs
so in future. Due to splitting E.ON and Uniper, however, carbon dioxide figures will only be
comparable to a limited extent.

Innovations for our energy future
E.ON wants to play an active role in the future of energy. So we want to find relevant technological
developments early on and integrate them into our innovation framework. We focus on marketable
solutions for renewable, decentralised and conventional power generation along with intelligent energy
consumption concepts. Renewable and decentralised power generation are taking a growing share of
the market, meaning new technologies need to be integrated in the existing systems in order to
guarantee supply reliability. So we are developing digitally integrated products and services for our
customers and support them in the efficient climate-friendly, independent production and consumption
of energy. We are convinced: Only market-based innovations will help create a future energy supply
that is safe, socially balanced and environmentally friendly.
Our company sees a bright future in areas such as supplemental distribution or long-term energy
management partnerships, to help build customer loyalty. However, we use these means not only to
improve our market position, but also increase profitability as many of the technological innovations
can also help save money. They increase the efficiency and life time of our systems and reduce the
maintenance requirements. At the same time, we can reduce our carbon footprint and with it our fuel
consumption and CO2 certificates. Last but not least; successful innovations help will improve our
reputation, making E.ON an attractive employer and attracting more talent.

Material aspects
We looked at key stakeholder expectations in our materiality analysis. The field of action ‘technological
development’ generated the following material aspects:
Make power generation more sustainable
The energy world is changing rapidly. Renewable energy is constantly expanding and our
stakeholders are increasingly questioning the need for coal-fired power plants. Investments in
conventional power generation technologies need to make a real contribution to a safe,

Technology development

environmentally friendly and affordable energy supply. The fluctuating energy feeds from wind and
solar power generation increase the need for high performance storage technology and flexibility both
in generation and consumption. Our research activities are intended to help meet these challenges
and secure our competitive advantage and knowledge lead. As part of the process we are working on
the continuous improvement of technology in all areas. We want to increase both the energy yield
from power generation along with stabilisation of the mains through the intelligent management of
energy flows and energy demand. In order to integrate the latest approaches and understand their
potential for the future, we are working together with innovative start-ups, research institutes and
universities.
Networking and digitising energy processes
Networking and digitisation will make decisive contributions to designing the climate-friendly energy
world of the future. Once the successful integration of energy production, storage, distribution and
consumption are in place, many small decentralised "Prosumers" (producers and consumers in one)
can work together to create a universal stable power supply. Our future business model will be based
more on providing customers with affordable, easy-to-use solutions. Thus the implementation of
projects focusing on the networking and digitalization of the power sector remains primary focus of
research and development. The strong network of energy companies and customers will give us a
competitive advantage and a knowledge lead.

Management and measures
The Technology and Innovation (T&I) department is integrated into the Group Management and has
centralised control over technological development at E.ON. T&I researches and develops along the
entire value chain in four different areas: conventional, renewable and decentralised power production
as well as customer-oriented solutions. We can thus move forward with projects at all levels from the
lab to market launch. The individual research projects have been broken down into seven Innovation
Centres:


Customer Solutions



Energy Intelligence



Generation



Distribution



Energy Storage



Energy Systems



Exploration & Production

They are directly integrated in the existing business units and are assigned with integrating
technological knowledge as efficiently as possible in our value chain.
Discovering the latest trends
In order to strengthen our innovation capacity, we have established further interfaces in the group
structure. Scouting and strategic co-investment play a major role here in identifying new business
models and products as well as making investments in strategic partnerships with young companies.
Since 2012, we have regularly made strategic co-investments in pioneering business models or
products, in order to integrate their innovations in E.ON's business and help increase the value of the

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

60

Technology development

company. Every year a select number of new co-investments are added. We invest primarily in startups in the middle phase of their development that are active in areas relevant to T&I.
So-called innovation scouts are assigned to uncover technological trends in an early stage and
develop new, pioneering business models. In addition they are assigned with protecting E.ON's
intellectual property.
Making good ideas marketable
Since 2013, we have supported the development of new business models in their early phases with
our ":agile" incubator”, an internal innovation and enterprise programme. It uses the creative potential
of our employees in order to bring ideas from the entire Group to market and thus develop new
business ideas beyond the ones we now have. Since 2014, we have also supported external projects,
which are developed independent of E.ON.
Integrating customers in research
As part of our structured development process for new products, we have been testing products not
yet on the market with a small group of customers in order to determine their market potential since
2014. In the 6- to 24-month test phases the products were improved based on customer feedback.
The subsequent development to marketability is then the responsibility of the group unit ordering the
tests.
Establishing competencies over the long term
As part of our T&I activities we take part in research projects with universities and research
institutions. The E.ON Energy Research Centre at the RWTH University in Aachen plays a key role in
the process. We focus primarily on the intelligent grid, customer behaviour and renewable energy. The
goal of our research is the long-term accrual of competencies needed to meet the future challenges of
the energy world.

Targets & Performance Review
We use our T&I projects to participate in the realization of the operational goals in the sustainability
work program. They include the economically advantageous reduction of our CO 2 emissions through
efficient, innovative technologies. In the future we will continue with our innovation activities and do
our part to help create efficient and climate-friendly power generation.
Investments in research and development
The expenditures on research and development (R&D) are a key indicator for the scope of our
innovativeness. In late 2015, investments were EUR 106 million - EUR 7 million more than in the
previous year. The increase is due to support for activities in infrastructure and end users, who
represent our strategic focus. Such investments now take up almost 60 percent of all R&D funding.
We use the funds very precisely to generate large and small innovations to shape the future, but need
to keep an eye on the development of the group at the same time.

Our strategic co-investments make an important contribution to the progress of energy technologies:
In December 2015 the 15th investment was finalised. Market launch plans were developed for the
majority of the start-ups. The transition of T&I projects to market readiness is often fluent, making it
difficult to name a precise figure.
Selected projects 2015
In 2015 E.ON performed various T&I projects for development focuses. A promising project in
infrastructure and storage is the development of the first modular large-scale battery storage M5BAT
(modular multi-megawatt, multi-technology medium voltage battery storage). Large-scale battery
storage is important to the expansion of renewable energy, as it will make a decisive contribution to
mains stability. On 12 August 2015 construction began on the M5BAT modular battery storage facility
began at the RWTH Aachen. The planned capacity of five megawatts and the high modularity - where
various battery technologies are linked together - make the storage system truly unique.
We focus on strategic co-investment with young companies, who have intelligent solutions for the
energy market of tomorrow using decentralised and smart energy solutions. We are thus able to
provide event greater support to our customers and promote intelligent energy consumption. In 2015
we made an investment in the US start-up Bidgely. Bidgely offers cloud-based energy applications via
the Internet and mobile interfaces. Households can thus better manage their energy consumption. For
example, customer's mobile devices provide tips for optimising electronic and heating devices. In
addition, we invested in Space-Time Insight in 2015. The company is also from the US and develops
analytical applications, which provide a graphic visualisation of consumption data in real time. In the
first step, we work together on a software solution, which makes it possible to reduce the error rate
when reading smart meter data. In 2015 the German start-up digimondo also opened for business.
The project develops intelligent, innovative infrastructure for the cities of tomorrow (Smart Cities).

In the renewable energy area, the T&I team in early 2015 supported an international cooperation
project testing vibration technology as alternative to classic pile-driving technologies. Anchoring using
vibrations under the right conditions is known to be a more environmentally friendly and cost efficient
solution. Together with RWE, DONG and Vattenfall, we are testing the vibration method in the
construction of wind farms in the North Sea off Cuxhaven. The work is coordinated by the Offshore
Wind Accelerator (OWA) research, development and demonstration initiative of the independent
organization of experts - Carbon Trust. The results will have a direct impact on our current
development projects.

 Materiality process

Foresighted environmental management
Our business as an energy company poses considerable environmental risks, primarily through our
operation of conventional power plants. With the combustion of coal and gas, harmful pollutants and
significant quantities of CO2 are released into the air. Waste products from conventional production
can also affect the environment if we do not dispose of them properly. Especially radioactive waste
resulting from the use of nuclear energy and the dismantling of facilities particularly provides us with
challenges.
Raw materials that we use in production processes are not available in unlimited quantities. We can
only operate our power plants in the future if we handle these resources carefully and efficiently. We
must also keep the potential effect on the environment in mind with the expansion of renewable
energy and rule out placing bird and fish species at risk.

Material aspects
In our materiality analysis we have analysed the expectations of our key stakeholders. In this regard,
we lay out the following significant topics in the field of ‘environmental protection’:
Avoiding impact of conventional power plants on the environment and biodiversity
Our conventional power plants contribute to security of supply by switching to low CO 2 energy
generation. Hence, reducing the impact that emerges from the use of coal, oil and natural gas towards
the environment and biodiversity remains a central concern for us. Government and society set high
demands. Naturally, we must satisfy these to secure our business activity as well. If we are successful
in reducing emissions from our power plants to the required level, we can meet stiffer environmental
regulations in advance and proactively counteract stricter requirements. A positive effect on the length
and cost of approval procedures is not a negligible concern either. If we do not observe environmental
regulations, it may result in fines and withdrawal of our approval.

Environmental protection

Environmentally replacing nuclear power plants and safely storing radioactive waste
The disposal of radioactive waste is the most important environmental issue in the coming year for 28
percent of all Germans. In accordance with the amendment to the German Atomic Energy Act that
entered in force in August 2011, all remaining nuclear power plants in Germany must be removed
from the grid by the end of 2022 at the latest. E.ON operates nuclear power plants in Germany and
Sweden. Environmentally-friendly decommissioning of these facilities and the safe handling of
radioactive waste is coming more and more into focus for us. We have already gained extensive
experience in decommissioning nuclear facilities from our first decommissioning projects. And as we
expand our competence in this area, the opportunity to move into new areas of activity opens up to us,
for example in offering consulting services in decommissioning.
Responsible use of water (Water management)
Water is an indispensible resource in our work. As the world population grows, and wealth and energy
consumption increases, the International Energy Agency (IEA) expects that water demand in the
energy sector will increase by 85 percent by 2035.In addition, climate change will affect the availability
of water, according to findings by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Therefore,
we must establish a responsible approach of handling water. Only this can ensure that this valuable
resource will also be available for our business and our stakeholders in the future. By implementing
new, innovative and environmentally friendly technologies for our facilities, we will require not only less
resources, but our operating costs will drop as well.
Considering environmental impact in the development of renewable energy and the grid
E.ON will also be developing renewable energy further in the coming years. This requires further
expansion of the grid, because locally generated power must be transported from the place of
1

production to the consumer. As we operate distribution networks in seven countries , this challenge
also affects E.ON. We must develop both of these – the development of renewable energy and the
expansion of the grid – as ecologically compatibly as possible. This is the only way that we can ensure
public acceptance of these projects. Development of the most environmentally friendly technologies
for the construction and operation of renewable generation facilities can also afford us a competitive
advantage in an internationally growing field of business and help us deal with increasing regulatory
requirements.

Management and measures
Our actions are guided by the precautionary principle endorsed by the United Nations. Hence, we
consistently support the concept that environmental damage will not even occur. For E.ON, integrity of
people is bound together with protection of the environment. A dedicated department at Group
Management is responsible for the foresightful management of our health, safety, and environmental
(HSE) performance. The management chapter of this report contains a detailed description of our
HSE organization.

Environmental protection

Uniform standards for environmental and climate protection
HSE Management, our business governance group directive that was released in September 2013,
requires all E.ON units, both global and regional, to introduce an externally certified environmental
management system. In this way, we want to combine group processes and ensure integrated and
effective health, safety and environmental (HSE) management within the group.
Part of the “HSE Management” group directive is our “Declaration of Principles for Health, Safety and
the Environment”. In this declaration of principles, we commit ourselves to reducing our ecological
footprint in all our areas of activity. We also commit our suppliers to fulfilling our HSE requirements.
For example, HSE Management and Performance include criteria that we apply testing under queries
for procurement from non-fuel suppliers. Depending on the size of the supplier, we require, among
other things, OHSAS 18001, ISO 14001 or EMAS III certificates or we conduct an HSE audit.
Identifying and avoiding environmental incidents
We monitor, inspect and maintain our facilities in accordance with our environmental management, so
as to prevent environmentally relevant incidents as much as possible. However, if such incidents
should occur, such as pollution by spillage, our environmental and crisis management will ensure that
the impact will be reduced as much as possible. With “Prevent!”, our online-based event management
system, we have documented such incidents centrally since 2012 and develop risk minimisation
measures on this basis.
Systematically identifying and allowing for environmental risks
Aspects of environmental protection such as biodiversity and water scarcity play an important role in
the development, planning and implementation of our generation projects. As required by
environmental management standards, we continually collect and evaluate all relevant environmental
factors. These vary by type of facility: with biogas facilities, we must primarily deal with air and noise
emissions, and with renewable energy such as wind turbines and power lines, with surface use and
biodiversity aspects.
In the planning of facilities, all project managers are responsible for taking into consideration the
results of environmental impact assessments (EIAs). They are supported at every phase of the project
– from construction and commissioning to operation – by our HSE experts. Regular meetings of the
HSE managers facilitate the exchange of experiences and best practices.
Decommissioning of nuclear power plants and storage of radioactive waste
The goal of E.ON Nuclear Power is to make a significant contribution to climate-friendly, reliable and
affordable electricity generation in Germany and to ensure safe and reliable decommissioning of
existing facilities. We have extensive experience in the dismantling of nuclear facilities under related
projects at the Würgassen and Stade sites. We will bring this expertise to future decommissioning of
other facilities.
Secure provisional storage of all radioactive waste from operations and decommissioning must be
ensured until the provision of necessary final storage facilities by the federal government. We fulfil this
requirement under the strict requirements of existing regulations. We are monitored by the appropriate
regulatory agencies in this regard.

Provisions for environmental protection measures
Before all else, our provisions for environmental protection measures ensure that we have enough
funds for possible sanitation and water protection measures and remediation of contaminated sites. In
2015 our short-term provisions for environmental-protection measures and similar commitments
amounted to EUR 76 million (2014: 75 Mio Euro); long-term provisions amounted to EUR 775 million
(2014: EUR 796 million).
Extensive water management
E.ON has been a member of the “UN CEO Water Mandate” (UN WM) since December 2015. We
belong to an easily manageable number of companies whose water management complies with the
requirements of the mandate. The UN WM is an internationally recognised voluntary association and a
network that seeks to improve water usage worldwide. With E.ON’s Water Management Corporate
Policy, which was approved at the end of 2014, we established an important requirement for
membership. The policy complements our HSE basic requirements for fundamental principles of
responsible water management.

Targets & Performance Review
For E.ON, environmental and climate protection go hand in hand. Our goals for reducing CO 2
emissions that we have set in our climate protection field of implementation also play into
environmental protection. Furthermore, we have set the following goal for our 2012-2015 operational
programme: we want to establish comprehensive water management along our value chain to meet
requirements for membership in the ‘UN CEO Water Mandate” by 2015. We were able to reach this
goal on schedule.
Environmental incidents in the E.ON Group
The effectiveness of our externally certified environmental management system can be recognised in,
among other things, the extent that we have been successful in avoiding environmentally-related
incidents in the E.ON Group. We divide environmentally relevant incidents into four categories:
“severe”, “moderate”, “minor” and “inconsequential”, based on certain features. Severe and moderate
environmentally related incidents are subject to reporting within 24 hours. They must meet at least one
of the established criteria. Examples of serious incidents include irreparable damage to protected
habitats or clean-up costs exceeding EUR 1.5 million.
In 2015 there were zero serious incidents and twenty-nine moderately serious incidents at E.ON. The
number of moderate incidents increased in comparison with the previous year, in which there were
only 16 incidents in this category. In addition, there were 120 minor incidents and 375 inconsequential
incidents. The number of inconsequential accidents decreased slightly; 391 incidents were recorded in
this category in 2014.
The steep decline in incidents with inconsequential impact – in 2014 there were still about 21,191
incidents in this category – can be attributed to the fact that gas leaks in the distribution network in
Romania in 2015 were not included in the calculation. Such incidents often occur due to the steel
piping still being used. This was not included in the calculation so that better comparability with other
incidents in this category could be established. It should be noted that although the number of

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

67

Environmental protection

moderate incidents in Sweden has increased, clearly less incidents with minor impact were reported.
This can presumably be attributed to a modified classification of incidents in Sweden.
Just as in 2014, there were no category one to seven incidents at our nuclear power plants in 2015,
based on the seven-level International Nuclear Event Scale (INES).

Avoiding environmental impacts
Avoiding environm ent al imp act s

Avoiding environmental impacts
We want to keep the impact of our activities on the environment as low as possible, or completely
avoid them. Naturally, E.ON complies with European, national and regional environmental regulations.
This is why we have defined environmental standards that apply to the entire E.ON Group - and we
also require our business partners and contractors to comply with them. Our business-governance
Group policy Health, Safety & Environment (HSE) Management is an effective framework for this. In
2015, the unified management system for health, safety and the environment (HSE) for all 16 German
companies was certified under OHSAS 18001 and under the international environmental management
standard ISO 14001: this applies a general HSE policy to much more than 200 sites in Germany
pursuing general HSE targets. Under this, all environmental management processes will be
transparent and uniform for all employees.
New technologies reduce emissions
Legislators, environmental organisations and the public constantly set higher and higher requirements
for energy producers to reduce the emission of pollutants. We work constantly on developing new
technologies to reduce the emissions of our facilities below legal requirements. For example, in 2015
we developed a high-tech ultrafiltration technology that removes even very small pollutants from waste
water. This is not possible with conventional water waste treatment facilities.
Also, in 2015 we tested a catalyst at the Staudinger plant that will further reduce not just emissions of
nitrogen oxides but also mercury. New European legislation sets limits for the first time on mercury
emissions from large coal-fired plants throughout Europe. Consequently, domestic limits will also be
stricter, starting in 2019. This is why we are developing the respective technical measures for
reduction of our mercury emissions.
Facility efficiency as the key to environmental protection
An important measure within our environmental management is resource efficiency in the building and
operation of our facilities. We optimise existing power plants and conceive new highly efficient facilities
with lower fuel consumption. We strive for high electrical efficiency. This value shows how much
electric power can be produced from fuel. A good example of this is our new coal-fired power plant
Maasvlakte 3 outside Rotterdam in the Netherlands, which entered service in 2015. It is one of the
most modern coal-filtered plants in Europe and is up to 47 percent more efficient than other coal-fired
plants, which globally reach an efficiency level of only 33 percent. Moreover, Maasvlakte allows
burning of up to 22 percent biomass instead of coal. This allows avoidance of up to 1.4 million metric
tons of CO2.
Maintaining natural habitats
As operators of power plants and distribution networks, we need to ensure that our business activities
do not jeopardise species and habitat diversity. We consistently comply with the requirements of
authorities and involve environmental experts when necessary. We conduct extensive environmental
impact assessments for new construction and operation and implement targeted projects and
measures for maintaining biodiversity. For example, during the construction of the Datteln coal-fired

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

69

Environmental protection
Avoiding environmental impacts
plant we are conducting not only regular environmental monitoring, but also compensating for the
intervention in nature caused by the new plant with measures such as afforestation.
We are aware that all our plants take up tracts of land where nature is no longer present in its previous
form. We must ensure, especially with facilities near nature reserves, that they have no negative
effects on the neighbouring or bordering nature reserves, and continually monitor their effect. The
following table displays selected German production sites of E.ON located less than 10 km from
reserves (for conventional power plants), less than 5 km (for wind parks) and less than 2 km (for
pumped storage power plants). Impact on protected areas is to be expected at these facilities due to
their physical proximity and the type of operations.

Protected areas as per Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and
Wild Fauna and Flora (the Flora-Fauna-Habitat (FFH) Directive)

River power plants were not included in the consideration because they seal no green areas and it has
been shown that these provide new habitats for flora and fauna, and so are conducive to protection of
nature. Also, we have implemented numerous measures in the concession areas of our hydroelectric
plants in 2015 to improve biodiversity in the aquatic environment. Among other efforts, we have
refurbished or newly installed upstream fish migration systems similar to nature to improve access for
fish migration on the respective rivers. We have also created new spawning grounds in the Lech
River, and thus begun to reactivate a so-called Auenbach back to the Isar. This will engender new
habitats and retreats, showing that hydroelectric power and protection of the environment go hand in
hand, and rivers can sustainably be used for climate-friendly hydroelectric power.
Commitment to biodiversity along our networks
Impact on nature is also exerted by the operation of distribution networks that transport electric power
to our customers. For example, this happens through the erection and operation of power lines, which
may pass through forests and lead to habitat changes in flora and fauna. In addition, overhead lines
present a hazard for birds. For this reason, the employees of our regional supply companies
undertake a variety of measures to preserve species and habitat diversity, despite their creating or
resulting in possible limitations to existing networks. For example, in 2015 E.DIS implemented sitespecific measures for the protection of large birds on new and existing overhead power lines, as in
previous years. These include technical protection measures such as insulation and marking of lines
to prevent collisions, and thus fatal flashovers, between birds and the lines. In addition, breeding and
nesting places for white storks and ospreys have been provided at the expense of E.DIS and mounted
on masts. E.DIS works closely with the Wildlife Protection Society of Germany (NABU) in this.
Alternative management concepts even accord an ecological added benefit for animals, plants and
habitats under high tension lines. Bayernwerk continued its grazing project in 2015: the paths under

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

71

Environmental protection
Avoiding environmental impacts
the lines are kept in their natural growth state by grazing. This not only contributes to a secure network
operation, but also to ecological diversity.
Environmentally friendly expansion of renewable energy
Compared with conventional generation systems, renewable energy is tied to reduced CO 2 and
pollutant emissions. Nonetheless, we must take into consideration environmental requirements and
maintaining biodiversity in the construction and operation of these facilities.
One example is the pile foundation in the construction of offshore wind parks; here it is a case of
largely reducing the noise that is produced by pile driving in the marine environment – otherwise,
sensitive animals such as porpoises and fish may be disturbed or even injured. We made enormous
technical and financial efforts to meet the strict limits set by the authorities during the construction of
the Amrumbank West wind park, which came on line in October 2015: among other things, we divided
the project into several phases in coordination with another E.ON project to perform no pile driving
when there were large numbers of porpoises in the protected area adjacent to the wind park.
Furthermore, a technically optimised noise reduction system was used in series. In relation to this,
E.ON conducted a research project in cooperation with the Technical University of Brunswick called
“Triad”.
For the planned Arkona Becken Southeast offshore wind park to be constructed in the Baltic Sea, we
undertook basic environmental monitoring before construction between the beginning of 2014 and the
beginning of 2016. We started a further required environmental monitoring process in relation to this in
March 2016. It will accompany the seven year construction and ensuing operational phase. We are
carrying out the research in cooperation with the Spanish energy company Iberdrola, which is
currently building the adjacent offshore wind park Wikinger. In this way, we ensure that there is no
doubling up of the use of ships and aircraft during monitoring and the environment is not unnecessarily
burdened.
Offshore and onshore wind facilities will operate with a greater amount of gear, transformer and
hydraulic oil. Every facility is provided with its own catch area so as to avoid contamination of ground
and water from oil leakage. With additional measures, we seek to react appropriately to emergencies
such as an unplanned discharge of oil from leakage. We conducted specific measures related to this
in 2015 in several countries: special emergency plans were developed in the UK and the USA, and
employees trained accordingly. We successfully tested the use of biodegradable oil in replacement for
existing hydraulic oils in Sweden. It is biodegradable and not toxic to aquatic organisms. These best
practice measures are first tested in individual countries before they are utilized in operations
elsewhere, if necessary.

Decommissioning of nuclear power stations
and storage of radioactive waste
Deco mm ission ing of nu clear po wer station s and stor ag e of r adio active wast e

Maximum safety during operation,
decommissioning, dismantling and disposal
We bring a high level of responsibility in the operation and decommissioning of our nuclear power
plants and the related storage of radioactive waste – we are aware of this. Security is our top priority in
both the operation of our nuclear power plants and the decommissioning of our facilities and disposal
of the resulting radioactive waste.
E.ON Nuclear Power – Preussen Elektra from 2016 on – operates eight nuclear power plants in
Germany, of which we removed three of the facilities operated by E. ON (Isar 1, Unterweser and
Grafenrheinfeld) from the grid due to legal regulations; these are currently in shutdown status. We
th

plan – subject to the result of the constitutional complaint against the 13 amendment to the Atomic
Energy Act – to directly dismantle these facilities and have submitted the required applications for this.
The approval process is still underway. Upon completion of the decommissioning of the Würgassen
nuclear power plant in North Rhine-Wesphalia in August 2014, the Stade nuclear power plant was well
advanced in its decommissioning.
Our facilities at Brokdorf, Grohnde and Isar 2 will be gradually removed from the grid by 2022, subject
to the constitutional complaint. They will be operated with highest reliability and in substantial
autonomy by Preussen Elektra until the end of their active life in 2022. Furthermore, we held a
majority interest in another facility in Sweden in 2015.
Safe operation of our facilities up to the last day
In 2014, we were able to successfully complete the nuclear decommissioning of our former nuclear
power plant in Wurgassen, which was shut down for economic reasons in 1997. The Stade nuclear
power plant was also removed from operations for economic reasons in 2003, and has been
decommissioned since 2005. The Stade facility is currently in the final phase of its decommissioning.
With these successful decommissioning projects, we have developed extensive decommissioning
experience that will be very helpful in the forthcoming projects.
Our expertise is also sought after by other nuclear plant operators: We provide our knowledge to third
parties through respective consulting services. In May 2015, we were represented for the first time at
th

the 46 Annual Meeting on Nuclear Technology (AMNT) and presented our competence in
decommissioning of nuclear power plants. We introduced solutions for current challenges in nuclear
technology at lectures.
Safe disposal of radioactive waste
Radioactive waste is generated by the use and decommissioning of our nuclear power plants. We
distinguish between radioactive waste with negligible heat generation (low and intermediate level
waste) and heat-generating, highly active waste.
Waste with negligible heat generation makes up the greater part of the radioactive waste in terms of
mass and volume, but contains less than one percent of the total radioactivity of a nuclear power
plant. It results from both the operation and the decommissioning of the facility. A distinction is made

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

73

Environmental protection
Decommissioning of nuclear power stations
and storage of radioactive waste
between liquid (e.g., resins, concentrates, sludges) and solid waste (e.g., metals, rubble, filters and
clothing). In contrast, heat-generating, high-level waste contains more than 99 percent of the total
activity of a nuclear plant. It consists mainly of the fission products of uranium in the fuel elements that
arise in the nuclear fission in the nuclear reactor.
Our goal: minimising waste
Residue processing ensures a reduction in volume of radioactive waste to a minimum. At the same
time, that portion of the residue that can be fed back into the recycling loop is increased. We manage
this by avoiding waste and, for example, materials – as far as possible – by not bringing it into the
control area or by avoiding contamination. We also reduce the amounts by the sorting of residue that
isn’t contaminated, or by decontamination. We also test whether material can be reused in another
control area or recovered as residue. When the material is handled and prepared for storage and
disposal, volume-reducing handling steps and procedures for use are applied.
In order to, for example, reduce the volume of radioactive waste with negligible heat generation, liquid
waste is dehydrated and dried. Combustible waste is burned and remaining ash and filter dust is
disposed of as radioactive waste. Also, large volume non-combustible waste is packed using highpressure volume reducing procedures.
Process for disposal and storage of radioactive waste
The storage of waste with negligible heat generation is handled separately from highly-active waste in
interim storage specially constructed for this purpose. The first type of waste is conditioned for
permanent storage and packed before being placed in interim storage. In Germany, there are
multiregional storage areas (Gorleben and Ahaus storage areas), the Mitterteich interim facility for
Bavarian plants, and local interim facilities at several nuclear plant sites (such as the sites of the
Stade, Würgassen and Unterweser power plants).
The Konrad radioactive waste repository for radioactive waste with no heat generation is currently
under construction and shall not be operational before 2022, according the authorities responsible for
the construction and operation of this repository, the Federal Office for Radiation Protection.
With the entry in force of the ban on delivery of irradiated fuel for processing (sect. 9a, para. 1 of the
Atomic Energy Act), starting 1 July 2005 spent fuel is stored in previously constructed site interim
storage facilities at its respective power plant site. The fuel will remain there until a final repository for
highly radioactive waste is made available in Germany. It is as of yet impossible to reliably estimate
when this will be the case. The responsibility for this lies with the federal government.

Moderately nuclear waste (metric tons)

There was a sharp decrease in the quantity of low and moderately radioactive waste in 2015: in
comparison with the previous year, 2,187 less metric tons of low and moderately radioactive waste
accumulated; this corresponds to a drop of 66.3 percent. 301 metric tons of moderately radioactive

Environmental protection
Decommissioning of nuclear power stations
and storage of radioactive waste
waste – some 40.5 percent – occurred during the decommissioning of our facilities (project-based
business) and not in the operation of the nuclear power plants. The sharp decrease noted in
comparison with the previous year is primarily due to the complete decommissioning of the
Würgassen nuclear power plant, which was already completed in 2014. So no further waste
accumulated in 2015. Presumably, this value will increase again in the coming years due to the
upcoming decommissioning projects.
The increase of highly radioactive waste by 106 metric tons to 264.2 metric tons is primarily due to the
decision made in 2015 to take the Swedish Oskarshamn 2 reactor permanently out of operation and
not restart it. Consequently, all fuel elements of the reactor have been designated as highly
radioactive waste.

Water management
W ater m anag em ent

Responsibility for a valuable resource
Water is an important resource for E.ON: We use it in our power plants as cooling water, process
water for steam production, and in flue-gas scrubbers. Hence, it stands to reason for us to observe the
legal and environmental framework for the withdrawal and discharge of water. We are developing
various measures to ensure high water quality to counter risks like flooding and reduce fresh water
consumption by our business. We began developing and introducing systematic water management in
2013. We introduced measures and minimum standards in this regard by 2015 that meet the
requirements of the “UN CEO Water Mandate” (UN WM). Based on this, we were accepted as a
member of the UN WM in 2015.
Elements of our comprehensive water management
We formed our own core team in 2014 to satisfy the UN WM. It consists of experts in health, safety
and the environment (HSE) and employees in each area in which water represents an important
resource. This includes, among others, E.ON International Energy (EIE) and Wasserkraft as well as
E.ON UK. The team analysed in which sectors our water management still had to be improved, and
introduced the necessary measures. On 23 December 2015, the process was successfully completed
and membership in the UN WM was officially confirmed by the UN.
Hence, E.ON belongs to the limited number of 145 companies worldwide that are members of UN
WM. Only five companies in Germany – and no other power companies – publicly recognize and are
committed to anchor the following six key elements of the UN WM to their water management:
1. Operations
We want to use water sustainably and efficiently in our operations. This includes reducing our
consumption of fresh water and ensuring high quality water at our facilities. E.ON is
constantly working on new technologies such as filtration processes that reduce emissions
into water to a minimum. In addition, we analyse site specific water risks and take measures
accordingly. We raise the awareness of our employees for the sustainable use of water, for
example via the intranet.
2. Supply chain and protection of watersheds
Our suppliers are also careful in handling water resources. As part of our group-wide
“Principles of Responsible Procurement”, we require our suppliers to ensure responsible use
of the environment. So when qualifying new suppliers in the non-fuels area we ask whether
the supplier monitors its consumption of fresh water.
3. Shared commitment
As a member of the UN CEO Water Mandate, we share our expertise with others and
participate in cross-industry water-related projects. Thus, E.ON is involved as a partner of the
International Hydropower Association (IHA).The IHA has developed the Hydropower
Sustainability Assessment Protocol (HSAP) together with the World Bank and nongovernmental organisations. With this protocol, hydroelectric projects can be assessed in
detail based on various sustainability criteria. It shall become a worldwide standard for

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

77

Environmental protection
Water management
sustainability performance of hydroelectric plants and projects in the future. As one of the first
companies, we have had two of our hydroelectric facilities analysed based on HSAP – most
recently at the Semla site in Sweden.
4. Political frameworks
We want to work with partners that identify with water issues in the political agenda. Our units
work for this in their respective countries. For example, in Germany E.ON Wasserkraft
together with Rhein-Main-Donau AG invited residents of Main and representatives of counties
and authorities to an energy policy dialogue at a communal forum in Lower Franconia. An
exchange of opinions like this is important in our view, so as to develop mutual understanding
for the various interests and enable synergies between the use of water power and water
ecology goals.
5. Social Commitment
We promote the sustainable use of water with relevant campaigns and dialogue with local
communities. Through the E.ON Start-up Hydropower Evolutions (HE), we have specialised
in bringing our expertise in sustainable hydro power projects to emerging markets. HE was
able to win a tender with the international development bank International Finance
Corporation (IFC) for the evaluation of hydro power projects in Indonesia.
6. Transparency towards our stakeholders
Our reports regarding our measures and services related to water management are
transparent. We have published comprehensive information on our water use ever since 2011,
as part of the CDP Water Disclosure program. On behalf of investors, this program surveys
major corporations on their water risks. Detailed water data by E.ON can be found in our
response. We also intend to make our water management system more transparent by
involving ratings and rankings, and further raising our stakeholders' awareness of our
performance in this area. For the results from 2015 see our external recognition page.
We have also anchored these six key elements in our “E.ON’s Water Management Corporate Policy”,
issued in 2014.
Measurement methods to determine water availability
Together with other major energy companies, from the beginning E.ON has participated in the
development of Global Water Tools (GWT), which was initiated in 2011 by the World Business Council
for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). E.ON has been using the GWT since 2012 to evaluate how
water availability will develop for all relevant production plants by 2025. The relevant production plants
are our conventional production plants – coal, gas, nuclear and hydroelectric – that account for most
of our water usage. We did not include renewables generation as it only accounts for an extremely
small percentage – less than one percent – of our water consumption.

Out of the total of 212 facilities that we evaluated in our analysis, about 20 percent are located in
areas with scarce water resources. According to the systematic applied by the World Resources
3

Institute (WRI), regions with scarce water resources are those in which less than 1000 m of water
3

from renewable fresh water reserves is available per person per year; those in which 1700 m are
available are considered sufficient. With the aim of raising awareness of water risks, we shared our
findings with the Operational Excellence teams at our generating units.
Total water withdrawal and discharges 2015
We have continually improved our water indicators in recent years. We have combined our water data
in a general water balance sheet since 2013. This provides an overview, by country, of the amount of
fresh water and seawater we withdrew and discharged.

water – 3,792 million m or about 94 percent – was drawn from rivers. 3,691 million m , or 97.3

percent, of that was discharged into rivers. 216 million m of the extracted fresh water came from
3

lakes. Out of this amount, 95 million m or 43.8 percent was discharged into lakes.
3

And the volume of sea water withdrawn also fell by 425 million m , or 7.4 percent, in 2015. During the
3

same period we discharged 437 million m , equal to 7.5 percent, less salt water than in 2014.

(Total: 9,378m )

The figures for our water withdrawal by source supplement the figures for our fresh water and
seawater consumption as well as those for our withdrawal of non-fresh surface water and waste water.
3

Total water withdrawal was 9,387 million m in 2015. Compared with 2014, the amount dropped by
3

1,109 million m , or 10.6 percent.
The drop in fresh and sea water usage, as well as total water withdrawal, can be attributed primarily to
the lower electricity production from coal-fired and nuclear power plants. Among other things, this was
due to power plant shutdowns such as the coal-fired plant at Veltheim in Germany, and the sale of the
entire generating fleet in Italy in the middle of the year.

Sulphur dioxide emissions
The combustion of sulphurous coal is the primary source of SO 2 emissions. Two ways we can reduce
our SO2 emissions are by improving desulfurization equipment and by increasing the proportion of
natural gas in our energy mix.

(Indicator calculation excluding discontinued operations in Spain)

At 27.9 kt, the total discharged quantity of SO2 in 2015 was 13.6 kt, or 33 percent lower than for the
previous year. This drop is primarily due to lower power generation by coal-fired plants resulting from
closures and sales, conversion of coal-fired plants and a total of 12 percent less energy production by
E.ON.
Specific SO2-Emissions by energy unit dropped from 0.19 kg/MWh in 2014 to 0.15 kg/MWh in 2015.
Nitrogen oxide emissions
Nitrogen oxide (NOx) is mainly generated from the combustion of nitrogen contained in the air at high
temperatures. For example, the combustion of gas or coal in our power plants is connected with NO x
emissions. This gives us a special responsibility to achieve further reductions in NO x emissions.
Our new power plants, and several of those that joined our portfolio in 2009, are fitted with advanced

NOx emissions dropped in 2015 from 94.1 kt in the previous year to 74.3 kt. This represents a
decrease of 19.9 percent. This development can be primarily attributed to lower overall power
generation, and in particular to the drop in power generation from fossil fuels like coal and natural gas.
Also, in 2015 we completed the sale of our generation operations in Spain. Hence, emissions from the
generation fleet in Spain are no longer included in reporting for 2015.
Specific NOx emissions dropped to 0.39 kg/KWh in 2015; they were still at 0.44 kg/KWh in the
previous year.

Our particulate emissions declined by around 0.7 kilotons, or 21 percent, year on year. This figure can
also be attributed to lower overall power generation and particularly the decline in power production
from coal-fired plants. Also, in 2015 we concluded the sale of our generation operations in Spain.
Hence, emissions from the generation fleet in Spain are no longer included in reporting for 2015.
Mercury emissions
Coal-fired power plants also emit small amounts of mercury. New European legislation sets limits for
the first time on mercury emissions from large coal-fired power plants throughout Europe. Hence, we
are developing the respective technical measures to reduce our mercury emissions.

In 2014, our mercury emissions compared to 2013 declined by 226.4 kilograms or to 485.4 kg,
amounting to a reduction of 31.8 percent. This decline is primarily attributable to the reduction in the
energy we generated and in the amount of coal we burned coupled with an increase in the share of
renewables in our energy mix. Also, in 2015 we concluded the sale of our generation operations in
Spain. Hence, emissions from the generation fleet in Spain are no longer included in reporting for

Waste
Waste is produced by E.ON both in operational and project-related business. When considering the
total amount of waste, we further distinguish between waste for disposal and waste for recovery.
Hazardous waste
The total amount of hazardous waste rose to 63 kt in 2015, and has almost doubled in comparison
with the previous year.
Hazardous waste (in kilotons)

The amount of both disposed and recovered waste clearly increased in 2015 compared with the
previous year: in total, we were able to recover 40 kt of hazardous waste produced. We disposed of
23 kt in accordance with local laws.
The waste that was recycled was produced primarily in operations. The increase over the previous
year can be attributed to, among other things, the fact that hazardous waste from the network
business in Germany was included in the calculation for the first time. Previously – up through 2014 –
the construction of the German grid was the responsibility of service providers, who arranged for the
disposal of hazardous waste for E.ON.
The clear increase in the amount of disposed waste comes from project-related business. More waste
was produced in 2015 than in 2014 due to the shutdown of power plants. The waste temporarily
stored initially at the sites was disposed of in 2015, as required by regulations.

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

85

Environmental protection
Environmental indicators
Non-hazardous waste
The amount of non-hazardous waste increased in 2015 in comparison with 2014, by 356 kt to 529 kt.
Non-hazardous waste (in kilotons)

The amount of disposed and recovered waste was significantly higher in 2015 than in the previous
year. The amount of non-hazardous waste for disposal increased by 276 kt to a total of 308 kt. This
represents an increase of 858 percent. The amount of non-hazardous waste for recovery grew by 80
kt or 57 percent to 221 kt.
The reason for the increase in disposed and recovered non-hazardous waste was primarily the
decommissioning of coal-fired plants like Kingsnorth in the UK and the new construction and
replacement of lines in Germany (both project-based business).
Ash and slag
Ash and slag fall in especially significant quantities in the combustion of coal. The amount of ash and
slag in 2015, including by-products, totalled 3,105.9 kt. They fell by 983 kt or 24 percent compared
with the previous year. It is our goal to recycle as much of this waste as possible.

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

86

Environmental protection
Environmental indicators
Ash and slag (in kilotons)

The amount of ash and slag disposed of in 2015 increased by 253.2 kt to 404.8 kt compared to the
previous year. Unlike in 2014, our gas and coal-fired plants in Russia were running again at full
capacity. This explains the increase in the amount of disposed ash and slag in operations from 2014
to 2015. However, this dropped by 181.6 metric tons compared with 2013.
BauMineral, a wholly owned subsidiary of E.ON, processes the flying ash and its by-products in a way
that a portion of it can be recycled for road construction, for example. Both flying ash and its byproducts saw great market demand in 2015 in Germany. The flying ash stored from previous years in
silos was completely sold. The silos that were empty at that point could be filled with the new flying
ash from 2015. However, the amount stored in the silos in 2015 was not reported as either recovered
ash and slag or as a by-product, and so does not appear in the balance sheet. This explains why the
amount of recovered ash and slag for 2015 declined by 858.1 kt or 70.1 percent. The same applies for
the drop in by-products by 378 kt or 20.4 percent.
Gypsum by-product
We produce great quantities of gypsum as a by-product of flue gas desulphurisation in our coal-fired
plants. It is harmless and can be recycled as building material. Under anti-pollution laws, power plants
are equipped with flue gas cleaning devices that remove environmentally hazardous materials from
flue gases. However, these materials are hardly removed environmentally neutrally. We collaborate
with BauMineral in processing residue from flue gas desulphurisation in our coal-fired plants in
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. For example, BauMineral distributes flying ash, bottom ash
and gypsum. Products such as clinker and ready-mix concrete are produced from the residue.

Gypsum (in kilotons)

The quantity of gypsum accumulated for disposal dropped in 2015 compared to the previous year by
41.1 kt, or 89.2 percent. At the same time, 8.1 kt or 12.6 percent less gypsum was recovered.
Including by-products, the total quantity of accumulated gypsum fell by 644.6 kt; this represents a
decline of 37.7 percent.
The drop in resulting gypsum can be explained by the lower production quantity of electricity and gas,
as well as by the shutdown and sale of power plants. In addition, the Spanish plant fleet produced the
percentually greatest amount of gypsum. This was sold in 2014 and no longer counted in the balance
sheet for 2015.

Enhancing competence - promoting diversity
Human resources management of E.ON is faced with diverse challenges: The increasing shortage of
skilled workers in Europe will in the medium term affect our chances to attract qualified employees.
Already now, there are numerous options available to specialists and executives. Therefore, we are
called upon to create an attractive environment for our employees. For this reason we for instance
invest in extensive training opportunities and offer flexible working models. In order to stay up with the
competition for the best employees in the long term, the digitalisation of personnel processes is
becoming more and more important. It provides numerous possibilities to simplify and optimise the
recruitment of new employees or the talent management.
Workforces nowadays represent a dynamic mix of different cultures, age groups, ethnic groups,
lifestyles and genders. This diversity is reflected in the society, which we, as a company, are part of.
We have to adapt to changed framework conditions of an increasingly diverse market and use the
opportunities arising from it. For this reason we must implement various measures in order to promote
diversity and equal opportunities at E.ON. When doing this, we naturally take into consideration the
statutory requirements and the “Law for equal participation of women and men in executive positions
in the private business and in public services”, which has become effective in Germany in 2015. It
shall contribute to increasing the proportion of women in executive positions and initiating of a culture
change in our company.

Material aspects
In our materiality analysis we have analysed the expectations of our key stakeholders. The following
topics relevant for the area of “workforce challenge" resulted from this:

Further developing of the employees, unfolding the potential
The energy of our employees is E.ON’s most valuable resource. Their expertise, their motivation and
reliability are the prerequisites for opening new growth areas in the future as well as existing in an
established core business at the same time. Our objective is to always appoint the right person to the
right position in the Group with the aid of a target-oriented talent management and to make the
employees qualified for new positions. We want to create the conditions they need in order to fulfil
their potential in the best way possible. When doing this, we increasingly rely on digital solutions: They
help us in finding new employees, in making talents and ideas more visible in our company and
supporting our employees in a most optimal way. With the aid of a successful talent management we
aim to position E.ON as an attractive employer on the market for skilled employees and thus to
develop new talent sources.
Support diversity and equal opportunities
Diversity and equal opportunities represent the main prerequisites for innovation and are essential for
E.ON’s success on a market that is characterised by many changes. The most recent studies show
that the company achieves higher yields than the industry average thanks to a diverse workforce. We
would also like to profit from diverse views, cultures, nationalities, genders and experiences in the
future as well. In this process, supporting the diversity and equal opportunities remains a most
important objective of our HR work.

Management and measures
The following topics are addressed by E.ON in the strategic HR work as an answer to various
challenges in the HR sector:
Systematically promote the talents
Our Group-wide talent management offers our specialists and executives-to-be attractive perspectives
in the Group and makes it possible for us to identify the potential of our employees early enough and
further develop them in a target-oriented manner. With the aid of various development programmes for
talents and the “E.ON” Graduate Programme” we can meet our staffing needs well into the future.
Engineers, experts for finance and acquisition are prepared in our “High Potential Programme” to
acquisition of international management positions in a target-oriented manner. The “Talent
Development Programme” on the other hand, supports talents across all business segments. In the
talent management, we increasingly rely on digital solutions: The most recent examples hereof are the
introduction of our “Talent Management Suite (TMS)” and “Executive and Talent Portal 2015”. We
measure our success by the fact whether we succeeded with primarily occupying positions with our
own talents and also achieving an increasing diversity in our company. In order to keep a view of the
potential of our talents in different units, we use so-called talent scorecards. Among other things, these
cards document the results of the annual, Group-wide “Management Review Process”, in which we
assess our executive officers and identify talents.
Educating and further developing of employees
Educating and further developing of our employees is a cornerstone of our personnel management.
We are particularly proud of our “E.ON Graduate Program”, in which we train our junior staff in an
intense and diverse 24-month programme. During this programme, our employees go through three to

six stations in various business units and departments and are thus able to familiarise themselves with
E.ON from various perspectives.
During this educating and further developing process, we want to support our employees in gaining
new momentum. This can be done through e.g. temporary assignments abroad. This is supported by
the guideline “International Transfer Policy”. In 2015, 107 of our employees used the opportunity of
collecting new experiences abroad. On average, the duration of their residence abroad amounts to
between two and three years.
Directly addressing the potential applicants
We continuously invest with the objective of positioning E.ON as an attractive employer: In this way
we want to create conditions of winning qualified and motivated employees and establish a permanent
relationship between them and us. Our recruiting is international and target-oriented so that we can
find the people who are perfectly suitable for us and fulfil all our requirements. We are also looking for
suitable candidates in social networks: This offers us the possibility of establishing direct contact with
them. An example thereof is our career channel on Facebook, existing since January 2014. Here we
offer many employees an insight into their activities and present exciting projects.
Promoting equal chances for both genders
We open up targeted career opportunities for women in our Group. This is regulated by the Placement
Policy implemented across the entire Group in 2011. Furthermore, we also rely upon various
mentoring programmes: Within the frame of the female mentoring programme, an experienced
manager is assigned to every participant, who advises, coaches and supports the candidate with
respect to her career - in addition to an executive officer. Female junior employees are in this way
prepared to assume executive positions in a target-oriented manner. Even our offers for better
reconciliation of professional and private life (Life Balance) - e.g. in a form of a flexible working model,
home-office or places in kindergarten - contribute to offering all our employees equal chances of
making a successful career.
A balanced gender distribution plays an important role for us even in the education of our future
specialists. Among other things, we want to employ as many female graduates as possible for our
“E.ON Graduate Programme” (EGP). In order to achieve this goal, we are committed to convincing
women to select a profession which is related to science and technology as early as possible. In this
process we cooperate with external partners such as the German Federal Ministry of Education and
Research. The Ministry has established a Germany-wide initiative with “Come, join us”, the goal of
which is employing more women in technical professions. E.ON has been a partner to this initiative
ever since 2011. Furthermore, we also cooperate with the Career Centre Femtec with respect to this
topic.
The success of our measures is obvious from an increasing number of women both among the
trainees selected in the EGP and among the new employees in the Group in year 2015. It amounted
to some 41 percent in year 2015. In year 2014 it amounted to only 38 percent. In total, we were able to
employ 10 percent more women in year 2015 than in year 2014.

Establishing barrier liberty in daily work routine
About 80 million people in Europe have a visible or less visible disability. The topic “Inclusion” - which
refers to promoting equality for disabled people in Germany - becomes increasingly important in our
company, and naturally, throughout the E.ON Group. We want to make our employees and managers
aware of differences and establish framework conditions for creating a daily work routine without any
barriers for all employees. Examples of these measures are a workshop for interaction with deaf
colleagues or “talking elevators” for blind employees. Contact persons for all questions posed by
people with disabilities are our representatives for severely disabled persons in the individual business
units on site.
All employees of E.ON must be treated with dignity, respect and appreciation. For these reasons, we
have just revised our integration agreement. A topic within this process is also the barrier liberty of our
IT.
Furthermore, there are numerous Group-internal networks for e.g. employees with migration
background, on the topic of religion or sexual orientation. Examples hereof are: BAM (Black Asian
Minority, LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Network etc.).
“Transforming HR” supports new strategy
Within the scope of implementation of our efficiency enhancement programme “E.ON 2.0”, we have
realigned our personnel organisation in 2015 to a thorough transformation process (”Transforming
HR”). We have brought together our personnel functions in a centralised manner into five centres of
competence. Each of which represents core areas of human organisation such as talent management
or HR controlling and control Group-wide core processes and tools, which are used as part of
operational HR work. Among other things, this includes the following: Recruitment process and
Performance Management process.
The reorganisation of the Group, in which the present-day business will continue in two sustainable
enterprises, is effectively supported by our HR organisation. E.ON management and employee
representatives agreed on a Joint Statement and Framework Agreement for implementing our new
strategy. In it, E.ON makes the following commitments:


no employee reductions in conjunction with the spinoff



collective agreements to remain unchanged



pensions will be unaffected



ongoing professional development and training



ongoing consultation and coordination during the transition, both at a European and national
level.

Targets & Performance Review
We have set ourselves the goal of detecting new talents more quickly and supporting them more
efficiently in the future with the aid of digital talent management tools and communication media.
Furthermore, we want to give our employees the opportunity of assuming managerial responsibility for
most various topics in a timely manner.

Tasks of the further development
The expenditure for training in the E.ON Group in 2015 amounted to EUR 1,017 per employee1,
measured in the average total workforce. With reference to the full-time equivalent, this is equivalent
to EUR 1,052, which is 8 Euros more than in the previous year. The average number of training days
of classroom training was in 2015 approximately 1.4 days per employee, also based on the average
total workforce2.
Implementation of woman’s quota in Germany
E.ON SE and other E.ON companies in Germany, such as, e.g. Hansewerk, E.ON Technologies, EGC
and ReVus, are subject to “Law for equal participation of women and men in executive positions in
private companies and in public services” which has come into effect on 1 May 2015 in Germany.
Every company has its own goals and deadlines to increase the percentage of women in executive
positions. Furthermore, the law gives specifications for the publication of the results.
Appointing of women to 15.8% of executive positions throughout the Group was our goal for 2015.
The proportion of female executives in management should amount to 14 percent in Germany by the
end of 2016. Our progress with respect to the increase of the woman’s quota at E.ON is described in
Section “Diversity and equal opportunities”. The exact structure of our Supervisory Board can be found
in our most recent annual report on pages 216 and 217.

In year 2015, the calculation basis of the full-time equivalent was converted into the number of employees of the average
total workforce. This conversion has been implemented due to the fact that the reporting in the area of further training was
made on employees’ basis - in this way for instance, the participants are paid and not the full-time equivalent resulting from
this.

Russia, France and nuclear societies are not taken into consideration. This value only applies to internal and external
seminars included in the central Learning Management System, where the processing duration of online-based learning

Promoting talent, enhancing development
With the aid of an efficient personnel management, we want to find suitable employees and talent for
our company, to win them over for us and continuously develop their skills. With the aid of various
measures we ensure that qualified employees are at our disposal in the long term.

Education at E.ON
Vocational training of young people is of great importance for us. In 2015, 331 young people began
their apprenticeships at German E.ON locations (previous year: 342), and 385 of a total of 441
graduates were taken on in subsequent employment. A German vocational training model is not
offered in this form in other countries. However, we also offer similar career-building programmes in
other European countries as well, such as, for instance, Great Britain.
The changes in the energy sector should in future be reflected already in training. Therefore, the
content of the training, for instance, is increasingly focused on industrial and technical professions and
more than ever, on renewable energies and thus on our new strategies. In 2016, we will offer for the
first time a commercial training station abroad as well, with the aid of our “E.ON abroad” programme.
In addition, as part of tariff negotiations with the unions we agreed that all graduates completing
training in 2015 would be taken on for at least 12 months fixed-term, and at least 120 graduates in
permanent jobs. With a total of 179 permanent acquisitions, we could even exceed this figure in the
reporting year. A large number of permanent acquisitions should be pronounced in the year 2016.
Furthermore, we have been contributing to a German-wide training agreement with the aid of the
E.ON Education Initiative ever since 2003. In 2015, we supported some 550 young people during the
process of transition from school into their professional life. This has been carried out e.g. in the form
of school projects, education preparatory courses and internships with partners. Our programme for
refugees is also included therein.
E.ON Graduate Program for college graduates
E.ON Graduate Program (EGP) plays an important role for us during training and development of
high-qualified college graduates. The trainees work in different business areas and functions for
several months each, from engineering to IT, finance, distribution and corporate development and HR,
and attend various seminaries. In this way they can familiarise with various business units in Germany
and abroad.
In 2015, 80 promising talents started the graduate programme- coming, among others, from Great
Britain, Germany, India, Turkey, Indonesia and Czech Republic. Although the portion of female
students amounts to only 10 to 20 percent in many technical studies, we were able to realise a
women’s share of 41 percent in year 2015.

Identify talent and develop it systematically
Support and further development of our employees is a central task of executive officers at E.ON. An
important basis for this is E.ON’s new advanced training course which integrates formal learning

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

95

Workforce challenge
Employee development
processes more thoroughly in the work routine. Furthermore, we support the executive staff when
performing this task with the aid of a systematic talent management.
New competence model “grow@E.ON”
The changes on the energy market represent new challenges for our personnel management as well.
In order to reach our goals and be successful in the future as well, we define inter-divisional and
transnational competences for executives and employees and comprise them into a global
competence model. The new model that carries the working title “grow@E.ON” should ensure
transparency of expectations we define for our employees and executives, and provide help to their
personal development. Topics such as customer orientation and responsibility are still the main focus
thereof.
“grow@E.ON” also represents a basis for selection and development processes of our employees and
for our programme for talent promotion. We want to provide experiential value for our managers and
employees and ensure the highest quality standards. That is why we adapt appropriate instruments,
such as the competency-based development talks or the follow-up formats for internal and external
assessment centres. The first pilot projects for staffing and staff development with the new title
“grow@E.ON” are currently launched in various units and countries such as Germany, UK and
Sweden. The findings from the pilot projects will then be integrated in the final model, which will be
rolled out during the year 2016.
New training approach integrates learning processes into everyday work
The integration of learning processes into the daily work routine is still a fundamental principle of our
activities in the training. The increasing digitalisation of the learning has a major influence on this
development.
The so-called 70/20/10 model was the focus thereof in year 2015. According thereto, only about 10
percent of the knowledge about formal learning processes - such as for instance, during structured
training - are learnt. The remaining 90 percent, the so-called “informal learning”, accounts for
interaction with others (20 percent) and collection of experiences (70 percent). Through a wide range
of part-time programs, courses, workshops and self-study materials and with the aid of raising
awareness of opportunities for informal learning, we promote a self-reliant learning culture. Executives
and employees should be able to organise their training themselves in terms of content, duration,
location, pace and method.
Supporting processes of change through CoC Global Learning
In 2015, we, among other things, placed a particular focus on supporting our employees and
executives in better identification, understanding and management of human aspects of processes of
change. Various offers were developed for this purpose, which facilitate an independent learning
process. Intranet-based Change Cube, which best summarises the self-help tools already available in
the E.ON Group for the change management is a part thereof. The tools are tested, up-to-date, easy
to use and placed at the disposal of all executives, superiors and employees. The introduction of the
Change Cube was accompanied by the so-called “Change Unplugged” short-term events. In the form
of a marketplace, the participants were informed about methods, tools and offers about how one can
master change processes himself while assisting employees and their team. In addition, the format

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

Workforce challenge
Employee development
offered the opportunity to get together with other executives and HR colleagues and exchange
experiences.
New system for the talent management
In order to optimise our personnel processes and our talent management, we implement new systems
and programmes on a regular basis. The most recent example hereof is the talent management suite
(TMS) introduced in 2015. This integrated software solution facilitates various HR processes which
relate to attracting and professional development of talents. They are: employee recruitment, talent
nomination, annual assessment of our managers, including variable compensation, succession
planning and staffing management positions. This new solution improves the data quality and provides
an overview for the employees of the data which have been stored at our company.
Executive and talent portal provides a transparent overview
The executive and talent portal supports our executive officers and talents during their professional
development. The portal represents an information platform for E.ON executive officers and talents,
but also for all our HR colleagues who are responsible for these target groups. It offers a transparent
overview of all relevant HR services: For example, a learning curriculum with special seminars and
trainings, information about the new global staffing process and a calculation tool for the
compensation. In close cooperation with the product and process experts from the education and
further training departments, the Business Services Centre (BSC) works in Berlin continually to update
and improve the content. The portal has been online since November 2014 and recorded steadily
increasing numbers of users.
New process for global staffing of executive positions
In 2015, we successfully filled top management positions over 29 percent across business units and
over 9 percent across countries. In 2015, we introduced a revised, Group-wide process of staffing
executive positions in order to optimise the allocation of executive positions even further. The key
element of the process is a placement conference, where representatives of different areas of the
company at least every other week discuss the free leadership and possible candidates. The
transparency of the decision-making process is increased thereby. Furthermore, the equal opportunity
is promoted in the list. The final decision as which applicant will be appointed at the selected position
is a task of the respective executive officer.

Diversity and equal opportunities
Diversit y and equ al opportun ities

Diversity and equal opportunities
Studies have shown that teams with very different members are particularly innovative and can find
new solutions more easily. We want to use this potential to the advantage of E.ON. For this reason we
welcome and expressly promote the diversity of our staff - in all dimensions. We want to make sure
that differences are appreciated in our company: All employees should have equal chances of
development and success at E.ON, irrespective of their background or gender.
Putting diversity policy into practice also means taking legal provisions, standards and the
recommendations of international initiatives into account. We support programmes which are
implemented to promote more diversity and equal opportunities at work. For many years we are
signatories of the “Charter of Diversity” and, since 2015, for example, also a member of Catalyst, the
leading non-profit organisation for the improvement of opportunities for women in business.
Promotion of gender equality
We are convinced that we can benefit of well-balanced teams in many ways. Therefore, we aim at a
higher rate of women in the management and supervisory bodies. At the corporate level and in
Germany we were able to make further progress in 2015 in this respect. Thus, E.ON Group increased
its share of women in executive positions to 16.7% in year 2015. The Group-wide annual target of
15.8% was exceeded thereby. The proportion of female executives in management should amount to
14 percent in Germany by the end of 2016. With a share of women in the amount of 14%, we have
already achieved this goal at the end of 2015.

On 1 May 2015, the “Law for equal participation of women and men in executive positions in the
private business and in public services” has become effective in Germany. It should contribute to the
significant increase of the proportion of women in executive positions and initiating of a culture change
in our company. Even the E.ON SE is subject to this law and undertakes in this respect to achieve the
specific goals: First of all, we will take into consideration the statutory women’s quota of 30 percent applicable as from 1 January 2016 - for the Supervisory Board of E.ON SE when appointing people
thereto in the future. We aim at a women’s quota of 23 and 17 percent for the first and second
managerial level. The respective actual value is currently 20 and 15 percent. These goals for the first
and second managerial level should be achieved by 30 June 2017 at the latest.
Against the backdrop of the fundamental structural measures implemented in the company, the
Supervisory Board approved a short-term target proportion of women of 0 percent for the

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

Workforce challenge
Diversity and equal opportunities
Management Board with an implementation deadline until 31 December 2016. The current status is
thus held for the time being. However, the Supervisory Board intends to adopt a resolution by the end
of 2016, according to which at least one position in the Management Board will be occupied by a
woman.
Promoting careers of women: E.ON new member of Catalyst
We are a new member of the non-profit organisation Catalyst since 2015: We are part of a global
community, the aim of which is to improve the framework conditions for women in business. With our
membership, we have access to tools, events and services pertaining predominantly to genderspecific issues. The membership will help us to further develop the theme of diversity at E.ON can and
remove possible obstacles.
“Female Mentoring Programme” for female junior staff
In March 2015, E.ON Germany launched a new Female mentoring programme with 20 participants
from different business units. The aim of the 18-month mentoring programme is to specifically prepare
young female talents to take on executive positions. Each talent has an experienced top executive as
a mentor on her side. The mentors should guide the career of female talents, in addition to their
respective leadership, as advisors, coaches and support. In personal meetings for example, valuable
career advice can be exchanged, personal development measures discussed and last, but not the
least, possible next career steps planned.
More chances for foreign professionals in Sweden
It is currently difficult for many companies in Sweden to find competent and qualified personnel. At the
same time, academics with foreign university degrees and work experience in foreign countries have
little chance of finding a job in Sweden: On average, a foreign academic needs five to eight years to
gain a foothold on the Swedish labour market. Therefore, E.ON Sweden has launched an initiative
“Finally a Job” (Äntligen Jobb). Äntligen Jobb gives unemployed academics who are not born in
Sweden, internships. E.ON Sweden would like to meet the shortage with the aid of this internship
initiative. The internship takes eight weeks and can be extended to six months at the most. In 2015,
within the framework of this initiative, we have provided jobs for 38 trainees, and 10 of them have
become permanently employed with E.ON.

other DAX 30 companies. The age structure of E.ON employees reflects the demographic
development of the labour force potential: In year 2015, approximately 17 percent were less than 30
years old, 55 percent were between 31 and 50 years old and some 28 percent were older than 50.
E.ON is well prepared for the demographic change and has already taken steps to address the
demographic changes such as in the area of health care, recruitment, promotion and training.

The absolute number of trainees and training quota has been reduced as opposed to the previous
year. Declining recruitment figures resulting from production and the transfer of training from fully
consolidated into non-consolidated companies are responsible for this. With a very high acceptance
rate (385 of 441 = 87%) of skilled trainees, E.ON counteracts the shortage.

In 2015, German E.ON companies employed 1,269 severely disabled persons or persons with a
similar disability. The absolute and relative number of severely disabled persons have been reduced
as opposed to the previous year 2014. However, due to the fact that the average number of
employees has also been reduced, the number of severely disabled employees decreased only
slightly, from 6.2 to 5.8 percent.

In total, 4,904 people at the year’s end were employed on a part-time basis in the E.ON Group, thereof
3,252 women (66 percent). The number of employees on a part-time basis has increased as opposed
to the previous year (2014: part-time employees 4,413, thereof women 3,202), as well as the
percentage (from 7% to 8%). The reason for the heavy increase of the number of part-time employees
in the segment of production is a collective agreement on working hour reduction to 97% as opposed
to full-time employees, for prevention of personnel reduction in the Power Plant Group West.

GRI aspect in the action
area
 Occupational health and
safety
 Materiality process

High standards for health and safety
None of our business activities should present a risk to people’s health and safety. E.ON builds and
operates conventional as well as renewable power generation facilities, distributes electricity via lines,
and transports and stores natural gas – all activities that require extensive safety precautions. For that
reason, effectively and strategically aligned HSE (health, safety and environment) management is our
top priority.
Nevertheless, accidents do occur, for example when performing maintenance on gas and electric
lines. Accordingly, our mission is to further incorporate our standardised safety standards in all
regional units and among our partner companies, and to ensure that every incident is consistently
reported. In addition, we are facing the challenge of maintaining the long-term health and performance
level of a continually ageing work force while also taking into account continuous change and
increasing requirements placed on our employees’ flexibility.

Material aspects
In our materiality analysis, we took a close look at the core expectations of our stakeholders. From this
emerged the following key topics pertaining to the area of “Health and safety”:
Ensuring occupational safety
One million work-related accidents occur annually in Germany alone. For those affected, these
accidents are often associated with a high degree of personal pain and sometimes permanently
impaired health. However, accidents also have far-reaching consequences for our business
processes. For this reason, minimum safety standards are a top priority in our industry. They are a
prerequisite for granting operating permits and in many business relationships, they are crucial when it
comes to signing a contract. Besides a possible loss in reputation, accidents often result in costs due
to property damage or downtimes. In addition, they entail tedious investigations or result in high
insurance premiums. Employee absences and accident-related damage to facilities and equipment

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

106

Health & safety

can also considerably delay the construction and operation of our plants, or even bring them to a
standstill.
Maintaining and promoting health
For E.ON, the health of its employees is a valuable asset. A health-promoting work environment
enables our employees to work and be efficient over the long term, and to further increase their
potential. Sound health management also contributes to our reputation and our appeal as an
employer. For that reason, our health programme takes into account physical as well as mental stress
that may result from changes in a work environment, due to restructuring for example, or from conflicts
at the workplace.

Management and measures
According to our principle of “Zero tolerance for accidents,” we are following a preventive HSE
management approach. By means of regularly compiled key performance indicators, we continue to
enhance forward-looking, preventive concepts for accident prevention and health promotion. In
addition, we rely on centralised processes to manage HSE activities and to support management units
at the Group management level. A detailed description of the organisational structure, including the
various committees and their interactions, is provided in the “Management” section.
Creating the framework using binding, Group-wide guidelines
Clear, standardised principles are a key factor for success in HSE management and we ensure they
are implemented by means of Group-wide guidelines. The Group policy “HSE Management” that went
into effect in 2013 and the subsequent business directives define minimum requirements as well as
reporting channels; they also describe suitable measures to prevent physical and mental problems in
carrying out day-to-day work. Integrated in this policy is our “Policy statement on health, safety, and
the environment" that conveys our aspiration to proactively improve our employees’ health and to
prevent safety hazards. In the course of implementing the Group policy, we will institute in all E.ON
1)

units an externally certified occupational health and safety protection management system according
to the international OHSAS 18001 standard.
Since 2009, we have publicly strengthened our commitment to maintaining high safety and health
management standards by signing the “Luxembourg Declaration on Workplace Health Promotion in
the European Union” as well as the “Düsseldorf Statement” of the Seoul Declaration on Health and
Safety at Work.
Proactive measures for process optimisation
Another control tool that we use to continually improve occupational safety at E.ON pertains to our
HSE Improvement Plans (HSE IP), which we introduced in 2010. They contain concrete targets set for
one year and for every management unit – from the global to regional levels as well as the supporting
functions. Their implementation status is reviewed on a regular basis. In fact, we began integrating
accident-related guidelines and targets pertaining to health promotion starting in 2013.

processes." (“HSE Management” Business Governance Group Guideline; p. 7)

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

107

Health & safety

The implementation of the individual HSE IP targets and the Total Recordable Injury Frequency Index
(TRIF) has served as a basis for calculating the variable compensation of managers since 2014. Also
taken into account are the results of HSE audits and any fatal work accidents. Since HSE is directly
represented at the Board level at E.ON, the status of HSE objectives also has an impact on the annual
bonuses given to CEOs of our global and regional units.
Our golden rule for ensuring safe conduct
By means of the Group-wide “Safety F1RST!” campaign, we established three core rules of conduct
for employees at all responsibility levels:


Rule No.1: We take care of our colleagues
Everybody working for or with E.ON speaks up about safety and health, and keeps the work
environment safe and healthy.



Rule No.2: We stop unsafe work
Everybody working for or with E.ON intervenes in unsafe or unhealthy situations.



Rule No.3: We learn from near hits and mistakes
Everbody working for or with E.ON reports all dangerous situations, dangerous actions, near
misses, and accidents. We're prepared to learn and do things better.

These rules have become firmly embedded in the Group in the meantime. Easily comprehensible
cartoons and videos as well as the high-visibility “Safety F1RST” logo help us to remind our
employees of these on a regular basis.
Our HSE courses and training
Knowledge is a key component when it comes to the safety and health of our workers. For that
reason, we enable our employees to participate in numerous HSE training sessions and course
programs. These have been offered since 2014 by the Centre of Competence for Global Learning in a
Group-wide, standardised continuing education catalogue and organised by the Business Service
Centre for Global Learning in Berlin.
Better HSE results through systematic evaluations
In 2015, E.ON implemented the “Incident Management” business directive. It sets minimum
requirements for reporting incidents and their subsequent investigations; it also ensures that
knowledge gained from these are passed on in a standardised process. This not only helps us to
quickly institute risk reduction measures, but to also develop long-term approaches, identify priority
measures, and thereby improve our HSE performance.
By means of our “Prevent!" event management system instituted in 2013, we record high-risk events
and accidents involving employees of E.ON and partner companies, and forward these to the
responsible departments. Serious accidents are reported within 24 and 72 hours respectively,
depending on the type of incident, via the system to Group management. We analyse the accidents
and thereupon institute targeted prevention measures. The system is currently being used in our
regional units in Italy, Sweden, Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Great Britain, as well as
in our global units, namely Generation, Technologies, E.ON Business Services and E.ON Connecting
Energies.

Health & safety

Standards in our supply chain
The topic of contractor management also holds a key role in our HSE management. Our E.ON mission
statement pertaining to health, safety and the environment and the “HSE Management” Group policy
specifically include our contractors. In addition, we revised the “Procurement” Group policy in 2015
and thereby elaborated our processes pertaining to the identification of HSE risks. In this way, we
ensure that prior to making a purchase, we check whether there are any HSE risks associated with a
service and what they are (i.e., a product, whose purchase is tied to a service, such as setting up a
generator). Depending on the identified risk, a new supplier must go through a qualification process
and identified shortcomings must be corrected.
We also support our partner companies by giving them an opportunity to participate in courses or
training, or we require them – depending on their respective activity – to pass certain classes. Our
management units have also developed country-specific concepts and set up their own training
centres where they train their partners.

Targets & Performance Review
We want to continually improve our performance in the area of health and safety. Therefore our 20122015 sustainability work programme set clear, quantifiable targets; once achieved, we review them
using standardised performance indicators.
Progress and improvement potential concerning safety
Among others, we set the target to decrease the total number of all recorded accidents (Total
Recordable Injury Frequency Index –TRIF) involving E.ON employees and contractors to 3.0 per 1
million work hours. We clearly exceeded this target with a figure of 2.1. We were also able to
significantly decrease the number of accident-related lost work hours (Lost Time Injury Frequency
Index – LTIF) over the last few years and also exceeded our specified objective – a figure of 3.0 –
here, too. In 2015 the LTIF for our contractors was 1.7 per one million work hours. Unfortunately, we
missed our LTIF objective for E.ON employees. We did make continual progress here over the last
years; yet with 1.6 points, our internal LTIF was above the target of 1.0 set in the work program.
Health objective reached
In the area of health protection, we had set a centralised, measurable objective. By 2015, we wanted
50 percent of our employees working in high-risk areas of activity to participate in health-related
measures. Since 2014, all E.ON units are urged to conduct an HSE Day. On this occasion, they
present locally relevant topics on nutrition, exercise, addiction prevention, and mental health within the
scope of presentations, workshops, and other formats. In 2015, about half of the employees
participated in the Group-wide HSE Day. In addition, our units offer their own health-promoting
measures that fall within the aforementioned range of topics. However, these have not been taken into
account to date in the performance indicator.
In regard to health, we want to develop and implement other performance indicators in the future, and
we want to establish clearly measureable targets so that we can have a standardised health
management program.

Group-wide HSE self-review introduced
In 2015, all E.ON units generated so-called management reviews as part of our “HSE Improvement”
plans; with these, they systematically evaluated the effectiveness of their HSE management systems
and determined their HSE performance. The insights gained were documented in a standardised
manner and forwarded to Group management in the form of a self-assessment. The acquired findings
are to be used to develop new measures within the scope of the “HSE Improvement" plans for 2016.

Preventing work accidents with foresight
The following principle applies to the entire Group. Our business activities shall not jeopardize our
employees, the employees of our partner companies, or the general public. To ensure this happens,
we pursue a preventive approach in the areas of health, safety, and environment (HSE), and this
1)

framework is provided by the “HSE Management” Group policy. It requires all regional units to
implement management systems according to the international OHSAS 18001 standard. In 2015,
approximately 85 percent of E.ON’s units, which are subjected to a corresponding operations risk,
especially production-related units such as grid operations and power generation, instituted an
externally certified management system according to this standard. The units of other business areas
are still in the preparation phase for certification.
In 2015, the standardised HSE management system of all 16 E.ON companies in Germany were
OHSAS 18001-certified. As a result, an overall HSE policy, with which shared HSE objectives can be
pursued, now applies to more than 200 business locations in Germany.
Raising awareness for safety topics
In 2015, all E.ON units introduced programmes as part of our “HSE Improvement” plans to increase
awareness regarding safe work practices at the interface between technicians and the first
management level. In prior workshops, we had identified the interaction and communication between
technicians and their direct supervisors as a central factor requiring improvement. In addition, we ran
various Group-wide campaigns to make managers and employees aware of safety and health
protection.
On 10 March 2015 and for the second time to date, we held an E.ON-wide “Safety Hour” and tied it in
to the success of the first one run last year. Our managers showed employees the benefits and
significance of our HSE management and provided an outlook regarding planned activities to improve
safety and health protection. We also held the annual Group-wide “Safety Day” in September 2015. It
serves to generate interest and awareness among our employees for these topics by means of
tangible demonstrations as well as presentations and workshops, among other things. As part of the
event, we also reminded all employees about our golden rules for safety-oriented behaviour.
The “Safety F1RST!” campaign was accompanied in 2015 by many different activities in the units,
which included for example:


Introduction of a conduct-based system entitled “SafetyCHECK” regarding a last-minute risk



Driver safety training and instructions for completing the vehicle accident reporting form

assessment in all of E.ON’s companies in Germany
(Czech Republic)

Audits for technical facilities and management systems
On a regular basis, we use audits to review whether the implemented HSE management systems of
our global and regional units are effective and comply with the standards. In 2015, audits were done
on HSE management systems of the global Generation Unit in France by E.ON Hydro in Germany, on
E.ON Germany (Bayernwerk AG), and on E.ON District Heating in Sweden, as well as the regional
unit in Romania. After investigating fatal work accidents in the previous years, we also evaluated the
work conditions and HSE management systems at locations in Russia and Germany.
These audits did not reveal any serious systematic deficiencies, although some areas requiring
improvement were identified. These pertained among other things to implementing risk assessments,
supplier management, and construction site organisation, and can be partially attributed to local
framework conditions. However, the organisational units could confirm that the findings of prior HSE
audits and accident investigations were implemented. Additional HSE audits are already being
prepared for 2016.

Reporting, analysing, and improving
We evaluate our performance in health and safety by means of performance indicators and continually
collect data pertaining to lost work hours and accidents. In this way, we can see where we have to
focus our efforts. The collected accident data also enables us to research causes and analyse risks in
a comprehensive manner.
Number of near-misses
Besides collecting reportable accidents, we also rely on documenting near-misses that could have
resulted in injuries. In 2015, the number of reported near-misses dropped 30,811 in the previous year
to 20,531. Of these, 6,057 involved E.ON employees and 14,474 pertained to subcontracted
companies. The drop in recorded near-misses is tied especially to the completion of several largescale projects, which decreased the number of high-risk activities.

Unlike our other sustainability reporting, our safety reporting includes companies in which E.ON holds less than a
50 percent stake but over which E.ON has operational control.

Breakdown of E.ON employees’ and contractors’ TRIF
To date, a key parameter for evaluating our occupational safety performance is the “Total Recordable
Injury Frequency Index” (TRIF), which measures the total number of all recorded accidents (not
including accidents requiring first aid). The TRIF that we have used since 2010 not only takes into
account the number of injuries along with lost work hours, but also accidents that resulted in limited
work hours, or those after which employees received medical treatment, but did not miss any work.
We have included contractors who work for us and their employees (combined TRIF) since 2011..

meantime, we have clearly exceeded this figure. Compared to the previous year, it further improved
from 2.3 to 2.1 in 2015. The TRIF remained stable at a very good level of 2.0 (2014: 2.0) among E.ON
employees; among our contractual partners, the corresponding figure of 2.3 was even better than in
the prior year (2014: 2.7).

E.ON employees’ LTIF
We record the frequency of lost-time work accidents using the “Lost Time Injury Frequency Index”
(LTIF). Our plan was to decrease this performance indicator for E.ON employees to 1.0 per 1 million
work hours by 2015. Although we continue to post a continuous decline in the LTIF among E.ON
employees, we were unfortunately unable to achieve our objective. In 2015, the LTIF improved from
1.7 to 1.6. The absolute number of reported employee accidents associated with missed days
improved from 177 in 2014 to 163 in 2015. In the same period, the number of hours worked decreased
so that the LTIF improved only slightly.

We clearly exceeded this target; in fact, in 2015, the LTIF for our contractors improved from 1.9 to 1.7.
Our contractors saw the absolute number of reported accidents associated with lost time, fall from 153
in 2014 to 120 in 2015. In the same period, the number of hours worked also decreased. Therefore,
the drop in LTIF was relatively lower.
Fatal accidents among E.ON employees and contractors
Despite the high occupational safety standards in the Group, there were two fatal accidents in 2015.
One of the fatalities occurred at one of E.ON’s partner companies in the Czech Republic. A domestic
junction box had become unstable and fell on an employee during excavation work for a cable
connection. The second fatality involved a subcontractor of our regional unit in Great Britain. Upon
unloading heavy district heating pipes at a storage facility, a pipe struck an employee. We very much
regret every single fatality and therefore work very hard to improve our occupational safety culture.
Besides investigations conducted by authorities, independent teams of experts contracted by Group
management analyse the exact cause of a given accident. From their findings, we develop measures
to prevent such accidents from reoccurring.

Being active for healthy employees
We believe that it is of great importance that our employees do not jeopardize their health in any way
when performing their work. In addition, they are to have the opportunity at any time to discuss
physical or mental problems openly and confidentially. In 2015, corporate management and the Group
works council in Germany signed the “Health" Group Works Agreement. In signing it, E.ON commits to
ensuring that it provides a healthy work environment and to promoting the health of every single
employee in an optimised manner. As part of the Works Agreement, four equally ranked areas of
activity were defined: Corporate Health Management, Addiction Prevention and Intervention,
Corporate Integration Management, and Employee Counselling.
Focus on mental health
As in years past, our employees’ mental health was again the focus of our corporate health
management program. Disability days due to mental stress are occurring with greater frequency in
countries like Germany. Among other things, these may be caused by the workplace and the work
environment. In addition to awareness campaigns and training for employees and managers, we
conducted a risk assessment for mental stress in 2015. To this end, we used a survey that was
distributed in various companies and locations in Germany, to analyse whether our employees’ work
conditions are mentally stressful. Based on the findings, we developed various measures of which
many have already been implemented. Plans call for conducting the risk assessment in 2016 in other
areas using this systematic analysis.
Health rate at a glance
The health rate provides information about the percentage of days worked in relation to the agreed
upon work time. At 96.7 percent, the figure remained at a high level again in 2015.

Health promotion
In 2015, many employees and managers Group-wide participated in programmes to promote
awareness for physical health and psychological issues. The respective activities and campaigns in
the various regions were selected based on need. For example, new challenges are emerging due to
demographic changes. Employees must work longer and more flexibly, and must still be efficient. This
is only possible in a work environment that promotes health.
In 2015, following health-promoting measures were conducted, among other things, in the individual
regions:


Introduction of “E.ON Life” – an interactive online platform that provides information and
advice on health-related topics, such as mental health, nutrition, and sleep (Great Britain)



Pilot project in regard to dealing proactively with alcohol and drug addiction (Sweden)



Development and implementation of new tools to assist managers in dealing with stress
(Hungary)

In 2015 as in years past, all units Group-wide were encouraged to participate in an HSE Day that
focused on the topic of “Health.” In addition, our HSE experts held an international knowledge-sharing
workshop that was based on a health-related survey among all management units in the Group.
Attendees presented best-practice measures and agreed on developing Group-wide indicators
pertaining to health.
External counselling via the Employee Assistance Program
By signing the “Health” Group Works Agreement in 2015, we also committed all E.ON companies in
Germany to offer their employees counselling services. Since 2013, employees of administrative units
and most of the associated regional supply companies of the regional unit Germany have already had
access to the Employee Assistance Programme (EAP), which is an independent external counselling
service. It operates on a strictly confidential basis and may be used by managers and employees.
They receive counselling in personal meetings with qualified experts in regard to personal, work-, or
health-related issues and problems. If therapy is needed, the experts promptly refer the respective
employees to the appropriate specialists, therapists, or treatment centres.
In the meantime, the EAP is also available in Great Britain, Sweden, the Czech Republic, and
Hungary. Other global and regional units offer their employees comparable assistance programs.
Risk-identification training for employees
Generally, E.ON’s objective is to generate awareness among its managers so that they can correctly
identify absentee patterns and address discrepancies directly. Since 2013, the Centre of Competence
for Global Learning (CoC for Global Learning) has offered managers an e-learning tool, among other
things, on the topic of “Mental health in the work environment” to assist them. In 2015, a total of 1,400
training sessions were conducted for managers on this topic. In addition, the Group offers online
courses and training on other topics, such as “stress management,” “health management,” and “drugs
and alcohol.”

Protection for travel and overseas assignments
Due to the globalisation of the workplace, many E.ON employees nowadays are required to travel for
work-related reasons or to take on longer assignments or projects abroad. Our responsibility is to
prepare them systematically and to protect them against health- and safety-related risks. For that
reason, we introduced a structured management process and established binding regulations in the
“International protection for employees” business directive. The COC for Global Learning also
conducted various courses and training on the topic of “Safe travelling” in 2015. A total of 40
employees have participated in online training.
Epidemics represent a special challenge to the health of our employees. For that reason, travel
medicine is becoming more significant in occupational health-related counselling Group-wide. The
“fitness examination for activities in the tropics, subtropics, and other work locations with particular
climatic conditions and infection hazards” is an integral part of our occupational health office’s care
services. In addition, when sent overseas, our employees can turn to an international service provider,
including its global assistance centre and teams of international, multilingual experts, for assistance.

Engaging in dialogue, promoting acceptance
The energy transformation, which is widely supported by society, requires a large number of
infrastructure projects, both large and small. These projects must not only be approved by the
authorities but must also be designed in consensus with our stakeholders. Citizens, municipalities,
environmental organisations and authorities quite frequently raise ecological, health or financial
concerns about the expansion or conversion of energy grids and power plants.
This process involves interests and expectations which are frequently different and which sometimes
conflict with each other; while our shareholders, for example, expect maximum returns, environmental
groups require the projects to be as environmentally sound as possible. We must have as good a
knowledge as possible of the various requirements of our stakeholders and use this to develop and
represent our own positions. We perform this task in a difficult market environment characterised by
regulatory interventions and rapid technological change.
As a business enterprise and energy supplier, we consider that we have a responsibility to lay the
foundation for prosperity and economic development and to improve the local infrastructure. We aim
to also fulfil this responsibility under the altered framework of today's energy landscape.

Material aspects
In our materiality analysis, we have analysed the expectations of our key stakeholders. This showed
the following key issue for the ‘Societal interaction’ action area:
Promoting acceptance of our projects
Around 93% of the population in Germany supports the development of Renewable Energies.
However, the percentage who are agreeable to having corresponding plants in their own
neighbourhood is much lower (at 68%). Acceptance is once again significantly less in the case of
conventional energy generation plants (at 7-25% only). One of our key tasks, therefore, is still to

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

120

Societal interaction

ensure that our business activities are understood and accepted by the population and politicians in
municipalities, regions or countries ("license to build and operate"). To this end, we must contact
regional interest groups and make them part of our planning and approval processes.
Open and transparent dialogue helps us to identify the concerns of local residents in good time, take
these into account where possible and thus ensure greater planning reliability for our construction
projects. Public confidence suffers, in contrast, where participation is not transparent. As a result, not
only is our reputation harmed, but the construction of new plants can also be delayed. Criticism by the
general public and media also lessens our appeal as an employer. Our regional commitment is
consequently also a supra-regional priority for E.ON.

Control and measures
We will only be able to help reshape the energy supply of the future by working closely with local
communities.
Bringing together different interests at dialogue forums
When we plan to build plants, we make increasing use of dialogue forums and policy conversations in
an effort to include affected stakeholders near our facilities in our building and planning processes.
The forums are conducted by our regional units. We use the results to review our local strategy.
One current example is our power plant forum in Datteln where we are currently building one of the
most modern and efficient hard coal power plants in the world. Here, regional stakeholders have
roundtable discussions with E.ON in its role as operator. All participants have the same rights and
obligations in the dialogue process. They meet several times a year to discuss their different
viewpoints and concerns as well as to share facts. The results of these discussions are included in our
further work and published in press releases, in a newsletter, and on the website.
Employees deployed as E.ON ambassadors
As part of our "E.ON in Dialogue" communications campaign launched in 2006, employees are
deployed specifically as E.ON ambassadors. At conventions, trade fairs and other well-attended
events they answer questions from stakeholders and collect suggestions and complaints.
Clear rules for dialogue
In our dialogue with stakeholders, the aim is to have communication that is open, fast, substantively
consistent and appropriate to the target audience. Our Group Policy on Stakeholder Management has
been the standard framework since 2013 for dealing with relevant stakeholder groups (excluding
investors). This policy sets forth principles for internal and external communication and assigns clear
tasks and responsibilities. Group Management is responsible for determining E.ON’s position and
talking points on issues that affect the company as a whole and for establishing the scope of possible
activities. The real drivers of dialogue with our external stakeholders locally are the regional units,
since they have the best knowledge of the needs and preconditions in their operating territory. In
individual cases, the global units also engage in dialogue with stakeholders.

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

121

Societal interaction

Investing in non-profit projects locally
Our regional units are involved in what are in some cases long-standing partnerships to support local
projects (Community Involvement). These focus primarily on energy and environmental education,
climate protection and energy access. Another key element in our social responsibility is the
involvement of our employees (Employee Involvement) in volunteering, in areas such as Education
and Culture. In 2015 our social investments, however, decreased again. More precise information
concerning this can be found in the chapter "Further measures and performance (Societal
interaction)".

Targets & Performance Review
We believe we will also continue to be able to provide our customers with energy and related services
well into the future, that we will remain a reliable and attractive employer for our workforce, and that
we will live up to our environmental and social responsibilities. One way we do this is by engaging our
local stakeholders in constructive dialogue at a local, national, and European level.
In 2015, we held 38 individual events, on 95 days in all, as part of "E.ON in Dialogue". This allowed us
to achieve the goal we had set ourselves in our 2012-2015 sustainability work programme in terms of
involving our stakeholders.

Involving our stakeholders
We interact with our stakeholders in a variety of ways depending on the target group and issue. These
range from simply providing information to integrating stakeholders in decision-making processes or
directly involving them in projects.

Depending on the issue, various E.ON departments are involved in this process: from Corporate
Responsibility (CR) and Health, Safety & Environment (HSE), to Political Affairs, and including
Investor Relations, Sales, Procurement, and Human Resources.
Dialogue forums and information events: A variety of interests at the same table
In the case of power plant projects, we involve our stakeholders in decision-making processes. To do
this, we hold public forums in which regional stakeholders have roundtable discussions with us in our
role as operator. All participants have the same rights and obligations in the dialogue process. The
different perspectives, interests, concerns and facts can be exchanged openly.
We also used this procedural template in the construction of the district heating pipelines DattelnRecklinghausen. Numerous residents from Recklingen-Suderwich used the forum to express
opposition to the plans for aboveground installation of the pipes. We responded to the residents'
concerns, reviewed our plans in this area once more and finally made plans to bury the pipes. The
new plans were then presented to the residents at an information event and were received very
positively. An additional discussion meeting was subsequently scheduled for final agreement of the
revised construction plans. That meeting was successfully concluded after just one day without any
objections.
Our Schleswig-Holstein Netz subsidiary also initiated a successful dialogue project in 2015. The goal
was to involve owners of the affected areas and residents early on in the construction of high voltage
lines between Heide und Strübbel that was planned for 2017. Schleswig-Holstein Netz firstly informed
the mayors of the affected communities, the officials in charge, and the chief administrative officer
[Landrat] of the plans and what was to happen next. The dialogue was then extended to citizens of
Wesselburen, Wöhrden and Heide. In all, over 100 interested parties came to the meetings and used
the detailed plans to discuss the many issues surrounding the connection project.
Citizens' involvement in Swedish wind farms
Our regional unit in Sweden has gained extensive experience in involving stakeholders in new
construction projects. E.ON Sverige invited interested parties to attend discussion evenings at the
E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

123

Societal interaction
Inolving our stakeholders
sites of Örserum near Jönköping as well as Midsommarberget and Högklippen in Northern Sweden.
All residents, local sports associations, companies and NGOs within a 3 km radius received a
personal letter inviting them to attend, and the events were also announced in the newspapers. The
discussions centred around questions regarding the routing of power lines, opportunities to obtain lowpriced wind power, and compensation for residents adjacent to the wind farms. Stakeholders were
also informed through posters and leaflets. Extensive consultation documents were available for
inspection on the internet.
Citizens invest in Bavarian wind farm
A new construction projects in which our stakeholders can participate directly was launched in midMarch of last year: The Citizens' Wind Farm in Gerolsbach. The farm was implemented by E.ON
subsidiary Bayernwerk along with the municipality of Gerolsbach and a local civic energy cooperative.
Citizens had the opportunity of acquiring a financial interest in the wind farm. The minimum amount
was EUR 1,000 and there was no maximum limit. Citizens who invest in the project receive 3% fixed
interest as well as a share in the profits of the wind farm. This allows them to contribute directly to the
energy transformation and profit from the wind farm's earnings. The three wind farms should generate
capacity of 7.2 MW in total. This will enable them to supply around 16 million kilowatt hours of power
annually to around 4,600 households. The aim in the future is to further expand the business model of
direct financial participation by citizens.
Involving international experts
Besides local stakeholders, we also involve renowned international experts when planning projects.
As part of a renovation project, at the end of 2014 we arranged for our Swedish hydropower plant
Semla to be assessed by the International Hydropower Association (IHA). In accordance with the
Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol (HSAP) this also involved a site visit and extensive
discussions with stakeholders. As a result of the assessment, the sustainability performance of our
power plant was certified as being "above average".
We will be able to use the knowledge gained during the assessment to further improve our
hydropower plants. To build on the results we intend to continue our collaboration with IHA and use
the HSAP as a strategic tool to review the sustainability performance of major hydropower plant
projects. Our goal is the long-term integration of the HSAP in our standard project management
processes.
E.ON in Dialogue initiative
Our employees were also deployed in 2015 at conventions, trade fairs and other well-attended events,
as part of the "E.ON in Dialogue" communications campaign, in an effort to meet and discuss issues
with stakeholders. In this campaign, which was initiated as far back as 2006, "E.ON ambassadors"
field questions, suggestions and complaints from stakeholders and explain key aspects connected
with the energy transition.
Approximately 165 employees were involved as E.ON ambassadors in the campaign on 95 service
days. They proactively engaged in dialogue with visitors at 38 external events, explaining E.ON's
position regarding current energy policy questions and providing information about interconnected
technical and economic issues. In addition, in 2015 we participated for the first time with E.ON in

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

124

Societal interaction
Inolving our stakeholders
Dialogue at an event abroad – the EWEA Offshore in Copenhagen. We had close to 20,000 visitors to
our dialogue booths.
The most discussed issue was the future of energy supply. Direct discussion with booth visitors gave
us valuable information on current trends, hot topics, and attitudes among the population.
For the first time in 2014, we organised micro-conferences as part of the "E.ON in Dialogue"
campaign. This initiative was further extended in 2015: We organised a total of 55 events of this kind
at the Hanover trade fair and the International Consumer Electronics Fair. At our "E.ON in Dialogue"
booth, 24 speakers shared their thoughts with the public on topics including practical experience in
setting up offshore wind farms, power-to-gas demonstration plants and the challenges involved in
optimal design of distributed heat and power generation.
Additional customer feedback channels
The program we launched in the UK in 2013 entitled the Customer Immersion Program has been used
since 2015 in all our regions. The program allows our customers to raise their concerns using various
different formats such as personal conversations and online chats.
In 2015, we strengthened the activities through our Facebook, Twitter and Google+ social media
channels. The number of our Facebook and Twitter followers went up during the reporting year from
20,000 and 15,000 respectively to 51,500 and 23,500. Through Twitter we mainly reach political,
media, association, and scientific representatives. Facebook allows us to engage directly with
interested parties, for example regarding our offshore wind farms, new storage technologies, or the
transformation of the energy sector. Our regional sales units in particular, such as E.ON Energie
Deutschland, place our customers and their concerns firmly centre-stage on their Facebook pages.
Systematic surveys in materiality processes
In our systematic materiality processes, we ask our stakeholders for their opinion on the impacts of
our business activities and our performance. Based on the results, we review our action areas and
determine the topics of our reporting.

Focusing on customer satisfaction
In 2015, we supplied electricity and natural gas to customers in 10 countries. Their trust and
satisfaction are essential to the success of our business. That is why we listen very closely to our
customers and take the concerns they have, which reach us in a variety of ways, very seriously. This
helps us understand what they value about our company and what areas we still need to improve on.
The feedback we get from our customers clearly shows us a number of things: The main thing they
expect is reliable, expert advice as well as individualised options - all at a reasonable price.
As digitisation becomes more prevalent, there is also a growing demand from customers to control
and manage their energy consumption more and more independently. As an energy supplier we have
a responsibility to offer corresponding innovative solutions, while at the same time ensuring that these
solutions meet the highest requirements in terms of data protection.

Material aspects
In our materiality analysis we have analysed the expectations of our key stakeholders. The analysis
showed the following key topics of relevance to ‘customer orientation’:
Promoting customer satisfaction with high service quality
A reliable power and gas supply is one of our basic everyday needs. There are numerous providers
competing in this market to win consumers. Satisfied, loyal customers are therefore fundamental to
our competitiveness in the power and gas business. We survey our customers on a regular basis and
systematically analyse their responses: this allows us to better gear our products and services to their
needs and develop innovative new offerings.
Making prices easy to read and fair
Stable and transparent prices are the basis for customer trust and loyalty. Our customers expect us to
pass lower market prices for electricity and gas on to them. However, our ability to influence end-

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

127

Customer orientation

customer prices is only limited: taxes and levies (such as premiums for renewables feed-in) impact
prices in the individual countries to varying degrees. Going forward, we will also continuously work on
our competitiveness in an effort to provide our customers with energy that is as inexpensive as
possible. Fair and transparent prices also make it less likely for us to be challenged and protect us
from litigation and more stringent statutory regulations.
Digitising the energy sector and ensuring data protection
The energy industry is undergoing a period of structural change. This is evident, for instance, in the
first draft published in Germany in September 2015 of an act to digitise the energy sector. The
increase in digitisation affords both us and our customers a huge variety of new opportunities. Smart
metering systems allow consumers and companies to better manage their energy consumption and
increase their energy efficiency, and we have an opportunity to develop new business models and
create new areas of activity for our employees. With digitisation, though, there are also new data
protection requirements since individual consumption data is being captured increasingly. It is
therefore a key priority for us to ensure the data belonging to our customers, partners and employees
is handled responsibly and in a legally-compliant manner.

Management and measures
Our customers and their needs are our top priority across all of our markets. This applies to the entire
company and this orientation is systematically enhanced by our corporate strategy. According to this
strategy, we will align our future performance more strongly than before to the needs of our
customers.
Structurally anchoring the focus on customer satisfaction
In recent years, we have made good progress in systematically gearing our corporate culture and
management processes toward improving customer satisfaction. The overarching objectives are set
by the E.ON Board and are part of performance agreements made with our managers.
In 2014, we introduced the Center of Competence Customer Experience (CoC Customer Experience)
which serves as a Group-wide platform for sharing best practices and offers support and advice to
Group Management and to the global units regarding changes affecting our customers' interests. We
will continue to further develop our corporate culture going forward in an effort to improve customer
satisfaction with our products. We use the "Net Promoter Score" (NPS) to measure progress in this
area. The NPS measures the willingness of our customers to recommend E.ON to their family and
friends and is considered a significant measure of customer loyalty throughout the Group. It helps us
to find out what is important to our customers and how we will have to change to ensure that their
needs are our top priority. The NPS enables us to understand how we can enhance our customer
experience and compare our performance with that of our competitors. So far, we have successfully
introduced the NPS in Germany, the UK, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Italy, the Netherlands,
Hungary and Romania.
Business units with no direct customer contact also have a significant impact on customer satisfaction
through the role they play in designing our products and services. We also use an internal NPS
programme (iNPS) to foster a customer-centric culture among our employees throughout the Group.

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

128

Customer orientation

Promoting customer satisfaction Group-wide
We wanted to make a Group-wide effort to understand the needs of our customers even better and to
optimise our performance. That's why in 2015 we established the Chief Markets Office (CMO), which
works to improve cooperation and coordination between the different areas responsible for customer
satisfaction. In addition, at the beginning of 2014 we launched the "CustomerFirst" programme, set to
run for an initial term of three years. It aims to get regional units to join in efforts in developing flexible
customer solutions to actively tackle current market challenges and ultimately implement those
solutions in their respective markets.
We also encourage all regional units to participate in the Customer Immersion Program. The objective
of the customer immersion programme is to build on the momentum of our strategy and give our
leaders direct exposure to customers. The purpose of these sessions is not to drive immediate action
but to generate understanding of and engagement in our customers.
These sessions, and the discussions that they have provoked, have gone a long way to bringing the
customer into our decision making processes. The flexibility of the approach also means that we can
adapt the methodology to best suit the business needs across all regional unites.
Developing customer-centric solutions in the regional units
In Europe, our 10 regional units are responsible for developing offerings which are focused on the
needs of our customers. For instance, the apps which consumers use to monitor their individual
electricity consumption are tailored to the specific circumstances of the country in question. Our
regional units supply energy products and services to residential customers and provide all-inclusive
service packages to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In some European countries they
also offer efficient custom-tailored solutions to industrial and commercial (I&C) customers or serve as
the sales partners of regional and municipal utilities.

Targets & Performance Review
Our aim is to attract customers with intelligent and customised solutions that will make us their
preferred energy partner. In so doing, we seek to increase customer satisfaction and customers'
willingness to recommend us to their family and friends, which we measure using the "Net Promoter
Score" (NPS). By 2018, we want to be a performance leader in all our markets in comparison to the
competition, as measured by top-down NPS results.
Our regional units set their own specific NPS targets in consultation with Group Management and
implement their own measures themselves. They report progress towards these targets to the Board
of Management on a quarterly basis. In 2015, we also introduced NPS in our network business, which
has already resulted in positive feedback from our customers. Prior to that, in 2014, we had increased
the incentives for our executives by making a portion of their variable compensation available to all
senior managers based on the NPS score of the respective country in which their unit operates.
Enhancing customer satisfaction further
Our NPS figures for the end of 2015 show that our efforts to enhance customer satisfaction are paying
off: On average, we were considered to be significantly more customer-oriented and were able to
improve our scores compared to the previous year in most regions in which we conduct NPS surveys.
We won many accolades compared to companies of the same size and capacity: we scored "Best in

Class“ among residential customers in three out of seven regions. In the SME segment, we were top in
five out of nine markets.
We also receive a lot of different market feedback on our performance in terms of customer focus. The
"customer satisfaction" subpage contains information about the results or surveys and tests, and about
accolades we received in 2015.

Putting customers first
Focusing on what our customers want is E.ON's top priority. We view our customers as partners and
strive to develop lasting relationships with them. In 2015, we continued to work on gearing our
corporate culture even more toward improving customer satisfaction. Our progress in this regard is
reflected in the "Net Promoter Score" (NPS) results measured at the end of 2015, which showed
improvements compared to the previous year in most regions. These results measure our customers'
willingness to recommend E.ON to their family and friends.
Calculating customer satisfaction
To calculate the NPS score we ask our customers the following simple question: "How likely is it, on a
scale from 1 to 10, that you would recommend E.ON to a friend or colleague?" Depending on their
response, we classify participants as "Detractors" (0-6), "Passive consumers" (7-8) or "Supporters" (910). The figure is arrived at by deducting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of
supporters. The score can consequently be within a range of plus or minus 100. The NPS is a key
performance indicator (KPI) of business success, since the best way of developing our business is to
have customers who stay with us want to use more of our services and recommend us to others.
Above-average customer satisfaction
By 2018, we aim to be the provider with the highest customer satisfaction scores in all our markets
("Best in Class"). In 2015 we moved a little bit closer to achieving this goal. In terms of residential
customers, we achieved better results in 2015 than the previous year in six of the seven regions in
which NPS is measured. Compared to competitors of the same size and capacity, E.ON'S residential
business in Great Britain, Germany and Sweden achieved the best scores. Our Czech unit shares first
place here with other providers. In terms of small and medium-sized enterprises, we achieved better
scores than the previous year in seven out of nine markets and were "Best in Class" in five markets.
In 2015, the four regions accounting for most of our customers, our NPS among residential customers
improved on average by an additional six points - and by as much as 33 points over the last three
years.

corresponding NPS for the competitor that is best in class (BiC), or next -best competitor. NPS is measured in
half-year figures from the start of 2011 to the end of 2015.

Analysing valuable feedback
In conducting the NPS survey, E.ON contacted more than 300,000 customers in 2015, either in
person, by telephone, or via email. We then systematically analysed the information obtained. We also
analysed the feedback received in 2015 from 700,000 additional customers, for example, via social
media, complaint forms or other channels. Every single piece of feedback from our customers helps
us to understand the factors that influence customer satisfaction and to identify where we can further
improve our performance. Going forward, we therefore intend to continue to invest in analysing
customer needs.
Accolades for good service
Our strong commitment to customer orientation helps differentiate us from our competitors. Our
customers think so too. In 2015 our regional units received a number of awards for customer
orientation and also scored well in surveys and tests. Here are a few of the accolades they received:


In the United Kingdom, E.ON UK was voted the best Large Energy Supplier for customer
satisfaction for the second year running by uSwitch, an impartial online comparison service.



In Sweden, E.ON Sverige won the independent brand award in the energy category.

CustomerFirst: working together to enhance customer orientation
The Group-wide "CustomerFirst" programme was launched in 2014. Our aim with the programme is to
gear our marketing more to the needs of our customers and bundle the experience and expertise of all
of our regional units. Between January and April 2014 we firstly determined the existing sales
capabilities of the individual units and in what respect they could be further improved. Since April 2014
our regional units have been developing concrete actions based on this in an effort to improve our
products and services for the customers.
Gaining a better understanding of how our customers see things
The “Customer Immersion Program" gives E.ON employees – including non-customer-facing ones –
the opportunity to engage directly with our residential and business customers. This helps us to better
understand how our customers see things and gear our products and services to their needs.
This format has been in use in the UK since 2013. In 2015, the programme was also launched in
Slovakia, France and Italy and so it is now offered in all of our regional units. Since the programme
was launched E.ON UK has already hosted hundreds of small group and various large-group eventtype sessions in which more than 1,000 employees have met with more than 1,000 customers. 60
face-to-face sessions and online chats were held during 2015 alone. The sessions dealt with topics
such as "transparency and trust" and "personal experiences with energy providers". In addition,
Ofgem, the UK utilities regulator, has also been a regular participant.
Multiple sessions in conjunction with the programme were also held in all other regional units during
2015. In September, for instance, all of our employees in Germany were given the opportunity to join
in live as our customers reported their experiences and voiced their needs and expectations during an
online discussion.

Fair pricing
Fair pricing

Fair prices, customised tariffs
We aim to supply our customers with reliable energy which is as climate-friendly as possible - and to
do this at a price that is verifiable and fair. We therefore continued in 2015 to work on our
competitiveness. We also developed our products and services further, offering our customers a
variety of tariff models which they can use to impact their energy bill in accordance with their personal
needs.
Constituent elements of electricity price
Wholesale prices on the European electricity markets vary only minimally. The price of electricity,
however, is largely made up of price elements mandated by government. In 2015, around 72 percent
of the total price in Germany was attributable to cost items upon which we have no influence. These
include such things as state-regulated network fees, i.e. fees for the use of the electricity grids, and
levies under the Renewable Energies Act.
Since these taxes and charges vary greatly in the individual countries, there are huge differences
between the electricity prices. Across Europe, in 2015 the Germans paid most for their electricity at
29.74 ct/kWh after the Danes (average for the 28 EU member states: 20.52 ct/kWh). The high price in
Germany compared with other member states is attributable to the high proportion of levies, taxes and
charges.
Customised tariffs give customers more control
We offer our customers customised products so that they can have greater influence on their energy
bill. Depending on the needs and circumstances in the individual countries, for example, in 2015 we
offered our customers the following options:


price-cap tariffs and fixed-rate products that shield customers from price increases



products oriented to customer preferences, such as price-tracker products adapted to falling
market prices



instalment plans in which customers’ energy bills stay the same throughout the year, which
protects them from seasonally high bills, particularly in the winter



credits for achieving specified energy saving targets



prepayment models such as "Pay as you go" smart meters in Great Britain, which give
customers control by making advance payments

Customers’ buying decisions ultimately determine which power and gas products succeed in the
marketplace. We are therefore regularly studying customers’ willingness to choose the above options,
which in some markets are still not well known. We’re also testing new products on a pilot basis in
selected regions.

Fair pricing
Incorrect Application of price increases and termination fees in the UK
In April 2015 E.ON UK provided a £7.75m payment to Citizens Advice after incorrectly applying
increases in price and termination fees to some former customers who expressed their wish to leave
the company after price rise announcements in 2013 and 2014.
Following reports from E.ON, Ofgem opened an investigation into the errors in June 2014 and agreed
the penalty package in recognition of the company's errors. These errors meant that some customers
were overcharged although in the majority of cases this was by less than £10. E.ON identified
potentially affected customers and provided redress payments to ensure those who were affected
have not lost out financially.
Support for vulnerable customers
We actively support customers who are particularly vulnerable, such as the elderly or disabled with
low income or those with life-support appliances. Our aim is to prevent any interruption to a customer's
electricity or gas supply if that customer gets into financial difficulties. This is particularly important
during the winter months. We offer special assistance to low-income households, based on the
relevant national funding structures. For instance, in some regions where there is no state aid, we
support customers who are in financial difficulties, team up with partners to provide pre-financing to
insulate rooms or initiate payment plans.
Easy-to-understand billing
Apart from the price, easy-to-understand bills are another key factor that promotes customer
satisfaction. The many different components of energy prices – levies, fees, and taxes – can often be
confusing for customers. In 2014 we therefore shortened and simplified our bills for residential
customers in Germany and Italy. We had already reduced residential bills in the United Kingdom from
seven pages to one page in 2013. E.ON also offers customers the option in all markets to prepare and
send invoices electronically. This helps protect the environment and cuts costs compared to paper

billing. As of year-end 2015, 6,052,562 of our customers chose this option. In 2014, the figure was

Digitisation through intelligent use of IT
Digitisation through intellig ent u se of IT

Smart energy consumption management
Digitisation is also changing the energy sector. As a result, E.ON is changing from being a pure
supplier to being a provider of innovative technology solutions. Our customers can use our products to
monitor and manage their energy usage more independently. It is important here to ensure that the
highest data protection and security standards are met. In 2015, we further expanded our portfolio
throughout Europe.
Smart meters - a key technology for digital services
An EU directive enacted in 2009 requires member states to provide end-customers having a minimum
consumption of 6,000 kWh with smart power or gas meters that enable them to continually monitor
their energy usage. The aim of the European Union here is to give consumers a more pro-active role
in the energy market and to create incentives for greater energy efficiency. The introduction of this
technology raises a number of technical and legal issues. Some member states have not yet fully
transposed the directive into national law: 16 member states have set themselves the goal of
equipping 80 percent of consumers with smart meters by 2020. In Germany, on the other hand, only a
selective roll-out is planned, while in other countries the issue is still to be clarified. The installation of
smart meters throughout Europe will accordingly still take several more years.
We’ve completed the rollout of smart meters in Sweden and are therefore in compliance with what‘s
required by law. In the UK we started installing smart meters in our customers properties over 4 years
ago and have currently installed over half a million meters. In other regions, such as Germany, we’re
currently testing smart meters in pilot projects. Overall, more than 1.7 million households were
equipped with an E.ON smart meter system by the end of 2015.

Advanced electricity meter rollout to business customers in the UK
In November 2015 E.ON UK apologised to customers for failing to meet its obligation to install 20,000
advanced electricity meters to business customers by an April 2014 deadline. E.ON had installed
more than 12,000 advanced electricity meters, but Ofgem has ruled that E.ON failed to take all

reasonable steps to manage the installation within the timeframe. E.ON UK agreed to provide a GBP 7
1

million (EUR 9.6 million ) payment to fund a two-year programme of energy saving help for small and
medium businesses, to be delivered by the Carbon Trust, by way of settlement.
Highest data protection standards for smart metering systems
Its importance is increasing as more and more smart meters are installed, since inadequate security
procedures might lead to unauthorised access to the data transmitted between the customer and its
supplier. We take data protection for smart meters very seriously and helped formulate EU-wide
recommendations on this issue. Some countries have already passed laws incorporating the
recommendations. In Germany a draft law to digitise the energy transition was published in September
2015. It also contains an extensive regulatory framework for data protection and data security. All
smart metering systems are accordingly to be certified by the German Federal Office for Information
Security (BSI) and will as a result meet high data protection and security standards.
Our key "EniM" programme (introduction of new smart metering systems) was set up to implement the
statutory obligation to install smart metering systems in Germany and prepare for their introduction.
We conducted extensive tests on devices and systems in our EniM laboratory in Hamburg in 2015.
There we tested metering systems that were already on the market to check their functionality,
susceptibility to failure and data security.
The software required to operate the systems was also subjected to extensive testing. The first
metering systems were installed on the island of Fehmarn and a large number of other devices will
follow during 2016. By doing this we are ensuring that all devices and systems meet the high
requirements set by the BSI, particularly in relation to security and data protection.
Digital solutions for our customers
Energy can be saved by the intelligent networking of devices and the automation of processes in
buildings (smart homes). This is evident, for example, from the results of the "E-Energy - Smart
Energy made in Germany" project. According to those results, the potential savings in residential
homes is as much as 10 percent, and even as much as 20 percent in the corporate sector. With
digitisation, we have the opportunity to develop new products and services which will help our
customers improve their energy efficiency.
Since 2015 our customers in Germany have been able to use the "E.ON SmartCheck" to view the
consumption of their household devices at a glance. E.ON customers use an easy to use online app to
enter information about their own household, such as size, number of residents and household
appliances. Once they have registered, users receive an early warning if it looks like they might have
to pay more as a result of high electricity consumption. Customers can also compare their electricity
usage with similar households and thus learn more about the way they individually handle energy. The
portal is free for customers who have electricity or natural gas contracts. "E.ON SmartCheck" is being
made accessible for other types of contracts and new functions will be successively added.

Customer orientation
Digitisation through intelligent use of IT
Since 2013, our customers in the United Kingdom have been able to use the “Saving Energy Toolkit”,
which allows customers to compare their energy usage to that of similar households and provides
energy saving tips. Our small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) customers in the United Kingdom
have access to the Energy Toolkit, which provides a variety of personalised tips, aimed at helping
businesses use no more energy than they need. More than 12,000 business customers used the
toolkit in 2015.
In Sweden, the "100Koll" product developed by E.ON has since 2014 allowed our residential
customers to monitor their electricity consumption. They can use it in conjunction with their smart
meter to view the real time consumption of individual devices in their household at any time on their
computer, other connected device or in-home display. The devices can also be switched on or off
remotely. In 2015, we conducted a technical review of "100Koll" with the primary aim of using the
findings to further develop these kinds of digital products throughout the Group.
Investments in energy savings start-ups
As part of gearing our products more towards distributed, smart energy solutions, we are relying on
strategic joint investments with young companies that are helping to shape the future energy market
with smart solutions. This means that in future we will be able to give our customers greater support in
terms of energy efficiency and smart energy use.
In 2015, for example, we acquired a stake in Bidgely, an US start-up. Bidgely offers cloud-based
energy apps both online and through mobile phone interfaces, allowing households to better manage
their energy consumption. One of the ways this is done is that tips on how to optimise the customer's
electricity and heating appliances are sent to customer's mobile phone. Another US interest in which
E.ON invested in 2015 was Space-Time Insight. The company develops analytics applications which
show consumption data in real time using visual graphics. Initially we work jointly on a software
solution which reduces the error ratio in read-outs of smart meter data. In 2015, digimondo, the
German start-up which we nurtured, also started its work. The project develops smart innovative
infrastructures for smart cities.

area
 Compliance (Society)
 Anti-corruption
 Public policy
 Materiality process

A proven foundation for good corporate
governance
In order to remain successful in the future, we must govern our company in a transparent and
responsible manner and focus on adding long-term value. An important basis for this kind of
responsible corporate governance is our compliance with the applicable law and consideration of the
values and principles to which we have made a voluntary commitment. This also includes strictly
controlling compliance with laws and regulations, dealing with any potential violations transparently
and imposing rigorous penalties for these violations. Only in this way can we ensure the trust of our
stakeholders in the long run.
As a company in the energy sector, our business activity is heavily influenced by social developments.
Political decisions based on these developments - such as withdrawal from the nuclear energy
programme in Germany or most recently, the resolutions of the UN Conference on Climate Change
held in Paris 2015 - have a major impact on our company. We therefore intensively follow social
discussions and actively introduce our expertise into the democratic process of shaping public opinion.
In turn, politics and society expect us to accept the decisions that are made and to support the
corresponding measures that are to be implemented.

Material aspects
In our materiality analysis we have analysedthe expectations of our key stakeholders. The analysis
showed the following key topics of relevance to "good governance":
Compliance with statutory regulations, prevention of corruption, and transparency in dealing
with violations
Compliance - or the consistent observance of existing statutory and internal company regulations - is
crucial to society's acceptance of our business activities. Violations such as corruption not only result

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

139

Good governance

in penalty payments but may also lead to a loss of shareholders and customers confidence as well as
revenue losses. However, if we deal with potential incidents in a transparent manner, we can prevent
much more stringent statutory regulations. At the same time, transparent and responsible corporate
governance has a positive effect on our appeal as an employer because negative headlines also
damage our reputation vis-à-vis towards our potential employees.
Contributing to political decisions
In the energy supply environment, which is heavily dominated by politics, adequate representation of
our entrepreneurial interests is essential for our operational business and our strategic further
development. We can make our position more understandable for politics by providing sound
arguments and thereby ensure that this position is taken into consideration when decisions are made.
Only when we deal with our lobbying activities in a transparent manner we can dispel any suspicion of
inadmissible influence on politics and prevent any and all damage to our reputation.

Management and measures
E.ON has put in place effective organizational structures and has clearly assigned roles and
responsibilities based on the principles of good corporate governance. For this reason, we integrate
sustainability aspects directly into our business processes.
Public pledges of good corporate governance
Since 2005 we have been committed to upholding the ten principles of the United Nations (UN) Global
Compact, the world's largest sustainability initiative with more than 8,000 members from more than
163 countries. By this public pledge we commit ourselves to compliance with human rights and labour
and environmental standards and we also participate in the fight against corruption.
Furthermore, we were one of the first companies to sign the "Code of Responsible Conduct for
Business" in 2010. By doing so we commit ourselves, together with other globally active companies
from Germany, to the social market economy and to fair rules in global competition. In addition, we
support the aims and implement the recommendations of the "German Corporate Governance Code".
We are also involved in various committees within the Federation of German Industry (Bundesverband
der DeutschenIndustrie - BDI) and the German Association of Energy and Water Industries
(Bundesverband der Energie- und Wasserwirtschaft - BDEW) in order to enhance compliance.
Our corporate governance system: Good corporate governance regulated throughout the
Group
By "corporate governance system" we mean the overall system which facilitates the governance and
supervision of our company. In accordance with the so-called dual system which is customary in
Germany, the responsibilities are clearly separated from one another: Our Executive Board is
responsible for management and the Supervisory Board is responsible for the supervision of E.ON
SE. Along the way we ensure that the two boards work together efficiently and that our reporting
practices are transparent. Our corporate governance system complies with the "German Corporate
Governance Code" and thus ensures that the interests of the company and shareholders are
protected. Furthermore, the Code requires that the decision-making process of our executive board is
transparent to our stakeholders and that the Supervisory Board is independent. In 2015, the
Supervisory Board of E.ON SE comprised two female and ten male representatives who originated

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

140

Good governance

from four nations in all. The Supervisory Board is also well-balanced when it comes to representatives
of the shareholders and employees.
Sustainability issues anchored at the executive level
The Executive Board and Supervisory Board of E.ON SE also have management and supervisory
responsibility for key sustainability issues. The Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) informs both boards
on a regular basis of key measures, events and indicators with respect to sustainability. The Chairman
of the Executive Board Johannes Teyssen took over as CSO in 2015. The CSO is also the chairman
of our Sustainability Governance Council (SGC) which represents the key committee for management
and supervision of sustainability activities at E.ON. We have also established our own organisational
structure - the HSE Governance Council - for health, safety and the environment.
We want all of our executives at E.ON to take a proactive approach to sustainability issues.
Consequently, safety goals are included in the performance targets of the Executive Board as a whole
and for individual Executive Board members as an element of sustainable corporate governance. The
variable annual salary (short-term incentive) of the E.ON executives is also linked to sustainability
performance values. We monitor attainment of targets by applying measurable criteria such as the
increase in the proportion of executive positions held by women. We present the compensation of our
Executive Board members in our published Annual Report in a transparent manner.
Comprehensive compliance organisation implemented
In order to detect risks of major regulatory violations early enough and to prevent them, we have
introduced a series of measures and processes throughout the E.ON Group, which together form our
compliance management system. The Group's Legal and Compliance policy defines fundamental
structures, roles, and responsibilities for this purpose. In other guidelines we provide more detailed
behavioral and procedural rules for compliance issues such as corruption, insider trading and
intermediary contracts. The compliance management system is currently undergoing the process of
IDW PS 980 certification.
Our Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) is responsible for compliance throughout the Group. He provides
the Executive Board of E.ON with an overview of current developments and events in a quarterly
report. These reports include for instance, violations of guidelines at Group management level and in
the managerial units. So that we can be informed about events in the individual managerial units, all
regional and global units have their own compliance officer, who reports directly to the CCO in Group
management. Violations of regulations are investigated centrally in coordination with the Compliance
Audit and Internal Controls Compliance departments. Countermeasures and sanctions are
implemented by the units themselves.
Zero tolerance for Code of Conduct violations
By virtue of our Code of Conduct, which was last updated in September 2013 and applies group-wide,
we require all our employees to conduct themselves lawfully and responsibly. In keeping with our
Executive Board’s commitment to zero tolerance, we ensure that all demonstrably unethical conduct
or practices cease immediately and that disciplinary action is taken. There are particularly strict
standards for our executives and managers. They are role models and are required to ensure that the
Code of Conduct is observed in their area of responsibility.

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

141

Good governance

So that such breaches do not occur in the first place, we give our employees detailed instructions in
the relevant guidelines, for example on how to handle gifts and entertainment. A compliance checklist
contains a series of questions which our employees can use to determine whether proposed activities
are in keeping with the Code of Conduct. We also use electronic learning programmes, for example, to
raise the awareness of our employees with respect to the content of the Code of Conduct.
Clear rules for the representation of interests
E.ON abides by applicable national and international directives regarding representation of political
interests. Our "Stakeholder Management Guideline" also defines clear internal rules for participation in
political decision-making processes and transparent and substantively consistent interaction with our
stakeholders. As part of this process we require our Group representatives to comply with a
transparent information policy. No wrong, misleading or excessively selective information may be
provided by E.ON; we correct such deficiencies immediately.
Our Gifts and Benefits guidelines state that we do not make any monetary payments or grant noncash benefits to government officials or political decision-makers. Our employees may only accept
gifts - such as presents or invitations to events - if there is absolutely no impression that these are
being given as a reward for certain conduct. In case of doubt, the responsible Compliance Officer
must grant his/her consent first. We offer regular training courses in order to raise awareness of this
topic among our employees.
In late 2011 we were registered in the EU Transparency Register. This register includes organisations
and independent individuals who exert influence on the decision-making processes within the EU. This
also means that we are a signatory to the Code of Conduct contained therein. We would welcome the
introduction of a similar accreditation process in Germany and support efforts to bring it about.

Targets & Performance Review
1

In 2015, the number of compliance notices was reduced from 92 to 75. Thirteen of these were in the
"special incidents" category which also includes cases of suspected corruption. A potential cause for
this reduction in notices is the intensive training of employees regarding the contents of our Code of
Conduct in 2015.
Our objective is to successfully complete the certification process for our Compliance Management
System in accordance with the IDW PS 980 standard. Furthermore, we also plan to introduce a
training plan for regular mandatory compliance courses throughout the entire Group and to determine
the participation rate for each company.

Compliance notices are messages about misconduct as well as violations of laws and regulations committed by E.ON
employees who are addressed via our internal reporting channel as well as via our group-wide “Whistle Blower” hotline. The
increased number of these messages refers to centrally recorded cases which also resulted in investigation and which have
not been proven to be hoaxes.

Acting in accordance with the law and anchoring
values
By virtue of comprehensive measures and defined processes, our Compliance Management System
ensures compliance with applicable laws and our internal guidelines by all members of the E.ON
Group. The guidelines specifically define the respective statutory requirements and our ethical
principles. We have codified these values and principles in a Code of Conduct which is binding across
our entire organisation. In order to refresh our employees' awareness of the various aspects of our
Code of Conduct, we developed a new electronic learning programme (e-learning programme). In
2015 we started implementing it in our units.
Refreshing knowledge of the Code of Conduct via e-learning
Every E.ON employee is obliged to follow the instructions laid out in our Code of Conduct at all times.
We want to use our new, so-called "Refresher" e-learning programme to remind our employees of the
contents of our Code. The programme was successfully completed in 2015 in most units. In 2016 the
training will be completed throughout the entire Group. The programme is divided into three modules.
Each module pertains to one key topic of the Code of Conduct and enhances employees' basic
knowledge.
Since as early as 2010, we have been using a mandatory e-learning programme to train all new
employees of E.ON about E.ON's Code of Conduct. They must complete the programme within the
first six months of joining the company. The programme is enabled for roughly 60,000 E.ON
employees who have access to our Intranet. We provide offline versions and face-to-face training to
employees without internet access so that they too can receive compliance training.
The following compliance topics are integral parts of the Code of Conduct and are taught during
training courses:


Rules governing general behaviour,



lawful behaviour,



interactions with business partners, third parties, and government agencies,



avoiding conflicts of interest and corruption,



handling information and company property and resources,



the environment and occupational health and safety, as well as



compliance organisation in the Group.

Risk prevention: Preventing violations by applying targeted measures
In addition to training all employees, we implement other measures to ensure that behaviour complies
with the E.ON Code of Conduct throughout the Group. For this reason we regularly pinpoint what
fields of activity are exposed to an extraordinary risk of specific compliance violations. With this in
mind, E.ON carries out "Compliance Risk Assessments" on a regular basis, in addition to "Necessity
Checks" based on these. We determine what measures are necessary on the basis of the results. For
instance, in 2015 we trained our employees on the topic of money laundering and the appointment of
intermediaries.

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

Good governance
Compliance and prevention of corruption
Reporting violations of compliance
If misconduct or violations of the law or guidelines should occur despite all preventive measures, our
employees can report this anonymously via our internal reporting channels or a Group-wide "Whistleblower" hotline. The hotline is operated with an external law firm. The information is checked by our
CCO in collaboration with the relevant departments at E.ON and in compliance with all data protection
regulations.
1

75 compliance notices were reported and thoroughly investigated in the E.ON Group in 2015; 92
reports were made in 2014. Fifty of these 75 reports belonged to the category of fraud or pertained to
violations of internal guidelines (2014: 64), 12 pertained to potential conflict of interests (2014:13) and
13 reports belonged to the category "other incidents" (2014:15).
Penalty payments for statutory and regulatory violations
E.ON made no penalty payments as a result of anti-competitive conduct in 2015. However, E.ON UK
2

had to pay some GBP 7.8 million (EUR 10.6 million ) due to errors in invoicing, as a result of an
investigation carried out by the British regulatory body Ofgem. E.ON also made a penalty payment in
the amount of EUR 5,000 in the Netherlands due to non-compliance with environmental laws. The
results of an emission measurement carried out at the Blekerstraat site in Rotterdam, where two oilfired boilers for district heating are installed, were not forwarded within the due time to the relevant
environmental authority.
Countering corruption risks
According to the international Corruption Perception Index (CPI) published by Transparency
International, E.ON has operations in six countries that fall below the threshold of 50 points. In 2015,
we generated around 3.4 percent of our sales (EUR 4 billion) in these countries. We maintained the
supplier relationships with companies in 16 other countries belonging to this category and transacted
5.4 percent of our purchasing volume in the non-fuel sector (EUR 426 million) with suppliers from
countries belonging to this category.
Legally compliant and ethical behaviour is our top priority not only within the E.ON Group. We must
also prevent violations with our suppliers. In order to counter corruption risks along the entire supply
chain, we developed a "Compliance Check" for potential suppliers. We have been implementing this
check since 2015 as obligatory for new contracts. Before any contract is concluded, we apply this
check in order to establish whether potential suppliers meet our compliance standards. To this end,
one of the first things we check is to see if the supplier is mentioned by the media in connection with
compliance-related topics such as corruption and whether the supplier is mentioned on lists of
sanctions and terrorists. We have also developed a comprehensive questionnaire. This questionnaire
is used if there are still some remaining doubts as to whether a supplier follows our values and

Helping to shape political decisions
As a major energy provider, we represent our interests in political discussions and support decisionmaking processes with our technical expertise. Due to the fact that we are a public company with a
very broadly diversified investment structure, we participate in many types of discussions dealing with
topics of energy, the environment and climate change. In 2015 we took part in many discussions and
consultations regarding strategically relevant topics. Our engagement in national and international
associations once again played an important role.
Strengthening emissions trading, improving energy efficiency
Decisions regarding climate policy, such as those adopted at the climate conference in Paris (COP21),
are of crucial significance for E.ON. Even in the run-up to COP21, we therefore participated in
discussions and took a stance concerning a position paper. We welcome the resolution in favour of a
global climate protection agreement and continue our commitment to strengthening European
emissions trading.
As early as February 2015, the European Commission published a framework strategy for the future
alignment of the European and national climate and energy policy. Every EU member state is to
develop an integrated energy and climate plan for the period 2021 to 2030. In this process, they are to
develop measures which will contribute to reaching the EU 2030 energy and climate objectives laid
out in October 2014. We participated in the corresponding discussions within the framework of various
working groups - for instance, in working group 3, we participated in the "Electricity Market" platform of
the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie BMWi). Further development of renewable energies was the main focus of this project.
An energy market for a safe supply of energy
During the political discussion pertaining to the future alignment of the energy market, the issue that
was also dealt with in 2015 was whether one can rely on the mechanisms of an optimised "Energy
only market" over the long term - or whether capacity mechanisms are necessary for the future in
order to ensure supply security. In an "energy only" market only energy supplies that are actually
utilised are paid for, not the provision of the basic service. On the other hand, a power plant operator
in a capacity market also receives payments for the provision of the guaranteed capacity. E.ON thinks
it is necessary to quickly develop the existing system in Germany due to the further increased share of
volatile power generation from renewable energies and is committed, in collaboration with other
companies in the industry, to creating the preconditions for a capacity market.
In 2015, E.ON participated in public consultations dealing with this topic along with specialists, the
business sector and consumers, which resulted in the "Electricity market for the Energy System
Transformation" white paper which was published by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and
Energy (BMWi) in July. Among other things, it advocates the creation of a capacity reserve. E.ON
expressed its opinion about this in a position statement to the BMWi. In that statement we argued in
favour of the introduction of a "decentralised capacity market". With this capacity market mechanism,
electricity suppliers receive capacity certificates from power plants, which cover requirements even
when capacity demand is high. Together with the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

146

Good governance
Responsible lobbying
(BDEW) and the Association of Municipal Companies (Verband kommunaler Unternehmen - VKU), we
contributed to the development of this concept. The position statements led to the first draft of an
electricity market law in autumn 2015 which is currently being discussed.
The future configuration of the energy market is also occupying politicians and the energy sector in
other European countries as well. In France, we participated in the debate about the introduction of
the "decentralised capacity market" which had already been decided on there.
Withdrawal from the nuclear energy programme and search for a permanent repository
Another issue dominated the energy policy debate in 2015 in Germany: Are the nuclear power plant
operators financially capable of coping with the withdrawal from nuclear energy? The BMWi issued an
expert opinion in this respect in 2015 assessing the financial reserves for the dismantling of the
nuclear plants and the disposal of radioactive waste. The expert opinion shows: E.ON's reserves fully
cover future obligations and are at a high level also by international standards.
A major concern in this context is to find a permanent repository for radioactive waste. In 2015 this
search was on the energy policy agenda not only in Germany but also in other countries such as
Sweden. E.ON calls on politicians to press ahead with the search for the permanent repository and
thus reduce the interim storage period.
We will also continue in the future to participate constructively in discussions within the framework of
the withdrawal from nuclear energy and the search for the permanent repository.
Other topics
We also participated in discussions on comprehensive topics such as the Regulation on Wholesale
Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (REMIT) and on the harmonisation of electricity
transmission tariff mechanisms. We also use our expertise in discussions pertaining to technological
standards.
Advocacy through sector associations
At the European level, we often represent our interests in political discussions via the trade
associations of the European electricity and gas sector, Eurogas, or Eurelectric. We are represented
in these associations indirectly via national associations. Both associations were present in 2015 at
the conference on climate change in Paris (COP21). Also, as a member of the Magritte Group which
consists of twelve major European energy supply companies, the chairman of our Executive Board,
Johannes Teyssen, put the case to the EU Commission and national governments that ambitious
climate protection goals should be formulated. We also became a member of the "Smart Energy
Demand Coalition" (SEDC) in 2015 and in early 2016 we joined the "European Distribution System
Operators' Association" (EDSO) - both associations which have set themselves the goal of
establishing the intelligent networking and digitalisation of the energy sector.
At the national level we also work to represent our interests through our membership of organisations
such as the German Association of Energy and Water Industries (BDEW), Sweden's Swedenergy,
Romania's ACUE and Britain's Energy UK. Shared positions on a wide range of technological, political
and economic issues are developed in these organisations. In addition we participate in industry

associations such as the Federation of German Industry (BDI) and its European umbrella
organization, Businesseurope. As a founding member of Natural Gas Future, a German natural gas
industry association, as well as through new partnerships in the natural gas sector, E.ON will continue
to promote the security of the gas supply. In the initiative, E.ON is currently Chair of the Supervisory
Board.

Addressing procurement risks foresightfully
In our business, we use a variety of different fuels and make use of various services and resources
(non-fuels). Each fuel, each product and each service presents its own risk potential in its acquisition,
whether it be political uncertainties (such as natural gas), violations of environmental and human rights
standards (coal, uranium), impairment of biodiversity (biomass), radiation risks (nuclear fuel) or
general work safety (services). For example, some of our coal and uranium supplies come from
Russia and Colombia – countries that do not belong to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD). Especially in these countries, a great challenge to labour and quality
standards is presented due to the absence or insufficiency of structures.

Material aspects
In our materiality analysis we have analysed the expectations of our key stakeholders. The following
prominent issues presented themselves in the field of “Sustainable Procurement”:
Maintaining human rights and environmental standards in the supply chain
Safe and inexpensive procurement of fuels and non-fuels is an important requirement for the success
of our business. We must act in such a way so that human rights and environmental standards are
maintained in the entire supply chain in all our procurement processes. Serious consequences may
result if this is not done; mining accidents in coal mining, for example, are catastrophic locally for
people and the environment. In addition, such accidents damage our reputation significantly, can
disrupt planned supplies and mean significant losses for E.ON. In countries that are not members of
the OECD in which the risk of such accidents is enhanced due to lack of standards, we are often
involved only indirectly through our suppliers and subcontractors. Nevertheless, even here it is our
responsibility to exert influence on production conditions and on observance of established standards.
This also corresponds with the expectations of our stakeholders.

Management and measures

Comprehensive procurement policies
To prevent as much as possible the social, environmental, and human rights risks posed by our
procurement activities, we have put in place comprehensive policies that are binding throughout our
company. The rules of conduct and standards of our Code of Conduct as well as the principles of the
“Global Compact” of the United Nations (UN) are indelibly tied to this. The following standards apply to
the procurement of fuels and non-fuels:


Supplier Code of Conduct: The Supplier Code of Conduct binding throughout the Group lays
down our standards regarding human rights, working conditions, environmental impact and
ethical business standards. They apply fully to non-fuel suppliers; we also ensure that all our
uranium and solid biomass suppliers are contractually bound by them. We reviewed and
revised the principles in 2015.



General Purchasing Conditions: Purchasing contracts with our non-fuel suppliers are
always concluded with reference to the General Purchasing Conditions (GPC). They contain
clauses on health, safety and the environment (HSE) and quality assurance. In addition, the
GPCs bind suppliers to compliance with the E.ON Supplier Code of Conduct and the
principles of the UN Global Compact. We revised the General Purchasing Conditions in 2015.
In the revised version, E.ON and the supplier mutually ensure the undertaking of all necessary
precautions to reduce compliance risks. In this regard, we make absolutely clear what we
understand by serious violations and how we deal with such incidents. This includes for
example – regardless of the form of participation – offences in the areas of corruption, fraud,
forgery and infringement of competition to serious violations. Aiding and abetting are
considered equivalent to the act itself.

In addition, at this point E.ON indicates the consequences of failure of compliance. Depending
on the case, these range from inspection of supplier files for damage claims to extraordinary
termination of the contractual relationship.



Directive on the Procurement of Biomass: E.ON primarily uses biomass in the form of
wood pellets and wood chips. Their procurement has been regulated by an amendment to the
Supplier Code of Conduct since November 2009. This directive is the basis for all contracts
and takes into account the safeguarding of biodiversity, environmental quality, human rights
and living conditions of persons affected by biomass production. All our biomass suppliers
ensure to us their contractual compliance, with the exception of suppliers in Sweden.



Business Governance Group Directive on Procurement: This directive establishes Groupwide operational principles and procedures and responsibilities for non-fuel procurement. We
implemented a revised version of the Group directive in April 2015.



Nuclear Fuel Policy and Nuclear Fuel Purchasing Amendment (2014): Beginning in 2014,
the Principles for Sustainable Procurement of Nuclear Fuel entered in force. The directive
defines the procedure for the selection and evaluation of new uranium suppliers. It obliges
them to comply with standards for the mining, conversion, enrichment, transport, usage, and
storage of nuclear fuel.

Sustainable procurement

Respect for human rights
Our directives for the procurement of fuels and non-fuels recognise the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights (UDHR) of the UN and the conventions of the International Labour Organisation. We
have our non-fuel suppliers contractually acknowledge their compliance with human rights and labour
safety standards. In particular, this means excluding child and forced labour, excluding discrimination
and harassment, ensuring freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. Specific
features such as land rights in biomass production and uranium procurement are also governed by our
directives.
Industry initiative for better standards in coal mining
We have no direct influence over production conditions in industries in which we are only indirectly
involved through our suppliers and subcontractors. In these, we support industry initiatives for
safeguarding our standards.
E.ON is a founding member of the industry’s Bettercoal Initiative. This adopted the so-called
Bettercoal Code of Conduct: it describes social, ecological and ethical requirements for sustainable
coal production, providing the first company-independent standard for onsite evaluation of coal mines.
The core principles to respect and support human and labour rights are also based on international
standards (United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, ILO Declaration) and international
humanitarian law. Furthermore, they require that companies contribute to the long-term regional
development of communities in which they operate.
Qualification of new non-fuel suppliers
Suppliers go through supplier qualification before we engage in business with them. This is required of
new suppliers with whom we expect an annual volume of over EUR 100,000 (service providers) or
EUR 500,000 (products) for use, as well as suppliers with a medium to high risk potential in the area
of health, safety and the environment (HSE), regardless of the volume of business with them.
The first step is pre-qualification: suppliers must undergo this before participating in a tender. First we
survey them through a pre-qualification questionnaire specifically comprising aspects of their social
and financial standing.
After successful pre-qualification, further steps ensue – product and service tests, audits of
manufacturing/supplier locations or trial orders. We initiated our optimised process for qualification of
new suppliers Group-wide in 2015.
Risk assessment
Suppliers with an annual contract volume of over EUR 5 million are of particularly strategic importance
for E.ON. They must undergo a biennial risk assessment in the finance, market, performance and
corporate responsibility/compliance areas.

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

Supplier evaluation and development
A supplier evaluation is required following the performance of services under contract with a volume of
over EUR 500,000. In it, we evaluate our suppliers under twelve criteria, such as compliance with
safety requirements, product and service quality and adherence to deadlines. We also use the
supplier evaluation to support our suppliers in achieving further development. Results from supplier
self-assessments and onsite audits also influence this. We identify areas for improvement and agreed
measures and time limits for their implementation together with our suppliers. We reserve the right to
terminate the business relationship if suppliers do not implement the agreed measures.

Targets & Performance Review
It is our wish to rigorously observe our purchasing decisions and meet the expectations of our critical
stakeholders. We have set concrete goals in recent years to that end, of which the following are parts
of our 2012-2015 work programme:
Non-fuels: continually improving supplier qualification
It is our intent to strategically control relationships with key suppliers in terms of sustainability and
further develop our supplier base in the procurement of equipment (non-fuels). Our Group-wide
standardised process for qualification of suppliers is used for this purpose. Our stated goal for 2015
was to review nearly 100 percent of our suppliers in the non-fuel category whose purchase volume
was classified as critical.
Faced with focusing on savings targets, we admitted that this goal could not be reached during 2014.
We came gradually closer to the target through our new supplier qualification process that was
improved in 2015. Hence, we were able to check and qualify numerous providers by the end of 2015.
At the same time, we are working on the possibility of an automated system-based evaluation of the
results obtained.
Expanding auditing of coal mines
We set the goal of standardising and expanding coal mine inspections under the Bettercoal Initiative
together with other major European companies in our 2012-2015 sustainability working programme.
Four onsite audits were to be carried out and at least 20 self-evaluation questionnaires filled out by
mine operators by 2015 under the programme. The Bettercoal members can currently access more
than 20 questionnaires through the designated data base. Also, three onsite inspections were
conducted in coal mines in 2015, and another took place in January 2016. Hence, the goal set for
2015 was completed, with a slight delay.

Standards in the supply chain
Observance of human rights, quality and environmental standards are extremely important for us at all
E.ON sites. We also set this demand for our business partners in the supply chain. We want to
exclude human rights violations, ensure proper working conditions and implement ethical business
practices. To this end, we have introduced various policies and management processes. In dialogue
with our stakeholders, we are continuing to develop our own environmental and social standards and
are committed to establishing sector standards. In this way, we are gradually extending control over
supply routes – because in the procurement process, the main challenges arise in relation to
protecting the environment and human rights.
We reviewed and revised our Principles for Responsible Procurement in 2015. This also entailed the
revision and updating of general purchasing conditions: we inserted new paragraphs in which we deal
particularly with compliance failings of suppliers.
Development of our supplier relations management
In 2014, the central purchasing division, supported by the Health, Safety & Environment (HSE) and
Corporate Responsibility (CR) areas, developed an optimised and unified process for qualification of
new suppliers. The implementation of this synchronised process was included in the Group
procurement directive and has been mandatory for all Group entities since April 2015. The new
process helps us to evaluate our new suppliers in terms of sustainability. We want to ensure that only
suppliers that are classified as uncritical in environmental, social and governance (ESG) areas are
admitted. We are currently engaged in a project to evaluate the supplier qualification already carried
out to check if the new process is successfully implemented.
New compliance check to prevent corruption
In addition, we developed and tested a Compliance Check that enables us to verify compliance by
new suppliers with antitrust and criminal law and their anticorruption measures. The check, which
takes place during pre-qualification, was made mandatory in the Group in 2015 to mitigate reputation
and liability risks.
Occupational safety and environmental standards in the supply chain in view
Occupational safety and environmental protection are fundamental to E.ON’s core business: the
production and distribution of energy. We require these of our partner companies as well. We have
integrated even stricter environmental and safety standards in the non-fuel procurement process in
our 2015 revision of our Group procurement directive. It was important for us to identify potential risks
in our suppliers as early as possible so as to be able to take appropriate countermeasures. For this
reason, we developed a unified process for risk assessment in 2015 and documented it in the Group
directive. A Group-wide training programme and the Group-wide unified documentation of the results
of the risk assessment are further important milestones for 2015.

Standards in the supply chain
Expansion of inspections in the coal supply chain
As part of our collaboration in the Bettercoal Initiative, we seek to improve the working and
environmental conditions in the coal supply chain. As a member, we have set specific environmental
conditions and self-evaluations for our coal suppliers. These were updated in 2015. Accordingly, four
coal mines are to be audited by 2017, as well as 12 self-assessments under the Bettercoal Code. The
results are evaluated by the Bettercoal initiative’s Secretariat, which afterwards works out specific
improvement options together with suppliers, and reviews their implementation. Mines which do not
yet meet the Bettercoal Code standards receive targets for improvement of their processes and
structures. Each member has access to all auditing and self-evaluation results in the Bettercoal
Initiative data bank. E.ON draws on the audit and self-reporting results in their evaluation of their own
suppliers.
With the energy companies Iberdrola and ESB, the number of members of the Bettercoal Initiative has
increased by two members, to a total of 13.
Main source countries for fuel
Together, Russia and Columbia provide more than 58 percent of our hard coal, making them by far
our largest suppliers. Neither country is a member of the OECD; both are therefore potential sources
of the risks described above.

The most important countries for gas supply in 2015 were Russia, Germany and the Netherlands. We
ensured access to about 400 billion kWh of natural gas using long-term supply contracts in 2015. Our
total trading volume of natural gas was 2,565 billion kWh (2014: 1,794 billion kWh).
The largest uranium reserves are in politically stable countries like Canada and Australia. E.ON
covered its demand for natural uranium through suppliers from Kazakhstan, Canada and Uzbekistan

(47 percent, 27 percent and 13 percent respectively). Smaller amounts come from Australia, Russia,
Namibia, South Africa and the USA. The uranium was enriched in Europe and Russia. We also have
our own stock of natural uranium, two thirds of which come from Australia, Kazakhstan and Canada.
In 2015 we sourced a total of roughly 890 metric tons of natural uranium for our nuclear power stations
in Germany and Sweden (2014: 1,000 t).
Development of purchasing volume in non-fuels
We obtain the majority of our goods and services (non-fuels) from the countries in which we are
active. This is borne out by figures from 2014 and 2015; during the period from January 2014 to
December 2015, approximately 89 percent of our non-fuel purchasing volume was commissioned from
suppliers in the countries of our regional units, as well as from suppliers in Norway and the United
States; global units are engaged in these countries to an extensive degree. For example, in the
following diagram, the share of total purchasing volume in Germany, the UK, Sweden and Romania
are shown:

Maintaining supply security amid increasing
challenges
Figures from the German Federal Network Agency show that electricity and gas outages occur
relatively rarely in Germany – in 2014 there were 173,800 power cuts with an average duration of
12.28 minutes. Gas outages only lasted around 1.25 minutes. Despite the high level of supply
security, electricity supply is facing major challenges in future. Energy is increasingly generated in a
decentralised way today, for example in large wind farms or in private photo-voltaic systems on house
roofs. This means that power is fed in from many different points and is therefore subject to weatherrelated fluctuations. This is pushing distribution grids with increasing frequency to the edges of their
capacity. As an energy supplier we therefore face the challenge of ensuring secure energy supply now
and in the future.
And we also have to guarantee gas supply in the long term. The strong increase in global demand
therefore confronts us with a series of challenges. In China alone, gas demand has more than
quadrupled since 2004. Current (geo-)political crises, for example in eastern Europe, place additional
strain on the market and highlight the dependence on gas imports. In order to prevent supply
bottlenecks we have to avoid excessive dependencies on individual countries and build up capacity
reserves.

Material aspects
In our materiality analysis we have analysed the expectations of our key stakeholders. The analysis
showed the following key topics of relevance to the field of environmental protection:
Ensuring stable energy supply
Secure energy supply is E.ON's core business and the basic prerequisite for E.ON's business
activities ("license to operate"). Power cuts damage our reputation, because what our customers

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

156

Supply security

primarily expect of us is to provide them reliably with energy. At the same time, our stakeholders
demand that we invest even more heavily in renewable energy in the future. This is also our goal: we
want to contribute to the continued increase in proportions of renewable energies in the energy mix.
Currently this proportion is already over 15 percent in the EU and is set to cover 20 percent of gross
energy consumption by 2020. In order to enable energy from renewable sources to be optimally
integrated into our energy system and distributed, the transmission and distribution networks need to
be further developed. In doing so, it is important that an optimum coordination of conventional
networks and new, intelligent ones ensures the greatest possible stability in energy supply. By
developing such intelligent networks and innovative technologies we can face up to the challenges of
the new energy landscape and obtain an advantage in international competition.
Ensuring secure gas supply
It is our aspiration reliably to supply our customers with natural gas now and in the long term. For that
reason we are focusing on the impacts of global developments on our supply chains. By procuring
natural gas with diversification of sources and transport, and by developing important transport
infrastructures, we are safeguarding capacities for the future.

Management and measures
In the new energy world, intelligent and flexible networks are the key to integrating renewable and decentralised energies into our energy system. Conventional generation in the traditional energy world,
by contrast, safeguard power supply when shortages emerge in the fluctuating renewable electricity
sources. Our strategy combines approaches for the new and old energy worlds: We strive to foster an
energy supply that’s secure, balanced, and as climate-friendly as possible.
Developing distribution networks for the new energy world
Our over-riding goal is safeguarding energy supply through efficient and reliable operation of our
distribution networks. With a needs-based expansion of intelligent power networks, we make it
possible to feed energy generated in a decentralised way into the distribution grids. In parallel with the
power network, this creates a data network that coordinates the generation, distribution and storage of
energy. These "smart grids" are able to control energy feed-in from numerous decentralised sources
with the aid of information and communications technologies. Solutions such as the Regel Energy
Management System (REMS) technologies such as flexible gas-fired power plants and embedded
cogeneration units along with new energy storage techniques will also help balance out fluctuations in
supply and demand and make our distribution networks even more flexible.
Broad diversification of energy procurement
Our conventional generation portfolio includes reliable and flexible coal and gas power stations and,
until 2022, several nuclear plants. With each energy type we endeavour to distribute the procurement
sources and routes as broadly as possible. This is how we prevent dependencies on individual
producers, which would lead to a distorted pricing structure. This also applies to natural gas. In
addition to the procurement of natural gas via pipelines, the market for liquefied natural gas (LNG) has
developed into another procurement source. Liquefaction of natural gas has the advantage that the
gas can be transported globally in tanker ships and therefore is not dependent on pipelines. The
increasing liquidity of European markets is also making a significant contribution to gas supply
security.

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

Supply security

E.ON operates a comprehensive gas storage portfolio and has working gas capacities in Germany
with a volume of around 6.8 billion m³. We campaign for the regulatory environment for gas storage to
be structured in a way comparable with those of other sources of flexibility such as border crossing
points. The goal should be that these are not subject to additional charges, so that they can compete
more fairly and play their deserved role in strengthening supply security over the long term. In
addition, E.ON has holdings in various important transport infrastructures such as cross-border
pipelines.
The "Sustainable procurement" page provides an overview of the regions from which we procure fuel.

Targets & Performance Review
We do everything we can to prevent power supply outages from happening and, in the rare instances
they do, to restore service promptly. Our aim is to ensure an uninterrupted energy supply at all times.
We measure our network quality with SAIDI (System Average Interruption Duration Index). This gives
the average outage duration for each consumer supplied per year.
SAIDI power (in min per year)

Power availability in the German distribution network is the highest in the whole of Europe. In 2015 we
had around 0.6 outage per customer (System Average Interruption Frequency Index, SAIFI).

Secure energy supply
Secur e energ y su pply

Ensuring stable energy supply
Our customers expect secure and stable supply of electricity and gas from E.ON. As part of our further
expansion of renewable energy, the power networks will be developed from a centrally controlled
infrastructure to an intelligent, de-centralised one. Our objective is to guarantee reliable supply despite
these changes. That is why in 2015 we not only further expanded and maintained our networks, we
also invested in creating intelligent control (smart grids) and flexibility for them. To this end, we
increasingly also developed decentralised energy storage such as power-to-gas plants. These make it
possible to store excess electrical energy – for example when wind power plants produce more power
than is needed during high winds. Even before 2015 we were able to commission two highly
innovative power-to-gas pilot plants.
Intelligent network control with smart grids
Intelligent networks – known as smart grids – make it possible to integrate electricity from renewable
energies as efficiently as possible into our power network. Smart grids bring all stakeholders in the
energy system together via a single communications network. This means that an energy- and costefficient balance can be achieved between a large number of consumers, generators and –
increasingly in future – storage facilities. With the aid of modern communications technology, the
management of power generation, storage, consumption and the electricity grid is itself optimised.
In early 2015, as part of our strategy project "Work Stream intelligent grids", we identified the 15
essential trends in the constantly changing world of energy. We identified trends including "flexibility of
networks", "integration of renewable energies" and "analysis of networks" as particularly relevant. This
shows that with our approaches we are well on our way in comparison with the competition. In future
we want to test our smart grid strategy regularly and revise it where necessary.
Nano grid project in Hamburg-Reitbrook
A "nano grid" is a complete smart grid in its smallest form. It is chiefly used in small ensembles of
buildings. It connects all energy consumers, generators and storage facilities with each other, acting
externally as an energetic single unit in information and technical terms. In 2015, under the leadership
of E.ON Gesellschaft HanseWerk, we built a nano grid in the Reitbrook district of Hamburg. As part of
this pilot project in partnership with the Lübeck University of Applied Sciences, we are recording the
electricity consumption of an office made from shipping containers in the Hamburg Innovation Centre
with the aid of smart meters. The container office is used all year round for research and general
administrative work and is subject to typical consumption levels for office space. It is also fitted with a
photo-voltaic system, which is being supplemented with a small wind turbine in spring 2016.
The aim of the project is to develop a device configuration that, largely automatically, provides selfgenerated electricity to achieve the highest possible level of self-sufficiency and, if necessary, helps to
stabilise the supply network. In normal use, the system is intended to work unnoticed by users, but to
allow them full control when needed.

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

Supply security
Secure energy supply
Remote-controlled multicopters check networks
We have to check our networks regularly to discover potential damage early. This checking process
generally takes place while the networks are working under electrical voltage. This means that out
staff have to keep their distance for safety reasons. Previously, for a closer inspection, it was essential
to temporarily shut down sections of the network. Therefore we are currently trialling the use of
"multicopters", remote-controlled unmanned aircraft. With their help we can subject the networks to a
close inspection without having to shut down parts of them. The multicopters provide us with aerial
images that we can use for checking particular network sites and for planning future replacement
works. Some of the first pilot projects on the use of multicopters are taking place in the Czech
Republic, where our technicians are testing around a dozen of these devices. In future we plan to use
them to facilitate maintenance of our high- and low-voltage lines in the Czech Republic, which have a
total length of some 65,900km.
Fully automatic monitoring of network load
We are continuously optimising our network operations and employ innovative technologies to do so.
An example of this is the intelligent monitoring of the utilisation of the power networks (ALM). This
involves monitoring the power circuits and substations with the aid of special decentralised measuring
systems. It provides us with a fully automatic means of shutting down systems in which the power
network is at risk of overload. ALM is a further development of conventional feed-in management:
while plant operators previously had to be manually prompted periodically to cut back on feed-in
levels, with ALM this happens fully automatically and in seconds.
Balancing out voltage fluctuations in the network
Because renewable energies are increasingly being fed into our power network, there is an increasing
risk of voltage fluctuations in local distribution networks. Normally these can be avoided only by
expanding the networks or building additional substations. E.ON was therefore on the lookout early for
innovative solutions. Use of voltage-regulated distribution transformers (VRDTs) proved particularly
promising. The voltage regulation is decentralised – just as with generation. It means that a small
number of central substation transformers can be supported by numerous decentralised distribution
transformer stations. The VRDTs measure the voltage in the transformer stations and compare it with
the programmed set value. If the two values are not the same, the transformer automatically regulates
the voltage to the set value. The decentralised VRDTs allow this to be regulated with significantly
greater precision than via a distant substation. E.ON had installed 200 VRDTs in the German
distribution network by late 2015. We are also increasingly using VRDTs in pilot projects in other
countries, such as the Czech Republic, to balance out voltage fluctuations in the grids. We have
already been able to significantly reduce the costs of the VRDTs. We are expecting further cost
reductions in future.
Store excess energy with power-to-gas
Storing excess, regeneratively produced power is a central key for secure power supply in the age of
the energy transition. One possibility for this is transforming electricity and water into hydrogen –
which is known as power-to-gas technology. The "green" hydrogen produced in this way (not to be
confused with "grey" hydrogen, which is generally produced from natural gas and used for engineering
purposes) is available to the natural gas market and can be used for heating in industry, as fuel for

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

161

Supply security
Secure energy supply
transport or in electricity generation. We are also able to avoid having to shut down wind power plants
when there is a risk of network overload, because the over capacity is transformed.
In 2015 we commissioned the world's most compact power-to-gas plant at our Hamburg-Reitbrook
site. Together with the plant previously commissioned in 2013 in Falkenhagen (Brandenburg), these
facilities enable us to transform 1.5MW of power into hydrogen per hour. This corresponds to a
3

production of 290m of hydrogen per hour.
Secure natural gas procurement
In addition to secure electricity procurement, supplying our customers with natural gas is one of
E.ON's main tasks. As part of our diversified procurement concept, the extension of pipeline capacities
also plays a role.
In 2015 a project was initiated to extend the Nord Stream pipeline, a gas transport route through the
Baltic between Russia and Germany, and we are involved. The plan is to double the existing transport
capacity from 55 billion m³ to 110 billion m³. After completion in late 2019, we will be in a position to
meet Europe's rising import needs and to increase supply security yet further.

Further measures & performance
Environmental Protection
How does E.ON ensure that the latest environmental regulations are taken into consideration?
Environmental legislation plays a central role for E.ON. A significant part of our expertise and
operation is involved in the observance of legal and regulatory requirements. A large number of our
management processes in our (operational) organisational handbooks are regulated by this. In
addition, we train our employees in their practical application.
We continuously monitor and evaluate all changes in regulatory requirements and laws at the national,
European and extra-European level that could potentially impact our systems. In this regard, in 2012
we established a central authorisation platform for the construction and operation of facilities. Each
regional unit appoints a contact person who updates the platform by publishing any changes of legal
relevance which have a material impact on our Group. The contact person is tasked with evaluating
these and coordinating our responses to the challenges that occur in relation to them.
Is there a policy that is particularly important for E.ON?
The Industrial Emission Directive (IED-RL) is significant for existing power plants with a thermal input
greater than 50 MW. In relation to this, E.ON may have to implement new requirements or decide
whether facilities are refitted or decommissioned after shutdown. Local regulatory authorities check as
part of their continual monitoring whether the objectives of the IED-RL in their national versions are
met. If the IED-RL is updated with new legal requirements, this is attended to by our global unit E.ON
Technologies.
What exchange of information takes place within the EU for optimisation of plants?
“Best Available Techniques” (BAT) are developed throughout Europe for various industries in an
exchange of information based legally on the IED-RL and distributed in leaflets. Member states,
industry, and environmental groups take part in the consultation process. This permits the optimal
design of facilities, and thus the reduction of environmental risks. The EU Commission is expected to
publish leaflets of BAT findings with so-called associated emission limits for large combustion plants
for the first time at the end of 2016. The limits established in them are to be applied to new plants
immediately following their publication in the European Official Journal, and to existing plants within
four years. An internal working group is evaluating the possible impact on our generation facilities.

How does E.ON support the reconciliation of work and private life?
We want to facilitate the reconciliation of work and private life (Life Balance) of our employees. That's
why we give them substantial freedom in the design of their working time. Models with flexible working
hours or trust-based working hours have been established at E.ON for years now. Our employees also
have the option to work from home office or to take long-term leave (sabbatical). After a longer
absence, we help them re-enter working life. We support and promote the need for part-time work;
some seven percent of our employees are employed on a part-time basis. Thereof, 66% are women
and 34% are men.
With various measures, we support our employees in phases of life in which they are facing great
challenges in their private life - for example, through the care of young children or elderly relatives. In
addition to making the working hours and places more flexible, we offer various care options: In
cooperation with daycare or nurseries, we provide subsidised childcare places and mediate ad hoc
support in Germany over the pme Family Service. In addition, we offer employees on parental leave
preferential cover for holidays and sickness so that they can follow current developments in the
company. At the end of 2015, 739 E.ON employees were on parental leave; of these, 703 were
women.
As part of the demographic change, not only is the average age of our employees rising but also that
of their family members. E.ON has offered various options for employees with relatives who need
care. In cooperation with the pme family service, we offer individual consultation on nursing at home or
inpatient care, and refers carers, assistants for the elderly and household helpers.
In what form does E.ON integrate its employees in the company processes?
It is of great advantage for us to integrate our employees closely into the company processes - both
via the personal dialogues and via co-determination bodies. A key element thereof is the mandatory
employee meeting. We also allow for direct exchanges with company management on the discussion
forum "Ask the board", in which the board invites all employees to live chat on a regular basis. There
are various blog formats on which our employees can get in touch with managers and colleagues,
submit ideas and suggestions and share successes and events.
How does E.ON provide for its employees?
An attractive salary package, including relevant benefits is a matter of course at E.ON. An important
component of this is company pension-plan benefits. In addition, we have created the “E.ON
Investment Plan” in Germany, which represents an efficient tool for individual wealth creation. It is
based mainly on an employee share programme, to whom E.ON offered a partially tax-exempt grant.
In 2015, a total of 9,275 employees held 1,419,934 shares. Similar programmes have also been
established in other countries. In the process, we also take into consideration the applicable legal
provisions.
Every employee of E.ON SE also enjoys the protection of employer-funded Group accident insurance
cover, which insures against accidents outside of work as well as work-related and commuting
accidents. The preventive health care for employees is also very important to us. Fundamentally, all

occupational benefits also apply to part-time and fixed-term employees; it is only the employee
shareholding programme that has limitations for fixed-term employees.
Is there an individual performance evaluation at E.ON?
For E.ON managers and a large proportion of employees, a variable, performance-based annual profit
share is a fixed part of their remuneration package. This depends both on the performance of
individuals who are evaluated on the basis of our competence model, and on the performance of the
entire company as well. Top management staff also receive a long-term variable remuneration
element.

What activities does E.ON engage in as part of "Community Involvement"?
Our regional units are involved in what are in some cases long-standing partnerships to support local
projects (Community Involvement). We focus here primarily on energy and environmental education,
climate protection and energy access. In the countries in which we are active we have thus
implemented many educational projects (some of which are ground-breaking) for children aged
between 3 and 18 or their teachers and educators. Group management provides advice in the design
and implementation of these projects.
Community investment by type

In 2015, the volume of social investments decreased further, falling from EUR 23 million in 2014 to
EUR 14 million last year. There are two reasons for this: cost discipline in the company and the
decision not to continue with certain programs in Britain. Each year we publish details on the extent of
our social investment in individual thematic areas for seven categories:

How does E.ON encourage its employees to be involved in volunteering?
Since 2009, there have been corresponding activities in all countries in which we are active. The
scope of these, however, varies depending on the particular country. Last year, over 2,167 E.ON
employees throughout the Group worked around 12,747 working hours doing volunteering (figure
adjusted for the commitment by the regional units in Spain and Italy). The Group consequently
provided the equivalent of around EUR 318,675 of work in all.
In what international industry forums, initiatives and conferences is E.ON active?


World Energy Council:
We are involved in the World Energy Council (WEC), which campaigns globally for an
affordable, reliable, and eco-friendly energy supply. Leonhard Birnbaum, a member of the
Board of Management, currently heads the European arm of the WEC. In this capacity, he
was involved in 2015 in numerous discussions at a national, European, and global level. The
WEC includes all energy sources in its work and has a broad membership base. This includes
governments and authorities as well as companies, the scientific community, and NGOs.



econsense – Forum for Sustainable Development of German Business
Leading German companies and organisations with global operations have joined forces in
econsense – Forum for Sustainable Development of German Business. Since its foundation in
2000, E.ON has participated in a variety of econsense working groups focusing on issues
such as sustainability in the supply chain, climate and environmental protection, and
sustainability performance metrics. We share experiences, develop joint positions, and
contribute to social discourses together with other companies. econsense also moderates the
preparation of the "National Action Plan (NAP) for Business and Human Rights", which is to
be adopted by the Federal Cabinet in 2016. E.ON was involved in the hearing on "Reporting
and Transparency" with the members of the NAP steering group. E.ON is also involved, as
part of the Supply Chain Management working group, in the design and development launch
of a Human Rights training module.



CDP Worldwide
E.ON participates in the Climate Change Programme and the Water Programme of the
independent information service provider CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project). We also
participate in CDP forums: Our aim in doing so is to communicate our strategy to a broad
range of professionals and learn from other organisations.



World Business Council for Sustainable Development
The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), a coalition of leading
sustainability-oriented companies, serves as an important interface between international
policymaking and the corporate world. The initiative focuses on energy and climate protection,
ecosystem protection, and sustainable development. We participate in a number of WBCSD
working groups, such as the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Working Group. We are also
involved in collaborative projects, for instance in developing standards for sustainable water
management in the energy industry. Apart from that, we were once again involved in the



Global Compact
Within the United Nations Global Compact, E.ON participated in 2015 as a member in the
work of the Business and Human Rights peer learning group. The group, attended by around
ten DAX companies from different sectors, provided a special type of forum for discussion with
its personal meetings in 2015. One of these meetings, which was attended also by a
representative of the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and corporate
representatives from the Southern Europe Global Compact Group, was devoted to the
experiences companies had had relating to the issue of aid for refugees.

How many customers bought green power products from E.ON in 2015?
E.ON offers residential and business customers a variety of green power products, which respond to
the public’s heightened environmental awareness. Altogether we supplied our customers with around
10 TWh of green power in 2015, which represented around 5.2 percent of the total retail sales volume
in our ten regional markets. The demand for these products varies greatly between the different
regions. This is a reflection not least of the different framework conditions for the supply of green
power.
And what action is E.ON taking in terms of climate-friendly mobility?
We have a range of offerings to promote low-carbon mobility in vehicles powered by electricity and
natural gas. Electric vehicles (EVs) can help make mobility cleaner and less dependent on fossil fuels.
With manufacturers offering better EVs and the legislative environment improving in many countries
(as with Germany’s newly enacted Electro-mobility Law and Charging Station Ordinance), we expect
this market segment to experience strong growth. We conduct projects and activities in a number of
regions in an effort to encourage people to embrace e-mobility. E.ON currently operates more than
1,000 publicly accessible charging points in Europe and is steadily expanding its charging network.
E.ON is also electrifying its internal fleets of vehicles and offering employees the option of charging
their electric vehicles.
Natural gas-powered vehicles also have considerable potential. They emit around 25 percent less CO 2
than gasoline-powered vehicles. As more biomethane is fed into the gas pipeline system, climate
performance will improve even further.
How is E.ON promoting e-mobility?
We consider e-mobility to be a cornerstone in the climate-friendly energy landscape of the future and
so we are working to expand the charging infrastructure and develop new charging technologies.
In the Hamburg metropolitan area we are involved in a scientific project which is looking at the
requirements that must be met by charging stations and finding out the current and future need for
charging points in the metropolitan area. To this end we are building as many as 50 charging stations
in the city and surrounding districts. Other project partners include the Hamburg metropolitan area
administrative office, the Institute for Urban Development and Urban Transport of RWTH Aachen
(North-Rhine Westphalia University of Technology), and “Hamburger Projektleitstelle für
Elektromobilität hySOLUTIONS GmbH”.
The whole project, which is being funded by the federal government to the tune of around EUR 1.6
million, is scheduled to last three years.
In Berlin and the surrounding area, we are partnering with Joey’s Pizza and the Berlin office of SEWEURODRIVE to test fast and uncomplicated practical solutions to inductive charging. In this process
power is transmitted without contact via the magnetic field of a coil installed in the ground. The
counterpart is located on the underside of the vehicle. This can also be placed during short periods of
non-use above the floor plate and charged and as a result is ready to use at any time.

How can E.ON ensure that human rights are protected throughout the Group?
Our entire company is also subject to our own Human Rights Guidelines in which we recognise the
UN "Universal Declaration of Human Rights", the International Labour Organization’s Convention on
Human Rights, and the Principles of the UN "Global Compact" of the United Nations (UN). With
reference to the corresponding ILO conventions, we explicitly affirm E.ON’s opposition to child labour.
Based on this guideline, we also include human rights topics in our procurement processes.
The E.ON Human Rights Guidelines apply to all our regional and global business units, as well as all
subsidiaries that are fully integrated in the E.ON consolidated financial statements. The Guidelines
stipulate the creation of a contact point for human rights issues at Group Management level in the
form of a Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO). This function has been assumed since October by the
Chairman of the E.ON Executive Board, Johannes Teyssen, who is consequently also simultaneously
chairman of the Sustainability Governance Council (SGC).
Furthermore, we have appointed staff who are responsible for ensuring that the E.ON Guidelines meet
the requirements in the UN’s 2011 Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights. Through
training courses, shareholder-dialogues, and other formats, these experts closely analyse the UN
Principles, contribute their knowledge to the Group and determine where there is a need to act in
anchoring the issue of human rights more firmly within Group companies.
What does E.ON do to ensure early detection of risks of human rights violations?
In 2015, with external assistance, we systematically analysed the processes pertaining to our
business activities - in relation to the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights (a socalled "Human Rights Capacity Assessment"). The goal was to better understand the major
requirements and determine how to achieve early detection of the risks of potential violations of
human rights and how to respond. Based on these results we will adjust our management systems for
protecting human rights as required, and integrate corresponding regulations into the relevant
business processes. Among other things, we have already expanded our checklist for suppliers and
aligned it with the requirements of the UN Global Compact.
In what dialogues regarding the protection of human rights did E.ON participate in 2015?
In 2015 E.ON took part in several sector-specific as well as more general stakeholder dialogues. One
of these was a dialogue process by NGOs and companies pertaining to the topic of human rights and
raw materials in global supply chains, which was moderated by the Wittenberg Centre for Global
Ethics (WZGE) in cooperation with ecosense - Forum for Sustainable Development of the German
Economy. In addition, E.ON supports the German Federal Government’s National Action Plan for
Business and Human Rights, which was launched in November 2014. The action plan is expected to
be adopted by the Federal Cabinet in 2016. In Great Britain, we are checking to see what E.ON's
obligations are under the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015.

How does E.ON promote sustainable biomass supply?
A variety of different legal guidelines and framework conditions characterize the European market for
solid biomass. This not only makes it difficult to establish a functional European trading market, it also
damages social acceptance of solid biomass. With the aim of developing a consistent European
sustainability certificate, we have joined together with other European energy utilities, pellet producers,
audit organisations and other stakeholders to form the Sustainable Biomass Partnership (SBP). In
March 2014, the SBP published its first framework and invited interested parties to comment on this.
The revised document went into test phase with industry partners in September 2014 and was
published in March 2015.
How does E.ON deal with the risk of nuclear fuel supply?
In 2014, we agreed a Nuclear Fuel Policy which describes how we source nuclear fuels, what
standards our suppliers must adhere to, and how we check this. It is supplemented with our Nuclear
Fuel Purchasing Amendment, which specifies the application of our Responsible Procurement Policy
to nuclear fuels. Both documents are components of our contracts with new suppliers of nuclear fuels
for our German and Swedish facilities. The Responsible Procurement Policy is already part of existing
supply contracts for uranium. We source uranium exclusively from established suppliers with
production primarily in politically stable countries. As far as we know, there are no companies among
them that fail to meet government regulations or permit requirements. Should this situation change,
then the respective suppliers would be excluded from our procurement group.
As part of our tender processes, all long-term suppliers in the supply chain for nuclear fuels are
required to carry out an extensive self-assessment. We review and document the resulting risks and
take account of them in our decision-making. We also analyse the situation in our procurement
regions on the basis of independent reports, such as those by the United Nations Human Rights
Council, as well as Transparency International and Amnesty International.
Currently, we only carry out reviews and on-site audits for new suppliers, or in cases of justified
suspicion. Since our demand for uranium, especially in the German E.ON facilities, will fall in the
coming years, no new contracts were agreed in 2015, nor were any uranium mines or processing
plants audited. In the 2015 reporting period there were no incidents leading to a termination of
business relationships.

Measurable economically, socially and environmentally relevant indicators are a basic requirement in
enabling us to evaluate our progress in implementing our projects and strategies. Standardised
indicators from the areas of Environment, Social Responsibility, and Governance & Integrity (ESG) are

In selecting our KPIs we use meaningful reporting standards, such as the third generation of ESG
KPIs from the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies (EFFAS) and the German
Association for Financial Analysis and Asset Management (Deutsche Vereinigung für Finanzanalysten
– DVFA). These core non-financial indicators are valid across Europe and also include sector-specific
criteria. We remain one of the few companies in Germany to offer standardized ESG key indicators. In
our annual sustainability report we are also guided by the guidelines of the "Global Reporting Initiative "
(GRI) and report our water and CO2 figures to the "Carbon Disclosure Project" (CPD).
These measures are intended to improve the comparability of our reporting activities and make ESG
information more easily accessible to financial analysts.

External recognition
Ext ern al r ecognitio n

Awards, ratings and rankings
For years E.ON has scored well in numerous sustainability ratings and rankings. We also regularly
receive external recognition for our sustainability activities – both regional projects and those with a
wider focus. In the following section we highlight awards, ratings, and rankings that are relevant to our
Group as a whole.

Dow Jones Sustainability Index and RobecoSAM Sustainability Yearbook
Each year, the investment specialist RobecoSAM assesses the economic, environmental and social
performance of over 2,500 listed companies. The globally recognised Dow Jones Sustainability Index
(DJSI) and the RobecoSAM Sustainability Yearbook are both based on the findings of this evaluation.
In 2015 E.ON missed its goal to be included in the DJSI. It is our goal to be included in both indices
again in the coming year.

E.ON has, however, once more been qualified for inclusion in the important "RobecoSAM
Sustainability Yearbook". E.ON was recently in the 2014 Yearbook. Inclusion once again in the current
2016 Yearbook was achieved due to the marked improvement in results in the 2015 DJSI assessment
(improvement in the percentile ranking from 78 to 87). To be listed in the Yearbook a company must
fall within the top 15 percent in its industrial segment. As one of the best rated companies we also
received the bronze award for "outstanding sustainability performance" by RobecoSAM.

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

ESG facts & figures
External recognition
Inclusion in the CDP Leadership Group with a maximum score
In 2015, CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) rated E.ON as a leading company in the DACH
region (German acronym for Germany, Austria, Switzerland) in terms of environmental reporting and
included it in the CDP Leadership Index. This represents an acknowledgment by CDP of the quality,
process and transparency of the data which E.ON publishes in the annual CDP climate change report.
The Leadership Index is reserved for the best ten percent of the companies reviewed from all
industrial sectors. E.ON succeeded in improving its prior year result from 87 points by 13 to achieve
the maximum score of 100. This result means we are significantly above the average for the industry.
The reporting data provided by E.ON for this purpose was assessed independently.
The independent non-profit organisation CDP on behalf of over 822 institutional investors calls each
year for groups all over the world to publish their CO 2 emissions and their strategies in dealing with
climate change and water resources. The results are published online. The CDP rating also assesses
the transparency and comprehensiveness of companies ’ CO2 reporting.
As part of its participation in CDP, E.ON has published data on CO₂ emissions (CDP Carbon
Response) annually since 2004. Since 2011, we have also published extensive data on our water
management as established by the CDP Water Program (CDP Water Response). We use this
platform to communicate our responsible corporate management to investors and other stakeholders
and to benchmark ourselves in a direct comparison with our competitors. We also aim to increase
awareness within our company of the importance of water and climate protection.
E.ON remains in the Euronext Vigeo Index
The ‘Euronext Vigeo - Eurozone 120’ by French rating agency Vigeo lists 120 companies in the euro
zone that have achieved the best performance in the areas of environment, social and governance.
The evaluation is based on up to 330 indicators covering 38 sustainability criteria. The index is
updated every six months. E.ON is once again included in the current listing from December 2015.
Top 100 Green Utilities – E.ON again in the Top Ten
In October 2015, E.ON was once again ranked among the leading companies in the "Top 100 Green
Utilities Ranking" of Energy Intelligence, a leading publisher on energy-related topics. Although we fell
somewhat, to 14th place from the previous year's 9th place, we are confident of being in the Top Ten
once again next year. The Green Utilities Ranking assesses leading international electricity utilities
based on their portfolios for renewables and their CO 2 emissions.
Successful sustainability reporting online
In the current comparison by Lundquist, a Milan-based communication agency, E.ON achieved ninth
place in the CSR Online Awards Germany 2014/14, placing us once again among the top ten of all
German DAX-30 companies for online sustainability reporting. With this award, Lundquist
acknowledges E.ON’s exemplary sustainability communication via the internet.
E.ON is a popular employer
In 2015 E.ON received several awards as a top employer. At the beginning of the year, the
independent international "Top Employers Institute" certified E.ON as "Top Employer Germany” and
classified it as one of the best employers in the engineering industry. Key evaluation criteria for the

E.ON Sustainability Report 2015

188

ESG facts & figures
External recognition
ranking include the topics of compensation and social benefits, talent strategy, HR planning, training
and development and carrier and succession planning. The 122 "Top Employers in Germany" and the
26 "Top Employers in Engineering” have been subject to a thorough review in all these areas and
exceed the relevant standards. In rankings by both the trendence research institute and the
Universum consulting company, we are also among the top 100 best or most popular employers in
Germany.
In addition, E.ON received the Total E-Quality award for the second time from the organisation of the
same name for equal-opportunities excellence in HR and organisational policies. This award is
supported by the German Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth; we
received the award in 2013 for a period of three years.
Standard Ethics Rating of the 30 largest companies in Germany
At the start of 2016, "Standard Ethics" rated the 30 largest companies in Germany in terms of ESG
standards. E.ON has an "EE" rating in the above field. We are consequently certified as having good
compliance. Only the small proportion of women on the Supervisory Board is considered to be critical
at E.ON.
The Standard Ethics Rating assesses the Compliance Level of
companies with regard to topics such as corporate governance and
sustainability. Documents and guidelines of the EU, OECD and UN
are used as the basis for the rating here.

We use our T&I projects to participate in the
realization of the operating goal of the work
program. The goals include the economically
feasible reduction of our CO² emissions through
efficient, innovative technologies. In the future we
also want to push forward with our innovation
activities and contribute to a more efficient and
climate friendly power generation.

Yes

The breakdown of R&D activities by technologies
is in keeping with our strategic focus of recent
years: Our research budget for conventional and
renewable power sources has been declining for
years, as the focus has shifted to the targeted
efficiency improvements to existing technologies
and systems. By contrast, the research budget
spent on distribution and end-users R&D activities
have been steadily increasing.
We are thus systematically managing our
research and development expenditures.

also include halving the CO² intensity of our power
generation by 2015 - relative to the benchmark
