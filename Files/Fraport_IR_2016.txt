About this Report

About this Report
The information in this report covers all activities, products, and services by the Group and all companies that are consolidated according to the
regulations on financial reporting issued by the International Accounting Standards Board on the balance sheet date or have significant environmental
effects within this framework.
The financial, HR, and environmental key figures are calculated at the Group level via an SAP-supported application and are subject to the same
calculation method. Different collection methods are indicated in individual cases. All data and information was collected by the relevant departments/
consolidated Group companies.
The Fraport Group is among the leading global airport operators with Frankfurt Airport and its international portfolio of investments. The range of
the Group includes all services of aviation and terminal operations as well as associated services.
The Group’s most important revenue driver is Frankfurt Airport. With a share of around 80 % of revenue, the German site – and here almost exclusively
Frankfurt Airport – was again the most important site of the Fraport Group in 2016. Nearly 92 % of employees were employed in Germany/at the
Frankfurt site in 2016.
Our reports “GRI Report 2016” and “2016 Compact – Gute Reise! We make it happen” are published annually in German and English and cover the
reporting period of January 1 to December 31 of each year.
The usual, and in our opinion appropriate, methods, calculations, and estimates are employed to determine the reporting data. It cannot be ruled
out that individual GRI indicators may be associated with a degree of uncertainty. A summary of all key figures is found in our financial report.

Environment
The scope of consolidation for the environmental key figures from 2014 to 2016 comprises the Fraport parent company and the fully consolidated
investments with significant environmental effects. These are: Fraport parent company, Gesellschaft für Cleaning Service mbH & Co. (GCS), Airport
Cater Service GmbH (ACS) and the Group airports Varna, Burgas, Lima, and Ljubljana (fourth quarter 2014 and later). Fraport Cargo Services GmbH
(FCS) was fully consolidated up to October 31, 2015 and a joint venture afterwards, but for comparison purposes was shown as a fully consolidated
company up to December 31, 2015. In 2016, FCS is no longer included in the scope of consolidation.
Key figures validated by an external environmental assessor pursuant to EMAS are shown with colored backgrounds.

* Population database DDS. Collection date for this data for all analyses is 2010.
1)
The flight noise contours were calculated based on the reference works introduced for Germany “Instructions for calculating noise abatement areas (AzB)” and
“Instructions for capturing flight operations data (AzD, 2008)”. All scenarios were standardized based on the average operation direction distribution for the ten years
from 2000 to 2009. The sigma increase developed for forecasting protection zone calculations under the Aircraft Noise Abatement Act and described in AzB and AzD was not used.
2)
For the Ldn (level day/night) measure, this is a 24h long-term noise level in dB(A) that adds an increase of 10 dB to noise events at night.
The Ldn enables us to document pollution changes from year to year using only one criterion.		
3)
The Leq, day = 60 dB(A) criterion is aligned with the definition of day protection zone 1 pursuant to the Aircraft Noise Abatement Act.			
4)
The Leq, day = 55 dB(A) criterion is aligned with the definition of day protection zone 2 pursuant to the Aircraft Noise Abatement Act.			
5)
The information on the Leq, day = 55 dB(A) is the total number within this contour that is below the number stated for Leq, day = 60 dB(A), i.e., a sub-quantity.
6)
The criterion Surrounding from NAT, night = 6 x 68 dB(A) and Leq, night = 50 dB(A) is aligned with the definition of the night protection zone pursuant to the Aircraft Noise Abatement Act.

Bird strike rate (number of bird strikes per 10,000 aircraft movements): All events with birds at Frankfurt Main Airport and in the surrounding area for aircraft registered in Germany.
The bird strike rate is transferred to the total aircraft movements at Frankfurt Airport. Notification of a bird strike is made by the pilot to the German Committee for Prevention of Bird
Strikes in Air Traffic (Deutscher Ausschuss zur Verhütung von Vogelschlägen im Luftverkehr (DAVVL e.V.)). The DAVVL annually provides a list of all bird strikes to the relevant airport
operator. The airport operator, in this case Fraport AG, calculates the bird strike rate.
2015 has been updated, 2016 is still preliminary.
The significant increase in the number of bird strikes corresponds to the trend across Germany. It can be assumed that the number of bird strikes has not increased, but rather the
number of reports. This is because, in accordance with EU Regulation 376/2014 and Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1080 Annex IV, beginning in November 2015 all airport
operators, air traffic controllers, ground handling services and aircraft pilots in Europe are now uniformly required to report security-related incidents (here bird strikes).
Bird strike rate: number of bird strikes per 10,000 aircraft movements.		
This figure is not for one year but only for the fourth quarter of 2014. Figure adjusted for technical reasons.		
2015 updated.		
Improved control with regard to deterrence of birds.

sold its shares in the Group company Air-Transport IT Services, Inc., USA with effect from April 22, 2015. On November 2, 2015 Fraport sold 51 % of
the capital shares in Group company Fraport Cargo Services (FCS). These two companies are no longer included in the personnel figures for 2015
and 2016. The employee figures for the Group companies in Greece were included for the first time in 2016.

Minor injuries (at the level of first-aid measures) are not included.		
Notifiable = occupational accidents resulting in more than three lost days must be reported.		
With reference to the average headcount. The average headcount is calculated by adding the total monthly employees divided by the number of months.		
Absence days = planned work days. 		
Based on planned working hours.		
It is not currently possible for Fraport to classify accidents by cause for technical reasons, but the aim is to collect these data in the future.		
The figures shown cover all staff, but not independent contractors, as no data are collected for these employees.		
Sub-dividing the accident and absence days by gender is not relevant for Fraport. The majority of workplace accidents take place in operational areas
where mainly men work. An analysis would therefore show that the majority are men. 		
2015 figure adjusted. Due to subsequently reported accidents, the figures reported for the previous year may be adjusted.

GRI Report 2016

GRI Content Index

GRI Content Index
Our sustainability reporting for 2016 consists of the report “2016 Compact – Gute Reise! We make it happen” and the GRI Report 2016. The GRI
Report focuses on the policies of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI G4, “In accordance” core option) and includes the airport-specific Airport
Operators Sector Disclosures.
In the course of aligning sustainability reporting with the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) G4 guidelines, the materiality matrix needed to be
further developed in 2015 (see G4-18). After updating the materiality matrix, the ten areas of activity were assigned to the key GRI G4 aspects. In
addition, relevant aspects that are key requirements for operating an airport were determined and these remain part of the reporting. These aspects
are identified in the report.

GRI and UN Global Compact Index
Fraport complies with and supports the ten principles of the UN Global Compact, develops and takes measures to implement them, and contributes
to their recognition, even beyond the Company’s own boundaries. The present report serves as a progress report for the implementation of the ten
principles of the UN Global Compact on corporate management.
The GRI index indicates where information on the individual topics and aspects of sustainability reporting can be found. In addition, please refer to
the following table, in which we provide information on our commitment to the implementation of the ten principles of the UN Global Compact.

Principle 1:
Principle 2:
Principle 3:

Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights
Businesses should make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses
Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right
to collective bargaining
Principle 4: Businesses should uphold the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor
Principle 5: Businesses should uphold the effective abolition of child labor
Principle 6: Businesses should uphold the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation
Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges
Principle 8: Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility
Principle 9: Businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies
Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery

G4-11 Employees covered by collective bargaining agreements
In the Fraport Group, 98.7 % of all employees are employed and paid under collective bargaining agreements. The difference to 100 % is made up
of employees of smaller Group companies who are not subject to a collective bargaining agreement. These are mainly employees not covered by
collective bargaining agreements or senior managers.
See Key figures/Personnel, G4-11 Employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, page 20.

G4-12 Organization’s supply chain
The Fraport Group is a supplier of high-quality airport services. In accordance with Fraport’s fundamental values of probity, integrity, trustworthiness,
responsibility, transparency, and fairness, we aspire to act with social, economic, and environmental responsibility in our business dealings and see
sustainability as designing the future. We have defined this responsibility for our employees in the code of conduct. We expect our suppliers and
service providers to comply with the same standards. The code of conduct describes the standards for business relationships with the Fraport AG
companies. Similar to the code of conduct for employees, this code addresses the issues of compliance, working conditions, and human rights and
was supplemented by the aspects of environmental conservation and climate protection.
This applies to all Fraport suppliers and service providers with whom there is a direct business relationship.

Procurement at Fraport AG
Contrary to a manufacturing company, Fraport AG has a heterogeneous requirement structure. The requirements of Fraport AG range from architectural
services through the erection of complete buildings to their repair, from office materials through computer center services to aircraft tow-tractors.
Frankfurt Airport does not have a traditional supply chain.
Around 68 % (€566 million) of the order volume from the parent company totaling €833 million was placed with companies in the Frankfurt/
Rhine-Main Region in 2016. More than 91 % of all awarded orders were below €10,000 and are therefore to the particular advantage of small and
medium-sized companies.
Around 43 % of the order volume was procured for services. These were mainly services for security, temporary staff, cleaning and IT.
28 % of the order volume was procured for construction. The other 29 % was placed in the market for consumables.
In 2016, Fraport AG had over 3,053 active suppliers and service providers.

31

GRI Report 2016

GRI Content Index / General Standard Disclosures

Location of suppliers and service providers by country:
97 % of the order volume placed comes from suppliers and service providers with their head office in the Federal Republic of Germany, 2.5 % from
within the EU, and 0.5 % from such countries as the USA and Switzerland. These countries have comparable legal principles and standards.

G4-13 Changes regarding size, structure, or ownership
See Annual Report 2016, page 49 et seqq. and page 58 et seqq.
In 2016, there were no significant changes in terms of suppliers’ sites or relationships with suppliers, including selection and termination. Fraport
does not have a traditional supply chain.

G4-14 Explanation of whether and how the precautionary approach or principle is addressed by the organization
Fraport actively looks for opportunities and embraces them if the magnitude of the projected benefits and the exposure to risks are in an appropriate relationship to each other. A controlled approach to risks is the primary goal of risk management (see Risk and Opportunities Report in Annual
Report 2016, page 77 et seqq.).
Furthermore, our business model supports a precautionary approach when dealing with environmental problems and also takes into account aspects
such as cost efficiency, economic feasibility, and sustainability of our environmental programs (see Environmental Statement 2016 in the “Publications/
Environmental Statements” section on www.fraport.com/en/responsibility.html).
A range of comprehensive measures directed toward preventive health and safety are designed to avoid the physical, psychological, and social
forms of stress that employees experience at work as far as possible. If stress cannot be avoided, the preventive measures are intended to reduce or compensate for it (see “Occupational health and safety” in “2016 Compact”, page 58 et seq. and “Occupational health and safety” on
http://www.fraport.com/en/responsibility/dimensions/employees.html). The Executive Board and the employee representative bodies have formulated a statement of principles on occupational health and safety and incorporated it into the Group guidelines.
Security is the key requirement for air traffic. This principle applies equally to passenger traffic and air freight. This is why security management
has always been a top priority for Fraport. Increasingly advanced technologies and more and more personnel are being deployed at Frankfurt
Airport to guarantee the security of passengers, baggage, and cargo. The Security Management System (SMS) at Fraport AG is an instrument set
up in conformity with the ICAO standards and recommendations. It records and evaluates all events relevant to security in airport operations and
potential weak points in the operating processes. The SMS is directed toward all users at Frankfurt Airport; the relevant processes, procedures,
and responsibilities are defined in a manual accessible to all internal personnel (see http://www.fraport.com/en/our-expertise/business-services/
safety-management-system--sms-.html).

G4-15 Externally developed charters, principles, or other initiatives
Voluntary initiatives (selection):
Fraport AG has made a commitment to compliance with the most important internationally recognized codes of conduct to promote responsible
corporate governance at all Group sites – the principles of the UN Global Compact (since July 2007), the OECD principles, and the ILO core labor
standards.
The Supervisory Board of Fraport AG adopted the Corporate Governance Code of Fraport AG as early as 2002. The Code describes the key principles
for the management and monitoring of the Company and includes internationally and nationally recognized standards for good and responsible
corporate governance. The Fraport Code also includes the key rights of the shareholders who provide the company with the necessary equity capital
and bear the entrepreneurial risk. The Fraport Code is firmly based on the German Corporate Governance Code.
In addition, Fraport signed the Business Conduct Rules of the biggest European purchasing association, the German Association of Materials
Management, Purchasing, and Logistics (BME) in 2009. The Rules are based on the principles of the UN Global Compact and include fundamental anti-corruption rules; antitrust agreements; rules on child labor and forced labor; and rules on compliance with human rights, environmental
protection, health protection, and fair working conditions. The companies signing up to the agreement have made a commitment to promote the
“Business Conduct Rules” with their suppliers in the best possible way.
Since 2002, Fraport has been a member of Transparency International German Chapter e.V. (https://www.transparency.de/English.1222.0.html).

GRI Report 2016

Equal opportunities, diversity, and achieving the right work-life balance for career and family are key elements of our employment policy. In 2007,
Fraport signed the Charter of Diversity and in 2013 the Charter on Compatibility of Career and Caregiving Activities in Hesse. Signatories of this
charter aim to support their employees in taking responsibility for relatives who need care.
Since 2006, Fraport has been contributing its climate reporting to the “Carbon Disclosure Project” (CDP), the world’s leading climate reporting initiative in the financial industry. In addition, since 2009 Fraport has participated in Airport Carbon Accreditation, a program of ACI, with the objective
of persuading the maximum number of European airports to adopt CO₂-neutral operation.

Mandatory initiatives:
Reporting is in accordance with the standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). As the capital-market oriented parent

For indexes, awards, and memberships, see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/about-us/awards.html.

G4-16 Memberships
Fraport pursues its interests through membership of the industry organizations Task Force for German Commercial Airports (ADV,
http://www.adv.aero/) and Airports Council International (ACI, http://www.aci.aero/) Europe and World. Fraport is also a member of the Federation
of the German Air Traffic Industry (BDL, http://www.bdl.aero/en/). BDL focuses on the importance of air traffic as an economic factor for Germany
and has defined its target as highlighting its contribution to safe mobility, climate protection, and environmental protection. We are working together
with bodies in these organizations to prepare positions on air traffic issues. They also include positions on projected legislation and political initiatives
(see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/european-matters-associations/associations.html).

Material Aspects and Boundaries
G4-17 List of consolidated companies
See page 17 and “Disclosures of shareholding pursuant to Section 313 (2) of the HGB” and “Notes to the Consolidation and Accounting Policies”
(Annual Report 2016, page 194 et seqq. and page 110 et seqq.).

G4-18 Process for defining the report content
The basis for defining the report content is a materiality matrix analysis. We focus on the principles of sustainability context, completeness, materiality,
and stakeholder engagement formulated by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). From the regular and systematic exchange with our internal and
external stakeholders, we gain the impetus for the strategic alignment of the company (see “Stakeholder dialogs” in “2016 Compact”, page 24 et
seqq.). Since 2010, we have used this to create the materiality matrix that depicts the company’s future challenges. The matrix is checked annually
to ensure it is up to date and, if necessary, modified (see “Updating the materiality matrix” in “2016 Compact”, page 26).
In the course of aligning sustainability reporting with the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) G4 guidelines, the materiality matrix needed to be
developed in 2015 to focus it even more on the central areas of activity for the company’s sustainability. In 2016, a check to ensure that the matrix
is up to date was made and the matrix’s validity was confirmed. In defining the key issues for updating the matrix in 2015, we proceeded as follows:

1. Identification
The content of the existing materiality matrix was first checked according to the GRI G4 requirements, taking account of the benchmark results and
discussions with representatives of internal departments. Detailed results from the last management and stakeholder survey from 2013 were also
considered, as well as the current extent to which targets from the areas of activity in the program had been achieved. The aim of updating the areas
of activity was to concentrate on aspects that can be recorded with targets and measurable performance indicators (see “Updating the materiality
matrix” in “2016 Compact”, page 26).
Based on these analyses we derived ten areas of activity that are of key importance to the future of the Fraport Group. The process of updating the
materiality matrix and the defined areas of activity were approved by the Executive Board.

33

GRI Report 2016

GRI Content Index / General Standard Disclosures

2. Prioritization
Fraport’s management and representatives of our most important stakeholders (airline companies, passengers, business partners, shareholders,
analysts, employees, employee representatives, political bodies and authorities, foundations, associations, scientific bodies, NGOs, local residents
living near airports) confirmed the high relevance of the ten newly defined areas of activity for the company’s sustainability in an online survey. Both
groups were also requested to prioritize the issues (see “Materiality matrix” in “2016 Compact” report, page 27).

3. Validation
After carrying out the stakeholder survey, the results were checked internally and the updated materiality matrix was approved by the Executive
Board. The areas of activity of the materiality matrix were then assigned to the relevant GRI G4 Aspects.

G4-19 All material aspects
After updating the materiality matrix, the ten areas of activity were assigned to the key GRI G4 aspects.

Aspect: Stakeholder Engagement
G4-24 Stakeholder groups engaged
See “2016 Compact” report, page 25.

G4-25 Identification and selection of stakeholders
The stakeholder groups relevant for us and to be included were defined with the involvement of the Executive Board and representatives from
individual departments. We seek a dialog with our business partners, our customers, and with politicians. We also seek dialog with our critics, particularly those people who live near the airport and experience the negative impacts of aircraft noise. Last but not least, we are also dedicated to
looking after more than 81,000 employees (as of: 2015) at the biggest workplace in Germany. As a large company, we bear direct, to some extent,
as well as indirect social responsibility for these people.

G4-26 Approach to stakeholder engagement
Fraport has a broad network of institutionalized, structured communication media to promote dialog and a regular exchange of views with our
stakeholder groups. This includes conducting regular surveys and operating systematic feedback management for our passengers, and the continual
exchange of views with local authorities and citizens on subjects relating to the airport (see “Aspect service quality”, page 74 and “2016 Compact”,
page 40 et seq.).

G4-27 Key topics raised through stakeholder engagement
Approach to integration of the interests of the stakeholders:
The materiality matrix helps us to identify and take account of risks and opportunities for the benefit of Fraport, or to avoid impacts as appropriate.
The systematic exchange of information with the most important internal and external stakeholders enables us to develop perspectives for the
strategic alignment of the company. We outline below the opportunities we want to take forward into the future. We show significant risks in our
annual report (see Annual Report 2016, page 76 et seqq.).
In the course of aligning sustainability reporting with the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) G4 guidelines, the materiality matrix needed to be
developed in 2015 to focus it even more on the central areas of activity for the company’s sustainability. To do this, the content of the materiality
matrix was first reviewed in terms of the GRI G4 requirements and in consideration of benchmark results (see “Updating the materiality matrix” in
the “2016 Compact” report, page 26).
Fraport’s management and representatives of our most important stakeholders (airline companies, passengers, business partners, shareholders,
analysts, employees, employee representatives, political bodies and authorities, foundations, associations, scientific bodies, NGOs, local residents
living near airports) confirmed the relevance of the ten newly defined areas of activity for the company’s sustainability in an online survey. Both
groups were also requested to prioritize the issues (see “2016 Compact”, page 27). The surveyed people also had the opportunity to state further
key issues for the future of Fraport AG – but these are covered completely in the defined areas of activity.
In 2016, a check to ensure that the matrix is up to date was made and the matrix’s validity was confirmed.

Resulting key issues:
Our new program was derived from the content of the materiality matrix. This focused on the ten areas of activity:
>> Product quality and customer satisfaction
>> Economic efficiency
>> Growth and development in the Group
>> Ideas and innovation
>> Attractive and responsible employer
>> Occupational health and safety
>> Climate protection
>> Conservation of nature and resources
>> Noise abatement
>> Value generation and engagement in the region
A comprehensive summary of all subjects including the associated objectives and measures can be found in “Our program” (see “2016 Compact”
report, page 30 et seqq.).

Implementation in communication:
The objectives and measures of the program were passed by the Executive Board at the end of 2016. The program is a key element of the reporting
such that the requirements of the stakeholders are also included in the reporting.

Corporate Management
G4-34 Governance structure
In accordance with German legislation, Fraport is governed by a dual management system: The Executive Board manages the company with responsibility for sustainable growth in the interests of the company, i.e., taking account of the requirements of the shareholders, its employees, and the
other stakeholder groups associated with the Company. The Executive Board develops the strategic direction of the company, defines it together
with the Supervisory Board, and ensures its implementation. The Executive Board is responsible for compliance with the statutory regulations and
internal company guidelines, and ensures compliance within the Group. The Executive Board also ensures appropriate risk management and risk
controlling within the Company. The Supervisory Board appoints, monitors, and advises the Executive Board. Decisions of fundamental importance
for the company require the consent of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board has 20 members and has equal shareholder and employee
representation. The shareholder representatives are appointed by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. The employee representatives
are elected by the employees in accordance with the provisions of the Co-determination Act. The period of office is five years.
More detailed information on the individual members of the Supervisory Board, as well as the composition and work of the committees is provided
in the 2016 Annual Report (see Annual Report 2016, page 20 et seqq.). A list compiled by the Supervisory Board relating to diversity aspects is
provided in the section “Key figures”, page 23.

Ethics and Integrity
G4-56 Values, principles, and standards of behavior
The Supervisory Board of Fraport AG adopted the Fraport AG Corporate Governance Code (see http://www.fraport.com/en/investor-relations/
corporate-governance/integrated-management-systems.html) as early as 2002 and has since continually developed it in compliance with the
recommendations and suggestions made by the Government Commission of the German Corporate Governance Code. The Code describes the
key principles for the management and monitoring of the company and includes internationally and nationally recognized standards for good and
responsible corporate governance (see Fraport AG Corporate Governance Code and Joint Statement on Corporate Governance).
Pursuant to responsible corporate governance, we have made a commitment to comply with internationally recognized standards of conduct, such
as those defined in the principles of the UN Global Compact, the OECD principles, and the ILO core labor standards.
In accordance with Fraport’s fundamental values of probity, integrity, trustworthiness, responsibility, transparency, loyalty, and fairness, we aspire to
act with social, economic, and environmental responsibility in our business dealings and see sustainability as designing the future. The reputation
of our company is a key element in our success. We all contribute through our daily work to the positive perception of Fraport.

GRI Report 2016

GRI Content Index / General Standard Disclosures

In order to anchor them more strongly in the company, at the start of 2013 Fraport published two codes of conduct that require employees and
suppliers to comply with these basic principles (see Code of Conduct for Employees of Fraport AG/Code of Conduct for Suppliers of Fraport AG
at http://www.fraport.com/en/responsibility/at-a-glance/corporate-values-and-policies.html). The Code of Conduct for Employees was edited
and updated in 2016. It covers the subjects of compliance, working conditions, and human rights. Similar to the Code of Conduct for Employees,
the Code for suppliers also contains the aspects of environmental conservation and climate protection. The Code of Conduct for Suppliers of
Fraport AG was substantially revised in 2016 in terms of content and its effectiveness in the General Terms and Conditions of Business. The obligations
of the business partner – including for the supply chain – were enhanced. An anti-corruption clause that defines serious misconduct (criminal offenses)
has now been included in the revised supplier code. A breach of these can lead to the termination of the business relationship. Further, in the case
of antitrust violations and serious misconduct, a contractual penalty and flat-rate claim for damages may be imposed. The new Code of Conduct for
Suppliers has been adapted to the German law on general terms and conditions of business and applies in this form to Fraport AG. It may be used
by the German investments. If they do not have the power to implement these changes with their clients, the previously agreed Code of Conduct
for Suppliers will continue to apply. For foreign subsidiaries with other jurisdictions, the previously agreed codes of conduct for suppliers apply.
The Fraport Policy forms the overarching structure for all commitments and the codes of the Group based on specific topic areas. The Code of Conduct reflects the values culture lived out at Fraport and provides our employees with a framework for dealing with the economic, legal, and moral
challenges of daily business life in a responsible and correct manner.
The Code of Conduct for Employees of Fraport AG was initially introduced at the beginning of 2013 to the controlled German companies of the
Fraport Group and was then gradually rolled out in the majority shareholdings abroad. Country-specific modifications were permitted and the code
was published in the respective national language, most recently in Slovenian and Greek.
The acceptance of the codes of conduct is also a key element of the Group Compliance Management System (CMS) guideline rolled out in 2015
that must be implemented by the fully consolidated subsidiaries as a minimum requirement. As a result of the publication of both codes as Fraport
AG guidelines at the same time and their inclusion in the CMS Group guideline that is binding for the subsidiaries by resolution of their supervisory
bodies, they have been implemented as binding. The training on these issues took place by e-learning at Fraport AG and within the subsidiaries
under the responsibility of the senior management there. Repeat training on the Code of Conduct is planned at 3-year intervals. Business partners
are not offered compulsory training. All new Group employees receive an appropriate introduction to the Code of Conduct that is handed out along
with the employment contract. The Legal Affairs and Compliance department regularly collects information from the subsidiaries on the status of
implementation of the Group CMS policy. The company management and the local compliance officers are responsible for the binding introduction
of the Group compliance policy.
Fraport is engaged at all Group sites in maintaining natural habitats and strives for preventative environmental management. The environmental
policy of Fraport AG was adopted in 2008 by the Company’s Executive Board (for further information see Environmental Statement 2014, page 6 in
the “Publications/Environmental Statements” area on www.fraport.com/en/responsibility.html). It is therefore binding for the whole Group. It is based
on a preventative approach in dealing with natural resources and commits us to an environmentally friendly approach in all business activities. At
each of our majority-owned airports there is an environmental management system that is used to detect and minimize risks. The long track record
of experience enjoyed by Frankfurt Airport in environmental protection provides a tangible benefit for all Group sites, for example in the form of
training courses and technical support, including on-site assistance.
The Group company agreement entitled “The Conduct of Partnership, Diversity, and Equality in the Workplace” defines the principles of non-discrimination, equal opportunities, the advancement of women into management positions, and diversity for Fraport. These principles are a key element
for decision-making on personnel appointments, training measures, organizational changes, and the structuring of work time.
Over recent years, the “Agenda 2015” corporate strategy was crucial for Fraport to meet the development needs in aviation and changes to the
environmental conditions. The new mission statement converts Agenda 2015 into a new strategy that was introduced in the company in 2016. It
takes effect in all areas and is the guideline for future activity. In addition to the corporate purpose, it describes the objectives, values, and vision
(see “Our mission statement” in “2016 Compact”, page 12 et seqq.).
The Group’s mission statement aims to define Fraport’s understanding of important issues. Our understanding of management, amongst other
matters, is also described here. With these established aspirations we want to give management activity a common orientation and obligation and
thus make our contribution to achieving the corporate objectives.

Refer to “Our program” in “2016 Compact”, page 30 et seqq.

Monitoring and tracking:
Fraport has implemented a Whistleblower System at many of its sites. This is an important tool for identifying or uncovering breaches in codes.
In 2009, Fraport implemented the electronic Whistleblower System BKMS® (see https://www.bkms-system.net/bkwebanon/report/clientInfo?cin=6fra1&language=eng) at the parent company. Fraport employees, business partners, and customers have the opportunity to submit confidential
reports about irregularities around the clock using an Internet-based communication platform. This means that information on corruption, economic
crime, and infringements of standards of conduct can be reported anonymously throughout the world at any time. The Whistleblower System has also
been implemented at our Group subsidiary Fraport Twin Star Airport Management AD since 2009, at our Antalya site in 2010 and in Lima in 2011.
Fraport has also appointed an external lawyer as an ombudswoman. She additionally accepts reports on company-related crimes, inadmissible
business practices, and serious infringements of regulations. Since 2003, employees at the Frankfurt site have also had an internal ombudsperson
they can turn to.
We have numerous management systems to establish responsible corporate governance in the business processes (http://www.fraport.com/en/
our-expertise/business-services/policies-and-payment-terms.html). These include, for example, environmental, health and safety, and quality management. Under the umbrella term “process-oriented quality management”, Fraport AG operates a system that focuses on the essential business
processes. In this system, the essential processes of Fraport AG are checked systematically and continuously so as to be able to offer customers
continuously high quality and thus ensure the competitiveness of our company. Certification of the quality management system in accordance with
ISO 9001 was successfully completed as early as 1996. Beginning in 2000, certification was expanded to Group companies and investments and a
certification association was formed. Currently, the association comprises 17 companies.
The awareness of the processes implemented in the company and their effectiveness, efficiency, and interaction are essential for sustainable corporate success. In order to maintain the high level of process quality and, if necessary, improve it with the relevant responsible persons, we conduct
internal audits regularly within the scope of the management systems. Internal audits are used as a self-monitoring instrument. Random checks
are made to see whether the relevant legal and any other requirements for the respective process as well as the internal rules are known and how
they are implemented. The processes are thus continuously scrutinized with regard to their effectiveness and efficiency.
Since 1999, Fraport AG has conducted a regular audit at Frankfurt Airport using state authorized and supervised environmental assessors. The basis
for this is the European regulation on the “Eco-Management and Audit Scheme” (EMAS). Since 2002, the audit has also applied the international
ISO 14001 standard. These audits under EMAS and ISO 14001 included Fraport Cargo Services GmbH (FCS) in 2008, N*ICE Aircraft Services &
Support GmbH (N*ICE) in 2009, and Energy Air GmbH in 2014.
Lima Airport, Ljubljana Airport, and the terminal operation in Antalya have been certified in conformity with ISO 14001. Varna and Burgas airports
have introduced environmental management systems.
In addition, the airports in Frankfurt, Antalya, and Ljubljana are involved with the Airport Carbon Accreditation of the Airports Council International (ACI) Europe.

Procedures to monitor sustainable performance:
Since 2014, decision-relevant sustainability issues have been discussed in meetings of the Executive Board including the relevant heads of the business, service and central units, which increases their binding nature and is accompanied by an increase in significance. These include passing the
materiality matrix and program as well as awarding significant sustainability projects. The Executive Board undertakes monitoring and control of the
issues relevant to sustainability (see “Strategy, Objectives, and Organization” on www.fraport.com/en/responsibility.html).

Key opportunities and risks:
The Fraport Group has a comprehensive Risk Management System. This ensures that material risks are identified, continuously monitored, and
delimited within the framework of the existing options to an acceptable level (see “Annual Report 2016”, page 77 et seqq.).

Specific Standard Disclosures
ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
General Management Approach EC
Alongside our function of providing transport, our owners are interested in safeguarding value and income over the long term, i.e., sustainable
corporate development. We want to continuously increase the assets of Fraport, generate a reasonable return on shareholders' equity, and generate
the financial means that are necessary for financing future development. Target attainment is measured by various indicators such as value added,
ROFRA (Return on Fraport Assets), revenue, and the result. Fraport plans and controls the development of the Group in accordance with the principles
of value-based management since 2001 with the objective of bringing about a sustainable increase in corporate value. The key measurement and
steering figure of this strategy is the “Fraport value added”, which is calculated as the difference between adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest
and taxes) – added to the result of the Group companies valued at-equity before taxes) and the company’s capital costs (Fraport assets x cost of
capital) (for further information see Annual Report 2016, page 34 et seqq.).
The highest level in the organization that takes responsibility for the economic performance is the Chief Financial officer (CFO).
The Fraport Group has a comprehensive Risk Management System. This ensures that material risks are identified, continuously monitored, and
delimited within the framework of the existing options to an acceptable level (see Annual Report 2016, page 78 et seqq).
The following GRI aspects were defined as material: Economic performance, market presence, and indirect economic impacts (see “Materiality
matrix” in “2016 Compact”, page 27 and G4-27 Key topics raised through stakeholder engagement, page 36).
Objectives and measures can be found in “Our program” in “2016 Compact”, page 30 et seqq. Also refer to “Growth and development in the
Group” in “2016 Compact”, p. 46 et seqq.

Material Aspect: Economic Performance – Management Approach
The section “Economic Report” in the management report of the 2016 Annual Report includes information on business development in 2016 (see
Annual Report 2016, page 48 et seqq.). Information on the risks and opportunities of the company are explained in the risk and opportunities report
of the Annual Report 2016, page 77 et seqq.
For information on the economic performance of the Group, see also “Economic Efficiency” in the “2016 Compact” report, page 44 et seq.

G4-EC1 Direct economic value generated and distributed
See Key Figures Finance, page 4.

G4-EC2 Financial implications, risks, and opportunities due to climate change
The Fraport Group has a comprehensive Group-wide risk and opportunity management system to identify, control, and limit risks and detect opportunities. The reference time frame is the rolling 24-month period. As a result of the longer time frames for climate change and the characteristics,
the risk and opportunities view is conducted within the environmental management system.
It can currently not be determined that the changes in existing rules initiated by climate change will involve changes to existing business processes
associated with significant costs. Global regulation that could massively affect the predicted growth of global aviation traffic is rather unlikely as it
would be accompanied by restrictions for individual and complete national economies. Annual global growth rates of between 4.5 % and 5.0 % are
expected through 2035. The expansion measures at Frankfurt Airport and Group airports create sufficient capacity to meet the rising traffic growth.

41

GRI Report 2016

GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

Frankfurt Airport is less susceptible to potential restrictions to aviation on shorter routes from national regulations, as it has a high share of medium
and long-distance flights. These cannot be replaced by other means of transport. Compared with short routes, they are more profitable and have
a better environmental balance. Fraport continues to work proactively toward reducing emissions by collecting emissions-based airport charges
as this gives airlines an incentive to use modern aircraft with lower emissions. At Frankfurt Airport, around two-fifths of goods are transported in
passenger aircraft. This advantage is of strategic importance against the background of the debate on energy efficiency, and it makes a significant
contribution to the high profitability of the site.
There are no discernible risks from changes to the physical climate parameters that have a material influence on the company. For Frankfurt Airport
there are meteorological figures for a long period of time and these are recorded on a daily basis. These indicators are analyzed periodically in order
to undertake the necessary changes to the airport infrastructure or existing business processes in good time. The capacity of drainage and volumes
in the rainwater retention basins are checked and taken into account when planning new infrastructure. Fraport uses a variety of measures to prepare
for extreme weather events. One of these is expanding the winter service facilities and their employees. Potential increases in energy consumption
from climate change are countered at an early stage by reducing consumption in existing buildings using construction and organizational measures.
Energy monitoring checks this.
Tighter regulatory requirements due to climate change can also be seen as an opportunity. The development of the energy efficiency requirements,
for example, supports the operational efforts to reduce energy consumption as well as the emissions and costs associated with this. The standards
are met by measures in existing and new buildings. For example, the new head office is certified by DGNB for reducing life-cycle costs via energy
savings and selecting easily reusable materials. Fraport expects increasing requirements for the energy efficiency of the vehicles and equipment used
on a daily basis, so we are gradually converting our fleet.
Physical opportunities exist in the predicted trend of global warming. For example, Fraport could benefit from the expected increase in average
temperatures during the winter months by being able to reduce the cost (resources, personnel, costs) of clearing the site, aprons, and runways.
This could also apply to aircraft de-icing. In addition, this would reduce the energy consumed in the terminals and administration buildings during
the winter months and therefore lower CO2 emissions and costs.
Since 2006, Fraport has regularly reported to CDP. Further information: https://www.cdp.net/en/responses?utf8=%E2%9C%93&queries%5Bname%5D=fraport

G4-EC4 Significant financial assistance received from government
Fraport has not received any government grants and subsidies. Fraport AG is a joint-stock company under German law. The shares are listed on the
Frankfurt Stock Exchange and are included in the MDAX, the index for mid-sized German joint-stock companies. On account of the share held by
the State of Hesse and Stadtwerke Frankfurt am Main Holding GmbH, and the consortium agreement between these two companies, Fraport AG is
a company controlled by these shareholders (see “Annual Report 2016”, page 38 et seq. and Key Figures Finance, page 5).

Material Aspect: Market Presence – Management Approach
The Fraport Group is among the leading global airport groups with its international portfolio. Fraport provides all airport and terminal operation
services and associated services. Fraport also provides planning and consultancy services and has operational and administrative activities. In addition
to the Frankfurt site, at the time of publication of the report Fraport was active at 13 other airports. Refer to “Situation of the Group”, Annual Report
2016, page 27 et seqq. as well as Visual Factbook in the Investor Relations/Publications areas on www.fraport.com.

G4-EC5 Ratios of standard entry level wage compared to local minimum wage
Frankfurt Airport is defined as a significant business site, as just under 92 % of the employees in the Group work at this site. There are collective
bargaining agreements in 98.7 % of all Group companies. These significantly exceed the local minimum wage standards. In accordance with the
collective bargaining agreement for public service workers, no gender-specific criteria may be taken into account when assessing activities. Criteria
such as knowledge and skills, responsibility, level of difficulty of the activity, or management responsibility must form the basis for assessment. Only
the actual job is assessed and not the person who is carrying out the activity.

G4-EC6 Hirings from the local community
Frankfurt Airport is defined as a significant business site, as just under 92 % of the employees in the Group work at this site. Fraport has no corporate
policy covering the entire organization and does not implement a procedure for preferring local residents in recruitment. In foreign subsidiary companies, employees from within the country are generally employed on account of the specifics of the business. Only a small number of managers
are seconded from the parent company.

Material Aspect: Indirect Economic Impacts – Management Approach
Airports are important business locations and contribute directly and indirectly to economic and social value creation. Frankfurt Airport, for example, with approximately 81,000 direct employees, is the largest local place of work in Germany. Additional employment effects are also created in
enterprises that are appointed by Fraport for the construction and modernization of airport infrastructures. The approx. 5.4 million people who live
in the metropolitan region around the airport benefit from this.
In this context, Fraport contributes comprehensively to social value generation. The company’s direct value generation includes expenses for
personnel, capital expenditure, tax, interest, and dividends to its shareholders. Over the past fiscal year, the corporate performance amounted to
more than €2.9 billion. The direct value added amounted to around €2.1 billion. The company’s indirect value generation includes consumption by
airport employees and the companies located at the airport who also have their own value chain and employment effects (see “Value generation
and engagement in the region” in “2016 Compact”, page 66 et seqq.).

G4-EC7 Infrastructure investments and services for public benefit
As an operator of the German airport with the biggest volume of traffic, we have a particular commitment to the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main region. We
have a strong track record over many years of contributing to a wide variety of sporting, social, cultural, and environmental activities. These include
donations and sponsorship for numerous clubs, cultural activities, charitable organizations, and educational institutions. For further information
(including on the effects of the support) see “Community” in “2016 Compact”, page 63 et seqq.
You will find an overview of the expenditure for donations, sponsorship, and the Environmental Fund under “G4-EC8 Community engagement”, page 7.
An investigation into the needs of the community in order to establish the specific packages required was not carried out during the reporting period.
Our employees at international Group sites are also involved. Also refer to the “2016 Compact” report, page 35.

G4-EC8 Indirect economic impacts
Frankfurt Airport is an important economic factor for the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main region. Thanks to its central location and the link with the airport,
this region has been transformed into one of the most sought-after, dynamic and most highly integrated international economic zones in Europe.
A workforce of some 81,000 employees (as of 2015) makes the airport Germany’s biggest workplace.
Around 68 % (€566 million) of the order volume from the parent company totaling €833 million was placed with companies in the Frankfurt/RhineMain Region. More than 91 % of all awarded orders were below €10,000 and were therefore to the particular advantage of small and medium-sized
companies. In 2017, orders to companies in the region are expected to remain at a similarly high level. This is complemented by the economic
power of some 500 companies based at the airport. The tax volume generated by the “Airport corporate complex” contributed to financing public
services such as schools, sports facilities, hospitals, universities, and social services. Also refer to http://www.fraport.de/de/konzern/flughafen-undregion/wirtschaftsfaktor-flughafen.html.
The airport is also important for the entire Federal Republic of Germany because the German economy is mainly dependent on exports. Many
companies rely on short delivery times and fast turnover of goods in order to be in a position to operate successfully in global markets for sourcing
and sales. Air traffic is a necessary prerequisite for this. Frankfurt Airport plays a crucial role for Germany in this respect.

Relevant Aspect: Procurement
G4-EC9 Proportion of spending on local suppliers at significant locations of operations
Frankfurt Airport is defined as a significant location of operation and the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region is defined as local. Around 68 % (€566 million)
of the order volume from the parent company totaling €833 million was placed with companies in the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region. On account
of the legal requirements for the airport operator as a sector contracting entity, it is not possible for Fraport AG to show preference to companies
located in the immediate vicinity or within the wider area when awarding contracts.

ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
General Management Approach EN
Environmental management at Frankfurt Airport has been validated in conformity with the European Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS)
since 1999. Our airport was the second in Germany to open its doors to the critical scrutiny of independent experts – and this validation process has
been repeated each year. Since 2002, we have also received certification under the international environmental standard ISO 14001. Environmental
management systems exist at all other majority-owned airports. The sites in Antalya, Lima, and Ljubljana are also certified to ISO 14001 (see http://
www.fraport.com/en/responsibility/at-a-glance/corporate-values-and-policies/certificates.html).
The key areas of activity are noise abatement, climate protection and the conservation of nature and resources. This includes energy efficiency,
minimization of waste, air pollutants and emissions, as well as the preservation of biodiversity (see “Materiality matrix” in “2016 Compact”, page 27
and G4-27 Key topics raised through stakeholder engagement, page 36 et seq.).
The (components of the) management approaches on the material Aspects are described in detail in the Environmental Statement 2014, pages
6–48 and pages 49–57 (see the Publications/Environmental Statements section on www.fraport.com/responsibility).
The management approach is assessed via Article 18 (tasks of the environmental assessor) and Article 25 (conditions for assessment and validation)
of the EMAS REGULATIONS (EU) No. 1221/2009 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL dated November 25, 2009.
The key effects were determined using the process of environmental auditing stated in Note I, EMAS REGULATIONS (EU) No. 1221/2009 OF THE
EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL dated November 25, 2009.
Targets and measures are listed in “Our program”, in “2016 Compact”, page 30 et seqq. and in Climate protection (“2016 Compact”, page 80 et
seqq.) as well as in Conservation of nature and resources.
Information on the organizational responsibility, monitoring and tracking, and the central opportunities and risks are listed under G4-56 Values,
principles, and standards of behavior, page 38 et seqq.
The central unit, Corporate Development, Environment and Sustainability, is responsible for the training and education of employees, environmental
auditors, and managers on environmental issues. The training courses required by law relating to hazardous goods transport and radiation protection
are the responsibility of the Occupational Health and Safety unit (reports directly to the Executive Director Labor Relations), see Environmental Statement 2014, Environment policy, page 6, in the Publications/Environmental Statements section on http://www.fraport.com/en/responsibility.html.
The environmental key figures for the Fraport parent company are audited and verified in accordance with EMAS via an external environmental assessor. The assessment of the standards, methods, assumptions, and factors is part of this verification process. The environmental key figures of the
Fraport Group companies are determined using comparable standards and methods. When calculating CO2, country-typical factors are used or are
replaced by factors from the most recent DEFRA set (see http://www.ukconversionfactorscarbonsmart.co.uk/). The “Group” scope of consolidation
in 2016 comprises the Fraport parent company and the fully consolidated investments with significant environmental effects (see page 8).

Material Aspect: Energy – Management Approach
Our environmental management covers the Aspect of energy efficiency, among others (see General Management Approach EN, page 45).

G4-EN6 Reduction of energy consumption
See G4-EN6 Reduction of energy consumption, page 10.
Since 2013, Fraport has gradually been introducing CO2/energy consumption controlling at the Frankfurt site. This is a controlling tool for measuring and managing energy consumption. It creates transparency, helps to reduce energy costs and hence to improve energy efficiency. This tool
enables us to monitor whether the strategic CO2 targets are being attained and to identify irregularities an early stage. At the same time, CO2/
energy consumption controlling facilitates the reduction of equipment usage and allows successes in implementation to be communicated within
the company and in the public domain. The database is provided by the energy consumption data recorded in a highly nuanced approach for
the parent company on buildings, systems, or equipment. All energy sources, such as electricity, district cooling, district heating, gas, and fuel for
vehicles and combustion are taken into account. Planning and construction based on life-cycle cost is implemented when portfolio buildings are
refurbished and energy efficiency is enhanced. This is also the case for new buildings.
The strategic networking of the airport with other carriers, also called intermodality, has a long track record at Fraport extending back to the 1970s.
For example, in 2016, 27 % of all passengers used the train (ICE, long-distance and regional trains, or metropolitan railway) to travel to and from the
airport. If other public transport and buses are included, the share was 34 %. At Fraport AG and in the Group it was even just under 40 %. Fraport
is working together with German Rail (DB) and Deutsche Lufthansa AG to maintain and improve the use of public transport by passengers, with
measures such as integrated travel packages and the inclusion of air traffic in the network planning of German Rail. Fraport employees are motivated
to use public transport with a free job ticket. In 2016, 30 % of employees used local public transport (metropolitan railway, regional railway, and
bus). Journeys by passengers and employees to and from the airport are not the only trips to “go by rail”. Plans are also being made to transfer
cargo from road to rail.
We are also optimizing the air freight logistics chain at Cargo City from environmental and commercial perspectives. In recent years, we have created
or initiated various projects such as founding the Air Cargo Community Frankfurt e. V. and introducing the IT platform Fair@Link (project developer:
Dakosy AG, Hamburg). This is the basis on which we define and establish the rules of cooperation that should lead to the freight up and downline
being more coordinated and therefore running more smoothly than is currently the case and avoiding backlogs.

AO4 Quality of rain water
See “AO4 Quality of rain water”, page 10.
There are indicators for the rain water which correspond to the statutory values specified by the City of Frankfurt. Compliance with these values is
regularly monitored by government agencies.
The data are collected by the parent company; no records are kept for the international investments included under IFRS.

Material Aspect: Biodiversity – Management Approach
Our business activities and natural biodiversity can be harmonized. Areas that are close to nature and their inherent biodiversity are preserved and
supported as far as this is possible within the operational constraints. Any impairments are kept as restricted as possible. Where substantial impacts
occur, at least equal mitigation or equivalent replacement is carried out and we ensure long-term preservation of function. Fraport has made a commitment to long-term preservation of biodiversity at Frankfurt Airport and has also decided to support projects beyond the confines of the Airport
relating to the preservation of biological diversity in the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main region and in Hesse through its Environmental Fund. For example,
the orchard meadows in the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main region are particularly worthy of protection. Orchard meadows in the State of Hesse have been
reduced by around 90 % over the past 30 years. The orchard meadows have a high level of species diversity and therefore play an important role in
retaining regional biodiversity. The Hesse Society for Ornithology and Nature Conservation (HGON) (“http://www.hgon.de/vor-ort/hgon-vor-ort/
unsere-arbeitskreise/frankfurt-am-main/”) in Frankfurt uses the financial support from Fraport to preserve valuable biotopes.
Our “Principles for biodiversity” presented here (in the environmental policy of Fraport AG and in “Protect environment – maintain biodiversity”
in the Publications/Sustainability Reports section on http://www.fraport.com/en/responsibility.html) describe our responsibility for this important
range of subjects, and document biodiversity projects at the airport and in the region that we conduct ourselves or support financially. International
agreements for the protection of biodiversity, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), European directives, such as the Habitats
Directive and the Birds Directive, and national legislation such as the Federal Nature Conservation Act, are important foundations in conjunction
with the actions taken in our valuable areas of nature.
More information can be found in our principles for biodiversity (see “Protect environment – Maintain biodiversity” in the Publications/Sustainability
Reports section on http://www.fraport.com/en/responsibility.html).
The activities of Fraport AG and its subsidiaries do not generally entail any hazards for endangered species of plants or animals. Hazards of this nature
only occur when the operational areas are expanded. In the European Union, an Environment Impact Assessment has to be carried out when this
occurs and appropriate mitigation or replacement measures have to be implemented.
Species on Germany’s Red List of endangered species exist at Frankfurt Airport. Plants and animals which are endangered at other locations have settled
on the areas between the takeoff and landing runways or the taxiways due to the usage pattern. These areas of land in the operating areas very seldom
experience human activity, and the kind of visitor pressure seen in nature conservation areas accessible to the general public does not occur here.
The Group airports outside of Germany are generally financed through international banks. An Environmental Management Plan has to be submitted
which is generally based on an Environmental Impact Assessment and defines how the consequences of intervention can be minimized. No species
on the relevant Red Lists of endangered species are registered by the Group airports.
Fraport AG developed a Wildlife Risk Management Program to protect against biological risks for air traffic and the impact of the airport operations
on wildlife.

Collisions with individual large birds or flocks of birds are a hazard for aircraft. Because, statistically, around two thirds of all bird strikes take place at
airports or neighboring areas, as an airport operator Fraport is also obliged to minimize this risk. In contrast to many international airports, in Frankfurt we focus on special biotope management. This concerns making the Airport area unattractive to relevant animals, i.e., minimizing or avoiding
nesting, resting, and feeding opportunities. The bird strike rate, which is based on verified reports to the Deutsche Ausschuss zur Verhütung von
Vogelschlägen im Luftverkehr (Committee for the Prevention of Bird Strikes in Aviation – DAVVL), was between two and five cases per 10,000 flight
movements in recent years.
Within the airport site, the areas between the two newly constructed aprons and the new runway were developed as nutrient-poor grassland (approx. 85 ha) and dwarf shrub heathland (approx. 132 ha). To achieve this, local seeds were collected on the airport site and the nearby area and
planted on these areas. In addition, the implementation of the sandy grassland and sandy meadows from the former Kelsterbach substation to free
areas in Kelsterbach Wood (approx. 2 ha) was successful and the biotopes with the protected maiden pinks and dwarf everlasting flowers are also
developing positively.

area on http://www.fraport.com/en/responsibility.html.

G4-EN11 Sites in, or adjacent to, protected areas
A total area of owned land amounting to 22.84 km² and an operational area of 18.60 km² within that area means that our airport in Frankfurt/Main
is one of the most compact major airports in the world. By making optimum use of our operational area, we contribute to keeping the utilization
of natural areas in the densely populated Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region as low as possible. Unoccupied areas at the airport are landscaped wherever
possible. Environmentally valuable areas are located in the areas bordering takeoff runway 18 (west) with species-rich extensive meadowland,
nutrient-poor grassland, sandy grassland adapted to dry habitats, and calluna (heather) heathland.
The areas between the south and center runways measure approximately 600 ha and they are arguably the biggest area of green space in the region
which is not used for agriculture. Apart from a substantial proportion of land of “minor biological value” (primarily sealed under road surfaces), the
airport has large areas of land which are used by animals and plants as habitats. Smaller species of at-risk birds, such as Eurasian skylarks, wheatears,
European stonechats, or whinchats, can be regularly found there, and in spring natterjack toads and populations of frogs can also be seen.
The precise details can be found at G4-EN11 Sites in, or adjacent to, protected areas, page 11.
Also refer to “Conservation of nature and resources” in “2016 Compact”, page 82 et seq.
Also refer to “Conservation of Nature and Resources” in the Dimensions/Environment area and “Environmental Funds” in the Dimensions/Community
area on http://www.fraport.com/en/responsibility.html.

G4-EN12 Impacts on biodiversity
The environmental impact audit at Frankfurt Airport verified that overall no sustainable negative impacts were caused to directly adjacent conservation
areas. This has been verified since 2010 during the course of monitoring biotopes and species (see “List of areas with measures” in the “Publications/
Sustainability Reports” section on http://www.fraport.com/en/responsibility.html).

G4-EN13 Habitats protected or restored
When construction work is carried out at the airport, the objective is to have minimum impact on the natural environment and the landscape.
However, if areas of land have to be developed, mitigation measures are necessary. That said, the extensive and comprehensive environmental measures achieve more than simple compensation (see “List of areas with measures” in the “Publications/Sustainability Reports” section on
http://www.fraport.com/en/responsibility.html). Regular monitoring of fauna and flora is a constituent element of the plan approval notice and is
outsourced to an external agency.

Material Aspects: Emissions, Effluents, and Waste – Management Approach
Environmental management at Frankfurt Airport has been validated in conformity with the European Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS)
since 1999. Our Group majority-owned airports have established environmental management systems that systematically record emissions, effluents, and waste. In Antalya, Lima, and Ljubljana the management systems are also certified to ISO 14001 (see Management Approach EN, page 45).
Since 2008, Fraport has combined all climate protection activities and focused on three fields: Energy-efficiency measures in existing buildings and
infrastructure, the efficient use of energy in new buildings, and the reduction of energy consumption in the Company’s fleet. Comprehensive CO2/
energy consumption controlling is used to check all measures directed toward climate protection. Fraport AG has received international recognition
for its climate protection activities: In 2016, the airport operator again achieved the third out of four certification levels of Airport Carbon Accreditation awarded by ACI Europe, the umbrella organization for airport operators. Since 2006, Fraport has been contributing its climate reporting to
the “Carbon Disclosure Project” (CDP), the world’s leading climate reporting initiative in the financial industry. In the Climate Disclosure Scoring, in
2015, Fraport improved over the previous year by three points to 98 out of 100 points. In 2016, the assessment fundamentally changed and is now
divided into five categories. Fraport was awarded the assessment level C “Awareness”. This level of assessment indicates that Fraport AG is aware of
and dealing with the impacts of its business activities on climate change.
The air pollutants and emissions are calculated or, since 2002, continuously measured at two dedicated stations. Measures for reduction are implemented: Collection of emissions-dependent airport charges based on nitrous gases and hydrocarbons, use of alternative drive technologies by
introducing electrically driven ground handling devices. In addition, methods of calculating air pollutant emissions from infrastructure and aircraft
handling were also developed.
At the Fraport parent company, the rain water falling in winter is contaminated with biologically degradable de-icing agents for the aircraft and
airfield surfaces when snow falls or frost occurs. Rain water with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 200 mg of oxygen per liter is retained and
treated in water-treatment plants.
The principle of Fraport’s waste management is to recycle or reuse unavoidable waste as far as possible. Frankfurt Airport separates non-hazardous
waste including paper, glass, packaging waste (DSD green-dot waste), and residual waste. The collected waste is either fed into advanced sorting
systems where any contaminants are separated out, and the recyclable materials are then conveyed to the recycling plant or the recently modernized waste to energy plant operated by the City of Frankfurt. The steam generated here by combustion is used for the production of electricity
and district heating. The hazardous waste created at Fraport is also collected separately and channeled away for recycling as far as possible. Where
there is no recycling option, the waste is thermally processed in a special combustion system or disposed of in a physicochemical treatment facility.
For further information on reductions of emissions, effluents, and waste, see “2016 Compact”, page 82 et seq.
The air pollutant emissions are recorded in the “Environmental Impact, Noise and Air Quality” team of the strategic business unit Airside and Terminal Management, Corporate Safety and Security. The CO2 emissions are surveyed and monitored in the Environmental Management department.
Environmental Management is located in the Corporate Development, Environment and Sustainability central unit, whereas the operational management of effluents is in the Integrated Facility Management service unit. At the Fraport parent company, a dedicated Waste Disposal department
carries out this management function.
For further information, see Environmental Statement 2014, Organizational chart page 4, Air pollutants page 27–29, Effluents page 37– 38, Waste

G4-EN17 Other indirect greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 3)
See G4-EN17 Other indirect greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 3), page 12.
Air traffic in the landing and takeoff cycle up to an altitude of 3,000 ft generates the greatest emissions (around 936 thousand metric tons of CO2).
This is followed by the transport of originating passengers to and from the airport (around 173 thousand metric tons of CO2), and the energy consumption by infrastructure and vehicles operated by third parties at the site (approximately 174 thousand metric tons), Fraport AG and third party
employee transport to the airport at 115 thousand metric tons of CO2, and by the business journeys carried out by staff members at Fraport AG
(approximately 0.8 thousand metric tons of CO2). The airport charges based on NOx emissions also have an indirect impact on the emissions of
air traffic. The unique intermodal link to the local metropolitan rail network and the national long-distance transport by regional and long-distance
trains means that passengers can be conveniently transferred from private transport and short-haul flights to rail travel. Energy marketing by a Fraport
subsidiary and selective stakeholder engagement have an impact on the CO2 emissions of third parties. Business trips are essentially necessary
through air travel to our investments.
As part of the participation in the ACI Airport Carbon Accreditation, CO2 emissions for Scope 3 were also determined at Antalya and Ljubljana airports.
Further information can be found in the Environmental Statement 2014, Environmental Aspect climate gases, page 15 et seqq. (See Publications/
Environmental Statements area on http://www.fraport.com/en/responsibility.html).

See G4-EN15 Direct greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1) and G4-EN16 Energy indirect greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 2), page 12.

G4-EN19 Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions
Climate protection is one of the most important challenges for the air-traffic industry. As an airport operator, we support the four-pillar strategy of
the air-traffic industry with measures for climate protection in air traffic. In this context, we focus our efforts on areas which we are able to directly
influence. These essentially relate to technical improvements in buildings and installations, process optimizations and economic tools such as airport
charges relating to noise and emissions (see “2016 Compact”, page 80 et seq.).
Furthermore, Fraport supports a number of industry-wide initiatives which are directed at reducing CO2 emissions. Fraport is involved in SESAR
(Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research), an initiative by the European Commission and EUROCONTROL, which is intended to secure
the future viability of European air traffic management with the involvement of all the players involved in air traffic. The various action plans within
the scope of this initiative include integrated planning of flights, i.e., all the players involved are working to optimize the process from undocking
the aircraft to reaching the target destination. This means that airports also become important players in air traffic management. The benefits for
passengers and the environment: shorter flight times and reduced emissions. The targets of SESAR to 2020 comprise increasing capacities threefold
since 2005, reducing CO2 emissions per flight by 10 %, increasing safety tenfold, and reducing air safety costs by half (http://www.sesarju.eu/).
As a member of the Air Transport Action Group (ATAG) through ACI, the global association of companies involved in air traffic, Fraport supports
their targets: Reduction of CO2 by 1.5 % per year by 2020 and carbon-neutral growth by 2050. This means a reduction in CO2 emissions in 2050 by
50 % compared with 2005 throughout the entire industry (http://www.atag.org/). At the end of 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO) resolved to introduce and design a market-based global climate-protection instrument (GMBM) to set the course for further progress in
climate protection in air traffic.
Fraport participates in Airport Carbon Accreditation, a program of ACI, with the objective of persuading the maximum number of European airports
to adopt CO₂-neutral operation. Frankfurt Airport was the first airport to be audited in accordance with the rules of Airport Carbon Accreditation
and it was accepted into the program in 2009. The highest level of 3+ can be reached in four stages. Fraport has reached Level 3 “Optimization”.
Stakeholder engagement is a key element of this stage. Our investment, Antalya Airport, has also reached Level 3+ “Neutrality”. In 2015, Ljubljana
Airport achieved Level 2 “Reduction” by appropriate measures.

Fraport also contributes its climate reporting externally to the “Carbon Disclosure Project” (CDP) (www.cdp.net), the world’s leading climate reporting initiative in the financial industry. This index analyzes companies and their strategies on climate change and CO2 reporting. Since 2006, Fraport
has been involved in CDP and, in 2015, it improved its Climate Disclosure Scoring by three points compared with the previous year to 98 out of
100 points. In 2016, the assessment fundamentally changed and is now divided into five categories. Fraport was awarded the assessment level C
“Awareness”. This level of assessment indicates that Fraport AG is aware of and dealing with the impacts of its business activities on climate change.

Fraport AG emits approximately the following amounts each year
NOX: 264 metric tons
Benzene: 0.4 metric tons
PM10: 9.3 metric tons
These data are derived from the zoning plan documents. Determining the data was extremely complex and expensive so that this procedure has
not been repeated again. In future, the data are to be subject to continuous reporting and the necessary processes are currently being put in place.
We are unable to influence other air emissions with our measures and they are therefore not significant.
As the data collection for vehicle and other emissions from handling processes at an airport are very complex and therefore costly, these are not
conducted for the Group airports.

Material Aspect: Products and services – Management Approach
Our commitment to environmental protection and environmental compatibility is directed toward maintaining our natural habitats.
The focus of our actions is provided by measures to avoid, reduce, and mitigate environmental impacts that arise or could arise as a result of
airport operations. Our environmental management focuses on the areas of noise abatement, climate protection, and biodiversity. As part of our
program, we have set strategic goals (see “2016 Compact”, page 30 et seqq.) and track these with various measures and projects, e.g., for climate protection (see report “2016 Compact”, page 80 et seqq. and “Climate Protection” in the Dimensions/Environment section of our website
http://www.fraport.com/en/responsibility.html), on maintaining and supporting biodiversity (“Protect environment – Maintain biodiversity”) and as
part of our global environmental management (see Environmental Statement 2014, page 6, in the Publications/Environmental Statements section on
http://www.fraport.com/en/responsibility.html). We are also continuing our efforts on noise abatement.
See also General Management Approach EN, page 45.

G4-EN27 Initiatives to mitigate environmental impacts
Since the end of 2013, there has been a returns system for bottles and cans with refundable deposit in both terminals at Frankfurt Airport. Following
a successful test run, a total of 24 returnables machines came on stream. The amount for the deposit is donated to four charitable institutions. The
guest decides for themselves which organization benefits from the donation.
Our environmental management focuses on the areas of noise abatement, climate protection, and biodiversity.
As part of our program, we have set strategic goals (see “2016 Compact”, page 30 et seqq.) and track these with various measures and projects, e.g.,
for climate protection (see “2016 Compact” report, page 80 et seq. and in the Dimensions/Environment ”Climate Protection“ section on our website

Relevant Aspect: Compliance
G4-EN29 Fines and sanctions for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations
At Fraport AG there are no breaches of statutory regulations which have been subject to fines or non-monetary sanctions imposed by the authorities.
The investments also reported no infringements.

Material Aspect: Transport – Management Approach
Networking with other transport providers – called intermodality – is required to generate additional traffic volumes in competition with other
airports. At the same time, short-haul flights can be shifted to the railways. The strategic networking of the airport with other carriers has a long
track record at Fraport extending back to the 1970s. At that time, the first underground station at a German airport was opened under the newly
constructed Terminal 1 – today this is the airport regional station. When the AIRail Terminal was opened in 1999, the link was created to the national
and international long-distance rail network. ICE traffic as a percentage of total traffic for arriving and departing passengers rose from 3 % in 1999
to 11.3 % in 2016. In 2016, 27 % of arriving and departing originating passengers used the railway to and from the airport (metropolitan railway,
regional trains, regional express, ICE, IC, long-distance trains). If buses are included, the share was 34 % in 2016, whereas this was only 23.6 % in 1999.
Most public transport at our other airports where we hold a majority shareholding is provided by the use of buses.
Indicators on intermodality are included under the transport aspect, page 15.

G4-EN30 Significant environmental impacts of transport and traffic
The strategic networking of the airport with other carriers – also known as intermodality – has a long track record back to the 1970s with Fraport
(see Environmental Statement 2014, Environmental Aspect transport, page 24 et seqq. in the Publications/Environmental Statements section on
http://www.fraport.com/en/responsibility.html).
A list of indicators is provided under “G4-EN30 Significant environmental impacts of transport and traffic”, page 15.
The CO2 emissions caused by traffic on the airport complex are reported for the Fraport parent company and the Group under “G4-EN15 Direct
greenhouse gas emissions”, page 12 and “G4-EN16 Energy indirect greenhouse gas emissions”, page 12. The emissions of air pollutants can be
found under “G4-EN21 NOx, SOx and other significant air emissions”, page 51.

Aspect: Intermodality (Airport Operators Sector Disclosures)
Information on intermodality was reported under the previous aspect “Transport”. Fraport is working to make the airport accessible to as many
passengers and employees as possible with public transport by networking with other carriers – also known as intermodality. We are working very
closely with other carriers to achieve this objective. For example, in 2016, 27 % of all originating passengers used the train to travel to and from the
airport. If buses are also included, the share was 34 %. Fraport employees are motivated to use public transport with a free job ticket. In 2016, 30 %
of employees used local public transport (metropolitan and regional rail and public buses).
We are also optimizing the air freight logistics chain at Cargo City from environmental and commercial perspectives. Making traffic flow in and around
the airport efficient whilst having the lowest possible impact on the environment requires increasing coordination of the processes with all participants – cargo lines, freight forwarders, handling agents, customs, etc. Fraport has also launched a pilot project with a number of partners directed
toward developing an IT-based Cargo Community System. In 2011, the transport flows were analyzed with a view to the potential for optimization,
and the pilot project with full routine, everyday operation was started up at the beginning of 2012 (see Environmental Statement 2011, page 23 et
seqq., Publications/Environmental Statements section on http://www.fraport.com/en/responsibility.html). With the introduction of the FAIR@Link
Cargo Community System, we at Frankfurt Airport have taken a big step towards the digitization of processes. The data platform enables its users to
exchange cargo data across the company. Government agencies are also linked to the system. This makes us a world leader. Thanks to FAIR@Link,
we have been able to simplify interfaces and improve processes.
Most public transport at our other airports where we hold a majority shareholding is provided by the use of buses.

Fraport has already taken responsibility for introducing noise-related landing and takeoff charges at Frankfurt Airport in 1993. Up to the year 2000,
noise differentiation was based on the noise values in the noise authorization documents provided with aircraft. In 2001, the noise differentiation was
converted to type-specific noise values determined by the aircraft noise measurement system operating at Frankfurt Airport. Since then, the differentiation and the range of charges have been gradually increased. Since January 2017, the aircraft types have been divided into 15 noise categories
and these categories have been managed separately for landing and takeoff. The spread of noise classes is particularly noticeable at night because
night movements must pay a night surcharge. This is even higher during the core night period (11 p.m. – 4.59 a.m.) than during marginal nighttime
periods (10 p.m. – 10.59 p.m. and 5 a.m. – 5.59 a.m.). Night surcharges are intended to create an economic incentive for the deployment of quieter
aircraft and to transfer aircraft movements from the night-time period to the day. According to the currently applicable charging rules for Frankfurt
Airport, on average 1.9 % higher takeoff and landing charges must be paid than under the previous rules. The increase was exclusively due to the
noise charges, whose share of the charges rose from 14 percent to 16 percent. An incentive scheme for movements with aircraft that can use the
GBAS satellite navigation system, which enables the use of new noise-reducing precision flight procedures, was also introduced.
Even before the new Runway Northwest came into operation, flight procedures for reducing noise were being developed and tested. Since founding
the Airport and Region Forum (FFR), a committee of experts located there with representatives from local communities, airlines, air traffic control,
the airport (Fraport AG), politics, and science have been the driving force for these active noise abatement activities.

The action plan comprised seven measures for reducing noise. These were expanded by a package of 19 measures signed on February 29, 2012
and entitled “Together for the Region – Alliance for more Noise Abatement 2012” (see “Noise abatement” on http://www.fraport.com/en/responsibility/aircraft-noise-infoservice/info-center.html).
Within the continuing collaboration in the “Active Noise Abatement” expert committee, Fraport has taken on the leadership for the design and implementation of some of these measures. One of these measures is raising the approach angle for Runway Northwest by 0.2 degrees. This measure
enlarges the overflight height above urban areas from the distance at which the beam on the instrument loading system during horizontal intermediate approach is normally reached. For the currently applicable intermediate approach height of 5,000 feet for Runway Northwest, this results in a
greater flight height at a distance of around 27 km compared with the 3.0 degree approach.
Fraport AG has equipped Runway Northwest with two instrument landing systems (ILS) per operating direction for the approach angles of 3.0 and 3.2
degrees. On approaches with a tailwind or poor weather conditions, the previous angle of 3.0 degrees should initially be retained for safety reasons.
The test operations conducted since October 2012 showed that when using the 3.2 degree approach there was neither an increased number of
go-arounds nor delays to arriving aircraft. Analyses from the German Center for Aviation and Space Travel (DLR) at a total of seven noise measurements stations of Fraport AG and by the Environment and Neighborhood House (Umwelt- und Nachbarschaftshaus (UNH)) showed a reduction in
the maximum noise level for over-flights of 0.5 – 1.5 dB (A) depending on the location of the measuring station and the aircraft type. The Federal
Ministry for Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI) has now approved permanent normal operation on Runway Northwest.
The usage rate of the 3.2-degree approach on Runway Northwest is around 70 %, meaning it is higher for operating direction 07 than for operating
direction 25 due to the combination of weather conditions and operating direction. The capital expenditure for the additional ILS systems was
€3.2 million.
In future, steeper approaches should also be possible on the “old” runways of our airport. However, this cannot be achieved in the same way as
for Runway Northwest because there is not enough space to set up the ILS systems here. Instead, we are using a completely new technology in
the form of GBAS. The abbreviation stands for ‘ground-based augmentation system’, a type of technology that facilitates satellite-based precision
approaches. Our airport, the first international hub in Europe, has implemented the new approach system. A significant advantage of the system is
that only one ground station is required for a wide variety of approaches on all runways and in both operating directions. However, for the system
to be used to its full extent, technical equipment is required on airplanes as well as on the ground. In particular, the Airbus A380, Boeing 747-8, 787,
and 737 NG currently have the relevant equipment. Following an extensive system test in cooperation with the operators of these aircraft models,
GBAS-supported approaches at 3.2 degrees will be offered on all runways from spring 2017. We have invested some €2.5 million to construct and
put the GBAS ground station into operation.
Further examples of active noise abatement measures that are currently being developed or tested include continuous climb operations (CCO) and
the development of even steeper approaches.
We are also focusing on abolishing aircraft noise at ground level. For example, reverse thrust with higher load levels, depending on dispersion
characteristics, produces noticeable noise in nearby residential areas. Reverse thrust may thus only be used at Frankfurt Airport for safety reasons.
By means of an automated monitoring program, we intend to systematically analyze the use of reverse thrust with higher load levels in order to
detect and prevent improper use. Fraport is the first airport worldwide to develop a detection system for this which is based on the coupled use of
microphone systems. Active noise abatement is supplemented by passive noise abatement measures. On the basis of the German Aircraft Noise Act,
the Hesse State Government enacted a Noise Abatement Zone Directive for Frankfurt Airport. This defines noise protection areas. Furthermore, a
comprehensive regional fund totaling some €265 million was set up to finance additional benefits providing private households and eligible public
institutions with passive noise abatement measures. Funds are also being provided from the Regional Fund so that claims for passive noise abatement
can be brought forward. This measure enables those entitled to reimbursement to submit their claims before 2016 (statutory date for claims). The
budget is provided by the State of Hesse and by Fraport. Following the entry into force of the third implementing regulation for the German Aircraft
Noise Act (3rd FlugLSV) in August 2013, the entitlement to compensation for aircraft noise-related impacts on the outdoor area of apartments and
vulnerable installations is now also regulated. An entitlement arises for properties that are within day protection zone 1 of the Airport.
We have been measuring aircraft noise around the airport for more than 50 years. Fraport currently maintains 29 measuring stations and three mobile
measuring stations. We publish the results of aircraft noise measurements and other information relating to flight operations, such as route allocations
or the use of directions in the takeoff and landing runway system, online at www.fraport.com. The measurement results also form the basis for the
calculation of noise-related takeoff and landing charges.

The FRA Map application allows internet users to create an individual image of their own aircraft noise situation on the basis of calculated aircraft
noise values. The interactive map gives access to information on diverse topics and focuses specifically on the people affected as they can enter their
home address. The “Aircraft Noise Information” function presents data related to aircraft noise in a compact form for the entered address.
In February 2017, Fraport published the most recent noise abatement report on the previous summer traffic scheduling period (2016). This report
provides information twice a year on the development of aircraft noise pollution in the region and presents progress made in terms of noise abatement at Frankfurt Airport. The number of aircraft movements was 2.5 % lower in the past summer traffic scheduling period (2016) than in the same
period in the previous year. However, continuous noise levels at most Fraport aircraft noise measurement points have not changed.
During the day, the continuous noise level rose by just under one decibel (dB) only at measuring station 12 in Bad Weilbach. This measuring station
is tasked with measuring departures on the north-west departure routes for operating direction 25. Despite the overall drop in traffic during the
day, the number of departures on these routes increased by 11 %. The reason for this: In the previous summer flight plan, storms and other adverse
weather situations, which impacted on flight operations, occurred on more days than in 2015. On these days, to evade storm fronts and prevent
delays, which could place compliance with the ban on night flights from 11 p.m. at risk, additional departures took place via the north-west departure routes. This flight plan optimization measure on days with severe weather-related fluctuations from the standard flight operations also led to an
increase in night-time departures on the north-western departure routes as well as on routes from takeoff runway 18W towards the south. This also
resulted in an increase in the continuous noise level at night by just under one dB at measuring stations 12 Bad Weilbach and 55 Büttelborn. The
measuring stations in the east, 03 Zeppelinheim, 01 Offenbach-Lauterborn, and 02 Offenbach-Bieber, which record the noise of air traffic landing on
the south and center runways for the western operation, reported an increase in the night-time continuous noise level of one dB. This is due to two
effects. Firstly, more landings occurred at night for the western operation in the 2016 summer flight plan than was the case for 2015, even though
the total share of the night-time western operation remained unchanged overall. However, there is a significant difference in the operating direction
distribution during the morning night-time hours between 5 and 6 a.m., which is characterized by arriving air traffic. In the 2015 summer flight plan,
the western operating share amounted to 67 %, while, in the same hour, the western operating share in the 2016 summer flight plan amounted to
about 72 %. A small number of shifts of arrivals from the north-west runway to the other parallel runways was also reported. As a result of the noise
intermission concept for landings for the western operation, introduced on April 23, 2015, the north-west runway was still used for night-time
landings in the first month of the 2016 summer flight plan. Both effects together led to a rise in the continuous noise level at the arrival measuring
stations for the south and center runway, while the continuous noise level at measuring station 44 Frankfurt-Lerchesberg remained unchanged.

Labor Practices and Decent Work
General Management Approach LA
Pursuant to responsible corporate governance, we have made a commitment to comply with internationally recognized standards of conduct, such
as those defined in the principles of the UN Global Compact, the OECD principles, and the ILO core labor standards. In 2013, Fraport published
two in-house codes of conduct to establish more firmly these principles within the Company. The Fraport Policy forms the overarching structure
for all commitments and the codes of the Group based on specific topic areas (see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/management/
compliance.html).
The following GRI aspects were defined as material: Employment, Labor/management relations, Occupational health and safety, Training and education, Diversity and equal opportunity, Equal remuneration for women and men (see “Materiality matrix” in “2016 Compact”, page 27 and G4-27
Key topics raised through stakeholder engagement, page 36).
We continuously develop our safety concepts on the basis of a systematic assessment of potential hazards. Alongside the technical safety of workstations, the behavior of employees and their independent sense of responsibility play an important role here. This is why Fraport carries out regular
training on occupational safety. Employees working on the apron continued to receive training sessions, which began in 2013, with practical tips
on safe driving to avoid specific accident risks. Lightning protection seminars were further events offered to this group of employees. These allowed
employees to learn about electrostatic discharges, dangers posed by thunderstorms, and corresponding protective measures. The Annual Meeting
for Safety Officers in 2015 focused on the issue of “traffic safety”. Apprentices in their first year at Fraport AG received information about occupational
health and safety on a safety day. Focal points included ergonomics and proper lifting and carrying.
Objectives and measures can be found in the program in “2016 Compact”, page 30 et seqq.

principles, and standards of behavior, page 38 et seqq.
See also “Employees” in “2016 Compact”, page 53 et seqq.

Material Aspect: Employment – Management Approach
Fraport is one of the biggest employers in the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region. In addition to the Frankfurt site, Fraport AG also operates 13 airports on
four continents in the form of majority and minority shareholdings, as well as under management contracts (see “Annual Report 2016”, page 27). As
a company operating on the global stage, we are committed to the values and standards of behavior enshrined in the principles of the UN Global
Compact, the ILO core labor standards, and the OECD principles for multinational companies. We developed a Code of Conduct in 2012 with the
aim of making the associated obligations even more transparent. This code is binding for all employees of Fraport AG. It was initially introduced at the
beginning of 2013 to the German companies controlled by the Fraport Group and was then gradually rolled out in the majority shareholdings abroad.
Country-specific adjustments were permitted and the Code was published in the relevant national language, most recently in Slovenian and Greek.
Fraport has no guiding principles and programs relating to recruitment of local personnel by airport operators and contractors, measures for reducing
the number of employees with access to the security areas of the airport, and measures which demand the loyalty of employees to the immediate
contractor.

G4-LA2 Benefits provided to full-time employees
Frankfurt Airport is defined as a significant business site, as just under 92 % of the employees in the Group work at this site. Fraport generated around
80 % of its revenue at the Frankfurt site in 2016.
Fraport offers employees a series of non-payscale benefits (see http://www.fraport.com/en/careers/working-at-fraport/rewards---benefits.html). Supplementary company social benefits are granted equally to all employees (as appropriate, pro rata in accordance with the scope of employment).
This also applies – unless a specified period of service with the Company is a prerequisite for entitlement – regardless of whether the employment is
Our material, controlled airport investments also provide non-payscale benefits. For example, Fraport Twin Star offers its employees – regardless
of their period of employment, but prorated according to their scope of employment as appropriate – additional social benefits (additional salary
components for pension schemes, food, etc.), health promotion (participation in health measures, payscale supplementary health insurance, etc.),
but also measures such as company sports, training opportunities, and the provision of public transport. Besides an increase in salaries for seasonal
employees, primarily health-related measures, such as the establishment of fitness centers at both airports, are intended for 2017.
Our Peruvian investment Lima Airport Partners is equally impressive, which was most recently demonstrated by the inclusion in the list of the best
companies in the “Great Place to Work” competition in 2016. Employees receive – regardless of their type of employment – a salary above the
national level; there is also an extensive program (“Club LAP”) of optional supplementary benefits. This program includes six categories, covering
the areas of the work-life balance, family, health, free time, and financial well-being of employees. Benefits such as increased cover for health and
life insurance, company bus transport, opportunities to take part in fitness and sporting activities, and additional days off to promote a work-life
balance are examples of what the program offers. The modules were expanded in 2016. This included the addition of online employee offers and
the opportunity for operating employees to increase the flexibility of their shifts. In 2017, the intention is to also increase the flexibility of working
hours for administrative employees.
Aerodrom Ljubljana also offers its employees various additional benefits. These include the take-over of and contribution to supplementary insurance
(pension scheme, accident insurance), the granting of time quotas and flexible working hours, social support for family events, and health promotion
in the form of preventive measures and company sports. All these benefits are granted regardless of the period of employment.

Material Aspect: Labor/Management Relations – Management Approach
Fraport has a long tradition as a company with a social perspective and a partner-centered approach. Our aim is not simply to be a big employer in
quantitative terms. We also want to be just and fair by rewarding our employees for their performance and commitment. This involves giving them
fair wages and salaries, and a package of benefits that goes beyond pay. We offer a high level of job security, good working conditions based on
collective bargaining agreements, career and personal development options, and a highly developed corporate ethic.
The operations of Fraport AG and its subsidiary companies are primarily carried out by the companies’ own employees. 98.7 % of these are employed
and paid under collective bargaining agreements. The risk of strikes that could lead to disruption of the operation of the airport is therefore extremely
low. This also includes all areas relevant to security, such as security check points, airport security, and operational safety. We are unable to exert any
influence on other contractual partners or on the customers of our airports in relation to work satisfaction.

G4-LA4 Minimum notice periods regarding significant operational changes
Fraport works closely with employee representatives in an atmosphere of trust. Pursuant to the Works Constitution Act, the Works Council must be
promptly and comprehensively informed about any changes in the business. This has not been defined in detail or restricted within the framework
of the collective agreements. A notification obligation of three months is standard business practice.
In 2016, a total of 37 meetings, one extraordinary meeting, and one constituting meeting following re-election were held by the parent company's
Works Council, while the Group Works Council held eleven ordinary and two extraordinary meetings.
Just as in Frankfurt, Fraport also ensures that employees have the basic right of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining negotiations
at international sites where Fraport has a majority shareholding. We are committed to open cooperation in an atmosphere of trust with democratically
elected employee representatives, and we use this process to work toward achieving a settlement that is fair for all interests.

Material Aspect: Occupational Health and Safety – Management Approach
Fraport aims to look after the physical, emotional, and psychosocial well-being of its employees through a range of comprehensive measures directed at promoting preventive health and safety over the long term. Another responsibility for Fraport relates to developing holistic preventive
concepts that are tailored to the specific needs of an aging workforce in general and the preservation of workers’ employability in operational areas
in particular through longer working lives.
Fraport AG responds to all health and safety risks in relation to prevention activities within the framework of behavioral and situational prevention.
Fraport’s general activities at the Frankfurt site were focused on the areas of noise, pollution and UV exposure on the apron areas as well as on the
following topics.
As has already been the case in previous years, the minimization of noise pollution by all airport employees was once again extremely important to
Fraport in the current reporting period. Various noise events are recorded and time-weighted in order to assess the noise exposure of employees.
Apart from background noise, which is especially present during continuous handling at the airport, noise is mainly analyzed where it directly impacts
on members of staff when they are carrying out their work. These individual “modules” can then be used to calculate individual stress profiles for
workplaces as well as for individual employees. This evaluation thus identifies the extent to which measures are required to reduce noise pollution.
The T-O-P hierarchy of measures is used to implement the measures. This means that the application of technical and organizational measures takes
precedence over personnel measures.
Besides minimizing noise pollution, the general pollution levels in the apron area were also measured. These measurements are intended to identify
whether and where stresses lie and, if stresses are detected, how these can be reduced. The measurements did not identify any transgressions of
the existing workplace limits. There was therefore no need for any further action.
Investigations on UV exposure for employees on the apron areas did not identify any critical exposure values. Despite this, Fraport has taken account
of the minimizing principle by providing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Employees are encouraged to wear their PPE and are
supported by instructions and on-site inspections. Thorough investigations were performed in the aircraft and baggage handling areas in Frankfurt
during the reporting period in order to improve the stress situation for employees. The aim was to systematically assess the ergonomic conditions
in the aircraft and the loading units in use and develop initiatives for improvement. In particular, the workplaces in an aircraft's hold and the existing legal conditions must be viewed in a critical light. Fraport therefore established working groups in cooperation with the accident insurers, the
legislator, and the airlines in order to develop specific, sustainable improvements for employees in the aircraft handling area.
The specific prevention activities to reduce load-intensive work for the musculoskeletal system, which were started in previous years, were continued. The use of innovative technologies should improve jobs in this respect. The vacuum lifting aid system was successfully rolled out and other
technologies have been reviewed in terms of their usability.
All hazardous substances still pass through the product assessment process at Fraport. This continuous review is intended to promote the use of
substances with a low hazard potential and minimize risks for employees.

There is a high risk of accidents on construction sites. For this reason, occupational safety measures still require the full attention of the principal
and the executing company. The Occupational Health and Safety unit provides advice for all construction projects throughout the entire period of
the project. The basis of the advice is the generally binding German Construction Site Health and Safety Regulations (Baustellenverordnung). The
occupational health and safety coordinators in the unit monitor compliance with these regulations.
Employees in the Occupational Health and Safety unit provided a range of advisory services in 2016. In addition to supporting many smaller and
medium-sized building projects, the focus was on supporting the construction of Terminal 3. Finding organizations to execute maintenance and
repair work particularly took a great deal of time, due to the size of the project.
Safety measures are agreed where Fraport works together with external companies. Causes of accidents are jointly analyzed and investigated, and
opportunities are explored to prevent and avoid accidents. To do this, the company has established effective processes in the past.
Accident trends show that we are making progress thanks to our work. For this reason, the work we started was successfully continued in 2016.
On the apron, we operate a large number of vehicles for transporting freight and people. The focus is therefore on the area of “internal transport and
traffic”. The driving safety of our personnel is therefore a top priority here in order to maintain the safety of all road users on the airport site. Fraport
therefore regularly carries out safe driving training courses as well as “refresher” courses for drivers who have infringed traffic rules. We have clear
evidence that this approach has succeeded in reducing the number of accidents causing damage within the company.
The pandemic plan/plan for protection against infectious diseases of Fraport AG regulates the measures which Fraport AG takes at the Frankfurt
Airport site in accordance with the German Protection against Infections Act if highly infectious diseases occur. The main targets are securing safe
operation of the airport in conformity with standard operating procedures and protection of customers and employees.
The responsibility assumed by Fraport for occupational health and safety is also clearly defined with regard to temporary staff. They have an equal priority
alongside permanent employees when it comes to occupational health and safety, and they go through a professional induction phase at Fraport.
We continuously develop our safety concepts on the basis of a systematic assessment of potential hazards. Alongside the technical safety of workstations, the behavior of employees and their independent sense of responsibility play an important role here. This is why Fraport carries out regular
training on occupational safety. Employees working on the apron continued to receive training sessions, which began in 2013, with practical tips
on safe driving to avoid specific accident risks. Lightning protection seminars were further events offered to this group of employees. These allowed
employees to learn about electrostatic discharges, dangers posed by thunderstorms, and corresponding protective measures. The Annual Meeting
for Safety Officers in 2016 focused on the issue of “fire protection measures“. Apprentices in their first year at Fraport AG received information about
occupational health and safety on a safety day. Focal points included ergonomics and proper lifting and carrying.
Creating positive conditions for the health of employees at Frankfurt Airport is the clear mandate of all company staff working in health and safety.
This is coordinated and planned by Fraport Health Management. Innovative concepts and tools (see “Health Management Measures 2016” on
http://www.fraport.com/en/responsibility.html in the Publications/Sustainability Reports area) aim to limit or reverse the illness rate, which is increasing overall for various reasons.
The offerings are available to employees of Fraport AG, and some are available to their families.

G4-LA5 Percentage of employees in job safety committees
Employees at Fraport AG have an opportunity to contribute to company processes in the area of occupational traffic safety. Fraport has a system of
committees in Frankfurt which focus on occupational traffic safety. Appointments to some of these committees have equal employee and employer
representation.
Fraport operates the Traffic Safety Committee as another forum. Unlike the occupational health and safety committees, this has equal employee and
employer representation from the parent company and meets at least once a month. The Traffic Safety Committee focuses primarily on increasing
traffic safety in the operational and apron areas. A representative from each of the departments is included on this committee as necessary. The
Committee analyzes a variety of different problem areas, such as reported accident events or special traffic problems. It then uses expert reports to
make recommendations on improving the relevant situation to the Company’s management.

The Fraport Job Safety Committee deals with operational issues relating to occupational safety at the parent company. The permanent members of
the Committee include representatives from the Disabled Employees Committee and the Works Council, the Senior Company Medical Officer, the
Senior Safety Expert, the Executive Director of Labor Relations, and five selected safety officers from the business units. The opinions of experts from
technical departments and experts from the affected areas are sought on defined technical issues in specific instances relating to job safety, and
environmental protection. In 2016, the Committee met four times under the chairmanship of the Executive Director of Labor Relations. Fraport also
actively participates in the further development of occupational health and safety issues in the Group.
In 2012, the Group Job Safety Committee was also introduced at Group level. The function of the Committee is to make fundamental decisions
across the Group on standardizing processes in occupational health and safety. One of the tasks of the Committee was to develop overarching
occupational safety objectives for the Group in 2016. Permanent members include the Senior Safety Expert, the Senior Company Medical Officer,
the Group Disabled Employees Committee and the Group Works Council, as well as all Executive Managers from the majority shareholdings at the
Frankfurt site. In 2016, the Job Safety Committee met twice. The Executive Director of Labor Relations also chaired these meetings.
Our Global Investments and Management (BET) business unit worked together with the Occupational Health and Safety business unit to establish
international reporting to determine key figures of relevance for occupational health and safety. This was related to the need to standardize the principles of data acquisition and the underlying definitions in the Group and to develop a common understanding in occupational health and safety.

Material Aspect: Diversity and Equal Opportunity – Management Approach
As a cosmopolitan company with an international perspective, Fraport values the diversity of its employees. Diversity enriches cooperation and
promotes innovation and creativity. This is why diversity is a strategic issue for Fraport which the Group systematically fosters in its Diversity Management program. We respect and promote personal differences and work toward ensuring that this is reflected in dealings with others. The Group
company agreement “Conduct of Partnership, Diversity and Equality at the Workplace” formed the platform for the defined key principles such as
non-discrimination and equal opportunity. From an organizational perspective, the Diversity Officer reports to the Executive Director of Labor Relations.
Diversity Management activities in 2016 (selection):
After consulting with the Works Council, at the start of 2016, the Fraport parent company presented a multi-faceted operating agreement in relation
to the objectives and the implementation of diversity, equal opportunities and the conduct of partnership. The following principles were agreed:
Respectful and partner-like conduct at the workplace, diversity, freedom from discrimination, equal opportunity, and women in management positions.
The objectives include:
>> Respectful and partner-like conduct at the workplace
>> Encouraging the appreciation of diversity
>> Equal opportunity to participate for all employees within the scope of their operating activities and enabling development opportunities based
on their individual capabilities
>> Increasing motivation and performance
>> Improving employee satisfaction, including by accepting different ways of life
The establishment of a Diversity Board, a Diversity Steering Committee headed by the Diversity Officer, was agreed in order to support the implementation of the diversity strategy and monitor compliance with the diversity objectives, among other things. The Steering Committee contains
managers from the business, service and central units. This committee will meet in 2017 for the very first time.
The Diversity Steering Committee, which is also part of this agreement, and is tasked with providing qualified and unit-specific support for the
diversity strategy as well as the objectives and measures, has now commenced its activities with representatives from the various Fraport units.
The Steering Committee and the Diversity Steering Committee are bodies associated with the Fraport parent company and its business units. The
intention is to also involve the Group companies at the Frankfurt site in the medium-term.
In the year under review, diversity management was focused on clarifying the contribution that diversity management will make to the new mission
statement as well as graphically conveying the topic of diversity and its dimensions in the corporate culture. Fair and respectful interaction with each
other and our customers is a key aim in this respect.
In 2016, Fraport once again participated in the Diversity Day and invited its managers and their teams to visit a Diversity Parcours in the foyer of the
head office. Workshops with managers as well as HR managers and officers were held to strengthen the culture of compatibility. The festival of the
Abrahamic religions was also celebrated.
Our measurable objectives in relation to women in management positions are described in ”Our program“ in the “2016 Compact” report, page 30
et seq.
More information on the topic of diversity is available online at http://www.fraport.com/en/careers/working-at-fraport/diversity.html and in the

See G4-LA12 Composition of employees, page 22 et seq.
The data have not yet been recorded by employee category. We would like to address this item over the medium term. The provision of information
on persons in governance bodies based on gender and age group and belonging to minorities is not yet possible for the Group as the data is not
available for the subsidiaries. The aim is to collect these data in future.

Material Aspect: Equal Remuneration for Women and Men – Management Approach
As an international company, Fraport encourages diversity in its workforce and acts in accordance with the principle of equality, rejecting any form
of discrimination (see the Code of Conduct for Employees of Fraport AG on www.fraport.com).
In accordance with the collective bargaining agreement for public service workers, no gender-specific criteria may be taken into account when
assessing activities. Criteria such as knowledge and skills, responsibility, level of difficulty of the activity, or management responsibility must form
the basis for assessment. Only the actual job is assessed and not the person who is carrying out the activity. Moreover, positions are usually assessed
before they are advertised.
See G4-LA13 Ratio of basic salary and remuneration of women to men, page 62.
See G4-56 Values, principles, and standards of behavior, page 38 et seqq.

G4-LA13 Ratio of basic salary and remuneration of women to men
Frankfurt Airport is defined as a significant business site, as 90  % of the employees in the Group work at this site.
In 2013, we participated in a Logib-D consultation promoted by the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth (BMFSFJ)
in order to review the actual salary data of female and male employees. After the survey and analysis of the structural data, Fraport AG (Fraport parent
company) was given formal recognition at the start of 2014 that the Company had made equal pay a key strategic issue and that it acted as a role model.

Relevant Aspect: Labor Practices Grievance Mechanisms
G4-LA16 Formal grievances about labor practices
Fraport AG did not receive any grievances about labor practices from employees or suppliers in the reporting period.

Human Rights
General Management Approach HR
Pursuant to responsible corporate governance, we have made a commitment to comply with internationally recognized standards of conduct, such
as those defined in the principles of the UN Global Compact, the OECD principles, and the ILO core labor standards. In 2013, Fraport published
two in-house codes of conduct to establish more firmly these principles within the Company. These two codes commit employees and suppliers
to comply with these fundamental principles. The Fraport Policy forms the overarching structure for all commitments and the codes of the Group
based on specific topic areas (see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/management/compliance.html).
The following GRI aspects were defined as material: Investment, equal treatment, freedom of association and collective bargaining, and assessment
(see “Materiality matrix” in “2016 Compact”, page 27 and G4-27 Key topics raised through stakeholder engagement, page 36).

The German General Act on Equal Treatment (AGG) forms a platform for our dealings with members of staff. All level 1 – 4 managers and employees
in human resources services receive regular training in relation to this legislation. Fraport has been developing special e-learning courses since 2012
with the aim of meeting increased compliance requirements. Introduction of these courses commenced in February 2013. They are intended to
support the positive Fraport values culture and assist our employees in correct behavior. They also serve to inform them about the wide range of
topics in the area of compliance.
Objectives and measures can be found in “Our program” in “2016 Compact”, page 30 et seqq. Information on organizational responsibility, monitoring and tracking, and central opportunities and risks is provided under G4-56 Values, principles, and standards of behavior, page 38 et seqq.
See also “Employees” in “2016 Compact”, page 52 et seqq., Our Group, page 16 et seqq.

Material Aspect: Investment – Management Approach
Fraport’s objective is to achieve Group-wide participation in the growth of the aviation market. By implementing capital expenditure, Fraport has
significantly increased its capacities at the Frankfurt site and beyond in recent years. Frankfurt Airport is defined as a significant location of operation.
Fraport generated around 80 % of its revenue at the Frankfurt site in 2016.
Significant factors for selection of suppliers include the principles for awarding orders based on Article 97 of the German Act against Restraints of
Competition (GWB).
Significant factors for the selection of suppliers include the following principles for awarding orders based on Article 97 GWB:
>> Competitive principle (the maximum number of bidders should be given the opportunity to offer their services in a formalized procedure)
>> Transparency principle (all bidders should be provided with the same information. The selected procedure must not be changed in an ongoing
commissioning procedure)
>> Equality principle/Prohibition on discrimination (all bidders should be treated equally)
>> Offer based on batch allocation (Major orders should be allotted in specialist batches and sub-batches in order to give small and medium-sized
companies the opportunity to submit bids within the scope of their capacity)
>> Principle of profitability (the contract should be awarded to the most cost-effective offer)
When services are put out to tender, Fraport AG generally guarantees compliance with national and international laws. This is again confirmed in
legally binding terms when the contract is signed.
Since the beginning of 2013, we have supplemented this with a Code of Conduct for the suppliers of Fraport AG, and we expect our suppliers
to comply with this code. It is based on the principles of the UN Global Compact and is a constituent element of all tenders and contracts (see
http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/management/compliance.html).
The Code of Conduct for Suppliers of Fraport AG was substantially revised in 2016 in terms of content and its effectiveness in the General Terms and
Conditions of Business. The obligations of the business partner – including for the supply chain – were enhanced. An anti-corruption clause as well
as serious misdemeanors (criminal offences) are now included in the revised supplier code of conduct. A violation of this can lead to the termination
of the business relationship. Violations of antitrust law and serious misconduct may result in a contractual penalty and a fixed fee for compensation
for damages (see G4-56 Values, principles, and standards of behavior, page 38 et seqq.).
A specific compliance business partner review was established for the Airport Expansion South project. The aim is to minimize compliance risks (e.g.,
corruption, price agreements, fraud, etc.) by becoming more informed about potential future business partners and to detect potential conflicts of
interest. The process, which was established in 2015, provides for a multi-stage, risk-based approach, including integrity checks by external service
providers. The process will continue at Flughafen Ausbau Süd (FAS) GmbH, which took over operations on January 1, 2017.
Moreover, compliance due diligence was introduced as a control process in Global Investments and Management (BET) in 2015. As a result, significant compliance Aspects, such as the compliance business partner review, are taken into consideration in all investment projects and consulting
services (see G4-HR1, page 64).
Also refer to G4-56 Values, principles, and standards of behavior, page 38 et seqq.

G4-HR1 Investment agreements and contracts that include human rights clauses
During the reporting period, no material investment agreements were concluded as a result of which Fraport acquired shares in another organization
or through which an investment project was initiated that was material for the balance sheet.
When services are put out to tender, compliance with national and international laws and agreements is usually guaranteed. This is again confirmed
in legally binding terms when the contract is signed.
Fraport complies with its responsibility in the supply chain and also expects the same compliance from its suppliers and service providers. Our
Code of Conduct for Suppliers formulates rules for business relationships with the companies of Fraport AG and applies to all suppliers and service
providers with which there is a direct business relationship (see http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/management/compliance.html).
Compliance due diligence was introduced as a control process in Global Investments and Management (BET) in 2015. As a result, significant compliance factors, such as the compliance business partner review, are taken into consideration in all investment projects and consulting services. The
obligation to adopt the Group CMS Policy for all fully consolidated investments also ensures that Fraport standards for the compliance management
system are implemented in the relevant investments.

Material Aspect: Non-discrimination – Management Approach
As a cosmopolitan company with an international perspective, Fraport values the diversity of its employees. Diversity enriches cooperation and
promotes innovation and creativity. This is why diversity is a strategic issue for Fraport which the Group systematically fosters in its Diversity Management program. We respect and promote personal differences and work toward ensuring that this is reflected in dealings with others. The Group
company agreement entitled “The Conduct of Partnership, Diversity, and Equality in the Workplace” formed the platform for defining key principles
such as non-discrimination and equal opportunity for the Fraport Group.
More information on diversity at Fraport is available at http://www.fraport.com/en/careers/working-at-fraport/diversity.html.

G4-HR3 Incidents of discrimination and corrective actions taken
During the reporting period, no legal actions were filed in relation to the German General Act on Equal Treatment (AGG).

Material Aspect: Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining – Management Approach
Fraport respects the basic right of freedom of association and collective bargaining under national agreements. We also recognize the right to open
cooperation in a spirit of mutual trust with democratically elected employee representative bodies directed toward a fair settlement of interests.
98.7 % of employees in the Fraport Group are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
See G4-56 Values, principles, and standards of behavior, page 38 et seqq.

G4-HR4 Freedom of association and collective bargaining
During the reporting period, the rights of employees to exercise freedom of association and collective bargaining were not violated in any business
activity nor with any major supplier.
Our Codes of Conduct commit us and our own employees, and all the suppliers and service providers of the Group to these standards (see
http://www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/management/compliance.html).
Suppliers from countries with an increased risk (countries of concern) are reviewed separately. In 2016, we did not place any orders with companies
in countries of concern.

97 % of the order volume placed in 2016 concerned suppliers and service providers with their head office in the Federal Republic of Germany,
2.5 % of orders were placed within the EU, and the other 0.5 % was placed in countries such as the USA and Switzerland. These countries have
comparable legal principles and standards.
Also refer to G4-56 Values, principles, and standards of behavior, page 38 et seqq.

Relevant Aspect: Child Labor
G4-HR5 Principles and measures taken to contribute to the effective abolition of child labor
During the reporting period, no substantial risk of child labor arose from any business activity nor from any major supplier.
The Fraport Group is committed to the abolition of child labor. The minimum age permitting full-time employment in compliance with the relevant
national regulations is observed within the Fraport Group. At all Group sites Fraport has made a commitment to compliance with the most important
internationally recognized codes of conduct to promote responsible corporate governance – the principles of the UN Global Compact, the OECD
principles, and the ILO core labor standards. We are continuously working on integrating the recognized international standards in the areas of human
rights, labor, environmental protection and anti-corruption in our processes (see G4-56 Values, principles and standards of behavior, page 38 et seqq.).
97 % of the order volume of the parent company in 2016 was awarded to suppliers and service providers with their head office in the Federal
Republic of Germany, 2.5 % was placed within the EU, and 0.5 % in countries such as the USA and Switzerland. These countries have comparable
legal principles and standards in this regard.

Relevant Aspect: Forced or Compulsory Labor
G4-HR6 Principles and measures taken to contribute to the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labor
During the reporting period, no substantial risk of forced labor arose from any business activity nor from any major supplier.
97 % of the order volume placed in 2016 was awarded to suppliers and service providers with their head office in the Federal Republic of Germany, 2.5 %
was placed within the EU, and 0.5 % in countries such as the USA and Switzerland. These countries have comparable legal principles and standards.
The Fraport Group does not permit any form of forced or compulsory labor and has made a commitment to compliance with the most important
internationally recognized codes of conduct to promote responsible corporate governance – the principles of the UN Global Compact, the OECD
principles, and the ILO core labor standards. We are continuously working on integrating the recognized international standards in the areas of human
rights, labor, environmental protection and anti-corruption in our processes (see G4-56 Values, principles and standards of behavior, page 38 et seqq.).
Fundamental responsibility for combating human trafficking or smuggling of migrants lies with the Federal Police. Insofar as possible, Fraport provides
support here by, for example, making video analyses available in compliance with legal restrictions. Knowledge about matters relevant to security is
exchanged in meetings held to ensure that all the organizations and authorities working on security issues provide mutual support. Before any data
are exchanged, the relevant data protection officers are asked to review the data and approve the transfer.
Various security systems are in place at the request of the government agencies depending on infrastructure, processes, and risks. One example is
short-term identification blocks (10 minutes). This procedure prevents repeated use of an ID card at the gates. Where possible, employee transfer
points between Schengen and Non-Schengen zones are installed very close to border control posts.
Moreover, the Airport User Regulation as well as the Identification Regulations provide clear guidelines for all ID holders as well as regulations in the
event of misuse up to and including the withdrawal of IDs/access authorizations.

Relevant Aspect: Security Practices
The Aviation Security Act (LuftSiG) came into force in 2005 and regulates, among other things, the checks carried out on air passengers and their
baggage (Section 5 LuftSiG). It also defines the security measures that have to be taken by airport operators (Section 8 LuftSiG) and the airline
companies (Section 9 LuftSiG).
The revised version of the Aviation Security Act is expected to enter into force in the first few months of 2017. This does involve any changes with
regard to the following statements.
The air security measures in accordance with Section 5 LuftSiG are the responsibility of the Federal Police. The police have appointed Fraport AG,
FraSec GmbH, and another service provider to carry out the air security checks (i.e., checks on persons, hand luggage, and hold luggage).
The security obligations of the airport operator relate to maintaining security and order on the airport site as a prerequisite for guaranteeing unimpeded operational work processes. The entire airport site must satisfy the defined safety standards. These are based on the requirements of the
Aviation Security Act (LuftSiG) and the EU provisions and are divided into different areas for security purposes depending on their criticality. The
airport operator is responsible for carrying out pedestrian and vehicle access checks, and for enforcing checks on people and goods at access points
to critical parts of the security area. This includes checking airport deliveries (deliveries of goods that are not to be taken onto airplanes into critical
parts) and checks on taking prohibited items on board. This means that such operations have to be carried out in the security zones themselves.
Fraport AG has commissioned FraSec GmbH to carry out the checks. Fraport AG must outline the security obligations incumbent on it in accordance
with Section 8 LuftSiG in an aviation security plan. This plan must be approved by the Hessian Ministry of Economics, Energy, Transport, Urban, and
Regional Development as supervisory authority.
Fraport AG has established a working group, consisting of employees responsible for data protection, product management video, requirements
management, the users of the relevant business units and corporate safety, with the involvement of the Works Council, which is responsible for all
issues relating to the use of video technology. This working group has prepared a continuously updated concept, which provides clear requirements
for users of all video data with regard to intended use and data protection requirements.
The concept contains a roles and authorization concept for the application and use of video technology across the entire airport complex. This also
regulates the use of Fraport video technology by the authorities.
Furthermore, a standardized approval process has been established which is primarily based on the appointment of video officers (VO) by the areas
deploying this technology. The video officer for the Airside and Terminal Management, Corporate Safety and Security (FTU) business unit is also the
head of the Fraport video officers working group (“Fraport VO”), nominated by the Executive Board. Besides the integrated development of the
video topic, The FTU VO also manages all official matters.
These measures continue to ensure that the requirements for video monitoring are harmonized with the individual rights of passengers, visitors,
and employees.
Boarding cards have included 2D bar codes for some time now and these store personal data about passengers. The systems for processing data
were developed by Fraport in cooperation with customers and Data Protection and they were implemented so that personal data are only displayed
to the inspecting personnel for checking purposes but are not stored, or otherwise processed, or used for any other purpose. This is not necessary
for the operation of the airport.
In order to be in a position to guarantee safety at airports, one of the measures required is that personal access rights must be administered and
checked. At Frankfurt, this is carried out using a new ID card administration system and new access control systems will be used in future for the
gates and for all other access points to operational and security areas. Fraport AG has implemented organizational and technical measures directed
toward the protection of data in order to keep data secure against misuse. Alongside the conclusion of an operating agreement to regulate the
handling of data, all changes in use must be agreed with the Data Protection Officer and the Works Council. Access to the system is only permitted
for a very limited group of people for a specifically defined function and this access is documented so that any misuse is excluded as far as possible,
but any misuse can also be identified and tracked.
All security employees must be trained and officially approved in accordance with statutory requirements. Moreover, all employees with access to
security areas must undergo regular airside security refresher training.

G4-HR7 Percentage of security personnel trained in the organization’s policies
The training and career development of the entire security personnel is carried out in accordance with statutory regulations and internal procedures
and also encompasses statutory provisions relating to handling people and property. The training requirements are applicable to the security personnel at Fraport AG and to the personnel of the subsidiary company Fraport Security Services (FraSec) GmbH.

Relevant Aspect: Indigenous Rights
G4-HR8 Incidents of violations involving rights of indigenous peoples
Fraport respects the rights of indigenous peoples. During the reporting period, there were no incidents affecting the rights of indigenous peoples.

Material Aspect: Assessment – Management Approach
At all Group sites we have made a commitment to compliance with the most important internationally recognized codes of conduct to promote
responsible corporate governance – the principles of the UN Global Compact, the OECD principles, and the ILO core labor standards (see http://
www.fraport.com/en/the-fraport-group/management/compliance.html).
Compliance due diligence was introduced as a control process in Global Investments and Management (BET) in 2015. As a result, significant compliance factors, such as the compliance business partner review, are taken into consideration in all investment projects and consulting services. The
obligation to adopt the Group CMS Policy for all fully consolidated investments also ensures that Fraport standards for the compliance management
system are implemented in the relevant investments.
During the reporting period, no grievances were raised against Fraport AG or the investments in relation to human rights which were submitted
through formal, organizational grievance mechanisms (see G4-HR12 Number of grievances about human rights impacts, page 67). For this reason,
no improvements had to be made.
Also refer to G4-56 Values, principles, and standards of behavior, page 38 et seqq.

G4-HR9 Operations that have been subject to human rights reviews
During the reporting period, none of the investments were the subject of a review and/or impact assessment relating to human rights.

Relevant Aspect: Supplier Human rights Assessment
G4-HR10 Percentage of new suppliers that were screened using human rights criteria
During the reporting period, no contracts with major suppliers or contractors were rejected on account of human rights criteria or came into being
only due to the inclusion of additional framework conditions. Further screening is therefore not required.

Relevant Aspect: Human Rights Grievance Mechanisms
G4-HR12 Number of grievances about human rights impacts

Society
General Management Approach SO
The following GRI aspects were defined as material: Local communities, Anti-corruption, and Politics (see “Materiality matrix” in “2016 Compact”,
page 27 and G4-27 Key topics raised through stakeholder engagement, page 36 et seq.).
A key area of activity for Fraport is noise abatement. Fraport AG deployed an “Info Mobile”, which traveled around in the area surrounding the airport,
to engage in dialog with local residents. Fraport employees acted as ambassadors and took part in campaigns held in the region. The main focus of
campaigns was on holding training sessions that provide information on the issues of noise, flight routes, and noise abatement.
Objectives and measures can be found in “Our program” in “2016 Compact”, page 30 et seqq. Information on organizational responsibility, monitoring and tracking, and central opportunities and risks is provided under G4-56 Values, principles, and standards of behavior, page 38 et seqq.
See also “Community” in “2016 Compact”, page 64 et seqq.

Material Aspect: Local Communities – Management Approach
There is an area of conflict at our main site in Frankfurt. On the one hand, we are responsible for tens of thousands of jobs, the economic importance
of the biggest airport in the export nation Germany, and the prosperity of the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region. On the other hand, the downside to
this is the noise pollution for those parts of the population who live in the region around the airport.
We are committed to taking responsibility and we incorporate all the aspects of this conflict into our business actions to maximum possible effect.
This is particularly important against the background of a foreseeable increase in the volume of traffic. We therefore defined specific goals for noise
abatement, such as improving the noise situation in the neighboring residential areas and reducing the number of people affected by noise (see
“2016 Compact”, page 70 et seqq.).
See also “Value generation and engagement in the region”, page 66 et seqq., “Growth and development in the Group”, page 46 et seqq., and
“Stakeholder dialogs”, page 24.

G4-SO1 Operations with implemented local community engagement
Frankfurt Airport is defined as a significant location of operation. Airports are important business locations and contribute directly and indirectly to
economic and social value creation. Frankfurt Airport, for example, with around 81,000 direct employees and around 500 companies, is the largest
regional place of work in Germany. Additional employment effects are also created in enterprises that are appointed by Fraport for the maintenance
and expansion of airport infrastructure. The approx. 5.4 million people who live in the metropolitan region around the airport benefit from this.
They not only benefit from a short trip to fly away on holiday or for business trips, many of them also work in a company that enjoys a position in
close proximity to the airport.
Fraport AG makes an important contribution to the generation of regional value and to social stability at its sites (see “2016 Compact”, page 66 et seqq.).

We also make a contribution towards generating regional value at all our other airports where we have a majority holding.
Fraport regularly holds open dialogs with stakeholders (see “2016 Compact”, page 24 et seq.).

G4-SO2 Operations with actual or potential negative impacts on local communities
Airports make a significant contribution to economic prosperity through jobs, tax revenue, and excellent transport connections (see “2016 Compact”,
page 24 et seq.). However, their business activities also have disadvantages which exert negative impacts on local communities. A material Aspect
here is noise abatement (see also “2016 Compact”, page 70 et seqq.).

AO8 Number of persons displaced by the airport operator and compensation measures
There were no cases during the reporting period where people were voluntarily or involuntarily displaced by the airport operator.

Material Aspect: Anti-corruption – Management Approach
Fraport has been operating a web-based compliance system based on prevention since 2003. The initial emphasis here was on anti-corruption as
a result of the expansion of the airport.
Due to the system’s much broader further development into a comprehensive compliance and risk management system, new organizational structures
and content have been developed since 2012. The compliance, values and risk management department was restructured on June 30, 2016 and
compliance and values management was assigned to the legal department, while risk management was assigned to accounting. The preventive nature
of the existing compliance management system (CMS) aims to strengthen the compliance culture of our company, while also ensuring governance.
In 2016, the focus was on supporting the investments in the implementation of the Group CMS guideline. The investments were supported by the
provision of a sample CMS description and checklists to document the level of implementation. In addition, a compliance risk analysis was performed
prior to the establishment of new subsidiaries. The existing guidelines were also revised, and in-person training sessions were held for various risk
groups and compliance officers as well as administrative employees at subsidiaries.
A key area of focus in 2016 was on the preventive measures for the southern expansion of the airport. This includes the business partner review
process, the tightening of rules of procedure for commissioning procedures and the identification of conflicts of interest.
An important tool in the prevention and/or detection of breaches is the whistleblower system, which is implemented at many Fraport sites (see
Monitoring and tracking in G4-56 Values, principles, and standards of behavior, page 38 et seqq.).

G4-SO3 Number of operational sites assessed for risks related to corruption risks and the risks identified
The Internal Audit Department audits all key business units of the parent company, subsidiary companies and joint ventures, and investments on
the basis of an audit plan adopted by the Executive Board. The key emphasis of the audits also involved regularity audits which include aspects of
the audit relating to corruption risks. The focal points of the audits are developed on the basis of a standardized, risk-oriented, planned approach
for annual program planning and the number of regularity audits can therefore vary between five and ten audits each fiscal year.
In 2016, a detailed compliance risk analysis was performed for a Brazilian company in the process of being founded. The compliance risks of active
and passive corruption, antitrust law and fraud were investigated. Significant risks in the area of active and passive corruption were identified.
In November 2016, a compliance risk analysis was performed with management and the relevant managers for the subsidiary Fraport Greece, which is
in the process of being founded. The compliance risks of active and passive corruption, antitrust law, fraud and conflicts of interest were investigated.
Increased risks were identified for active and passive corruption and appropriate counter-measures were proposed. The dominant market position
also results in high risks in the area of antitrust law.

G4-SO4 Information and training on anti-corruption
Fraport parent company
The Executive Board of Fraport AG is informed about compliance activities and progress made on measures to combat corruption in the form of
semi-annual compliance reports. The management bodies do not receive dedicated training.
All employees have access to the Code of Conduct and standards of conduct, which also serve as guidelines for all employees, via internal information portals.
All business partners are informed about compliance with the Code of Conduct in the Code of Conduct for Suppliers, including the anti-corruption
obligation. These are a central part of the General Terms and Conditions.
Central compliance training sessions on “Giving and Accepting Gifts and Invitations” (anti-corruption training) have been given on an e-learning
platform since 2014. The training concept involved different management levels and functions having the same obligation to undergo training. Of
the 11,401 permanent staff (2015 basis), 4,011 people were obliged to undertake the anti-corruption training in 2016 (35 % of permanent staff).
87 % of level 1 – 5 managers and 87 % of non-management employees required to participate in the training completed the “Accepting Gifts”
anti-corruption module. 85 % of level 1 – 5 managers and 85 % of employees required to participate in the training completed the “Giving Gifts”
anti-corruption module.
In-person training sessions on antitrust and competition law were also carried out for the retail business unit (23 participants) in the reporting year.

Group
In connection with the compliance risk analysis performed in 2015 and mainly due to the execution of the seven questionnaires on corruption, the
relevant managers and the relevant compliance officers of 23 companies underwent training on corruption risks. The training of employees is the
responsibility of their executive managers. In 2016, compliance training sessions took place for the administrative employees of three investments,
held by the compliance and values management business unit of the parent company. Employee training on the Code of Conduct and standards
of conduct, including corruption prevention, is given when employees start working. Moreover, administrative employees also receive training on
corruption risks over internal training intervals.

G4-SO5 Incidents of corruption and actions taken
Two cases of alleged corruption were reported and investigated in 2016 at the Fraport parent company and the Fraport investments. The matter is
still not resolved in one case. In the second case, the allegation was confirmed. The employment relationship with the employee was terminated.

Material Aspect: Public Policy – Management Approach
Fraport has a broad network of institutionalized, structured communication media to promote dialog and a regular exchange of views with our
stakeholder groups (see “2016 Compact”, page 24 et seq.).
Fraport pursues its interests through membership of the industry organizations Task Force for German Commercial Airports (ADV) (see
http://www.adv.aero/) and Airports Council International (see http://www.aci.aero) Europe, and World. Fraport is also a member of the Federation of
the German Air Traffic Industry (BDL) (see http://www.bdl.aero/en/). BDL focuses on the importance of air traffic as an economic factor for Germany
and aims to highlight its contribution to safe mobility, climate, and environmental protection. In May 2016, the Chairman of the Board of Fraport AG
is been elected for two years as Honorary President of the BDL. We are also working together with bodies in these organizations to prepare positions
on air traffic issues. This includes positions on projected legislation and political initiatives. Working with trade organizations is a top priority for
Fraport. Involvement in trade organizations promotes exchange of information and cooperation with other airports and airlines on current issues
relating to traffic policy and sector-specific matters. ADV and the BDL focus on Germany’s importance as a traffic hub. ACI EUROPE and ACI WORLD
address issues relating to European and international air traffic. In Europe, exchange of ideas between hub airports is particularly important because
this enables common positions, strategies, and solutions to be agreed. Working with trade organizations involves a range of different specific issues
(e.g., environmental policy, safety measures, passenger rights, infrastructure development, Single European Sky, etc.). The Fraport Executive Board
also plays an active role in the management bodies of the industry associations.

Nachbarschaftsdialog (Neighborhood Dialog), and thus formed the basis for dealing with complaints about aircraft noise on a broad dialog basis.
Fraport has since provided a central contact point for questions and complaints from residents on aircraft noise, noise abatement, flight paths, and
problems caused by flyovers, noise values, and air quality, and Fraport programs for structural noise abatement and roof protection.
Telephone queries are directed to Infofon. The Infofon team is available around the clock, free of charge. Complex questions are passed on to the
Nachbarschaftsdialog department.
However, Nachbarschaftsdialog employees are also directly available to interested residents via e-mail or letter.

Fraport has been in dialog with more than 45,000 residents of the Rhine-Main region in relation to aircraft noise and noise abatement. In 2016 alone
we investigated and clarified 1,462,838 individual and flight-related aircraft noise complaints caused by flyovers or aircraft noise.
Visitors to our website can find answers to various questions on noise abatement, aircraft noise, and flight operations, including figures, facts, data,
and other opportunities for dialog at http://www.fraport.com/en/sustainability/aircraft-noise-infoservice/info-center.html.
This site is supplemented by www.framap.fraport.de, an interactive map of approach and departure routes, measurement values, route and runway
occupancy figures, aircraft noise contours, and programs of measures, and by http://franom.fraport.de/franom.php, Fraport Noise Monitoring. These
websites allow users to access current noise values at the stationary aircraft noise measurement points operated by Fraport AG, as well as arrivals
and departures at Frankfurt Airport.
The interactive FRA Map also provides extensive information in the form of a report with detailed information on the specific aircraft noise situation
within five kilometers of the user’s residence. The report can be accessed by entering an address at the direct link www.fraport.de/fluglaerminfo.
In the last three years, we have recorded a disproportionate increase in complaints relating to aircraft noise in comparison to the number of complainants, i.e., complainants are making an increasing number of complaints. The increase in the total number of complaints is due to a small number of
complainants. As the complaints are usually not related to specific flight events, it is not possible to process them individually. The vast majority of
residents complain about flight events, however. A continuous decline in both the number of complainants addressing aircraft noise and complaints
about aircraft noise has been recorded in this complaint category.
With regard to key figures, we publish both the total number of messages received and the number of individually prepared complaints, i.e., excluding automatically generated complaints about aircraft noise, and the number of complainants (see Key Figures Environment, G4-SO11, page 17).

Product Responsibility
General Management Approach PR
The following GRI aspects were defined as material: Customer health and safety, Product and service labeling, and Customer privacy (see “Materiality
matrix” in “2016 Compact”, page 27 and G4-27 Key topics raised through stakeholder engagement, page 36 et seq.).
In order to ensure adequate preparation for emergencies, a range of different emergency exercises are regularly carried out at Frankfurt Airport, for
example
>> Planned exercises
>> Firefighting and rescue exercises
>> Exercises for informing relatives, affected airlines, media, and the general public
>> Exercises providing initial counseling for uninjured survivors of an accident, their relatives, and people giving assistance.
Alongside smaller exercises, e.g., evacuation of persons from the Skyline, a full exercise is carried out at the airport every two years in accordance with
statutory regulations and the international ICAO guidelines. This major exercise involves practicing complex emergencies. The primary focus is on
effective cooperation between internal and external emergency services. The Fraport Emergency Directive (BA-NOT) forms the basis for planning and
coordinating these exercises. The exercise scenarios are planned and carried out as near to reality as possible, in order to ensure that all the parameters
contained in the emergency plan are reviewed – the functionality and effectiveness of organizational, personnel, and material precautions, as well as
the qualifications of the emergency and support personnel. Special training and career development courses are held for employees at the Emergency
Information Center and in Special Assistance Teams (SAT) (see http://www.fraport.com/en/our-expertise/aviation-services/SafetyandSecurity.html).
Objectives and measures can be found in the program in “2016 Compact”, page 30 et seqq. Information on organizational responsibility, monitoring
and tracking, and central opportunities and risks is provided under G4-56 Values, principles, and standards of behavior, page 38 et seqq.

Material Aspect: Customer Health and Safety – Management Approach
The top priority for air traffic is safety. We want to retain the high standard of safety at Frankfurt Airport. A continuous review of all processes governing safety, training of personnel deployed, and a safety management system enable us to make a significant contribution to safety. Increasingly
advanced technologies and more and more personnel are being deployed to guarantee the security of passengers, baggage, and cargo (see “Safety
and Security in Air Traffic” at http://www.fraport.com/en/our-expertise/aviation-services/SafetyandSecurity.html).
Another central area of action is noise abatement (see “2016 Compact”, page 70 et seqq.). We are committed to taking responsibility and we incorporate all the aspects of this conflict into our business actions to maximum possible effect. This is particularly important against the background
of a foreseeable increase in the volume of traffic.
In order to reduce the noise pollution created by the operation of the airport, together with our partners from the “Alliance for Noise Abatement”
we have implemented a variety of active and passive noise abatement measures and we continue to work on the development and introduction
of additional improvements (for more information, see “Noise Abatement” at http://www.fraport.com/en/responsibility/aircraft-noise-infoservice/
info-center.html).
Fraport AG developed a Wildlife Management Program to protect against biological risks for air traffic and the impact of the airport operations on
wildlife. Collisions with individual large birds or flocks of birds are a hazard for aircraft. Because, statistically, around two thirds of all bird strikes take
place at airports or neighboring areas, as an airport operator Fraport is also obliged to minimize this risk. In contrast to many international airports, in
Frankfurt we focus on special biotope management. This concerns making the Airport area unattractive to relevant birds, i.e., minimizing or avoiding
nesting, resting, and feeding opportunities. The bird strike rate, which is based on verified reports to the Deutsche Ausschuss zur Verhütung von
Vogelschlägen im Luftverkehr (Committee for the Prevention of Bird Strikes in Aviation – DAVVL), was between two and five cases per 10,000 flight
movements in the past years.

G4-PR1 Product life cycle stages for which health and safety impacts are assessed for improvement
The top priority for air traffic is safety. By continuously reviewing all safety-related processes, the training of our staff, and a safety management system,
we can maintain the high level of safety at Frankfurt Airport. Increasingly advanced technologies and more and more personnel are being deployed
to guarantee the security of passengers, baggage, and cargo (see “Safety and Security in Air Traffic” at http://www.fraport.com/en/our-expertise/
aviation-services/SafetyandSecurity.html).

Aspect: Business Continuity and Disaster Management
(Airport Operators Sector Disclosures)
Fraport AG currently has an emergency management system spanning all departments that was implemented on the basis of the Emergency Plan
for Frankfurt Airport, and applies this to all emergency incidents. Each individual incident and the measures taken are documented. Apart from
routine everyday business, extreme weather events and strikes were a particular issue on the agenda last year. Our crisis team was also engaged in
this matter in our emergency center (ERIC – Emergency Response and Information Center).
Emergency management also covers the care team, where volunteer employees work in the ERIC support team, the special assistance team, emergency information center, and the basic assistance team. In emergency events or serious operational disruptions affecting Frankfurt Airport, the ERIC
support team supports the crisis team with its work. The special assistance team provides psycho-social frontline assistance to possible relatives or
uninjured affected parties, while the emergency information center is the first telephone contact point for relatives at the airport and the BAT team
helps stranded passengers in the terminal.
Emergency and crisis management comprises the following elements
>> Emergency planning
>> Crisis preparation
>> Emergency Response and Information Center (ERIC)
>> Emergency Information Center (NIZ)
>> Special Assistance Team (SAT)
>> Basic Assistance Team (BAT)
>> Emergency exercises
>> Airport fire brigade
>> Airport safety
>> Security control center
>> Medical services
The Fraport Group has a comprehensive Risk Management System. This ensures that material risks are identified, continuously monitored, and
delimited within the framework of the existing options to an acceptable level.
Events which can impair service quality at the Airport include a breakdown of the Central Airport Information System (INFOplus) or the electronic
gate management system.
Corresponding countermeasures for the failure of a system are laid down in individual section processes. See also http://www.fraport.com/en/
our-expertise/aviation-services/SafetyandSecurity.html.

Aspect: Service Quality (Airport Operators Sector Disclosures)
Service quality is increased by means of the following tools:

1. Fraport passenger survey
>> Each year, around 29,000 passengers are surveyed in respect of their satisfaction with Frankfurt Airport. The questionnaire includes satisfaction
with the stay at the airport overall as well as over 70 criteria along the entire passenger process chain at Germany’s largest air-traffic hub. This
ranges from arrival, check-in and signage to experiences with the friendliness of the staff as well as the ambiance and cleanliness of the terminal
through to the gastronomic, shopping and entertainment offers. The survey takes place at the departure gates as part of the ongoing “Fraport
MONITOR” passenger survey, where departing passengers are personally interviewed prior to boarding.
>> Analysis: The proportion of passengers (on a scale where one is best and six is worst) who selected one of the best assessment options (“top
box”) is analyzed in terms of global satisfaction and individual aspects along the passenger process chain. For example: The overall satisfaction
calculated on the basis of this method reached a historical record level of 82 % in 2016, i.e., 82 out of 100 respondents gave a score of 1 or 2 to
the item “How satisfied were you overall with Frankfurt Airport today?”.

74

GRI Report 2016

GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – SOCIAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

2. ASQ (Airport Service Quality) program
>> ASQ is a passenger satisfaction survey initiated by the international airport association ACI which covers more than 280 airports worldwide. This
once again gives passengers the opportunity to assess their overall satisfaction with the airport (“Overall satisfaction with the airport”) as well as
their experiences during arrival and on their way from check-in to the departure gate. In this case, they independently complete a questionnaire
during their waiting time before boarding, which is collected by an interviewer before boarding.
>> Analysis: This tracks the development of the satisfaction values over extended periods as well as providing a continuous comparison between
Frankfurt Airport and the most important national and international competitors in matters of customer satisfaction.
We are also in continuous dialog with our business customers and partners. Established dialogs include our customer advisory councils and working
groups involving airlines, which meet regularly.
We are also in continuous, close exchange with government agencies.

Aspect: Provision of Services and Facilities for People with Special Needs
(Airport Operators Sector Disclosures)
FraCareServices GmbH is a subsidiary company of Fraport AG and Deutsche Lufthansa AG, and is based at Frankfurt Airport. FraCareServices GmbH
offers services to people with restricted mobility and special needs pursuant to the provisions of EU Directive (EC) 1107/2006.
This service is Fraport AG’s response to the EU Directive. Responsibility for providing assistance at the airport has been transferred by the airline companies to the airport operators in order to ensure a uniform quality standard for assistance provided to passengers with special needs and restricted
mobility. FraCareServices GmbH has specially trained employees and looks after passengers requiring support in making their way to and from the
aircraft (for more information, see http://www.fracareservices.com/english/).

Material Aspect: Product and Service Labeling – Management Approach
The ongoing economic success of our company depends on the satisfaction of our customers and employees. Prices in line with the market, the
quality of services, and the safety and security of processes (see also the Aspects “Security practices”, page 66, “Business continuity and disaster
management”, page 74 et seq.) are decisive factors here. Fraport has created an integrated management system covering environmental, occupational safety, and quality management to guarantee a process of continuous improvement in customer and employee satisfaction. The objective
of the management systems at Fraport AG is to secure and improve the quality of all internal business processes (for more information, see G4-56
Value, principles and standards of behavior, page 40).
Numerous international and national guidelines and laws regulate air traffic. The Airport User Regulation (see http://www.fraport.com/en/
our-expertise/business-services/policies-and-payment-terms.html) is also applicable. The EU “Rights of Passengers” are also applicable (See
http://www.eu-info.de/static/common/files/view/1294/Amtsblatt_Fluggastrechte_04.pdf). Fundamental principles are also defined in extensive
ICAO and EU regulations governing air traffic and ground handling services (for more information see http://www.icao.int/). The Aviation Security
Act (LuftSiG) came into force in 2005 and regulates, among other things, the checks carried out on air passengers and their baggage (Section 5).
It also defines the security measures that have to be taken by airport operators and the airline companies (Sections 8 – 9).
The satisfaction of our customers is a top priority in our materiality matrix. We are continually working on improving our tested service profile in order
to retain and further enhance customer satisfaction (see Product quality and customer satisfaction in “2016 Compact”, page 40 et seq.).

G4-PR4 Incidents of non-compliance with regulations concerning product information and labeling
No incidents were recorded for 2016.

G4-PR5 Customer satisfaction
Every year, around 29,000 passengers at Frankfurt Airport are surveyed with regard to over 70 different satisfaction criteria along the entire passenger
process chain as part of the ongoing “Fraport MONITOR” passenger survey. Overall passenger satisfaction with Frankfurt Airport continued to improve in 2016: The proportion of passengers who gave Germany's largest airport a grade of 1 or 2 (top box value) rose last year to an all-time high
of 82 %. Numerous service and infrastructure measures as part of the “Great to have you here” service program are having an extremely positive
effect on individual satisfaction criteria: So the ways to pass the time rate for example, 76 percent of respondents to the departure as very good or
good – also a new peak. Four of every five passengers are very satisfied or satisfied with the availability of rest areas and waiting areas as well as the
offer of duty-free/travel value shops. And the “Hospitality of the airport staff” criterion, which was a new addition in the past year, achieved an initial
top box value of 85 %.
The satisfaction results, which are evaluated on a monthly basis, are supplemented by half-yearly results from the international ASQ (Airport Service
Quality) survey, which delivers comparative values in the area of customer satisfaction for the most important international and national airports in
direct competition with Frankfurt.
Fraport also has a comprehensive feedback and complaints system so that our customers can tell us about their experiences. We are available to
customers on Facebook, Twitter, by e-mail, telephone, letter, in person, and on the FRA Airport app and we aim to conclusively respond to each
complaint within five days. Complaints covering some 5,800 issues were received in 2016 (previous year: some 5,300) while passenger numbers
remained unchanged. The majority of complaints were still sent to the feedback team via e-mail (approx. 71 %) and the proportion of complaints
received on social media channels is 19 %. The complaints are dealt with by the relevant departments and are transferred to a continuous improvement process (CIP). We are also in continuous dialog with our business customers and partners. Our customer advisory councils and working groups
meet with the airlines on a regular basis in an ongoing process of dialog within a structured schedule and framework. Additionally, numerous ad hoc
meetings take place to discuss specific subject areas. We also have a continuous, close exchange of ideas with government agencies.

Foreword

Foreword

2016 Compact

Dear Readers,
We cannot simply be satisfied with our past success.
Nevertheless, this success gives us a strong basis for
coping with the changes in the aviation industry and
for developing Fraport profitably in the future. Our
mission is to be Europe’s best airport operator, set
standards worldwide and to focus on the needs of our
customers while doing so. We have summarized this in
a single sentence in our new mission statement: “Gute
Reise! We make it happen”. This places our customers
even more strongly at the center of our activities than
before. At the same time we will continue to develop
our strategic direction in response to the changing
environment and market conditions to ensure that
Fraport is positioned for success in the aviation market
over the long term.

2016 Compact

Foreword

The trend towards the digitization of business processes is an opportunity for us to increase the efficiency of
our operations and to create new offers for our customers together with our business partners. We have
added new products and services to the multichannel
platform already developed at Frankfurt Airport in the
past year. We are thus creating attractive, integrated
solutions and at the same time using the synergies
of the digital and bricks-and-mortar business to
strengthen profitability. We are a globally pioneering
airport operator in this area, and we are delighted that
our online shopping platform won the prestigious
“Imagine Excellence Award” in the USA last year.

In the “Aviation” section too, Fraport is responding to
market changes by developing customized services
and the new charge table. Today, airlines expect airport
operators to share in the cost of market entry when new
routes or stations are opened up. At the same time,
we have long been observing the trend on European
routes that low-cost direct traffic is growing disproportionately at the expense of the established network
airlines. The expansion of the low-cost segment at the
Frankfurt site is in line with what customers want and
ensures a growing transport offer and a wide variety
of connections.

Foreword

The new charge table for Frankfurt Airport encourages
the use of low-noise aircraft even more than before.
To this end, airport charges based on the level of
emissions were further increased and even more widely
applied. An incentive program for equipping aircraft
with a navigation technology that allows for low-noise
approach procedures was also launched. These and
other measures fulfill our responsibility towards those
who live near the airport. Together with our partners,
we continue to work hard to maintain and expand
Frankfurt Airport’s role as an international pioneer in the
fields of active noise abatement and noise reduction.
In terms of finances, the fiscal year 2016 was a thoroughly successful one for Fraport in view of the
difficult geopolitical environment. We generated a
top performance as a result of the profitable sale of
shares in the operating company of Pulkovo Airport
in St. Petersburg and the compensation payment
from the Manila project. Particular contributions to

2016 Compact

the positive financial development were also made
by the Group companies Lima in Peru and Twin Star
in Bulgaria, which significantly increased the relevant
traffic figures and key financial figures compared to
the previous year and together generated EBITDA of
over €150 million. In contrast, in view of the attacks in
Turkey and intermittent tensions with Russia, the investment in Antalya recorded a sharp drop in traffic and
earnings. Despite a significant decrease in passengers
in late spring and summer, partly due to the attacks in
Belgium and France, Frankfurt Airport was again able
to exceed the 60-million mark with some 60.8 million
passengers, and only slightly fell short of the figure
for the previous year, by 0.4 percent. However, cargo
tonnage increased by 1.8 percent to about 2.2 million
metric tons on the back of a stronger global economy.
In summary, the Fraport Group generated EBITDA of
€1,054 million and EBIT of approximately €694 million.
The Group result improved significantly by almost

2016 Compact

Foreword

»We particularly want to thank our employees in Frankfurt and around the
world. Their steady, high levels of commitment, their abilities and their ideas
ensure that we can generate such positive results.«

35 percent to a new record high of €400 million. The
significantly positive performance of the key financial
figures is also reflected in increased value added. At
approximately €169 million, this figure was approximately €122 million above the already good level of
the previous year.
We particularly want to thank our employees in Frankfurt and around the world. Their steady, high levels
of commitment, their abilities and their ideas ensure
that we can generate such positive results. They are
the ones who ensure the successful development of
the Group airports and Group companies day in and
day out and repeatedly turn in excellent performances
even under adverse conditions.
To maintain this performance and motivate our employees over the long term, we offer a wide range of
projects in the areas of professional training and health.
Our goal of further increasing the number of women
in management positions will be applied to the entire
Group in the future. Fraport aims at a proportion of
30 percent to 35 percent by no later than 2021. We
are also vigorously pursuing the Group-wide goal of
continuous reduction of accidents at work. The target
for 2020 is to have fewer than 25 accidents per 1,000
employees.
We have also set ourselves new targets for CO2 reduction. Based on the Federal Government’s plans,
we intend to reduce the CO2 emissions of Fraport AG
at the Frankfurt site to 80,000 metric tons by 2030.
This represents a 65 percent decrease compared to
emissions in base year 1990. CO2 emissions are to be
reduced to 0.9 kg CO2 per traffic unit (one passenger
or 100 kg of cargo or mail). This would correspond to
a reduction of 84 percent.

In addition to these objectives, and in terms of responsible corporate governance, Fraport is committed to
complying with internationally recognized codes of
conduct. These include the ten principles of the UN
Global Compact, to which we have been expressly
committed since 2007. In addition, Fraport is particularly committed to the UN’s Agenda 2030 and its
Sustainable Development Goals. You will find more
information on the following pages about which of
these objectives we are placing a particular focus on.
We hope you find this report informative and interesting, and we look forward to your responses.

Lufthansa’s first Airbus A320neo
transferred to Frankfurt

Award for initiative
E-PORT AN

Frankfurt recognized as “International
Cargo Airport of the Year”

The Airbus A320neo is one of the quietest
and most energy-efficient aircraft on short
and medium-haul routes. According to the
manufacturer, the new aircraft has an almost
50 % smaller noise contour on take-off than
the previous model. All newly delivered
A320neo aircraft come equipped with vortex generators, which make an additional
contribution to noise reduction. By the end
of 2016, Lufthansa will station five of these
latest-generation aircraft in Frankfurt.

Fraport and the Lufthansa Group are working
together at Frankfurt Airport to use more
electric vehicles for aircraft handling, and
thus make the processes on the apron more
environmentally friendly. The US trade magazine Air Transport World (ATW) honored
this commitment with the “Eco-Company
Partnership of the Year” award. In addition
to Fraport and Lufthansa, the state of Hesse
and the “Rhine-Main Electromobility Model
Region” are part of the E-PORT AN initiative.

Readers of the “STAT Trade Times International” named air cargo hub Frankfurt as the
best international cargo airport. The award
was presented at the “Air Cargo India 2016”
trade fair in Mumbai, India. The “STAT Trade
Times International” was founded in 1986
and is the market leader in its field for the
cargo industry.

Xi’an Airport named best regional
airport in China
Xi’an Xianyang International Airport in the
major Chinese city Xi’an was named “Best
Regional Airport in China 2016” with the
prestigious “Skytrax World Airport Award”.
The award is based on independent passenger
surveys.

Dividend per share of €1.35 maintained

FRA: modernized arrivals area
at Terminal 1 reopened

Fraport was awarded the “Imagine Excellence
Award” for its new online shopping platform
at Frankfurt Airport. The award ceremony
was held at the “Imagine” convention in
Las Vegas, one of the largest e-commerce
congresses in the USA. Together with AOE,
the service provider responsible for the technical realization, Fraport took the prize in the
category “Best Omnichannel Experience”.

At the 15th Annual General Meeting, the
shareholders with a large majority discharged
the Executive Board (99.96 %) and Supervisory Board (97.12 %) for the 2015 fiscal
year. The dividend per share of €1.35 was
maintained. The last dividend increase dates
back to the 2014 fiscal year.

Since Easter 2015, the entire exterior area
in the arrivals level of Terminal 1 has been
modernized. The focus was on the clear
design of the improved traffic flow of the
450-meter long covered terminal access
road. In addition to the renovation of the
walkways and the road, more than 1,000
square meters of new glass facade and 2,100
square meters of metal facade were installed.
144,000 energy-saving LEDs are also used.

Frankfurt Airport turns 80
On July 8, 1936, Frankfurt Airport was inaugurated at its current location with the first
landing of a “Junkers Ju 52/3m”. As early as
1937, the airport had almost 71,000 passengers. In World War II, the airport was struck
by approximately 2,000 bombs, which led
to its almost complete destruction. After
the airport was repaired and when regular
passenger traffic resumed in 1950, the number
of passengers grew steadily. Ten years later,
the airport already had 2.2 million passengers, and in 1980 served 17.7 million air
travelers. Within another 10 years, this figure
doubled to almost 30 million passengers. In
2016, Frankfurt counted a total of just under
61 million passengers.

Group’s own Aviation Academy
at Ljubljana Airport
Fraport AG opened an aviation center of
excellence under the name “Fraport Aviation
Academy” at the Group’s Ljubljana Airport.
The academy is operated by Aerodrom
Ljubljana d.o.o., which is Fraport’s subsidiary
in Slovenia and the operating company of
the airport. The establishment of the center
of excellence takes account of the increased
training and continuous education requirements within the Group and by external
customers.

Investment in Pulkovo Airport reduced
Fraport AG has agreed the sale of 10.5 % of
the shares in Thalita Trading Ltd. with the
Qatar Investment Authority. Thalita owns
Northern Capital Gateway, which in turn
holds the 30-year operating concession
for Pulkovo Airport in St. Petersburg. This
reduced Fraport’s holding in Thalita from
35.5 % to 25 %.

Cooperation with Beijing Capital
Intl. Airport and Air China

The Fraport Group recorded revenue of over
€1.2 billion in the first half of 2016. Adjusted
for changes in the scope of consolidation,
Group revenue increased by €19.2 million
(+1.6 %). Group EBITDA fell by 1.7 % to
€378.4 million. Group EBIT was €214.6 million
(– 3.3 %). The slight improvement in the
financial result and lower taxes on income led
to a Group result of €99.7 million (– 3.2 %).
Higher cash flow used in investing activities
and one-time tax effects in the first quarter of
2016 led to a €40.4 million decrease in free
cash flow to €149.3 million.

In Beijing, representatives of Fraport AG,
Beijing Capital Intl. Airport and Chinese
airline Air China signed a memorandum of
understanding. The core of the agreement
is the expansion of flight frequencies between Frankfurt and Beijing. In addition to
the coordination of joint communication
and marketing activities, the development
of specially tailored passenger services for
guests from each country will be intensified
at the Beijing and Frankfurt sites.

Compensation payments for
terminal project in Manila

Ryanair to fly from Frankfurt
starting in summer 2017

New retail subsidiary at Frankfurt
Airport

Following the decision of the Supreme Court
of the Philippines, which became legally
binding in April 2016, the Philippine government paid compensation to the project
company PIATCO in connection with the
terminal project at Manila airport. In addition,
Fraport sold shares in the companies in the
Philippines. Fraport AG will receive an amount
of approximately US$270 million from the
total transaction, of which the company will
have to repay up to approximately €40 million
to the Federal Government in connection with
a federal guarantee for investments abroad.

At the company’s headquarters in Frankfurt,
Chairman of the Executive Board Dr. Stefan
Schulte and Chief Commercial Officer of
Ryanair David O’Brien announced the commencement of passenger flights from Frankfurt from the 2017 summer flight schedule.
This expands the flights on offer to include
flights from the largest European low-cost
provider. The initial destinations from Frankfurt will be Palma de Mallorca (PMI), Alicante
(ALC) and Málaga (AGP) in Spain, as well as
Faro (FAO) in Portugal.

The retail company Gebr. Heinemann SE
& Co. KG and Fraport have agreed on the
establishment of a joint venture “Frankfurt
Airport Retail GmbH & Co. KG”. The new
joint venture, in which each partner holds
50 %, operates 27 shops at Frankfurt Airport,
most of which are run under the brand name
Heinemann Duty Free and Travel Value. Gebr.
Heinemann is contributing all of its existing
activities at the Frankfurt site as well as its
approximately 750 employees to the new
company.

Environment Award for Ljubljana
Headcount at Frankfurt Airport
rises again
As at the reporting date of December 31,
2015, around 81,000 people – more than
ever before – were employed at the airport.
A total of around 450 companies and institutions took part in the 2015 workplace and
employee survey. The result confirms the airport’s position as the largest local workplace
in Germany. A year earlier, the headcount was
approximately 80,000.

The Slovenian subsidiary Aerodrom Ljubljana,
d.o.o. received the Environment Award from
“Finance” magazine for its commitment to
environmental protection. One of the factors
in this decision that the “Green Team” jury
was especially impressed by was an annual action plan for reducing the company’s carbon
footprint. Aerodrom Ljubljana is ISO-14001
certified and has achieved Level 2 (Reduction)
of the Airport Carbon Accreditation.

Our mission statement

Vision
“Fraport – from Frankfurt to the world.
We are Europe’s best airport operator and
set standards worldwide.” This is the new
vision for the Fraport Group. It emphasizes the Company’s close connection to its
home site of Frankfurt. The impetus for the

international activities starts from there.
In Europe, Fraport measures itself against other
airport operators. Globally, Fraport is success­
fully expanding its network and setting
standards in the operation of international
airports along with the associated services.

Vision: Europe’s top airport operator

Growth in Frankfurt and internationally

Service-oriented airport operator

Fairness and recognition for partners and neighbors

Economically successful through
optimal cooperation
Learning organization

2016 Compact

Our mission statement

The five goals are:
1. We grow in Frankfurt and
internationally.

Gute Reise!

We make it happen

2. We are a service-oriented airport
operator and focus our processes on
our customers.
3. We act while keeping the entire company in view. By optimally collaborating
within the Group, we remain competitive and do business successfully.
4. We are a learning organization
developing in tandem with the market.
5. We treat one another, as well as our
partners and neighbors, with fairness
and respect.

Implementation of the new mission
statement
At the end of 2015, the Fraport Group set
down the guideline for future action in its mission statement. This represents a shift towards
an even stronger focus on customer needs. As
a service-oriented service provider, the processes and infrastructure are intended to help

our customers have a “Gute Reise”. The values
of competence, commitment, openness, reliability, courage, and trust are the core values
of Fraport culture. Five goals, the vision and the
new slogan “Gute Reise! We make it happen”
provide a clear orientation towards the future.

To anchor the mission statement within
the company, a roll-out process based on
four pillars began in 2016: Communication,
attitude change, strategic implementation
and monitoring.

11

12

Our mission statement

2016 Compact

»We serve our customers by successfully operating airports
worldwide and providing relevant services. We create the
prerequisites for international connectivity, economic growth,
and prosperity.«

Familiarity with the mission statement:
Communication
The company’s mission statement was
announced as part of a comprehensive
communication campaign. In addition to a
poster campaign and a film series, all means
of internal communication were continuously
used to report on the mission statement. In
town halls, the Executive Board entered into
a direct discussion with employees. A total
of 13 events, each with around 300 employees, were held during the year to discuss
the mission statement. The feedback was
mostly positive.
Questions and concerns that employees addressed to the Executive Board were, where
appropriate, passed on to the departments
and focal points were taken up by internal
communication. The Executive Board will
continue to discuss the mission statement
with the employees in 2017. The poster
campaign will be continued as a visible sign,
as will the film series “Your contribution to a
good trip”.

Changing attitudes through dialog
Team dialogs were carried out in the first
half of 2016. Starting with the Executive
Board, a total of more than 425 teams across
all hierarchical levels Group-wide discussed
their contribution to a “Gute Reise” and the
implementation of the mission statement in
the working day. The purpose of the dialogs
was to trigger an effective, enduring change
in our own attitude to align with the spirit of
the mission statement.
Many employees and managers viewed the
discussion within the team dialogs as very
positive. Initial skepticism and reservations
led to constructive discussions and creative
ideas. All of the teams documented their
results – in particular the goals they set themselves with regard to the mission statement.
The results of the individual dialogs were
centrally evaluated and published in their
entirety within the Group. This gives all employees the opportunity to understand the
perspectives of other areas of the company
with which they work on a daily basis.

Based on the findings of the team dialogs
and discussions with the moderators who
provided support to the operational areas
in the implementation, connection concepts
are being developed in 2017. A starting point
is a “mission statement box” for managers.
It contains cards with thematic suggestions
and interactive methods for further implementation of the mission statement. Managers
can select suitable themes, revise them, and
thus move forward the joint learning and
awareness processes for their teams in accor­
dance with their needs.

2016 Compact

Our mission statement

Implementation at the strategic level

Monitoring with the Culture Check

In 2016, approximately 50 managers from
the Group worked on the strategic direction
of the company in four so-called mentor
circles along the five goals of the mission
statement. As a result of these mentor circles, six so-called lighthouse projects were
initiated with the aim of implementing the
vision “We are Europe’s best airport operator
and set standards worldwide.” In terms of
content, the focus of the lighthouse projects
is also on the customer. Other focal points
are the promotion of internal cooperation
and mutual learning.

To measure the cultural change initiated with
the mission statement, an online survey on
Group culture was conducted at the beginning of 2016. This “zero measurement”
of company culture is a yardstick for future
changes. Criteria for the measurement of
corporate culture were developed in advance
and the desired target state was defined in
advance. The Culture Check measures the
discrepancy between the actual and the
target culture.

The results of the mentor circles and the
annual strategy session of corporate management, supplemented by the findings from
the lighthouse projects, feed into the further
development of the Group strategy.

The result, with a response rate of around
40 %, indicates highly consistent results
across all hierarchical levels and organizational units. It confirms that there is a high degree
of recognition of the mission statement in the
company (76 %). This recognition is greatest
among administrative employees (91%). It
also meets with broad approval: 91% of the
employees surveyed like the new mission
statement. 77 % of employees who took part
in the survey like the new slogan “Gute Reise!
We make it happen”.

The results of the Culture Check indicate
areas of activity that are now being targeted.
The most important points are the topics of
leadership/orientation, cost-consciousness/
administrative expense as well as cooperation/service orientation, information
sharing and further development. Some
of the lighthouse projects as defined in
the mentor circles are already supporting
the development of these areas of activity.
A Group-wide survey has also shown that
numerous concepts and programs that are
currently being implemented contribute to
personnel and manager development. They
are now being further honed to specifically
support the planned changes.

From Frankfurt to the World
The Fraport Group (hereinafter also referred
to as: Fraport) is among the leading global
airport groups with its international portfolio. Fraport provides all airport and terminal
operation services and associated services.
Fraport also provides planning and consultancy services and has operational and
administrative activities. Passenger traffic,
which impacts on a majority of the services
the Group provides, is key to the Group’s
revenue and earnings performance.
The Group’s business activities can fundamentally be broken down by Group sites
and by the services provided there. Here,
the main site is Frankfurt Airport, one of the
biggest passenger and cargo airports in the
world. In contrast to time-limited airport
operating models, the Fraport Group parent company, Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport
Services Worldwide (Fraport AG), wholly
owns and operates Frankfurt Airport with
no time limits. With almost 10,500 employees, Fraport AG, which has been stock exchange-listed since 2001, is also the biggest
single company of the Group, which has
more than 20,300 employees. It directly or

indirectly holds the shares in the other Group
companies and has its head office in Frankfurt
am Main. The Frankfurt site, including the
subsidiaries, has 18,300 employees. Fraport
provides the entire range of airport and
airport-related services there.
In addition to the Frankfurt site, Fraport was
also active at 13 further airports in 2016.
The most significant companies for the Group
result are the Group companies Lima, Antalya,
Twin Star, Fraport USA Inc. (formerly AMU
Holdings Inc), Ljubljana and Xi’an. Whereas
the Group companies Lima, Twin Star, Fraport
USA Inc., and Ljubljana are fully consolidated
in the Fraport Group, Antalya (joint venture)
and Xi’an (associated company) are accounted
by using the equity method.

Germany – and in this respect almost exclusively Frankfurt Airport – was once again the
most important site for the Group in the past
fiscal year with a share of 63.7 % of the Group
result (2015: 63.4 %). Compared with the
previous year, the share of the Peru site rose
from 15.5 % to 21.5 % and the share of the
Bulgaria site rose from 4.8 % to 8.5 % In fiscal
year 2016, the sites in Turkey and the USA
made a negative contribution to the Group
result due to a sharp drop in passenger numbers in Antalya as well as the unscheduled
depreciation and amortization in connection
with the Group company Fraport USA Inc.

In April 2017, Fraport took over the 14 Greek
regional airports and commenced their
operation. The airports include the mainland
airports of Thessaloniki, Aktion, and Kavala,
and the island airports of Chania on Crete,
Kefalonia, Kerkyra on Corfu, Kos, Mykonos,
Mytilini on Lesbos, Rhodes, Samos, Santorini,
Skiathos and Zakynthos.

»In the Supervisory Board, we regularly discuss the business
development of the Fraport Group and its Group companies,
with a particular emphasis on the traffic and earnings development
at Frankfurt Airport. We are also closely following the expansion of
the airport site to the south. The successful international involvement
of Fraport AG is also a frequent topic within the Supervisory Board,
as individual Group airports have to be closely monitored for
particular geopolitical developments. The extension of the contracts
of Dr. Matthias Zieschang and Michael Müller ensures the stable
composition of the Fraport Executive Board.«

Organization
Fraport AG is a public limited company
under German law – accordingly, the senior
management and control are divided up
between three independent bodies. The
Executive Board is responsible for operational
management and leads the Group. At the
end of 2016, it comprised four members,
Dr. Stefan Schulte (Chairman), Anke Giesen
(Operations), Michael Müller (Labor Relations),
and Dr. Matthias Zieschang (Controlling and
Finance).

The Supervisory Board appoints the Execu­
tive Board and monitors its activity. It exists
under German law and, as a result of the
size of the parent company, comprises
20 members who are appointed or elected
by shareholders and company employees in
equal numbers.

Meeting takes place in the first six months of
each fiscal year and makes decisions on all
tasks assigned to it by law and the Group’s
articles of association, such as appropriation
of profit, election and discharge of the Supervisory Board, and discharge of the Executive
Board. Each share provides one voting right.

As an additional decision-making and control
body, the shareholders of Fraport AG make
use of their discussion and voting rights at the
Annual General Meeting. The Annual General

Strategy
Fraport continues to guide its strategy by the
long-term forecasted development of the
global aviation market and its market trends.
Here, renowned aviation associations and
aircraft manufacturers continue to expect
long-term stable growth of the aviation
market. This is derived, in particular, from
projected global economic growth and the
continuing global expansion of the middle
class that increases its consumption. Supporting effects continue to result from the
continuing internationalization of labor and
education. Increasing traffic is also forecasted
from migration and tourism. The intense
competition between airlines and business
models that focus on pure transport also have
the effect of promoting growth. This leads to
relatively cheap ticket prices. Disproportionate growth is still expected from and in the
economic emerging markets.

Despite long-term growth forecasts, the
short-term future of aviation markets continues to be marked by uncertainty. These
primarily result from political crises, such as in
Ukraine, Turkey, and the Middle East, the possible spread of epidemics and possible terrorist attacks, but also from the economically
uncertain situations of various economies.
In addition, the various companies in the
air travel industry, in particular the airlines,
have been negatively affected by continued
intense competition, the introduction of
national taxes, such as the German aviation
tax and labor disputes. As a result, these
negative effects are resulting in a conservative and short-term volatile supply behavior
of airlines. Positive and negative effects also
result from the appreciation and depreciation
of currencies as well as price fluctuations on
the commodity markets.

Due to its position as an international hub,
at Fraport the aforementioned uncertainties
particularly affect Frankfurt Airport. In Europe,
there have also been shifts in passenger flows,
moving away from Turkey as a popular destination for German tourists – Antalya Airport
has been significantly affected by this –
towards alternative holiday destinations in the
western Mediterranean region. Due to the
high share of Russian-dominated traffic,
the St. Petersburg, Varna, and Burgas sites are
also heavily influenced by political uncertainties in connection with Russia.

2016 Compact

Our Group

Integration of the mission statement

Governance and compliance

The modified general conditions in global
air traffic influence the entire air transport
industry. Price wars between airlines and a
change in passenger travel behavior have led
to increased competition between airports.
At the same time, the quality of services as
well as reliable and fast processes are becoming increasingly important.

area. This requires the entire company to
place a much more in-depth focus on customers, whether they be passengers, airlines,
or shop operators. Fraport generates revenue
and its economic success from these diverse
customer groups, and has incorporated these
changed requirements into its Group mission
statement “Gute Reise! We make it happen.”

Within this scope, we have continued to
develop our corporate strategy by placing
more focus on the changed framework and
market conditions. The challenges for the
future are significant: From the point of view
of the passenger, airports are becoming increasingly exchangeable. Travelers can often
choose between several airlines or alliances,
and thus their hubs. To an increasing extent,
they draw up their travel routes themselves
and forgo any end-to-end offers from one
single airline. The expansion of low-cost
carriers in the point-to-point market at other
airports means that Frankfurt, without a corresponding offer, is no longer the first choice for
price-savvy passengers within its catchment

The mission statement and its implementation through the refined Group strategy
should help ensure that Fraport will continue
to be one of the most important international
airport operators. The Company seeks to
establish itself as Europe’s top airport operator, while at the same time setting global
standards. This will ensure the long-term
sustainable development of the value of the
company. Fraport has positioned itself as an
attractive partner for all its customers, which
ensures it remains competitive. Detailed
information on the contents can be found
in the 2016 Annual Report, starting from
page 29.

As a company operating at a global level,
Fraport bears national and international responsibility. Fraport understands compliance
to be the management of business activities
in accordance with the relevant key laws and
internal guidelines. The issues of compliance
and values management are brought together in a values-based compliance management
system (CMS). Thus, the preventive nature
of values management introduced in 2003
enhances the overarching CMS. The commitment to compliance has been part of
employment contracts since 2005.
In addition to an internal confidant, Fraport
introduced an electronic whistle-blower
system (BKMS® System) in 2009. An external
ombudsperson was appointed in 2011, who
in particular confidentially receives and legally examines tips on serious legal violations.
Suspected cases of compliance breaches
are processed by central case management.
Numerous communication measures and a
variety of on-site training as well as e-learning
courses aim to ensure prevention.

17

18

Our Group

In terms of responsible corporate governance, Fraport has already long been committed to complying with internationally
recognized standards of behavior as listed in
the principles of the UN Global Compact, the
OECD Guidelines, and the ILO Core Labor
Standards. In order to embed these rules
even more strongly in the company, at the
start of 2013 Fraport published two codes
of conduct that require employees and suppliers to comply with these basic principles.
The Code of Conduct for Employees was
revised in 2016 and covers the subjects of
compliance, working conditions, and human rights. The supplier code also contains
the aspects of environmental conservation
and climate protection. The content of the
supplier code of the Fraport parent company
has been substantially revised in terms of
its effectiveness in the General Terms and
Conditions in 2016. The obligations of our
business partners – including for the supply
chain – were enhanced. An anti-corruption
clause that defines serious misconduct
(criminal offenses) has now been included in
the revised supplier code. A breach of these
can lead to the termination of the business
relationship. Further, in the case of antitrust
violations and serious misconduct, a contractual penalty and flat-rate claim for damages
may be imposed.
The new supplier code is adapted to the
German legislation on general terms and
conditions and applies in this form to the
Fraport parent company. It can be used by
the German investments. If these investments do not have the power to enforce this
more stringent code with respect to their
clients, the previously agreed supplier code
applies. For foreign subsidiaries with other
jurisdictions, the previously agreed codes of
conduct for suppliers apply.
The Fraport Policy forms the overarching
structure for all commitments and the codes
of the Group based on specific topic areas
(see www.fraport.com/responsibility). The
Code of Conduct reflects the values culture
lived out at Fraport and provides our employees with a framework for dealing with
the economic, legal, and moral challenges
of daily business life in a responsible and
correct manner. The acceptance of the
codes of conduct is also a key element of
the Group Compliance Management System

2016 Compact

(CMS) guideline rolled out in 2015 that is to
be implemented by the fully consolidated
subsidiaries as a minimum requirement.

Compliance with human rights
Fraport respects the cultural, ethnic, social,
political, and legal diversity of all nations and
societies. As part of diversity management,
we consciously make the diversity of our
employees part of our human resources
strategy and organizational development.
As the representative of the highest level in the
organization, the Chairman of the Executive
Board is responsible for human rights issues
in the Group.

Significant factors for supplier selection
include the principles for awarding orders
based on the Act against Restraints of Competition of the Federal Republic of Germany.
When tendering, Fraport AG generally
guarantees compliance with national and
international laws and agreements.
We expect our suppliers to comply with our
Supplier Code of Conduct. It is a constituent element of all tenders and contracts.
Suppliers of product groups of a higher risk
category and those from higher-risk countries
are subject to a special review. In 2016, we
did not place any orders with companies
from “countries of concern”.

Fraport respects the basic right of freedom
of association and the right to collective
bargaining agreement negotiations under
national agreements. Furthermore, we work
together openly in a spirit of mutual trust
with democratically elected employee representative bodies. In 2016, 99 % of Fraport
Group employees were covered by collective
agreements.
Wherever it can, Fraport supports the German
Federal Police in pursuing and combating
international people trafficking at Frankfurt
Airport, for example, by handing over raw
video material in certain justified cases. Before
any data are exchanged, the relevant data
protection officers are asked to review the
data and approve the transfer. Furthermore,
technical security systems were installed in
cooperation with the German Federal Police
and the German Customs Office.

»Fraport respects the cultural, ethnic, social, political,
and legal diversity of all nations and societies.«
Procurement
In 2016, Fraport’s parent company placed
orders with a total volume of around €833
million. Around 68 % of these were placed
with companies in the Frankfurt Rhine-Main
region; however, as a sector contractor, we
are precluded from granting preference to
companies in our immediate vicinity or the
surrounding area.

Responsibility
For us, acting sustainably means creating
the future responsibly. We understand sustainable development to be a continuous
process. We believe that the entrepreneurial
scope for action can only be ensured by
consistent incorporation of non-economic
aspects in management processes.
The topic of sustainability or responsibility
falls under the remit of the central unit
“Corporate Development, Environment
and Sustainability”, which is assigned to the
Chairman of the Executive Board. The section
brings together the strategically relevant
themes relating to responsible corporate
governance and initiates their development.
It is also in charge for environmental management, and drawing up the materiality matrix
and the program. Responsibility for reporting
and managing rankings and assessments
lies with the “Finance & Investor Relations”
section.

Stakeholder dialogs
Airports are of great public importance. They
regularly give rise to sociopolitical debates;
naturally, this applies particularly to Frankfurt
Airport, one of the largest hubs in Europe.
As the operator, Fraport AG has to reconcile
very different requirements.
For example, some of our stakeholders are
focused on global challenges such as climate
change, while for many of those living near
airports, aircraft noise is most important.
Other stakeholders are concerned with
issues surrounding the Group’s financial value
creation and its competitiveness, as well as
maintaining and creating secure, attractive
jobs. The issues raised with us are highly
diverse and sometimes irreconcilable.
We can implement many suggestions, but
not all. Nevertheless, we firmly believe that
exchanging information contributes to mutual understanding and developing widely
accepted solutions.

With its stakeholder dialog activities, Fraport
addresses all of the company’s key stakeholders in a targeted manner. These include passengers, business partners, analysts, owners,
and representatives from the community,
politics, and the authorities. Special consideration is paid to local residents affected by
aircraft noise at our sites and the approxi­
mately 81,000 employees at Frankfurt Airport,
Germany’s largest workplace, including, in
particular, Fraport employees, for whom we
are directly responsible. The Fraport Group
also maintains close contact with its main
customers – airline companies – to regularly
exchange information on a range of issues
and coordinate operational measures.
We consider dialog to be an important tool
that we use to obtain recommendations for
the company’s strategic alignment and advice
on risk management. As a “learning organization”, we are also focused on advancements
in science and technology.

Updating the materiality matrix
The systematic exchange of information with
our internal and external stakeholders enables
us to develop perspectives for the strategic
alignment of the company. Since 2010, we
have used this to create a materiality matrix
that depicts the company’s future challenges.
The matrix is reviewed annually to ensure it
is up-to-date and, if necessary, adjusted. In
the course of aligning sustainability reporting
with the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI)
G4 guidelines, in 2015, the materiality matrix
needed to be developed to focus it even
more on the central areas of activity for the
company’s sustainability.
Fraport’s management and representatives
of our most important stakeholders (airline
companies, passengers, business partners,
shareholders, analysts, employees, employee
representatives, political bodies and authorities, foundations, associations, scientific
bodies, NGOs, local residents living near
the airport) confirmed the relevance of the
ten newly defined areas of activity for the
company’s sustainability.

Both groups were also asked to prioritize
the topics. This revealed a wide consensus
on the weighting of the areas of activity
between management and stakeholders:
both consider “product quality and customer
satisfaction” and “economic efficiency” to
be the most important areas of activity for
Fraport’s sustainability; “ideas and innovation” and “attractive and responsible employer” were also deemed very important from
both perspectives. Both groups felt “noise
abatement” and “value generation and engagement in the region” were of moderate
to low importance and “climate protection”
and “conservation of nature and resources”
were also considered to be less important
by both groups.

The updated materiality matrix was approved
by the Executive Board in 2015. In 2016,
a check to ensure that the matrix is up to
date was made and the matrix’s validity was
confirmed.

Conversely, the area of activity “growth and
development in the Group” received varied
ratings, with management considering it
more important. “Occupational health and
safety”, on the other hand, was considered
more important by stakeholders.

Definitions of the areas of activity
Product quality and customer satisfaction:
Continuous improvement of our services, reflected by a high level of customer satisfaction.
Safeguarding of the Frankfurt hub function
and preservation of the Group’s competitiveness.
Economic efficiency: Return-oriented utilization of present and future assets while
securing profitability and liquidity.
Growth and development in the Group:
Growth, consolidation, and expansion of the
Group’s portfolio.

Ideas and innovation: Development of new
products or approaches that solve a problem
more efficiently or fulfill a need better than
existing solutions while bringing (added)
benefit.

Value generation and engagement in
the region: Positive contribution to the
economic development of the region. Charitable involvement in the neighborhood of
the airport and dialog with our stakeholders.

Attractive and responsible employer:
Protection of jobs across the Group and
provision of a working environment that is
characterized by diversity, equal opportunities, fairness, and respect. Creating good
labor conditions and development opportunities to recruit, qualify, and retain dedicated
personnel.

Noise abatement: Noise abatement in nearby residential areas and reduction of those
affected by aircraft noise.

Occupational health and safety: Maintaining and promoting the physical and mental
performance of our employees by means of
suitable measures in the areas of safety at
work and health.

Conservation of nature and resources:
Conservation of natural resources; minimization of waste and emissions of air pollutants
caused by airport operations as well as maintenance and improvement of the biodiversity
of the airport grounds.

Climate protection: Increase in energy efficiency, monitoring and minimization of the
emission of climate-relevant gases caused by
airport operations (e.g. CO2).

Our program
Our program regarding strategically important topics for responsible corporate governance is structured analogously to the areas
of activity included in the materiality matrix.
We have set concrete targets and defined the
measures required to achieve them. Each target is measurable and recorded using at least
one key performance indicator (KPI). The
KPIs enable the degree to which targets have
been achieved to be shown transparently.
The program is reviewed and updated annually. Its scope is essentially the Fraport Group,
i.e., all companies that are included in the
scope of consolidation for financial reporting.
Nevertheless, there are targets that, at the
current time, only apply to Group companies or the parent company at the Frankfurt
site. These are identified in the program
accordingly. For these targets, the aim is to
gradually expand their scope to the whole

Group. The responsibility for implementing
the measures and achieving the targets lies
with the relevant departments. You can find
the complete program on pages 28 to 31.
We report key opportunities and risks in our
current Annual Report, available in the “Investor Relations” section at www.fraport.com.

Common goals for global challenges

With Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development, the international community is expressing its
conviction that global challenges can only be solved if we all work together. The Agenda provides
the basis for making global economic progress in line with social justice and within the ecological
limits of our planet.

Agenda 2030 was adopted by all member
states at a United Nations summit in September 2015. The heart of the agenda consists of
17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
For the first time, the SDGs give equal weighting to all three dimensions of sustainability –
social, environmental, economic.

In January 2017, the Federal Cabinet adopted
the “German Sustainability Strategy – Revised 2016”. This is much influenced by the
UN Agenda 2030 and its SDGs.

Fraport AG assumes responsibility for the
health of its employees and offers comprehensive benefits to maintain and promote
their physical and mental performance.

Well-trained employees are required in a
specialized field such as managing and operating an airport. We therefore provide a wide
range of ongoing training opportunities and
offer numerous places for apprentices every
year. We also support projects, institutions
and facilities that improve the employability
of young people in the region, as well as
research and environmental education activi­
ties, through our own environmental fund.

As transport hubs, airports are sites where
resources are used intensively; it is our aim to
organize this so that resources and nature are
conserved as well as possible. Our ambitious
noise abatement goals contribute to noise
abatement in nearby residential areas and
reduction in the number of those affected
by noise at the Frankfurt site.
Areas of activity
–– “Occupational health and safety”
–– “Conservation of nature and resources”
–– “Noise abatement”

Our focus is on the eleven SDGs listed below
that are clearly within the sphere of influence
of our actions. These are listed below.

As a signatory to the UN Global Compact,
Fraport AG is particularly committed to
the objectives of Agenda 2030 and the
SDGs.

Areas of activity
–– “Attractive and responsible employer”
–– “Value generation and engagement
in the region”

Operating an airport requires a lot of water
and, at the same time, produces a large
quantity of waste water. When dealing with
the legally protected resource of water,
Fraport takes all aspects of modern water
management into account and conserves
natural resources.
Area of activity
–– “Conservation of nature and resources”

Our Group

The use of renewable energy is an essential
component for achieving the climate protection targets of Fraport AG. We continually
examine the options for use of renewable energies and manage our electricity purchasing
portfolio to keep our emission factor below
the national average. When our energy efficiency measures are exhausted, we increase
the renewable proportion in the purchasing
portfolio to bridge the gap to achieving our
climate protection targets.
Area of activity
–– “Climate protection”

Fraport is internationally one of the leading
companies in the airport business and has
set itself the goal of profitable growth and
the long-term achievement of a positive
value added in all business fields (economic
enhancement). This includes creating good
labor conditions and development opportunities to recruit, qualify, and retain dedicated
personnel.
With our value generation, we also make a
positive contribution to the economic development of the regions in which our sites
are located.
Areas of activity
–– “Economic efficiency”
–– “Growth and development in the
Group”
–– “Product quality and customer
satisfaction”
–– “Attractive and responsible employer”
–– “Value generation and engagement

Innovations are a key to competitiveness for
Fraport AG. The aim is to introduce new technologies and continuously optimize complex
processes to meet a wide range of customer
demands while staying true to our economic
and business requirements.
Area of activity
–– “Ideas and innovation”

We want to operate our business model as
sustainably as possible. To this end, compliance with international regulations on
occupational health and safety is the obvious
course for us. We consider ourselves responsible for protecting the environment, and we
expect our suppliers and service providers to
do the same.
Areas of activity
–– “Occupational health and safety”
–– “Climate protection”
–– “Conservation of nature and resources”

Operating an airport and air traffic have an impact on the environment. Fraport considers
itself responsible for taking the environmental
challenges arising from this appropriately
into account. This includes, in particular,
increasing energy efficiency, monitoring and
minimization of the emission of climate-relevant gases caused by airport operations.
Area of activity
–– “Climate protection”

As transport hubs, airports are sites where
resources are used intensively. We are committed to the maintenance and improvement
of the biodiversity of the airport grounds and
their surroundings.
Area of activity
–– “Conservation of nature and resources”

As a company operating at a global level,
Fraport bears national and international responsibility. We have made a commitment
to comply with internationally recognized
standards of conduct and are a member of
national and international working groups to
promote sustainable development.

Residents in the Leq contour, day = 60 dB(A)/contour of the envelope from NAT, night = 6 × 68 dB(A) Lmax and Leq, night = 50 dB(A)

Company Portrait

Fraport USA Inc.
(formerly AMU Holdings Inc.)

Fraport USA/Airmall was founded in 1992 at
Pittsburgh International Airport. Its area of
activity is marketing retail areas at American
airports. At all sites, Fraport USA/Airmall
has succeeded in revolutionizing the retail
and food and beverage landscape in the
terminals. For example, the shopping areas
in the terminals, which previously had only
had small stores, were expanded to include
major brands for the first time. In a joint effort
with the operators of each airport, Fraport
USA/Airmall is also developing creative
retail and food and beverage concepts
that appeal to both domestic passengers
and a broad international audience. At the
same time, healthy, positive competition
between the individual concessionaires
is being promoted at each site. Based
on the mission statement of Fraport AG,

“Gute Reise! We make it happen”, the concept of service and customer satisfaction are
always at the forefront.
As one of the leading providers for the marketing and development of retail areas at US
airports, Fraport USA/Airmall now operated
at a total of four airport sites: Baltimore/
Washington, Boston (Terminal E and B),
Cleveland and Pittsburgh. The company
currently managed more than 270 retail
and food and beverage establishments on
an area of approximately 34,000 square
meters in the passenger terminals of the four
airports. These establishments are operated
by regional, national and international concessionaires. Nearly 60 million passengers
passed through the terminals of the four
aviation hubs in 2016.

In 2014, Fraport took over the parent
company of Airmall, which at the time still
operated under the name “AMU Holdings”,
and renamed it “Fraport USA Inc.” in 2016.
Another milestone was also reached in 2016
when US airline JetBlue Airways nominated
Fraport USA/Airmall as the preferred bidder
for the development of the retail and catering
concessions at the company’s headquarters
in Terminal 5 of New York’s JFK airport. After
issuing a new tender, the Massachusetts Port
Authority (Massport) decided by vote in April
2017 against extending the contact for the
management of these airports by Fraport
USA/Airmall and instead awarded the tender
to a competitor. After seventeen years, the
company’s contract in Boston will end on
October 31, 2017.

»We attach great importance to our ACDBE programs to
promote disadvantaged groups, because both our company
and society as a whole benefit from them. This is why we have
already achieved good results in this area and have acquired
a correspondingly positive reputation.«

Revenue per passenger at record levels
As the largest airport in the metropolitan area
around the US capital of Washington D.C.,
Baltimore/Washington (IATA code: BWI) is
used by more than 25 million passengers
each year. This includes a high proportion of
passengers from the largest low-cost carrier
in the US, Southwest Airlines, for which Baltimore/Washington is an important hub on the
East Coast of the United States. In close cooperation with Southwest Airlines and other
key partners, such as the Maryland Aviation
Administration, Fraport USA/Airmall won outstanding new concessionaires for the airport
(such as Baltimore’s famous Obrycki’s, The
Silver Diner, and Phillips Famous Seafood).
Also thanks to a two-year renovation that cost
approximately US$15 million, Fraport USA/
Airmall has doubled its sales at the site since
the take-over in 2003 and set a new “revenue
per passenger” record of US$10.53 in 2016.
As a result, the retail business grew by 15 %
more than pure passenger numbers. This was
achieved through a targeted development
of space to adapt it to changing passenger
flows and target group-oriented marketing.

At the Pittsburgh International Airport (IATA
Code: PIT), “revenue per passenger” is currently significantly above the national average
and in 2016 it reached US$15.35, one of the
highest in North America. This exceptionally
solid performance is due, among other factors, to the customer surveys carried out by
Fraport USA/Airmall and the subsequent adaptation of the product portfolio. Continuous
capital expenditure in the development of
the passenger areas, the central marketplace
and the baggage claim area also contributed
to the positive performance. Just recently,
an additional US$10 million was invested to
improve the retail offer. The improvements
included the installation of two six-meterhigh video walls, from which passengers can
interactively obtain information about the
retail offers at the airport. There were also a
number of new openings of premium brands
at the airport, including the first “Bottega dei
Sapori” shop in the US. The new concessionaires also include well-known brands, such
as Collezioni – The Beauty Gallery, Furla,
Desigual, Armani Jeans and Hugo Boss. The
artistic design of the new terrazzo floor in
the central marketplace of the terminal even
attracted the attention of specialist design
magazine “Architectural Digest”.

Social Engagement
In particular, Fraport USA/Airmall promotes
small businesses, minority-owned businesses,
and businesses whose owners are part of
a disadvantaged population group (for
example, by offering training courses or
contact exchanges). Fraport USA/Airmall thus
fulfills the policy goals summarized under
the abbreviation ACDBE (Airport Concession
Disadvantaged Business Enterprise) and is
now in fact one of the leading US companies
in this area. And the engagement is paying
off: At Cleveland Airport, for example, 40 % of
revenue is generated by ACDBE businesses.
At all airports where Fraport USA/Airmall is
active, the company regularly offers activities for young entrepreneurs, women and
members of minority groups from across the
country who already manage a company or
who want to start a business. The objective
is to encourage small business owners who
contribute their entrepreneurial potential
and high levels of motivation, and to support
them in developing their businesses.

Economic enhancement

Economic
enhancement
We consider “economic enhancement” to mean the continuous
increase of our company’s value and the safeguarding and improvement of profitability while maintaining a financial balance. The goal
of economic enhancement is to achieve profitable growth and the
long-term generation of a positive value added in all business segments.
As such, we manage the Group’s development according to the principles of value management. The key figure for this is the Fraport
value added. 1) We use retained profits as the basis for future capital
expenditure and to further increase the company’s value.

1)

Fraport value added means the difference between EBIT and capital costs
(= Fraport assets × cost of capital). As of the beginning of fiscal year 2015, pre-tax results
and the carrying amounts of Group-companies accounted for using the equity method have
been added to EBIT and Fraport assets. In this way, Fraport takes account of both consolidated
companies and companies accounted for using the equity method in value management.

Specialist in loudspeakers
and clocks
Athanasios Girousis has held the title of “Group Leader for Electroacoustic Systems/Tower Crash/CAT lll/
Clock Technology” for four years. Since then, the electrical engineer has been working at Fraport. Prior to
that, he was employed by an external company involved in the construction of Pier A-Plus. After that job
was completed, he joined Fraport. The cumbersome job title encompasses a multitude of responsibilities,
mainly related to the dissemination of information to passengers and safety at Frankfurt Airport.

Athanasios Girousis: “‘Electroacoustic systems’ means all loudspeakers in the terminals.
The passengers mostly know them from gate
calls. The lovely music in the connecting
tunnel between the A and B terminals is
played through our system. But that is not

their primary purpose. The system is used
in an emergency to warn and direct passengers. If a terminal has to be evacuated, the
fire department and the police will use these
loudspeakers to provide the information.”

Girousis and his team are responsible for
ensuring that the control panel and all
connected loudspeakers are functioning
properly. Almost 30,000 loudspeakers can
be found at all levels in both terminals, so
even the furthest reaches of the airport can
be reached in an emergency.

2016 Compact

Another emergency warning system is the
so-called “crash horn”, which every airport
is required to have in accordance with the
regulations of the International Air Transport
Association. A stuck landing gear, a warning
light on the braking system – any of these
events could lead to an emergency on board
an aircraft. In such event, the pilot alerts the
tower during the approach to the airport,
and this in turn triggers the “crash horn”.
Long before the plane touches down, all the
necessary emergency services are readied to
mitigate the emergency. The signal is tested
once every morning. If the system reports
an error, it is up to Girousis and his three
employees to find and fix it.
Another safety system only activates during
bad weather. If fog or snowfall restricts the
view of the runway to under 200 meters,
pilots are required to use special approach
procedures. On the apron, red warning signs
labeled “CAT III” light up. The abbreviation
designates the different levels for the instrument landing system. CAT I is the simplest
category. For CAT II and III, aircraft and crew
need special authorizations and navigational
devices. As soon as CAT III is displayed, trips
which are not absolutely necessary for dispatch and maintenance purposes may not be
carried out for safety reasons. This applies, for
example, to visitor tours and camera crews.
Athanasios Girousis: “The signal comes from
the weather station on the airport apron. We
are responsible for ensuring that all lights
work. If one is defective, we immediately go
out and repair it, but that is the exception.
Our regular, strictly controlled maintenance
procedures virtually eliminates such failures.”
In addition to these safety-related systems,
Girousis and his team also service all the
clocks in the two terminals. Each has its own
control panel, which receives the radio signal
from the atomic clock via an antenna on the
roof. This ensures that the correct time is
displayed on all of the approximately 1,700
clocks. If one is defective, Girousis’ colleagues
fix it right away. Especially when working in
the building interiors, the wrong cable can
be quickly snipped by accident.

Economic enhancement

Athanasios Girousis: “Time is one of the most
sensitive issues at an airport. Passengers are
constantly wondering whether they will make
it to the gate on time, how long the security
check will take, how much time they have left
to shop or to grab a snack, and, of course,
whether the plane is on time. However, you
will not find digital clocks in the terminals.
That would only lead to confusion among
passengers who are unfamiliar with our 24hour system. Anyone can read a dial clock,
no matter what country they come from.”

»My contribution to
having a ‘Gute Reise’
is ensuring that the
safety systems work
and the passengers
at our airport can be
kept informed at all
times.«

Product quality and customer satisfaction
Continuous improvement of our services, reflected by a high level of customer satisfaction.
Safeguarding of the Frankfurt hub function and preservation of the Group’s competitiveness.

Customer service comes first
The customer is our top priority. This is also
reflected by our new mission statement,
“Gute Reise! We make it happen”. We consider passengers, airlines, the freight community
and the retail concessionaires to be our main
customers, and we intend to win them over
through attractive offers and the best service.
Tenants find Fraport AG’s sites are an optimal
environment for their business. We cooperate
closely with the authorities, especially in
terms of security. We consider the satisfaction
of our customers to be a key measure of our
success. In 2016, passengers at our Frankfurt
site once again confirmed their satisfaction
with us, with global satisfaction at 82 %. This
means we have reached our ambitious target
(≥ 80 % global satisfaction) for the fifth year
in a row and increased it by 2.0 percentage
points compared to the previous year.
We also maintain outstanding customer
service in the cargo sector. Readers of the
“STAT Trade Times International” once again
named FRA 2016 as the best international cargo airport. The award was presented at the

“Air Cargo India 2016” trade fair in Mumbai,
India. The prestigious “STAT Trade Times
International” was founded in 1986 and is
the market leader specialist publication for
the cargo industry.

Online shopping on the plane
The multichannel strategy has systematically
been further developed since the comprehensive redesign of the Frankfurt Airport
website and app in the previous year. The
purpose of this is to ensure that passengers
and customers are offered an optimal shopping experience at all times during their trip.
For example, the “Lounge Shopping” project
was the result of a new digital cooperation
with Lufthansa. In selected lounges, travelers
can shop at the airport shops via iPad or their
own cellphone and the products are delivered to the lounge within half an hour. The
pilot phase of the project ended successfully
in 2016, and implementation into regular
operation is planned for 2017.

At the same time, the new “Inflight Shopping” service was tested in a pilot project.
This service enables Lufthansa’s long-haul
passengers to shop online in more than
300 stores before landing in Frankfurt. The
selected products are then delivered at the
arrival gate using the new “Gate Delivery”
logistics concept immediately after landing.
Visitors and passengers who shop at the
airport both in person and online benefit
from the “Frankfurt Airport Rewards” bonus
and loyalty program, which is the only such
program of its kind worldwide. It has been
so well received that additional partners and
new bonuses are already being planned.

In 2016, the modernized access road to the arrivals level at Terminal 1 was reopened.
The outdoor area is now reminiscent of a modern city center, where barrier-free access,
digital information services and a reduction in traffic significantly enhance the experience
of pedestrians.

82 % passenger satisfaction
With the “Great to have you here!” service
initiative launched in 2010, passenger satisfaction at Frankfurt Airport in terms of quality
and service has increased over the last six
years from 70 % to 82 %. In five sub-initiatives,
directions and signposting, ambiance and
comfort in the terminal, and the range of
relaxation, working, and entertainment options on offer were all significantly improved.
Because employees are such a key factor for
customer satisfaction in the terminals, there
is also a sub-initiative for employees. 1,300
employees already participated in this program in 2016.

The Service Quality Committee, an association of companies and partners at Frankfurt
Airport, was also established. The aim is to
strengthen the partnership-based cooperation in the interest of the common customers,
guests and travelers. Service guidelines were
defined and adopted. In them, the participating partners affirm their desire and joint
responsibility to further develop the Frankfurt
Airport site. The focus is always on the travelers and guests from all over the world and
on ensuring the consistently high quality of
all processes. Achieving this requires solid
cooperation in a spirit of trust between the
partners, authorities, and service providers.
The objective is to provide the most seamless

possible experience for travelers and guests,
with the goal of using a positive experience
to make a connection between the airport
and the customer in order to improve the
airport’s competitive position.
Even employees who are not in daily contact
with passengers contribute to the airport’s
positive image. In the year under review, over
1,000 of them have been trained as “service
ambassadors” already. Whether they are on
their way to appointments or staying in the
terminal after finishing work, they are always
available to talk to passengers and will gladly
provide assistance.

Largest pharmaceutical hub in Europe
Aircraft do more than just make travel possible for passengers in all countries all over the world.
As the largest German cargo hub – and one of the most important sites in Europe – Frankfurt
Airport provides the infrastructure that the export-oriented German economy needs to be
able to react quickly with its goods and services in the major growth markets. Automotive
and IT products as well perishable goods and products of the pharmaceutical industry are
transported via this major hub. In 2016, around 100,000 tons of vaccines, pharmaceuticals
and other pharmaceutical products were handled at Frankfurt Airport, making Frankfurt the
largest pharmaceutical distribution hub in Europe.
Transporting this sensitive cargo requires particularly reliable and professional handling.
FRA has more than 7,000 m² of certified, temperature-controlled handling areas. At the end
of this year, more than 10,000 m² will be available. During transport on the apron, special
thermo transporters guarantee a constant temperature of – 30 to +30 degrees Celsius before the goods are loaded into the aircraft’s cargo space, which is brought to the correct
temperature in advance.
To expand its leading market position, Fraport and Air Cargo Community Frankfurt are seeking
continuous certification of the process chain. In 2017, 95 % of the freight handling and 85 %
of transports on the apron will be awarded the CEIV (Center of Excellence of Independent
Validators) pharmaceutical certification of the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

Joint marketing and optimization
of the equipment fleet
Our Customer Service Center offers our
airline customers a direct point of contact
for operational problems and a source of
advance information for building works or
operational changes. Fraport also supports
and advises airlines on their strategic planning in relation to the FRA hub. Together
with airlines, we celebrate the introduction
of new aircraft or the opening of new routes,
such as the first Lufthansa flight to Panama
or the opening of the Frankfurt – Shenzhen
route by Air China. With Air China and Beijing Airport, Fraport has also agreed on the
expansion of frequencies between Frankfurt
and Beijing. In addition to joint marketing
activities, passenger and VIP services in particular will be adapted to the specific needs
of the countries.
A new IT system for ground services enables
optimized allocation of the ground support
equipment (GSE) fleet. In 2014, pallet loaders
and ground power units were already fully
equipped with onboard modules. Operating hours, operational and maintenance
status data, as well as fault notifications and
location information via GPS via the signals
transmitted are visualized in the system and
in reports. A digital airport map displays all
equipment. The new system has increased
availability and significantly optimized the
fleet. Since 2016, the system has been linked
to the IDD flight information service, meaning that aircraft and flight events and their
individual status are shown on the digital
airport map. The trial is already proving successful. In addition, a further 320 onboard
modules were installed in equipment types
such as container loaders, belt loaders, and
passenger stairways, meaning that over
520 pieces of equipment are now included
in the system.

Good grades for FRA as a cargo site
A customer satisfaction analysis was carried
out for the cargo sector in 2016 for the first
time in several years. In the customer barometer for cargo, in which more than 90 FRAbased airlines, general sales agents, freight
forwarders and cargo handlers were consulted, around 70 % of the customers were
satisfied or very satisfied with the site and
would recommend it to others. The respondents gave the best grades for the handling
of specialty products, especially perishable

Economic enhancement

goods, and the handling of animals. The
reliability of the freight processes received
especially high praise. Our customers gave
this area the best grades compared to other
European competitors.
The CargoCity User Committee was launched
last year at the request of our customers to
meet customer needs for more personalized
service and to strengthen participation in the
discussion on the development and design
of the site. The parties involved meet up to
discuss concerns such as catering and infrastructure connection.

IT innovations in the cargo sector
The airport’s “FAIR@Link” cargo community
system, launched in 2015, is one of the most
comprehensive IT systems in the world.
The data platform allows users to exchange

relevant shipment data between companies.
Freight forwarders, cargo handlers, and
customs are also connected to the system.
This causes simplified interfaces and improved
processes. The standardization already paid
off in 2016: The processes were significantly
streamlined overall. The system was well
received among users and they reported
30 % more shipments via FAIR@Link than in
the previous year.
In an innovative promotion of the further
development of the site in the air freight
sector, Fraport, working with the DVV Media
Group, sent out invitations to the first Frankfurt Air Cargo Innovation Lab in 2016. Sector
leaders met with industry and academia to
discuss how digitalization, big data and new
technologies will change the air cargo supply
chain and what new business models may
arise from it.

Group result significantly above previous year
Financially, the Fraport Group had a positive
performance in 2016. This was due in particular to two one-off effects. First, the sale of
shares in Thalita Trading Ltd., the parent company of the operating company of Pulkovo
Airport in St. Petersburg, increased the Group
result by €35.9 million. Second, the payment
of compensation in connection with the
Manila project had a positive effect on the
result in the amount of €189.6 million. As a
result, the Group result rose significantly by
€103.3 million to €400.3 million, reflecting
slightly lower passenger numbers in Frankfurt. Net retail revenue per passenger was
€3.49 (previous year: €3.62) as a result of
passenger development at Frankfurt Airport
and lower spending behavior by travelers
from China, Russia, and Japan as well as the
depreciation of various currencies against the
Euro, which led to a loss of purchasing power.

There were also one-off effects on the
expense side. To respond to the intense
competition, particularly in the personnel-intensive business units at the Frankfurt site,
the Executive Board launched a personnel
restructuring program, which increased
personnel expenses due to provisions in the
amount of €37.7 million. In addition, a total
of just under €30 million was recognized
as an impairment of the goodwill of FraSec
GmbH and the Boston concession within
Fraport USA Inc.

Strong result in Lima and Bulgaria
Group companies Lima (Peru) and Twin Star
(Bulgaria) contributed just over €15 million
to result growth and almost €20 million to
EBITDA growth. These positive performances

were primarily based on significant growth in
traffic. The Varna and Burgas airports benefited from the tense geopolitical situation in
Turkey and North Africa. Due to the significantly lower traffic volume in international
traffic, the Group company Antalya posted a
sharp decline in financial figures, which negatively impacted the financial result by around
€16 million. With dynamic traffic growth
continuing to provide a positive impact,
the investment in Xi’an contributed almost
€3 million more to the Group result in 2016.
In connection with the Group-wide traffic
growth expected for the 2017 fiscal year
and the operational take-over of the Greek
regional airports, the Executive Board expects
a 2017 Group result of between around
€310 million and about €350 million. The
operational take-over and the related financing

2016 Compact

Economic enhancement

of the concessions will also simultaneously
have a negative impact on the financial result.
The uncertainties the Fraport Group faces in
2017 are mainly due to the difficulty in forecasting the development of tourist markets
as a result of terrorist attacks.
For detailed information on the development
of the result in the past fiscal year and the outlook for 2017, please refer to the “Results of
operations” and “Business outlook” chapters
in the 2016 Annual Report.

Group debt is declining
Over the past fiscal year, Fraport Group
generated operating cash flow of around
€583 million. The reasons for this decline
were higher taxes on income paid compared to the previous year. After deducting
capital expenditure in Frankfurt and the
airport investments – taking account of dividend inflows from Group companies – the
company still had free cash flow of almost
€302 million. These funds were mainly
used again in 2016 to service the dividend
payment for the 2015 fiscal year (just under
€139 million) and to repay financial liabilities.
In total, Fraport significantly reduced its
net financial debt over the past year from
€2.77 billion to €2.36 billion. In addition to
the free cash flow, this positive development
is the result of the increase in cash and cash

equivalents (liquidity), in connection with
the compensation payment from the Manila
project. Relative to the shareholders’ equity
(excluding the minority interests and the
amount planned for dividends), this means
that leverage (a gearing ratio) is around 65 %.
Compared with the previous year, this is a
decrease of almost 19 percentage points.
This was 2.2 times EBITDA (the operating
result before interest, taxes, depreciation,
and amortization). In the previous year net
financial debt was 3.3 times EBITDA.
For the fiscal year 2017, the Executive Board
expects a sustained positive free cash flow
that will be at or slightly below 2016 levels.
With the operational take-over of the 14 Greek
regional airports, there will be a significant
increase in net financial debt and the leverage
in fiscal year 2017.

ROFRA of 11.4 % signals economic
enhancement
To permanently increase the company’s
value, Fraport specifically draws parallels between the development of the results of operations and the asset and financial position.
In this context, Fraport calculates the ratio of
the operating result achieved before interest
and taxes (EBIT) to the capital that is used to
generate the result (value-oriented management principle). In the past fiscal year, assets
totaling €6.07 billion (“Fraport assets”) were

offset by an EBIT including earnings before
taxes of the Group companies accounted for
using the equity method in the amount of
€691 million. Using a pre-tax cost of capital
(WACC) for Fraport of 8.6 %, in 2016 the
ongoing capital costs to achieve the adjusted
EBIT amounted to €522 million. The EBIT beyond this amount of €169 million means that
Fraport once again earned its capital costs
in the past fiscal year and “created value”
Group-wide. This economic enhancement
is also visible in the “ROFRA”, the return on
Fraport assets, which was 11.4 % in the past
fiscal year and exceeded the pre-tax cost of
capital by 2.8 percentage points.
With regard to the company’s business fields,
the Group segments Retail & Real Estate and
External Activities & Services recorded a
sustained high ROFRA of 14.9 % and 31.0 %,
respectively, in 2016, whereas the Aviation
and Ground Handling segments did not earn
their cost of capital in the past fiscal year with
a ROFRA of 2.9 % and – 0.6 %, respectively.
The strong performance of the External
Activities & Services segment is primarily the
result of the sale of shares in Thalita Trading
Ltd. and the compensation payment from
the Manila project. These effects significantly
increased the EBIT of the segment.

Geopolitical crises change traffic flows
Above all, the travel market was affected
by geopolitical crises in 2016. A growing
intensity of terrorist attacks in certain traditional tourist destinations in the eastern
Mediterranean region and North Africa, as
well as a latent threat of terrorism in Western
Europe led to increasing uncertainty among
travelers. This led not only to changes in
the choice of transport modes, but also to a
shift in traffic flows. Demand was down for
destinations in the eastern Mediterranean
region, while the western Mediterranean
enjoyed increased numbers. Insufficient
capacity for accommodation there led to
increased traffic to neighboring countries
(for example Austria) and a shift from air
travel to car, bus and train travel. Individual
destinations outside Europe also benefited
from shifts in demand (for example Central
America). Overall, intercontinental traffic
stagnated, however, as from the fall onwards
demand for incoming travel, including from
the Far East and North America, dropped as
a consequence of terrorist attacks in Europe.
European traffic (excluding Germany) decreased by 0.7 % in the reporting period.
Domestic traffic posted the highest growth
rate at 0.9 %. Frankfurt benefited domestically
from transfer passengers bound for Berlin.

Slightly declining passenger numbers
in Frankfurt
Passenger demand was down slightly in the
reporting year. This resulted in the second
highest level of passenger numbers recorded to date at Frankfurt Airport at just over
60.8 million passengers. This figure fell
short of the previous year’s level by around
250,000 passengers (– 0.4 %). The year was
once again characterized by cancellations
due to strikes.
Cargo volume grew by 1.8 % in 2016 to
around 2.1 million metric tons. This performance was noticeably better in the second
half of the year at 2.8 % compared to the
first six months (+0.7 %), which reflected the
recovery in the global economy that started
in the summer. After a weak start to the year,
the appreciation of the US$ in the second
half of the year created a significantly positive
stimulus for cargo loaded in Frankfurt bound
for the USA. In contrast to the previous year,
air freight traffic with China grew significantly
in 2016.
As a result of the cancellations due to strikes
and the trend of using larger aircraft that
extended to the autumn, aircraft movements

were down in 2016. Movements in Frankfurt decreased by 1.1 % compared to the
previous year with approximately 463,000
take-offs and landings. In contrast, the maximum take-off weights increased slightly and
achieved a new record value of just over
29.7 million metric tons (+0.4 %).

Unequal dynamic at the Group sites
At Ljubljana Airport, passenger numbers
in fiscal year 2016 were down by 2.3%
compared to the previous year at around
1.4 million. While there was an increase in
the number of passengers on connections
to Paris and Belgrade, the volume for connections to and from Istanbul, Zurich, and
Brussels declined.
Lima Airport once again recorded strong
growth in the number of passengers in fiscal
year 2016 of 10.1 % to just over 18.8 million.
Both domestic traffic (+10.1 %) and international traffic (+10.2 %) grew in the reporting
period. Cargo throughput was around
288,000 metric tons. This figure was below
the previous year’s level (– 4.3 %).

The Bulgarian airports in Varna and Burgas
carried around 4.6 million passengers in the
reporting period and thus around 21.5 %
more than in the previous year. Both sites
benefited from the tense geopolitical situation in Turkey and North Africa. Travelers
from Germany, Russia, Poland and the UK
in particular favored Bulgaria as a holiday
destination.
With just over 19.0 million passengers in fiscal
year 2016, Antalya Airport posted a decline
of 30.9 %. While the number of passengers
traveling within Turkey once again increased
significantly by 10.4 % to nearly 7.0 million,
the number of international passengers fell
by 43.2 % to around 12.1 million. The drop
was primarily attributed to the lack of travelers
coming from Russia and Western Europe.
With just over 5.4 million passengers in fiscal
year 2016, the Hanover site recorded a slight
decrease of 0.8 %. The significant decline in
tourist traffic to the eastern Mediterranean region was not completely offset by the switch
to alternative holiday destinations.

At just under 13.3 million travelers, passenger
traffic at St. Petersburg Airport saw a decrease
in the past fiscal year of 1.7 % compared to
the previous year. Whereas international
traffic noticeably decreased by 11.1 % due to
the difficult economic and political situation
in Russia, national traffic increased by 5.0 %.
Xi’an Airport continued to record dynamic development as passenger numbers increased
by 12.2 % to approximately 37.0 million.
High-volume domestic traffic also rose by
12.0 % to around 35.0 million passengers.
International traffic grew by 16.1 % to around
2.0 million passengers.
In the reporting period, Delhi Airport
achieved significant growth of 21.0 % com­
pared to the previous year with around
55.6 million travelers, in particular due to
the strong growth of the Indian economy.
Noticeable growth continued to be reported
in domestic traffic, with a strong increase of
26.2 %. International passenger numbers
increased by 8.8 %. Freight volume also
showed a significant rise again (+9.5 %).

14 new Group airports
In April 2017, Fraport took over the 14 Greek
regional airports and commenced their
operation. The airports include the mainland
airports of Thessaloniki, Aktion, and Kavala,
and the island airports of Chania on Crete,
Kefalonia, Kerkyra on Corfu, Kos, Mykonos,
Mytilini on Lesbos, Rhodes, Samos, Santorini,
Skiathos and Zakynthos. At the time of the
take-over, Fraport Greece employed around
450 people. Fraport expects capital expenditure on the infrastructure of the airports of
around €400 million in the first four years.
In 2016, the overall portfolio posted significant growth in passenger numbers of 9 %.
Because of the operational take-over of the
airports, the Fraport Group will generate
additional revenue of around €200 million
and additional EBITDA of around €100 million
in fiscal year 2017.

Ideas and innovation
Development of new products or approaches that solve a problem more efficiently or fulfill a need
better than existing solutions while bringing (added) benefit.

Innovation through experience
and creativity
At Fraport, promoting innovation is an
integral part of the company's goals and
its management principles. The practical
implementation poses management and
employees of our company major challenges
because, for us, innovation is not an end in
itself. The aim is rather to meet a wide range
of both customer and business management
requirements through the introduction of
new technology and the ongoing optimization of complex processes. In order to make
optimum use of all potential, the company’s
idea management system brings together
employee creativity, while innovation management is oriented towards projects with
partners or customers as well as close cooperation with scientific institutions.
Over the past three years, the company
has succeeded in increasing the financial benefit of the ideas or maintaining
it at the target level. For example, many
employees have useful suggestions for

process improvements. This demonstrates
the important role played by the experience and internal knowledge of the staff.
The 633 submitted ideas, of which 62 were
implemented, testify to their know-how and
creativity in the year under review.
In addition, new approaches have been
successfully tested: some business units
are increasingly gaining experience in design thinking in this way. The possibilities
for knowledge exchange and cooperation
between units are supported, for example,
by wikis, chats and temporary labs. At the
Fraport Innovation Challenge in the summer
of 2016, for the first time external users submitted over 600 ideas – a record number. The
departments have since then been examining
the implementation of the winning ideas,
e.g., creating an Innovation Space in the
terminal for targeted networking through to
the possible development and testing of the
first test products.

Ideas that are proven to work are continued:
Fraport has been working with the “House of
Logistics and Mobility” since its foundation
in 2009. The platform for interdisciplinary
and cross-industry cooperation between
business, science, politics, and civil society
in the Frankfurt suburb Gateway Gardens is
located right next to the airport. The focus is
on coordinated cooperation with other companies and regional academic institutions.
The aim is to support innovative logistics
projects and technical developments and to
further increase the appeal of the Frankfurt
site. Fraport also benefits from the academic
research at Frankfurt University of Applied
Sciences, which is located at HOLM. Jointly
defined problems are tackled on site at Frankfurt Airport and managed by Fraport. These
include numerous academic theses.

Using a fully functional model
that they built themselves,
Galip Özdemir and Andreas
Breycha (from left) from the
“Ground Services” section
showed their idea for equipping the ground power unit
with a warning signal.

Warning before resumption of taxiing
If aircraft are not docked directly at the terminals but are instead parked on the apron,
a mobile ground power unit supplies them
with power. In the past, the power unit or
the aircraft have been repeatedly damaged
by improper removal of the connector. Two
ground services employees had an idea on

how to prevent this: an acoustic warning
signal. If the connectors are not correctly
removed from the aircraft and stowed on
the ground power unit, the signal sounds as
soon as the driver tries to dock the towbar
from the power unit to the towing unit. The
connectors have to be checked and correctly

secured on the power unit in order to shut
off the warning signal and move the unit.
In the future, this will prevent damage to the
unit and to aircraft.

Installation help for restroom sinks
Fraport has been renovating the restrooms
in the terminals for some time. New sinks are
being installed as part of the renovations and
whenever there is damage to the bathrooms.
Until now, the sinks have been difficult to
install. It took two or three employees several
hours to install a sink. This method bothered
Joachim Saft, at Fraport subsidiary GCS (Gesellschaft für Cleaning Service). He worked
on the project until he had developed a holder that enables a single employee to install
the sink in a third of the time. In addition to
the considerably reduced amount of work
required, sinks are now less frequently damaged during installation, which helps avoid
additional costs for replacements.

Aerodrom Ljubljana, d.o.o.
Aerodrom Ljubljana, d.o.o. operates the largest international airport in Slovenia. Letališce
Jožeta Pucnika Ljubljana Airport is the airport
of the capital city of Slovenia and the home
base of Slovenian airline Adria Airways. The
company was founded in 1963 and has been
wholly owned by Fraport AG since 2015.

The strategic goals of the company with its
approximately 400 employees include sustained growth in the passenger and cargo
sector, the long-term development of the
airport to an airport city and the successful inauguration of the Fraport Aviation Academy.

The airport benefits from its strategically
attractive geographical location at the intersection of the traffic flows between the
Carpathian Basin and the Po Valley as well as
the corridor from the Middle East through
the Bosporus to the European Union. The
airport had around 1.4 million passengers
and 32,700 aircraft movements in 2016.

Traffic development and expansion

The management consists of Zmago Skobir,
(CEO), Robert Gradišar (COO), Dr. Babett
Stapel (CFO and CCO), and Thomas Uihlein
(CAO).

Aerodrom Ljubljana recorded a slight decline in passengers in 2016, mainly due to
the restructuring of the home carrier Adria
Airways. There were also challenges, such
as increasingly high traffic peaks.
In the summer, Ljubljana airport served 29
destinations in 22 countries with more than
220 flights per week; in the winter there were
direct flights to 22 destinations in 18 countries with more than 180 flights a week. Two
new airlines, Poland-based Lot and Greece-

based Aegean Airlines, have been added,
while low-cost carriers expanded their presence. Dutch airline Transavia announced new
flights to Amsterdam starting from the 2017
summer flight schedule. These and other
airlines that are expanding their routes or
starting to serve the airport will benefit from
a new charge table, which entered into force
in April 2017.
Significant steps for the future expansion
of the airport were carried out in 2016, including the construction of the new bypass.
Planning for a modification of the terminal
infrastructure is in the final phase. Fraport
Aviation Academy, a newly established center of excellence, is designed to meet the
training needs of companies in the Fraport
Group – in particular airport investments –
and of its customers. The Academy will provide training for airport-specific occupations
and expertise.

Executive Director Operations

»We are aware that sufficient noise abatement is highly important to the quality of life of our neighbors. In 2016, as part of
our package of measures to reduce noise pollution from aircraft,
we therefore built a noise-reduction forest at Ljubljana Airport
together with our neighboring municipality of Šencur. It covers
an area of 7.34 hectares and protects the population of the
municipality in particular from ground noise generated by
aircraft during engine test runs or while taxiing on the airfield.
To this end, a total of 10,500 young trees and 2,400 shrubs
were planted in the area. The plants were grown in Slovenia and
are adapted to the plants typical to the region. In addition,
the noise-reduction forest is designed in such a way that it can
also be used as a recreational area by the municipality of Šencur.«

Reducing CO2, increasing customer
satisfaction
Since 2013, Aerodrom Ljubljana has been
continuously working to reduce its carbon
footprint. As part of the ACI Airport Carbon
Accreditation, the global standard for CO2
reporting and management at airports, the
company was able to renew its Level 2 (“Reduction”) certificate. The objective is to reach
Level 3+ (“Neutrality”) by the year 2020.
Aerodrom Ljubljana also continuously strives
for high quality in the area of customer satis­
faction. As a part of these efforts, the plan
is for the airport to be further developed

in accordance with the requirements of
passengers, airlines, and other business
partners. Regular surveys show where action
is needed.
The qualification and motivation of employees are a prerequisite for long-term
successful development of a company. This
is why continuous education and training of
employees and measures for occupational
health and safety need to be standard. In
addition, Aerodrom Ljubljana makes it easier for its employees to achieve a work-life
balance. The company was awarded the
“Family Friendly Company” certificate for its
efforts in this area.

In accordance with national and international
regulations, airport noise is measured at
the four most exposed points below the
approach and departure routes. Aerodrom
Ljubljana regularly provides information
about these noise measurements and has
made an interactive application for noise
monitoring available. In addition, in 2016
the company launched a project to reduce
noise pollution in the neighboring town with
a noise-protection forest.

From the outlet
to the apron lights
Fraport AG offers 110 places for apprentices every year. Talented young people are being sought for work
in 19 commercial and technical areas, such as IT, mechatronics, and facility cleaning services. There are
also eight dual-study courses, including industrial engineering and aviation management. Three years
ago, twins Adrian and Kevin Grellneth were among the “newbies” at the airport. Together they started
training as electronics technicians for building and infrastructure systems.

Adrian Grellneth: “Fraport guarantees each
apprentice a job for one year. That’s a generous offer. I’m glad that we can continue to
be part of the Group for now.”
During their apprenticeships, the brothers
had the opportunity to familiarize themselves
with different departments. Apprenticeships
at Fraport are designed so that the apprentices can work in as many technical areas as
possible. This maximizes the chances that

everyone will find a job that meets their
personal expectations. The technical training
is supplemented by training courses at our
cooperation partner Pittler ProRegion Berufsausbildung GmbH in Langen. The company
is owned by the City of Langen (since 1997)
and the Foundation ProRegion of Fraport AG
(since 2006). The many years of cooperation
are paying off. Fraport’s apprentices regularly
obtain the best grades at the exams of the
Frankfurt Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

The percentage who do not finish is extremely low.
Kevin Grellneth: “What I enjoyed most was
the time with the team that was responsible
for the maintenance of the parking garages.
The work there was mostly about the maintenance or repair of the lighting and heating
systems.”

»Our contribution to ‘Gute Reise’ is that
all systems that contribute to the comfort
and safety of passengers are regularly
maintained and that the passengers
at Frankfurt Airport feel comfortable.«

The twins also learned about the maintenance of the lighted emergency exit signs in
the public areas as well as the maintenance of
the HVAC systems that regulate temperature
and humidity in the terminals. In Pier A-Plus,
Adrian Grellneth worked in the department
that checks the fire and gas detection systems. His tasks also included the repair of the
employee time card readers.
During their apprenticeships, Adrian and
Kevin Grellneth serviced and repaired a wide
variety of electrical systems at the airport.
They also worked on the apron. Under the
guidance of the employees of the so-called
lighting guidance system workshop, they
inspected and repaired the components of
the runway lighting guidance system, such
as the blue taxiway edge lights. The towers
for the floodlights require the same regular
inspections.

In another part of their apprenticeship, they
learned how to check the pipe heating systems, which ensure that the water pipes do
not freeze. This task is scheduled for the fall
of each year. It is not an easy one when you
consider the long distances on the airport
site. Their duties also include maintenance
of the elevators and escalators. The outlets
in the terminals in which passengers charge
their cellphones and other mobile devices
must be regularly checked and damaged
components replaced. In addition to safety,
passenger comfort is our top priority.

recognizing and valuing employee diversity
as well as including it in the corporate culture.
This goal is accommodated by countless

competitive and secure jobs in the long term
in the aviation industry, with rising costs and
competitive pressure, we are increasingly
emphasizing a lifecycle-oriented approach
to our personnel development and work
organization, and focusing on strengthening the employer brand both internally and
externally.

50 years of apprenticeships
Fraport AG has an almost 50-year tradition of
apprenticeships. As one of the largest companies offering apprenticeships in the region,
we provide at least 110 young people with an
job opportunity in one of more than 30 training courses or dual study courses each year.
This is up from just four careers at the beginning of the 1980s. There are also a number of
special programs targeting the qualifications
of young people just starting out in their
careers. The training program is based on
our own requirements, but it also has a high
level of continuity. Anniversary year 2016
had the motto “30 – 20 – 10 years”. We have

assistants since 1986 – around 400 so far.
Since 1996, Fraport has been cooperating
with the University of Baden-Württemberg
in providing technical work/study programs
(dual study). And in 2006, the dual study
program “Aviation Management” was introduced together with Frankfurt University of
Applied Sciences and other partners from the
aviation industry.
In view of the demographic change, apprenticeships are indispensable for bringing the
next generation of young people into the
company. Training programs based on our
requirements and training concepts that
are appropriate for the target groups make
a significant contribution towards meeting
medium-term needs for qualified new employees. The key challenges of the coming
years, which will require additional efforts
and innovative pathways, especially in the
area of recruitment, are declining secondary-school graduation rates, which result
in a lower number of applications for our
technical apprenticeships, with a continuing
trend towards university attendance.
This also makes retaining trained young
people in the company more important,

because retirements will increase starting in
2019 and the average period of employment
of the apprentices who complete our training
is declining.

Integration through training
The influx of people from crisis areas around
the world also presents new challenges.
Together with companies from Frankfurt,
the City of Frankfurt, the Federal Agency
for Labor, the Chamber of Industry and
Commerce, and Gesellschaft für Jugendbeschäftigung, since 2015 we have developed
a qualification program for the professional
integration of young refugees (BIFF), which
we launched with nine young refugees in
cooperation with Pittler ProRegion Berufsausbildung GmbH in 2016. The program is
designed for career orientation, preparation
for apprenticeships and the improvement of
language skills. Following this measure, the
aim is to offer apprenticeships to as many of
the participants as possible. This program
complements the special programs that are
already established: “Jugend Mobil” (since
1999) and “Startklar” (since 2012).

Occupational health and safety
Maintaining and promoting the physical and mental performance of our employees
by means of suitable measures in the areas of safety at work and health.

Enhancement of the prevention culture
Accident prevention not only has the aim of
personal safety, but is also very important
from an economic point of view. Because
only a fraction of the accidents can be
attributed to technical causes in today’s
world of work, modern concepts and practical measures focus on the “human factor”.
Good prevention culture means that safety
and health are systematically and holistically
integrated into the processes and structures
of the company. Increasing the independent
sense of responsibility of all employees, and
in particular of managers, is the primary goal.
Comprehensive measures to ensure our high
standards of work safety are required, for
example, when handling hazardous materials, in ground services handling processes,
in maintenance, in internal transport and
traffic, and during infrastructure construction
activities. The aim is to reduce the number
of notifiable work accidents in the Group per
1,000 employees to below 25 in 2020 and
for it to continue to reduce.

Innovations in the baggage service
The accident figures for the ground services
at the Frankfurt site have recently declined
significantly, including among the employees
of the FraGround subsidiary (formerly APS)
who work there. Nevertheless, the proportion of physically demanding components
is still very high. The activities of the operational employees have hardly changed for
either aircraft handling or baggage service
in recent years. The increasing average age
and decreased resilience require jobs and

processes that are appropriate for the ages
of the employees and adapted to the aging
process. To this end, innovative solutions are
required. At the Frankfurt site, Fraport has
already implemented initial measures in areas
where it has direct influence. For example,
lifting aids for loading and unloading baggage carts and containers were introduced,
and workplaces were redesigned to be more
ergonomic.

Employees

Reduce loads with exo-skeletons
Together with institutes from science and production, Fraport has been
conducting a feasibility study on the usability of exo-skeletons at the
Frankfurt site since 2016. Worn on the body, the machine supports and
enhances the movements of the wearer. Among other things, exoskeletons
are developed for industrial applications, such as for lifting heavy loads.
Available components are to be adapted for the work in aircraft handling
and the baggage service, and a check will be made as to whether the
physical stresses of our employees can be significantly reduced.

In aircraft handling there are only limited
possibilities for making workplaces more
ergonomic and safer. The airplanes are the
property of the airlines, which equip them
according to meet their specific requirements. That is why we are looking for technical measures that provide relief for loaders.
In addition, Fraport is in talks with the airlines
and the regulatory authorities to achieve
the most long-term improvements possible
directly at the base.
Accident trends show that our Group is on
the right track with its measures. With a rate
per 1,000 employees (number of notifiable
work accidents per 1,000 employees) at the
Frankfurt site of 25.9 and in the Group of
23.9, we reached record low levels in 2016.

Tailor-made offerings
Maintaining the long-term health, performance, and therefore the productivity of
our employees is now more than ever the
focus of our HR management when faced

with the changing age structure within the
Group. Through our preventive health management, we contribute to maintaining the
performance of our employees and prevent
health risks arising at work.
The increasing requirements for efficiency
and flexibility as well as physically demanding
activities are burdens that have to be dealt
with at an early stage. The rising average
age of employees represents an additional
challenge. Our employees are therefore regularly informed about healthy measures and
behaviors, and their workplaces are set up ergonomically, including in the administrative
area. To protect their health, our prevention
program ranges from regular occupational
health checks to tailor-made offerings.
In 2016, Fraport offered supplementary
occupational health insurance to all Group
employees at the Frankfurt site. Checkups,
dentures, non-medical practitioners and
eyeglasses are reimbursed at moderate
premium rates. Families can also join in the
insurance. The Global Corporate Challenge

focused on increasing personal movement.
Equipped with a step counter, participants
measured their daily activity levels and competed against each other in groups of seven
employees and against the teams of other
companies around the world. In 100 days,
756 employees in administrative and operational areas increased their daily activity
level from an average of 12,800 steps to
around 16,900. Other sports like swimming
or cycling were also taken into account.
The “Weight Watchers at Work” program
continues to be very popular. A seventh
series of courses started in 2016. More than
800 employees have participated in the
courses so far.

Lima Airport Partners S.R.L.
Jorge Chávez International Airport (JCIA) was
opened on December 30, 1965. In 2001, the
Peruvian government transferred the concession right for the operation and management
of the airport to Lima Airport Partners S.R.L
(LAP), a company whose majority shareholder is Fraport AG, for a term of 30 years.
The first modernization work undertaken on
the airport infrastructure included updating
the sanitary facilities, the electrical and
communications systems and the technical
equipment.
Since the concession was taken over, the area
of the airport has almost doubled and the
operation has been aligned with international
standards as part of two investment pro-

grams. The airport had around 18.8 million
passengers and 177,000 aircraft movements
in 2016. This means that air traffic has quadrupled since 2001. Jorge Chávez International
Airport was voted the best South American
airport for six consecutive years as part of
Skytrax’s World Airline Awards. In 2016 approximately 500 employees worked at LAP.
The company is led by CEO Juan José Salmón.
The airport now almost reaches its capacity
limits in peak times. To ensure quality of
service and to meet the increasing demands
of passengers and airlines, LAP has launched
an extensive expansion program. The expansion includes a new passenger terminal and
a second runway, along with the necessary

infrastructure. The Peruvian Ministry of
Transport and Communications (MTC) has
already started to provide the necessary land
for the expansion. In 2016, the LAP team
responsible for the airport expansion was
primarily concerned with the conception
and design of the second runway and the
new terminal building, with an emphasis on
efficiency and safety.

Discussion on airport expansion
Important projects in 2016 included informing the public and strengthening relations
with the neighboring communities around
the airport. The focus was on providing

information on LAP’s compliance with environmental obligations and answering questions on the expansion. In a two-day period,
employees conducted 30 interviews with
interest groups representing the residents
of the surrounding towns. About 600 citizens from the 23 neighboring communities
participated.
Another project focusing on dealing with
passengers was the “Smile – a fresh breeze
is blowing at the airport” initiative. It encouraged local residents to be friendly towards
passengers and visitors at the airport. The
initiative is designed to promote the peaceful
coexistence of residents and visitors in all areas of the airport and provide a regulated and
swift flow of traffic and efficient operations in
the terminal.

“Club LAP” and “Academia LAP”
for employees
“Club LAP” is company’s extensive program
of optional supplementary benefits for all
employees. The frequency of shift changes
was increased to help employees create a
better work-life balance. Among other measures, specific sports programs and additional
opportunities for the employees to participate in sports are offered on the renovated
sports field. A new bus line was also set up
for employees. As part of the “Academia
LAP” training program developed by Human
Resources in 2016, employees in operational
areas are offered specific training courses for
soft skills and dealing with customers.
Based on the results of a survey on the subject
of the working environment, for the first time

LAP was included on the list of the 50 best
employers in Peru in 2016. LAP received the
award during the renewal of the certificate
for “Business Activities” from the Peruvian
Asociación de Empleadores (Employers
Association).
The number of work accidents fell to just seven in 2016 from 18 in the previous year. The
issue of sun protection is of particular importance because of the location of the airport.
Among other measures, LAP installed devices
that continuously measure UV radiation and
display the figures on a display panel. The
goal is to increase awareness about the risks
of UV radiation. This particularly applies to
employees and contractors who are exposed
to direct sunlight, for example, when they are
on the apron.

Fraport is internationally one of the leading companies in the airport
business and, with Frankfurt Airport, operates one of the world’s most
important aviation hubs. About 81,000 people work at Frankfurt Airport
and 18,300 of these work solely for Fraport. As an active partner for
the region, we support sports, social, and cultural clubs and institutions.
In addition, Fraport has also always been committed to contributing
to the reduction of aircraft noise pollution. We are continuously
attempting to reduce noise pollution through active and passive
noise abatement measures.

Transparency is paramount
when it comes to aircraft noise
Daphne Goldmann is a physicist, and she understands the issues of aircraft noise and noise abatement
from many angles. Before joining Fraport in 2001, she worked as a noise abatement specialist and expert
for different engineering firms. Today, she manages the Aircraft Noise Measurement and Assessment
department. Her team, which consists of seven aircraft noise controllers and two specialists for evaluation
and reporting, has a core mission: It operates a monitoring system around the clock for the automatic
measurement of aircraft noise.

Daphne Goldmann: “Measuring, assessing
and reporting regularly on aircraft noise is
part of the public service mission of each
airport. This is a service for the airlines, the
supervisory authority, the commission for
protection against aircraft noise and the
municipalities – and especially for the people
in the Rhine-Main region. Transparency is
paramount. This is why I am often underway

in the area surrounding the airport and informing local residents. I am also a member of
research committees and involved in various
programs for active noise abatement.”
Frankfurt Airport is an international pioneer
in the field of noise abatement and has been
setting standards for aircraft noise monitoring
for decades. The first measurements were car-

ried out in 1964. The measuring network has
been continuously adapted and expanded
since then. Five additional measuring stations
have been installed since the inauguration
of Runway Northwest in the fall of 2011.
To achieve a high level of data quality, reliability
and transparency, the stations use special
high-sensitivity, weatherproof microphones,
powerful data analysis devices and storage

2016 Compact

devices and precisely defined measuring
methods. Huge amounts of data are generated every day, which are checked, evaluated
and processed by her team.
Daphne Goldmann: “Today, we measure
aircraft noise using a total of 31 stationary
measuring stations within a radius of 20 kilo­meters around the airport. For comparison:
The second largest airport in Germany,
located in Munich, operates 16 measuring
stations. With the two measuring stations
most recently inaugurated next to Runway
Northwest, we have been testing an innovative measuring method for the detection of
reverse thrust on landings since May 2015.
Based on a field study, we developed criteria
to be able to distinguish between reverse
thrust with idling load levels or higher load
levels during landing.”

Community

Fraport’s flight and measurement data are accessible to everyone via the FRA.NoM
(Fraport Noise Monitoring) information service available on the Internet. Users can
find information about the destination or origin of an aircraft, its speed and altitude
as well as the noise level from it detected at the measuring points on the ground.

The stationary measuring network is supplemented by three mobile measuring devices.
The aircraft noise situation can vary dramati­
cally from place to place. For questions
concerning the concrete noise level situation in individual municipalities, flexibly
employable measuring systems that provide
the same technical performance and data
quality as the stationary installations are
used. Municipalities can apply for the mobile
measurement of aircraft noise for a period of
three months.

»My contribution to
‘Gute Reise’ is the
greatest possible transparency about aircraft
noise. This is part of the
public service mission of
an airport operator.
Together with the airlines,
we can test new noise
reduction procedures
and routes.«

In addition, the mobile measuring systems
are used during tests of new flight control
technologies or flight procedures. For the
SESAR Augmented Approach to Land research project, during which satellite-based
curved approach procedures were tested at
Frankfurt Airport from May to August 2016,
five mobile measuring devices were used in
addition to the stationary ones. The goal of
measuring the demonstration flights was to
determine the noise emissions of the aircraft
along the new approach routes.
All Fraport measuring systems continuously
transmit the recorded noise data to the control center. In addition to the exact sound
profile, the systems also provide data on
individual noise events, their duration and
maximum level. However, the data processing is not fully automated. A great deal of
detail work and supplementary research is
required to create the best possible data
quality after the data is collected. Ambient
and aircraft noise are identified using special
testing processes in the subsequent analysis
and comparing that with information from
the flight plan as well as the radar data from
German Air Traffic Control (DFS).
This data set offers many possibilities for
analysis. They are used, for example, to examine the impact of active noise abatement
measures such as aircraft modifications or
modified flight procedures. The average
sound levels of the aircraft types are used
for classifying aircraft into different noise
classes for noise-related takeoff and landing
charges. The amount of the fees to be paid
is graduated depending on the noise class.
Daphne Goldmann: “It is important that the
measured noise be correctly assigned to the
aircraft that caused it or to other sources of
noise. Our measurement data forms the basis for the noise classifications of the charge
table. The airlines can count on the high data
quality of the measurement results.”

Value generation and engagement in the region
Positive contribution to the economic development of the region. Charitable involvement in the
neighborhood of the airport and dialog with our stakeholders.

Airport location factor
Airports are important business locations
and contribute directly and indirectly to
economic and social value generation.
Frankfurt Airport, for example, with more than
81,000 direct employees, is the largest local
place of work in Germany. The latest survey
provides insight into the sectors in which
the jobs at the site can be found. Two-thirds
of the employees surveyed work for an airline, in airport operations or in the shipping

and transport business. Other industries
include authorities and institutions, catering, security services, personnel services,
consulting, hotels and restaurants, freight
handling, cleaning companies and retail
services. Growth potential exists primarily at
companies providing security services and
at authorities. The approximately 5.4 million
people who live in the metropolitan area
around the airport also benefit from this. They

not only benefit from having a short journey
to fly away on holiday or on business trips,
many of them also work in a company that
benefits from proximity to the airport.

In total, around 38 million inhabitants live in
the catchment area of Frankfurt Airport within
a radius of approximately 200 kilometers.
The central location and high demand mean
that more international and intercontinental
destinations can be reached from here than
from many other airports around the world.
The hub function plays a key role here: More
than half of passengers change planes in
Frankfurt. That also makes the airport attractive as a cargo transfer location. Around half
the annual figure of over 2 million metric
tons of cargo is transported in the “belly” of
passenger planes. Shippers of cargo use the
large range of connections at Frankfurt Airport to transport their goods quickly to their
destination. FRA therefore also ranks among
the world’s most important sites for air freight
and is number one in Europe. This benefits
the export-oriented German economy, which
needs the connection to other markets.

At our international sites, the nearby regions
also benefit from the economic performance
of the airport. The companies located at the
airport and their economic enhancement
as well as consumption by the employees
directly and indirectly contribute to the positive economic development of the respective
regions. Fraport’s direct value generation
includes payments for personnel, capital expenditure, tax, interest, and dividends to its
shareholders. The total amounted to around
€2.1 billion in the past fiscal year.

Painting up a storm
Personal commitment was needed for the “Maltese Social Day”, which was
attended by five administrative employees of Fraport subsidiary FraGround
Fraport Ground Services GmbH (formerly Airport Personal Service GmbH).
The kindergarten of the Protestant parish Auferstehungsgemeinde in the
Praunheim district in Frankfurt had asked for help with renovation work.
The employees painted the workshop and its washroom. The Company
gave the employees the day off to do this work. On this day, approximately
1,100 participants spent 4,000 working hours carrying out about 100
projects in the Frankfurt area.

At home in Frankfurt
For historical reasons, Fraport feels a particular commitment to Frankfurt and the
Rhine-Main region. We are committed to
the business location and the metropolitan
area. These activities include participation in
the economic initiative “Wirtschaftsinitiative
FrankfurtRheinMain”, in which 150 companies are involved. As a co-founder, Fraport
has been active in it since 1996 and provides
the executive management. The initiative
works towards making the metropolitan area
more attractive at the economic, academic,
and cultural level, thus positioning it in the
best possible way compared to competitor

locations. One result of the collaboration is
the House of Logistics and Mobility (HOLM)
center of excellence at its site at the airport.
This economic initiative is also a project
partner for the further development of the
RhineMain Regional Park, the largest project
sponsored by the Fraport Environmental
Fund.
With our motto “Active for the Region”, we
are known for our community, cultural and
social engagement. We support regional
children’s and youth projects, initiatives for
people with an immigration background,

minorities, and the socially disadvantaged.
Fraport is particularly active where clubs
and voluntary organizations depend on
aid to carry out their work. The so-called
“Neighborhood Framework” forms the geographic border for our funding activities. We
supported more than 1,800 projects of different clubs and associations with donations
or sponsorship involvement amounting to a
total of €5.3 million in 2016.

2016 Compact

In the Rhine-Main region, Fraport is one of the
largest supporters of sport; our involvement
extends to both amateur and professional
sport. Well-known names include FRAPORT
SKYLINERS and Eintracht Frankfurt. At both
clubs, in addition to the national league
teams we also support young talent and
projects for the motor skill development and
social integration of children. In the fields of
culture and education, Fraport is involved
in, among other things, the Rheingau Music
Festival and the Weilburger Schlosskonzerte
series of concerts. We also maintain longterm partnerships with Frankfurt cultural
institutions the Städel Museum, Schirn Kunsthalle, and Liebieghaus sculpture collection.

Foundation activities bundled
Since 1988, through the Erich Becker Foundation, Fraport has been making awards
and grants for academic work with a theme
related to air transport, logistics and mobility. Funds of approximately €3 million have
been approved since the funding activities
commenced. In 2016, the Foundation’s committees decided to dissolve the Foundation
and transfer its capital to the ProRegion Foundation. By bundling the activities, Fraport
would like to focus its commitment even
more on the integration of young people
and young adults into the world of work.
As one of the largest employers in Hesse,
Fraport intends to focus more strongly on
these issues, especially against the backdrop
of the collective societal task of supporting
young refugees in gaining vocational qualifications and integrating into society.

years, in which students developed environmental education concepts and tested them
with school classes. Since the environmental
fund was established, more than 950 projects
have been funded with a total of almost
€37 million.

Solidarity with refugees
The number of refugees seeking asylum
in Germany is falling, but remains high.
Since 2015, Fraport has set an example of
solidarity with people seeking protection.
The activities are bundled under the motto
“#Refugeeswelcome: Fraport helps”. In various towns and cities in the neighborhood of
the airport, Fraport is supporting the establishment of accommodation and the care of
refugees. Employees who volunteer in the
field of refugee aid are each able to apply
for a donation of €1,000 for their association.
In total, Fraport made donations of more
than €47,000 available for this purpose in
the reporting year.

Since 1999, ProRegion has been promoting
projects that contribute to improving the
training and employability of young people and young adults. The Foundation will
have capital of €7.6 million. Since 2006, the
Foundation has invested €1 million in Pittler
Pro Region Berufsausbildung GmbH in
Langen, and thus now holds almost 45 %
of the shares in the company. In the past
17 years, funding of €7.5 million has been
awarded, including €617,000 for 33 projects
in 2016. The largest recipients of funding are
based in Frankfurt am Main.
With the environmental fund, Fraport has
supported nature and environmental conservation projects, research, and environmental education projects since 1997.
The best-known project is the RhineMain

Noise abatement
Noise abatement in nearby residential areas and reduction of those affected by aircraft noise.

Reducing noise
Civil aviation makes global mobility possible,
represents the fulfillment of a wide variety of
transport needs, and is fundamental for the
economy nationally and globally. However,
airports that are near metropolitan areas also
mean a burden for many local residents.
At our main site, Frankfurt, this area of tension is becoming particularly clear. Fraport
is aware of its responsibility for tens of thousands of jobs there, as well as the economic
significance of its largest airport for Germany
as an exporting country and for the prosperity of the Rhine-Main region, but also for
the noise pollution for residents living in the
region around the airport.

Our aim is to remain below the noise pollution level calculated and assessed in the
planning approval process for the airport expansion on the basis of a traffic forecast. This
is to be achieved in particular through active
noise abatement measures. In active noise
abatement, the noise is reduced directly
at the source or through noise-reducing
operating concepts and take-off and landing
methods. Passive noise abatement is targeted
toward reducing noise at the location where
the noise pollution is experienced. We are
active beyond the legal requirements in
financing noise abatement construction
measures.

We want to demonstrate how successful we
are with our noise abatement measures even
more transparently in future. To do this, we
will develop a procedure that enables monitoring of specific noise development per
traffic unit (defined as one passenger with
baggage or 100 kg of air freight).

49 different approach routes possible

Assistance for quieter landings

With the inauguration of the “Ground-Based
Augmentation System” (GBAS) navigation
system in 2014, Frankfurt Airport was the
first international air traffic hub in Europe
to enable satellite-supported precision approaches. Together with our project partners,
Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) and Lufthansa, we expect an important contribution to
more efficiency and further noise-reducing
approach procedures from GBAS. An important aim is the development of GBAS-based
approaches with 3.2 degree approach angles
for all runways. These are currently possible
only on Runway Northwest using conventional ILS technology (instrument landing
system), and are already integrated into
normal operations. From the second quarter
of 2017, we want to test steeper approaches
on the other runways as well. In addition,
up to 49 different approach routes can be
supported from just one ground station with
GBAS. In order to make GBAS more attractive
for airlines, its use was incentivized in the new
charge table, which entered into force at the
start of 2017.

The goal in a joint research project of the
German Center for Aviation and Space Travel
(DLR) and the Environment and Neighborhood House (Umwelt- und Nachbarschaftshaus – UNH) in Kelsterbach is to reduce aircraft noise over inhabited areas while saving
jet fuel. During landing, it is often difficult for
pilots to choose when to activate the landing
flaps and lower the landing gear with the
optimum timing so that the engines can be
operated in a quiet and fuel-efficient idling
mode during as much of the landing phase
as possible. The LNAS (Low Noise Augmentation System) assistance system, which the
pilots view in a cockpit display, indicates at
which points they have to perform what action to make an optimal descent. This system
is the practical result of a doctoral thesis at the
DLR Institute for Flight Systems Engineering
in Braunschweig. In the fall of 2016, in cooperation with German Air Traffic Control and
Frankfurt Airport, tests were carried out on
how the weather conditions, poor visibility,
the weight of an aircraft and the requirements
of air traffic control affect the new assistance
system, and how professional pilots react to

the system. The test flights have provided the
first evidence of the amount of noise reduction that can be realized. In order to quantify
this as realistically as possible and, above all,
to test the usefulness and usability of the
system in daily operations, the Airbus A321
Condor fleet will be equipped with LNAS.
This trial operation will also be supported
by UNH and DLR. UNH has so far provided a
total of €560,000 in funding for the project.
The Perspective working group of the
Active Noise Protection expert committee
from the Airport and Region Forum have
provided technical support for the project.
Representatives of the aviation industry work
together with authorities and representatives
of municipalities, DLR and the Aircraft Noise
Commission on measures for active noise

(FFR, Forum Flughafen und Region), has
been tested in operating direction west, i.e.,
the airport’s main operating direction, since
April 23, 2015. This means that individual
runways are not used early in the morning
and late in the evening, in alternation.
Frankfurt is the first major international airport
that uses a night-time operating restriction
side by side with a runway use concept that
extends the night-time quiet period in the
approach corridors by one hour.
Southern Frankfurt and the north of Offenbach in particular benefit from bundling
landings on Runway South in the evening
from 10 to 11 p.m. However, the exclusive
use of this runway means that Neu-Isenberg
and southern Offenbach are more heavily
affected during this hour. Nevertheless, the
night-time quiet period was also extended
beyond the core period of 11 p.m. to 5 a.m.
here by Runway South not being used for
landings between 5 and 6 a.m. Morning
approaches are then brought in via Runway
Northwest and Runway Center. The monitoring results obtained during the trial operation
confirmed the previously calculated potential
for burden reduction, so that the “noise absence” concept was adopted into the regular
operation after the one-year trial operation.
In operating direction east, the “DROps
Early Morning” (Dedicated Runway Operations) procedure has been back in use since
October 2015. It had to be temporarily suspended in connection with the trial of noise
absence model 4. This procedure also follows

the approach of locally creating times with
reduced noise pollution in low traffic periods
through alternating the use of runways.

Passive noise abatement and outdoor
living area compensation
Measures for passive noise abatement have
the aim of reducing the noise level inside
buildings through construction measures.
At the Frankfurt site, Fraport has comprehensive legal obligations for around 86,000
households. Their entitlement is defined via
a noise protection area set by the Hesse state
government in accordance with the strictest
Aircraft Noise Act regulations. We fulfill these
entitlements to their full extent. In addition,
together with the Hesse state government
we set up a regional fund of €265 to €270
million, which will finance the more far-reaching measures.
Statutory services for passive noise abatement and the services of the regional fund
are only provided on application. In order
to support local residents in determining
their rights and to assist with applications,
Fraport provides an extensive range of information and services on the Group website
www.fraport.com/en/responsibility/aircraft-noise-infoservice/noise-abatement.html.
On August 29, 2013, the Regulation on Outdoor Living Area compensation came into
force as the third implementing regulation of
the Aircraft Noise Act. It legally introduced,

for the first time, compensation for the use
of the outside living area affected by aircraft
noise in day protection zone 1 of the noise
protection area of Frankfurt Airport. This
affects a total of about 12,500 households,
mainly in Florsheim, Frankfurt, Nauheim,
Neu-Isenburg, Rüsselsheim and Raunheim.
The amount of compensation is determined
either by means of a legal flat rate, depending on the type of property, or by an expert
opinion on the market value of the property.
Applications for this compensation can be
submitted to the competent Regional Council of Darmstadt. The outdoor living area includes, for example, lawns, gardens, terraces,
balconies, roof gardens and similar shared
outdoor facilities, such as playgrounds at an
apartment building. The buildings can be
residential houses or apartments, or facilities
such as kindergartens and schools. The claim,
however, applies only to property on which
structures were erected before October 13,
2011, the date the noise protection area was
established, or for which a building permit
existed before this date.
The entitlement is graduated by the intensity of the noise pollution. The claim for all
of day protection zone 1 has been in place
since October 13, 2016. Fraport had already
received 2,700 applications by the start of the
deadline in October 2016. The deadline for
this application is October 12, 2021. Owners can determine whether their property is
located in one of the zones by entering the
respective address in the noise protection

Focus on specific complaints
In 2016, a total of 2,339 individuals submitted
complaints and questions about the flight
operations to Fraport. This is a continuation
of the long-term trend of a decrease in the
number of complainants, which is now considerably lower than the number before the
inauguration of the new runway: that year,

4,097 people addressed their concerns about
aircraft noise to Fraport.
However, there was a massive increase in
the number of notifications received in
2016 with declining complainant numbers
and unchanged aircraft noise pollution. This
development is due to the fact that more and
more frequent complainants are submitting
an increasingly greater number of complaints
daily. The number of complaints from frequent complainants has almost doubled
since 2015. Since frequent complainants

»We made a real breakthrough this year and we intend to
continue building on this achievement at the Twin Star airports.
Together with our partners along the travel chain, we are working hard to expand the Varna and Burgas airports as a popular
year-round gateway to Bulgaria’s leading tourism region.
I’m proud that we’ve already achieved our first major successes.«

10 years of Fraport Twin Star
2016 marked the first decade of successful
operation of the Burgas and Varna airports.
During this time, Fraport Twin Star invested
almost €180 million in the development
and modernization of the two airports. New
terminals were inaugurated at both sites in
2013 – passengers and airlines alike benefit
from their flexible and customer-friendly facilities. The remaining infrastructure was also
overhauled. These improvements include
an updated runway at Varna Airport, the
extension of the apron to increase capacity
at Burgas Airport and newly constructed service buildings. Targeted marketing activities

serve to fill capacity by adding new airlines
and destinations and extending seasons.
The establishment of a base by Wizz Air and
the start of flight connections by Ryanair are
scheduled for the Varna site for 2017.
Fraport Twin Star operates its own aircraft
noise monitoring system. With regard to
exceeding the 85 db(A) limits for flights over
the cities of Burgas and Varna, information is
actively exchanged with the airlines to prevent future deviations and negative impacts
for residents.
The company has committed itself to complying with the principles of the UN Global

Compact in the areas of human rights, labor
standards, environmental protection and
combating corruption. Fraport Twin Star also

Saving energy
with the weather forecast
Climate protection is an important point in Fraport AG’s sustainability program at the Frankfurt site.
By the year 2030, CO2 emissions are planned to be reduced to 80,000 metric tons a year. Different projects
are contributing to reaching this goal, including the increased use of electric vehicles and ground handling
equipment. The biggest item, however, is the improvement of energy efficiency in the operation of
buildings and airport infrastructure.

Markus Petith works as an operational energy
manager in the Integrated Facility Management area. As a true “Fraport child”, the
technical management expert completed his
apprenticeship as a mechatronics technician
in 2004 and, after several internal job changes
and training courses, has been part a team
with five other employees since 2016. All of
them were specially selected to develop and
implement energy saving measures.

Markus Petith: “On our team, I’m the one
who has been working longest at Fraport.
I’m familiar with the processes and needs of
the different users of our facilities. We look
for optimization potential everywhere. The
facilities have to function in accordance
with the requirements. One issue is specific
user behavior. If an office is not used at
night, the HVAC system doesn’t have to run
continuously.”

The night flight ban in Frankfurt means that
there are many ways to save energy, whether
by simply switching off unnecessary lighting
or turning off the heating or air conditioning
in rooms that are not being used. There is
a great deal of potential in reviewing and
readjusting the HVAC systems. Working
with the employees of the “Central Infrastructure Management” (CIM) section, the
energy managers use computer programs to

2016 Compact

Environment

»Our contribution to
‘Gute Reise’ is ensuring
that our customers,
whether passengers,
tenants or co-workers,
are not even aware of
the energy savings measures in place – and
if they are, then that
they have a positive
perception of them.«

simulate how the facility values change when
the settings are changed.
For example, for several months, they checked
the room climate in the “Airport City Mall”
underground shopping center between
Terminal 1 and the parking garages. Temperature, humidity and CO2 levels in the air were
measured and the values were compared.
The goal was to realize savings without compromising the comfort of the passengers and
the employees in the restaurants and shops.
They improved interaction and heat recovery by reprogramming the HVAC systems.
The reward was around 40 % lower energy
consumption compared to the previous
month.
One of the people Petith works with is
Rüdiger Schröder from CIM. Since 2008, the
experienced graduate in supply engineering
has been working to measure, control and
regulate the buildings at Fraport.
Rüdiger Schröder: “The new Fraport headquarters is a particularly good example of

successful energy management. We were
able to predict demand for heating or cooling on the basis of the weather forecast.
If sunshine is forecast for midday on a winter
day, the heating system turns itself down in
the morning and makes optimal use of the
energy input. The sunshine, in combination
with the morning heating, is then sufficient for
controlling the temperature of the building.
With the simulation program, we can predict
the energy needs of the building up to three
days in advance.”
Before that, the systems were set according to the current temperatures. If the sun
came out on a cold day, the control systems
were unable to respond to it. The solar heat
would overheat sunny areas, causing the air
conditioning to cool the rooms. The setup is
different now. Data from the German Weather
Service is evaluated at 15-minute intervals,
future energy requirements are calculated
and sent to the management and control
systems in the form of optimized operating
times and setpoint values. A further advantage
of the new software is energy monitoring.

Previously only disturbances and excess temperatures were visible in the control room.
After reprogramming, the amount of energy
consumed and the forecast use for the next
three days now appear.
Because modern technology was already
installed there, the headquarters were used
to test this procedure. The only thing needed for the changeover was new software.
Although the building was constructed in
accordance with modern energy standards,
12 % energy savings were achieved compared to 2014. Lower costs mean that the
conversion of the facilities will have paid off
in three years. The room climate for the users
of the building also improved significantly.
More buildings will follow. The equipment
of fire station 4 on Runway Northwest will be
changed over in 2017, for example.

Climate protection
Increase in energy efficiency, monitoring and minimization of the emission of climate-relevant
gases caused by airport operations (e.g. CO2).

New climate protection objectives
Air traffic and the operation of airports have
an impact on the environment. As an airport operator with numerous international
sites, Fraport considers itself responsible for
minimizing the environmental impact of its
activities. This also applies to CO2 emissions,
whose reduction is a key challenge of our
time. Along with emissions of other greenhouse gases, CO2 emissions contribute to
global warming.
The German government’s aim is to reduce
German CO2 emissions by 55 % by 2030
and by as much as 80 % to 95 % by 2050
compared to the level of 1990. In order to
achieve this, the government has enacted
several laws, such as the Renewable Energies
Act and the Energy Saving Act. Voluntary reduction targets by German companies make
an important contribution to implementing
national policy. Fraport has also committed
to do this.

Stricter CO2 targets set
We are pleased that the climate protection
targets for the year 2020 for Fraport AG at
the Frankfurt site that were formulated in
2008 were fulfilled in the year under review.
At 209,257 metric tons (absolute) and
2.56 kg CO2/traffic unit, CO2 emissions were
very significantly below the target values.
In January 2017, we used this as an opportunity to set new CO2 reduction targets. Based

on the corresponding targets of the Federal
Government, we intend to reduce the CO2
emissions by Fraport AG at the Frankfurt site
to 80,000 metric tons by 2030. Compared to
emissions in the base year of the International
Climate Agreement (1990), this corresponds
to a reduction of 65 %. CO2 emissions are
to be reduced to 0.9 kg CO2 per traffic unit
(one passenger or per 100 kg of cargo or
mail). Compared to emissions in the base
year of 1990 (5.51 kg CO2/traffic unit), this
corresponds to a reduction of 84 %.
To this end, we will continue to work on improving the energy efficiency of our buildings,
facilities and processes. Using our opera­
tional energy management system, we
continuously identify savings potential in the
building and facilities portfolio and realize
them as far as possible. In the vehicle fleet
and in our ground processes, we examine
the possibilities of using alternative energies,
in particular electricity, as a substitute for
petroleum-based fuels. New buildings are
planned and constructed taking into account
energy efficiency considerations.

Electric vehicles for aircraft handling
“E-PORT AN” is a joint initiative by Fraport,
Lufthansa, the state of Hesse and Rhine-Main
Electromobility Model Region. The aim of the
various projects bundled under its umbrella
is the reduction of CO2 emissions in aircraft
handling. Up to 20 different vehicles are used

in aircraft handling. New battery-powered
vehicles are being tested for everyday use,
which are funded by the German Federal
Government within the scope of the “Electromobility Model Regions” program. They
replace fuel-powered vehicles. This reduces
CO2 emissions, air pollution and noise, which
in addition to the environmental footprint
also improves working conditions on the
apron.

Certified CO2 reporting
Airport Carbon Accreditation, a program
to whose development Fraport made a key
contribution, has developed into the global
standard for CO2 reporting and management at airports since 2010. Fraport AG
has decided to certify all fully consolidated
airports in accordance with Airport Carbon
Accreditation. The intention is to achieve
at least Level 2 (Reduction). To receive this
certificate for the first time, airport operators
are required to formulate climate protection
targets and establish a carbon footprint and
CO2 management system. In subsequent
years, they must also demonstrate a continuous reduction in their CO2 emissions. Finally,
Level 3 (Optimization) can be achieved by
including key stakeholders. If an airport operator completely reduces its CO2 emissions
to zero, it achieves Level 3+ (Neutrality). We
already reached Level 3 at the Frankfurt site
in 2012. Ljubljana Airport reached Level 2
in 2015 as a result of appropriate measures.

and their strategies with respect to climate
change and CO2 reporting. In 2016, Fraport
reached Level C “Awareness”. The scoring is
a reflection of a company’s transparency and
activities in climate change matters.

By bike to the airport
A good network of cycle paths is interesting
not just for sports enthusiasts or recreational
cyclists. Commercial and industrial locations
can also benefit from increased transportation options. This is why the FrankfurtRheinMain Regional Authority launched a project
together with the city of Frankfurt am Main,
Gateway Gardens Grundstücksgesellschaft
mbH, Fraport AG and the Hesse German
cyclists’ association Allgemeiner Deutscher
Fahrrad-Club (ADFC) Hesse. The goal is to
implement the bicycle as an attractive and
environmentally friendly means of transport
at Frankfurt Airport. This will contribute to
improving the performance of the transport
infrastructure in the region while providing
individual and societal benefits. The project

is funded by the Federal Ministry of Transport
and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI) with funding
for the implementation of the 2020 National
Cycling Plan as well as with EU funding to improve bicycle infrastructure in the immediate
vicinity of the airport.
The project includes the development of an
app for employees cycling on the site and
an interactive online mapping tool, where
everyone can enter their experiences on
a regular basis. We will also examine the
potential of pedelec users in a radius of
up to 12 km around the airport and how
“pedelec-capable infrastructure” can be

usefully integrated into the airport site. The
project “bike+business 2020” is intended as
a model for setting out a new strategy for
land planning for other companies at the
airport. “bike+business” certification is the
fruit of more than ten years of successful
cooperation between the regional authority
and the ADFC. Gateway Gardens will serve
as a pilot area, and as such will be the first
cycling-friendly service and industrial site to
be established and certified in Germany. A new
cycle bridge over Kapitän-Lehmann-Straße
will complement the planned cycle path
concept and connect the two Airport City
sites of Gateway Gardens and THE SQUAIRE.

Conservation of nature and resources
Conservation of natural resources; minimization of waste and emissions of air pollutants
caused by airport operations as well as maintenance and improvement of the biodiversity

Responsibility for protecting the environment
Operation and expansion of an airport goes
hand-in-hand with large-scale intervention
in nature. As a transportation hub for tens
of thousands of people, take-off and landing
point for hundreds of flights and a hub for
thousands of tons of goods per day, airports
are intensive in their use of resources. The
goal at all Fraport AG sites is to treat the
environment as gently as possible. We consider ourselves responsible for protecting the
environment and expect the same from our
suppliers and service providers. Conservation
of resources and environmental protection
are therefore included in our Code of Conduct for suppliers that has been in force for
the Frankfurt site as of 2013 and Group-wide
as of 2014.

roofs are planned for the new buildings in
CargoCity South.
In close proximity to the airport and further
afield, as part of the mitigation and coherence measures in the zoning plan for the
expansion, a total area of 2,312 hectares was
upgraded for nature protection. High-quality
habitats such as deciduous forests, orchards,

wetlands, and low-nutrient habitats are
being developed. The compensation for
the construction of the new Terminal 3 is
already included in this extensive package of
measures. In addition, we support projects
for preserving and promoting ecosystems
and biodiversity in the Rhine-Main area with
funds from the voluntary Fraport Environmental Fund.

In Frankfurt, a detailed record was made of the
local flora and fauna as part of the zoning plan
for the expansion of the airport in 2005. In
addition, we have been carrying out intensive
environmental monitoring around the airport
as of 2010. The first conclusive findings are
to be expected from about 2020 onwards.
FRA is one of the most compact major airports
in the world with an area of around 22 square
kilometers. Of this terrain, approximately half
is unpaved. The largest continuous open
area is in the area around the runways. This
extensively maintained permanent grassland
is a high-quality habitat which is home to rare
and endangered animal and plant species.
Where possible we expand green spaces.
For example, several environmental green

A rare guest
In the autumn of 2016, a rare guest stopped over at Frankfurt Airport for a few weeks.
A hermit ibis had discovered the airport site and made it into its new habitat. The bird, also
known as a bald ibis, was regarded as a delicacy in the Middle Ages and has been extinct
in Germany for 300 years due to intensive hunting. Its marker ring gave it away: It “broke
out” of the Amersfoort Zoo in the Netherlands and had somehow found its way to Frankfurt.
It was most often sighted in Cargo City South, or on the south runway. In consultation with
the zoo and the state bird shelter, no attempts were made to capture the animal. The bird
was not a hazard to air traffic, because it spent most of its time near the ground.

2016 Compact

Unattractive for flocks of birds
Collisions with individual large birds or flocks
of birds are a hazard for aircraft. Because statistically around two-thirds of all bird strikes
take place at airports or neighboring areas,
as an airport operator Fraport is obliged to
minimize this risk. In contrast to many international airports, in Frankfurt we focus on
special biotope management. This involves
making the airport area unattractive to relevant animals, i.e., minimizing or avoiding
nesting, resting, and feeding opportunities.
The bird strike rate based on verified reports
by the Deutscher Ausschuss zur Verhütung
von Vogelschlägen im Luftverkehr (German
Committee for the Prevention of Bird Strikes
in Aviation – DAVVL) has been at between
three and five cases per 10,000 aircraft
movements in Frankfurt for the past few years.

Modern water management
Operating an airport requires a lot of water
and, at the same time, produces a large quantity of waste water. When dealing with the
legally protected resource of water, Fraport
takes all aspects of modern water management into account. This includes managing
consumption and quality control of the water
that enters the ecosystem.
We use water sparingly at Frankfurt Airport
and employ, among other things, watersaving techniques in sanitary facilities and

Environment

recycling systems in vehicle washing facilities. In addition, where possible we use raw
water instead of drinking water. To do this,
we collect rainwater in CargoCity South and
Terminal 2 and supplement it from our own
groundwater wells or with treated water
from the River Main. We use the raw water in
sprinkler systems, toilets, and for irrigation of
green areas. The raw water supply in Cargo­
City South is being expanded across the
board. In the north, Terminal 2 is supplied
with raw water, and Terminal 1 and the neighboring office building are 70 % connected. In
the past 16 years, raw water as a percentage
of Frankfurt Airport’s total consumption has
increased to around 20 %.

Air pollutants continuously
monitored
Air pollutants arise at airports primarily in
connection with flight operation, but apron
and vehicle traffic also lead to the emission
of pollutants into the air. At Frankfurt Airport
we have been continuously monitoring emissions of pollutants as of 2002 at up to five air
measurement sites. The measurement results
prove that air quality on the airport site has
remained at city level since the commencement of monitoring. The use of electrically
powered apron vehicles also contributes
to the reduction of emissions on the apron.

Old work uniforms recycled
In 2016, Fraport distributed redesigned
work uniforms to employees who come
into contact with customers. This move
generated tons of old clothing that needed to be disposed of. Because the clothes
have the Fraport logo on them and may
not be used by third parties, it was not
legally possible to donate them to charity.
Sending them to a certified waste disposal
company for shredding would be the most
cost-effective method, but it was rejected
because of sustainability considerations.
The solution was found in collaboration
with Behinderten-Werk Main-Kinzig (BWMK)
and the K+G disposal company, which
provides containers for the collection free
of charge. In a workshop for the disabled in
Langenselbold, BWMK employees sort the
parts of the old Fraport uniform and remove
the logo. The employees of the integration
firm “Heinzelmännchen Wäscheservice und
Hausdienstleistungsgesellschaft mbH” in
Wächtersbach, also a subsidiary of BWMK,
then take over the further processing. The old
Fraport work uniforms are cleaned, ironed,
folded, and provided to various charitable organizations. Around 4,000 pieces of clothing
have already been delivered to the workshop
for the disabled.

Fraport Regional Airports
of Greece
Fraport Regional Airports of Greece (Fraport
Greece) was founded in 2015. As of 2017,
it takes over responsibility for the operation
and management of 14 Greek regional airports for 40 years. The consortium partners
Fraport AG (73.4% share) and the Greek
company Copelouzos Group (26.6 %) have
already successfully collaborated on a joint
project at Pulkovo Airport in St. Petersburg.
Fraport Greece is made up of three companies: Fraport Regional Airports of Greece
Management Company S. A. (Fraport Greece
ManCo), Fraport Regional Airports of Greece A
S. A. (Fraport Greece A) and Fraport Regional
Airports of Greece B S. A. (Fraport Greece B).

While all essential administrative functions
are carried out within the management
company, Fraport Greece A is responsible for
operating the airports of Thessaloniki (SKG),
Aktion/Preveza (PVK), Kavala (KVA), Chania/
Crete (CHQ), Kerkyra/Corfu (CFU), Kefalonia
(EFL) and Zakynthos (ZTH). Fraport Greece B
will operate the airports on Kos (KGS), Mytilini/Lesbos (MJT), Mykonos (JMK), Rhodes
(RHO), Samos (SMI), Santorini/Thira (JTR)
and Skiathos (JSI).
In addition to airport operations, Fraport
Greece will be responsible for the maintenance and development of the airports over
the next 40 years and will invest more than

€330 million in the updating and development of the infrastructure by 2020 alone.
Around 170 employees currently work at
the company’s headquarters in Athens, and
employment contracts have already been
concluded with more than 380 employees
at the 14 airports.
The management of Fraport Greece includes
Alexander Zinell (Chief Executive Officer),
Bill Fullerton (Chief Technical Officer),
Vangelis Baltas (Chief Financial Officer) and
Ian Matheson (Chief Operations Officer).

»Our work demonstrates how modernization and the efficient
operation of an airport can go hand in hand with environmental
protection. Fraport Greece focuses on a sustainable future and
makes it the basis for our day-to-day business. We want to contribute to improving operations at the 14 airports, ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and create sustainability
targets. The environmental approval of the upcoming work is the
basis for achieving these objectives. It is a further building block
of a very complex structure. Its conclusion will be accompanied
by positive changes for both Greece and its aviation industry.«

Professional management and
airport expansion
The privatization of the 14 Greek regional
airports is one of the largest investments to
strengthen the Greek economy. The partnership between Fraport and Copelouzos
will support Greece’s important tourist industry, strengthen its competitiveness and
create new jobs. In addition, the cities and
regions around the airport sites will benefit
from the increase in passenger numbers and
the expansion of the travel season through
professional airport management.

The 14 airports are located in attractive tourist
regions or national economic centers and
were used by over 25 million passengers in
2016. In the future, even more passengers,
mostly tourists, are expected in Greece,
which will benefit other sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, construction, retail, service
providers and the real estate market. Fraport
Greece will work closely with the cities and
municipalities at the respective airport sites
and promote local businesses and service
providers.
The airports themselves will profit from the
extensive experience of the two consortium
partners in the operation of international

airports, the expansion and modernization
of airport infrastructure and process optimization. The aim is to ensure high quality of
service that meets international standards.
The development plans for the 14 airports
include the modernization or expansion of
infrastructure. The planned measures range
from the renovation of existing terminals to
the construction of new airside and landside
facilities. A total of eight runways are being
renovated at the sites. Ten airports will get
new or expanded terminals, and the terminals will be renovated at the remaining four
airports.

(daytime protection zone 1/night protection zone as per German Aircraft Noise Act).
The significant increase in the number of bird strikes corresponds to the trend across Germany. It can be assumed that the number of bird strikes has not
increased, but rather the number of reports. This is because in accordance with EU Regulation 376/2014 and Implementing Provision (EU) 2015/1080 Annex IV
beginning in November 2015 all airport operators, air traffic controllers, ground handling services and aircraft pilots in Europe are now uniformly required to
report security-related incidents (here bird strikes).

About this Report

About this Report

The “2016 Compact – Gute Reise! We make
it happen” report informs our stakeholders
and the interested public in brief form about
the economic development of Fraport Group
and its objectives, activities, and progress relating to responsible corporate governance 1).
We publish additional information using the
standard of the Global Reporting Initiative
(GRI) in a separate report in the core version
of the GRI G4 guidelines, including the industry-specific additional indicators for airport
operators on our website www.fraport.com/
responsibility.
Our new slogan “Gute Reise! We make it
happen” was launched in the “2015 Compact” report. “2016 Compact” takes up the
subject again and explores it more in-depth.
The focus is on the second part: “We make
it happen”. Employee snapshots show who
is behind the “We”. The Group ID card at
the Frankfurt Airport site serves as a stylistic
device and unifying element throughout
the report. It is a symbol of being part of

1)

the Fraport Group and the major objective
of a “Gute Reise”, which all employees are
working towards.

corporate management. The reports are also
the basis and source of our statement of compliance with the German Sustainability Code.

The selection of the report content is based
on the regular exchange of views with our
stakeholders and a comprehensive materiality
analysis. In this regard, we have defined important areas of activity for Fraport and positioned them in a materiality matrix according
to their importance for the stakeholders and
the Group. As part of a program, Fraport has
set objectives and performance figures for all
areas of activity as well as defined measures
for achieving the objectives.

The information in “2016 Compact” covers
all Group activities, products, and services
and all companies that are consolidated
according to the regulations on financial reporting issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board on the relevant
balance sheet date or have significant environmental effects within this framework.
As it is by far the largest Group site, Frankfurt
is the focus of our reporting. You can find
detailed information on our data collection
in the GRI Report.

Fraport complies with and supports the ten
principles of the UN Global Compact, develops and executes measures to implement
them, and contributes to their recognition,
even beyond the company’s own limits.
This publication, alongside the GRI report,
is also used as a progress report relating to
the implementation of the ten principles in

Our reports are published annually in German and English, and cover the reporting
period of January 1 to December 31 of each
year. The editorial deadline for this report
was April 2017. The previous report was
published on May 4, 2016.

Where the statements made in this document relate to the future rather than the past, these statements are based on a number of assumptions about
future events and are subject to a number of uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services
Worldwide and which could have the effect that the actual results will differ materially from these statements. These factors include, but are not limited to,
the competitive environment in deregulated markets, regulatory changes, the success of business operations, and a substantial deterioration in basic economic
conditions in the markets in which Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide and its Group companies operate. Readers are cautioned not to rely to
an inappropriately large extent on statements made about the future.
