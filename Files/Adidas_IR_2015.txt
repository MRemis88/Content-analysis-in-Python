ABOUT

We are proud that our ­sustainability
programme has continuously earned
high external recognition over the
past decades. Ethical investment
agencies and socially responsible
­investment (SRI) analysts such as the
Dow Jones Sustainability Index, the
Financial Times Index FTSE4Good
­
and ETHIBEL have rated us positively
in terms of social and environmental
­responsibility. Furthermore, we have
been named one of the ‘Global 100
Most Sustainable Corporations in the
World’ every year since 2005 and made
it to the top ten of the ‘Global 100 Index’
for the third consecutive time in January 2016. The positive assessments
underscore our industry-leading role
in sustainability and acknowledge
our social, environmental and ethical
engagement. Most importantly, they
­
encourage us to continue and intensify
the activities that are addressed to improve our sustainability performance.

We have a strong legacy in sustainability reporting. For 16 years we have published an annual sustainability ­r eport
detailing our progress made in the previous year. It focuses on ­issues most
relevant to our business and stakeholders and shows how we address the
material challenges we face. We strive
to report in the most accurate, clear
and reliable way possible.

This powerful statement is the guiding principle of the
adidas Group’s new strategic business plan ‘Creating the
New’, and it has never been more relevant than it is today.
In 2015, we saw the positive power of sport on both a large
and small scale: 80,000 English football fans sang the
French national anthem ‘La Marseillaise’ in memory of the
Paris terror attack victims. New Zealand Rugby World Cup
winner Sonny Bill Williams from the magnificent All Blacks
gave his World Cup medal to a young fan who had been
knocked to the ground by a security guard. And thousands
of our employees took part in adidas Fund activities, helped
in their neighbourhood or engaged in voluntary refugee
work. These are just a few impressive examples of how we
can create social change through sport, which we can all
be proud of.

I am also proud of our Group’s achievements in its
sustainability efforts in 2015. While you will get all the
details in this report, I want to share with you my personal
TOP 3 highlights:

DRIVING INNOVATION IN PRODUCT CREATION:

We took our ambition to create in an innovative way and
use more sustainable materials to the next level in 2015.
Our partnership with Parley for the Oceans, a thought
leader in ocean conservation and eco innovation that
raises awareness with the aim of ending the destruction
of the oceans, has already yielded initial tangible results.
We presented the world’s first shoe made of yarns and
filaments reclaimed and recycled from ocean waste and
a 3D-printed Ocean Plastic shoe midsole. In addition, we
managed to raise awareness about the state of the oceans
and the need for the industry to start taking action at a
UN climate change event in New York, on the occasion of
COP 21 talks in Paris, as well as among our own employees.

MAKING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN GREENER
AND FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE:

I am pleased to see that our years of efforts to reduce our
environmental impact have not gone unnoticed. In 2015, we
ranked first in our industry in the Corporate Information
Transparency Index (CITI), which is great recognition for the
environmental performance of our supply chain in China. At
the same time, we did not hesitate to accept when we were
invited to join the UN Climate Neutral Now initiative. This
helps us to promote a wider understanding of the need and
opportunities for society to be climate neutral and ensures
that we will continue to fulfil our responsibility to lead the
way when it comes to climate change.

ADVANCING OUR HUMAN RIGHTS WORK:

We want to know and publicly show that we are able to
manage risks by identifying, preventing and, where
necessary, mitigating the human rights impact of our
own operations and those of our supply chain partners.
You will read about our initiatives for implementing and
strengthening our human rights approach in this report
in great detail, but allow me to highlight a significant
step in 2015: when we became the first company in our
industry to publish a record of the third party complaints
received in the past year related to labour or human rights
violations.

2015 also saw the kick-off of our new business
strategy ‘Creating the New’. Guided by the strategy’s
principle – through sport we have the power to change
lives – it sets out ambitious plans to grow our business in
the period up until 2020. While capitalising on the strength
of our brands, we remain committed to continuing to
meet our values and society’s evolving expectations of
business practices. These include our responsibilities
towards our employees, the people who make our
products, the environment and the communities where
we operate. Therefore, we are very proud to present the
new Sustainability Strategy of the adidas Group to you in
this report: ‘Sport needs a space’. Our new Sustainability
Strategy is a direct outcome of the new business plan,
aligning it more closely with our Group’s core business
objectives.
So what is this new strategy all about? While I do not want
to go too much into detail here and will leave it up to you to
explore it fully on the following pages, I can tell you that the
new framework is an expansion of our existing scope while
defining clear strategic priorities that are most material to
our business: it is about the spaces of sport. It is a matter of
fact that sport’s spaces are not always a given or are at risk.
We aim to protect these spaces that have a direct link to our
sports business – be it spaces where sport is made, sold
or played. In short, spaces of sport are endangered and we
want to be their guardians.
If we succeed in bringing all this together – our Sustainability Strategy, our growth dynamic and our sports-­inspired
corporate culture – there is a good chance that 2016 will be
an extraordinarily successful year for the adidas Group. But
I can already promise you now: we will never rest on our
laurels. Just like a true athlete always strives for more, our
sustainability efforts are never done. Please join us in ­using
the positive power of sport to change lives for the better.
Enjoy reading.
Yours truly,

HERBERT HAINER

SPORT
NEEDS
A
SPACE

WE CREATE RESPONSIBLY.

A bold statement like this needs to be backed up by strong actions; and be supported by a comprehensive and holistic framework of initiatives and programmes that meet our own values
as well as society’s evolving expectations of business practices.
We are proud of our long track record in sustainability and
our good external recognition as one of the most sustainable
companies worldwide. Yet, we know there is always room for
improvement. For this reason we have extended the scope of
our sustainable work and have pushed the limits of our own
ambitions further than ever before. We set out to create an
enhanced Sustainability Strategy that answers to our existing
programmes, subjects that are most material to our business
as well as the challenges ahead. It seamlessly supports our
overall business goals and is directly linked to our core DNA
as a global sport company. All of this comes to life in our new
Sustainability Strategy ‘Sport needs a space’, our roadmap
towards 2020 and beyond.
Over the last years we have seen an increased level of business integration across the entire adidas Group. ‘Sport needs
a space’ is seamlessly connected to our new business strategy ‘Creating the new’ and further ensures the important
alignment of our sustainability work with our overall business
goals. While it answers to our responsibility towards our employees, the people who make our products, the environment
and the communities we operate in, it also follows the ambitious plan to grow the business even further.
Equally important, it mirrors our undeniable connection to sport
and our DNA, in a way our sustainability strategy never did before. We wanted to ensure that our overall strategic efforts in
sustainability transfer into tangible and realistic goals that have
a direct positive impact on the world of sport we operate in,
which is why we went directly to one of our key stakeholders, our
consumers. We asked them about the importance of sport and
the effect it has on their lives. The results clearly show that the
creator generation sees sport as an essential part of their life as
well as a way to be happy, connect with others across all boundaries, increase their confidence and learn important values for
life off the pitch. The vast majority, an impressive 92%, even says
that sport has a positive impact on the overall society.
These findings support our belief that through sport we have
the power to change lives. At the same time, however, sport
needs a space to exist. It needs a field, a pitch or a court, an
ocean to surf, a mountain to climb, a path to explore. In short:
sport needs a space that allows us to compete, achieve our
individual greatness and increase our happiness. It needs a
space to change lives. And this is where our sustainable work
and the spaces of sport collide.

Based on our love of sport and our responsibility as a globally operating company, we want to take action and ensure that
sport remains an endless source of happiness. We want to be
the guardians of these spaces, which is what our new Sustainability Strategy is directly based upon.
Aptly titled ‘Sport needs a space’, the strategy expands our previous scope by clearly following the entire lifecycle of sport
from the spaces where sport is made (this refers to all places where our products are created, designed, manufactured or
shipped), sold (includes our own retail, wholesale and ecommerce) and played (from the indoor court to the outdoor pitch
and everything in between all over the world) addressing challenges and issues across our entire supply chain and including
all people involved along the way.
But how do we turn the realities of this lifecycle, these spaces of sport, into tangible and measurable goals and a holistic
­strategy? We believe that when we talk about sustainability, we
are ­really talking about two things: our products, which includes
­materials, technologies, the manufacturing process, shop fittings and i­nfrastructure, and people, for example our own
­employees as much as our factory workers, fans and ­athletes.
If we want to s­ eriously tackle the challenges that endanger the
spaces of sport and our planet, we have to define strategic priorities that provide crosscutting directions for any initiative
driven in the fields where sport is made, sold and played.
With this in mind, we created six strategic priorities within the
product and people areas as part of our new strategy:

PRODUCT
1 WE VALUE WATER
2 WE INNOVATE
MATERIALS AND
PROCESSES
3 WE CONSERVE
ENERGY

PEOPLE
1 WE EMPOWER
PEOPLE
2 WE IMPROVE
HEALTH
3 WE INSPIRE
ACTION

These six key priorities will shape our road towards 2020 and
beyond. For more details, please go to the next page.
We believe that ‘Sport needs a space’ is our most holistic Sustainability Strategy to date, one that is created and operationalised through excellent cross-functional collaboration. It is
the combination of our best ambitions, a strong track record
in sustainability and the belief that through sport we have the
power to change lives.
Above all, ‘Sport needs a space’ is our approach to create responsibly across the entire lifecycle of sport with tangible and
measurable goals to ensure that sport remains the source of
happiness for all people.

09

Industrial pollution and its effects on the environment and the
planet’s climate, the violation of human rights such as forced
labour practices or discrimination, the consequences of the

increasing urbanisation as well as our ever-growing population
are only a few examples of direct threats to our world, our environment and the spaces of sport.

Creating our new strategy was a collaborative effort – this
is true not only for us internally at the adidas Group but
also for many of our external stakeholders whom we engaged closely with along the process.

Our Sustainability Strategy ‘Sport needs a space’, a ­direct
outcome of our ‘Creating the new’ business strategy,
identifies six strategic priorities that are most ­material
to improve our social and environmental footprint.
They are the ones that are most essential to our stakeholders and have ­s ignificant ­impact on our ­b usiness
success.

10

As a society, we are facing many challenges from declining resources and climate change to the global water
crisis and human rights violations. As these pose risks
to our industry and our environment, we believe that
­a ddressing them in a meaningful way falls within our
­responsibility as a business. Acting upon our leadership

role and the expectations set for us by our stake­holders,
we aim to create lasting positive change within our area
of influence.

PRODUCT
1 WE VALUE WATER

Water is essential for life. It is also a key resource for
our industry. In order to tackle the ever-growing issue of
water scarcity and achieve water stewardship 1, we have
developed an approach addressing water ­
e fficiency,
quality and accessibility.
WHY IT MATTERS TO SOCIETY:
For life on planet to exist and survive, it needs clean water.
Yet, its supply is finite. If the current rate of growth continues, the demand for sustainable, reliable water in 2030
will be 40% higher than the estimated supply. 2
WHY IT MATTERS TO THE ADIDAS GROUP:
Water is a key resource for material and specifically textile production. Textile treatment and dyeing processes
consume significant volumes of fresh water and generate wastewater that requires proper treatment and discharge. Overall, 20% of freshwater pollution in the entire
industry is caused by textile treatment and dyeing. 3 Our
own footwear and apparel business also relies heavily
on these processes. The risks we face as a business are
­a ssociated with the decreasing choice of production locations, increasing production costs due to water shortage
as well as potential suppliers’ non-compliance with legal
standards. Hence, tackling the water issue will allow us to
actively create positive change in our supply chain and the
communities we operate in.
WHAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED SO FAR:
State-of-the-art supply chain facing programmes and innovative dyeing techniques such as DryDye are in place.
Our Green Company initiative has led to substantial water
savings per employee at our own sites. However, we know
that systemic change of water usage requires ongoing
­innovation and stakeholder collaboration.
OUR WAY FORWARD:
By 2020, we will achieve
—	20% water savings at our strategic suppliers 4
—	50% water savings at our apparel material suppliers 5
—	35% water savings per employee at our own sites 6

We create the best for the athlete, while optimising our
environmental impact. We are committed to steadily
­increasing the use of more sustainable materials in our
production, products and stores. At the same time, we
are driving towards closed-loop solutions.
WHY IT MATTERS TO SOCIETY:
Waste from non-renewable resources, hazardous chemicals contaminating the water supply, and conventionally
grown cotton are just a few examples of the severe environmental impacts deriving from material processing.
WHY IT MATTERS TO THE ADIDAS GROUP:
As the availability of non-renewable resources constantly
declines, resulting in increasing material costs, we must
search for alternative solutions now. This means that we
need to replace the non-renewable materials we use, like
synthetic fibres such as polyester, but also cotton and various blends. Likewise, our products require man-made
chemistry with unique criteria to meet our high-performance functional and quality standards. We address the
global waste challenge and resource shortages by actively driving material innovations and closed loop solutions
that will reduce our environmental footprint.
WHAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED SO FAR:
The number of environmentally preferred materials we
a lready use is constantly increasing. As an example,
­
43% of the cotton we sourced globally in 2015 was Better
­Cotton. In addition, after successfully phasing out all longchain fluorinated chemicals in 2014, we made major progress on our path to phase out PFCs in 2015.
OUR WAY FORWARD:
By 2020, we will achieve
—	20% waste reduction at our strategic suppliers 4
—	5 0% waste diversion for owned operations to minimise
landfill 7
—	7 5% paper reduction per employee at our own sites 6

12

Additionally, we will:
—	Further expand the use of waterless technologies for
our products.
— Continue to develop programmes focused on providing
access to clean water in the communities we operate in.

2 WE INNOVATE
MATERIALS &
PROCESSES

PRODUCT
Additionally, we are working on:
—	Replacing conventional cotton, with the aim of achieving 100% sustainable cotton by 2018.
—	P hasing out the use of virgin plastic, starting with:
-	Eliminating plastic bags in our stores.
-	
Increasing the use of recycled polyester in our
products.
-	Creating a completely new supply chain for Ocean Plastic together with our partner Parley for the Oceans.
This means that we are investing in resources to divert
plastic waste from coastal communities back into the
production cycle and turning it into products.
—	Increasing the use of sustainable designs and materials in our stores.
—	Rolling out a global product take-back programme to
all of our key cities and markets. Building on existing
take-back pilots such as the one in Brazil, we will continuously expand this programme.
—	Investing in materials, processes and innovative machinery which will allow us to upcycle materials into
products and reduce waste. Ongoing examples include:
-	Sport Infinity, a research project funded by the European Commission which focuses on sporting goods
that can be fully recycled. The project aims to identify
and develop innovative recyclable materials which will
enable the production of easily customisable sporting
goods.
-	Futurecraft Tailored Fibre, a new sewing technique
which allows new materials such as gillnets to be
combined for use in footwear. Thanks to its efficiency,
this process allows a significant amount of waste from
the traditional shoemaking process to be eradicated.
—	A chieving 100% sustainable input chemistry by adopting the ZDHC MRSL 8; phasing out hazardous chemicals; providing our strategic suppliers with a list of
positive chemistry (the bluesign® bluefinder).

3 WE CONSERVE
ENERGY

Additionally, we will:
—	Reduce the environmental footprint of our consumer
events.

Energy is the fuel of the body. The responsible use of energy is also critical for our planet to survive. In order
to mitigate climate change, we are committed to reducing our absolute energy consumption and CO 2 emissions,
transitioning to clean energy, and looking into energy
harvesting opportunities.

WHY IT MATTERS TO SOCIETY:
The responsible use of energy plays a key role in order to
tackle the impacts climate change has on our society and
the environment.
WHY IT MATTERS TO THE ADIDAS GROUP:
Climate change caused by the extensive use of fossil
­energy will have an impact on living conditions in key markets and production regions. Unless tackled, these developments will have adverse consequences for our overall business development. Risks we face include limited
availability of natural raw materials such as cotton as a
result of droughts as well as supply chain disruptions due
to flooding and fires. Our major focus is on tackling the
environmental impact that occurs along our supply chain,
which is why we pay close attention to our manufacturing
processes. At the same time, we are systematically improving the environmental footprint at our own sites.
WHAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED SO FAR:
Our Green Company initiative has led to reductions in
­energy consumption and carbon emissions at our own sites.
Based on the initiative’s success, we set ambitious targets
with our 2020 Green Company programme that now extends to our own retail operations. Signing the UN Climate
Neutral Now initiative stresses our commitment to tackle
energy consumptions and carbon emissions.
OUR WAY FORWARD:
By 2020, we will achieve
—	2 0% energy savings at our strategic suppliers 4
—	3 % absolute annual reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 9
CO 2 emissions at our own sites
—	further expansion of ISO 14001 to key sites globally
—	L EED certification for new corporate construction key
projects, such as the new offices at the company’s
headquarters in Germany and new flagship stores.

PEOPLE
1 WE EMPOWER
PEOPLE

People are at the heart of everything we do. Like a coach
ensures that all of the players on the pitch are in the
right position for the best results, we empower people
to exercise their rights and unlock their potential.

2 WE IMPROVE
HEALTH

Sport is the key to an individual’s health and happiness. Our aim is to enable people around the world to
participate in sports, while educating them on physical
and mental health, fitness and nutrition. This will ultimately allow them to lead a healthier and more fulfilled
lifestyle.
WHY IT MATTERS TO SOCIETY:
Sport is beneficial to individual development, health promotion and disease prevention.
WHY IT MATTERS TO THE ADIDAS GROUP:
Sport is our foundation, our heart, our DNA. By enabling
our employees to live an active and healthy lifestyle, we
have a positive impact on their lives and our business success. We inspire people to be active by supporting grassroots programmes directed by the adidas Fund or BOKS
that highlight the positive impacts on health as well as
physical and mental fitness sport can have. This association with a healthy lifestyle will ultimately support our
good reputation among our consumers and create d
­ emand
for our products.
WHAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED SO FAR:
We have created a Health Management Team, organise
Health Weeks globally, and offer a wide range of company
sport programmes at major sites.

WHY IT MATTERS TO SOCIETY:
Education and personal development as well as health and
the ability to exercise basic human rights are the foundation of a well-functioning society.
WHY IT MATTERS TO THE ADIDAS GROUP:
Our employees’ performance, well-being and knowledge
have a significant impact on our company’s success. At
the same time, operating our business by complying with
core labour standards is an imperative. Effective ­w orker
e mpowerment leads to a stable and conducive work
­
­environment. This stimulates workers’ productivity, thus
­increasing manufacturing performance, which ultimately
leads to cost efficiency. Creating a collaborative working
environment for our more than 55,000 employees as well
as safe and fair working conditions for more than one million workers employed in our supply chain allows us to be
the employer of choice and our suppliers to achieve sustainable leadership.
WHAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED SO FAR:
26% of our direct suppliers are in self-governance ­model
in 2015. On top of our existing grievance mechanisms, accessible to all employees and factory workers, more than
a quarter of a million workers in our supplier factories
already have additional access to our anonymous SMS
­worker hotline to raise concerns.
OUR WAY FORWARD:
By 2020, we will
—	Empower 10 our supply chain workers by expanding and refining grievance systems and skill training
programmes.
-	T his includes the expansion of the Workers’ Hotline
to the countries where our strategic suppliers are
located.
—	A chieve sustainable leadership at our suppliers and
licensees.
-	By 2020, all strategic suppliers and licensees will
achieve self-governance 11.
-	B y 2020, at least 20% of our strategic suppliers and
licensees will achieve Leadership level 12 .

—	Foster cross-functional and cross-cultural careers
and experiences for our employees. This will enable
them to gain fresh perspectives and grow professionally and personally.
-	T his includes volunteering programmes together with
the adidas Fund and the Reebok BOKS programme,
which also enhance soft skills such as teamwork,
leadership, decision-making and communication
while increasing our employees’ commitment and
motivation.
—	Champion diversity – regardless of gender, nationality,
ethnic origin, religion, world view, age, sexual orientation or gender identity.

PEOPLE
OUR WAY FORWARD:
By 2020, we will
—	Introduce education and upskilling measures on health
and work-life balance topics for our employees.
—	D evelop a global Health Management strategy for our
employees. This strategy is based on the strong foundation we already have at our offices in Herzogen­
aurach, Portland and Canton.
—	U tilise sport as a tool to teach values and boost young
people’s academic and physical performance. In addition, this tool will add to their overall confidence and
well-being.
-	Through the BOKS programme, we will refine and
perfect the collective impact model with our other partners including those from the healthcare industry to provide a solution to the physical inactivity
epidemic.
-	We also aim to increase the number of enrolled BOKS
schools by 50% in our target areas.

OUR WAY FORWARD:
We will continue to focus on
—	Rewarding our employees’ commitment and contributions to our company’s purpose, strategy and success.
—	Encouraging and supporting employee volunteering –
creating agents of change in the communities we work,
live and operate in.
— E ngaging with creators and influencers and driving
­innovative collaborations.
—	Inspiring consumers, key partners, brand assets and
others to join us on our journey.

Our sustainability programme has
always been based on our own business needs. Equally, it has been
formed and influenced by social and
environmental trends, our own learning and stakeholder feedback. With
these in mind, we presented a fiveyear roadmap in 2010 that shaped
the way we wanted to grow our business goals in a sustainable way and

The integration of sustainability programmes into our mainstream business practices is one of these trends.

»Over the last five

years we have seen
significant progress
in integrating sustainability thinking and
acting into our core
business practices.

We have seen this positive development occurring in all critical business
functions such as product creation,
development and material sourcing
practices, supplier and licensee
management, own facilities management and customer and consumer
engagement. Progress was achieved
by establishing sustainability expertise in these functions and embedding
social and environmental standards
in policies and procedures that steer
our day-to-day business processes.

Our status quo today
is a strong baseline
for moving our performance to the next level.

«

FRANK HENKE

VP Global Social & Environmental Affairs (SEA) at the adidas Group

⁄

regularly reported our progress
against targets on an annual basis.
Now, before we start our journey
towards 2020, we are taking a look
back at the major trends and developments as our programmes evolved.

Driven by a clear commitment from
senior management, further capacities, competence and expertise
in sustainability management have
been established and embedded in
core business functions. This ensures a successful horizontal integration throughout the organisation and
makes social and environmental considerations part of our daily business
decisions. Business integration has
become of even greater importance
when tackling cross-cutting sustainability challenges from end-to-end. One
example is the ­adidas Group’s chemical management programme which
is driven by effective cross-functional work of various functions including Social and Environmental Affairs
(SEA), Global Operations (GOPS) and
our product creation teams.
Another visible trend is exemplified
by our discolsure practices. The ambition to be transparent towards our
stakeholders has led us to disclose
and regularly update our global supplier lists since 2007. It was in the
same spirit of responsiveness that we
managed to become the first brand
in our industry to develop an operational grievance mechanism to address human rights impacts. And we
have become a pioneer in our industry to report on the progress of individual grievance cases publicly as of
2015. At the same time, we also expect transparency from our suppliers and encouraged those who operate wet processes to disclose waste
water and emissions data on public
platforms. This effort has been rewarded externally: The adidas Group
ranks first in our industry in the 2015
Corporate Information Transparency Index (CITI) which recognises the
environmental performance of our
­
suppliers in China.
To make our approach to sustainability
transparent and easy to understand, we
presented a new way of describing our
approach under four pillars – people,
product, planet and partnership – in
2014. Highlights within these four ‘P’s
are presented on the following page.

PEOPLE PRO–
DUCT

As a global leader in our industry, we take a stand within our
area of influence and communities in which we operate to empower people, be it our employees or workers in our factories.
In order to get closer to workers and support fair and safe
workplace conditions, we have successfully developed more
effective feedback mechanisms. Launched in 2012, the
anonymous SMS worker hotline, operated by an independent third party provider, already enables roughly one quarter of workers in our supplier factories to raise their voice in
an uncomplicated way and factory management to respond
more quickly to concerns. Supporting our factories on their
way to self-governance has always been one of our key priorities and we are pleased to report that as of the end of
2015 26% of our direct supplier factories are enrolled in a
self-governance model. This means they manage to comply
with our Workplace Standards with solid and effective programmes on their own and without support from our compliance team. Throughout the last years we have also developed and implemented effective tools such as Strategic
Compliance Plans and Report Cards to ensure ongoing compliance practices in our licensee’s factories.

We strive to innovate material solutions through our partnership with Parley for the Oceans that helps us to use
more recycled materials in our products. With the ambitious research project Sport Infinity, we aim to develop
materials that can be endlessly recycled. These initiatives
are to close the loop and improve our impact along our
value chain while positively contributing to our business
performance.
In the last years we have continuously increased the use of
environmentally preferred materials (EPM) such as Better
Cotton, recycled polyester, recycled rubber or bio-based
thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) in our adidas apparel
and accessories products. As of the end of 2015, all of our
adidas footwear products included environmentally preferred materials. We also advanced dyeing techniques
like DryDye and NoDye to decrease the amount of water,
energy and chemicals used in the dyeing process. In addition, our virtualisation efforts have led to a reduction of
2.4 million of physical samples between 2011 and 2015
which helps us to further lower our environmental footprint and reduce global transport.

Our desire to create social change extends to our own employees as well. As part of our global Diversity approach, we
aim to build a work environment allowing for appreciation
of all employees. In the last years, we proactively pursued
a portfolio of internal and external activities including the
signing of the Declaration against Homophobia in Sport or
our active membership in ‘Diversity Charter’. Through innovative HR learning programmes and platforms such as the
Talent Carousel or the Learning Campus, our corporate university, we are empowering our employees to truly live the
creativity, collaboration and confidence as embedded in our
new people strategy. Our support has also been extended to
the communities we operate in – be it through relief efforts,
our ongoing product or financial donations or our corporate
volunteering programmes.

An important aspect of creating responsibly includes
steadily increasing the use of sustainable materials while
improving the way products are made.

PLANET PARTNER
–SHIP
One of our main goals is to optimise our environmental
impact across our value chain and to positively contribute to our business performance. This includes reducing
our footprint at our own sites as well as across our supply
chain.

Our Green Company programme helped us reduce our environmental footprint at our own sites. The results of our
2015 targets show that we have exceeded our targeted savings for water and waste reduction. It is an additional testament to our efforts for internal collaboration that 13 of
our global sites are now certified with the environmental management system ISO 14001. Designed to maximise carbon reduction and cost savings, the green­ENERGY
Fund has seen great developments since its launch in
2012: 49 projects have received approved funding with a
forecasted 33% internal rate of return on project portfolio.
As most of the impact occurs in our supply chain, close
attention is paid to reducing the environmental footprint
during manufacturing in close collaboration with our
suppliers. Highlights of the past years included the progressive improvement of the environmental performance
(E-KPIs) of our strategic suppliers, high rates of adoption
of the Higg Environmental Facilities Module across core
suppliers and significant improvement and certification of
environmental management systems ISO 14001. Our recent
efforts to tackle our chemical footprint includes the completion of a full screening of chemicals used in the manufacture of apparel materials, which is a best-in-class approach towards full transparency of the use of chemicals
in the material manufacturing process.

In order to create positive change in our industry, we promote an open collaboration with partners who share the
same goals, but also enter in dialogue with critical stakeholders. It is our belief that we are better when we team
up and sharing knowledge and expertise.

As a founding member of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition
(SAC), we have been actively involved in and contributed to
the development of the Higg 2.0 Index since 2010, which is
a suite of assessment tools that standardises the measurement of environmental and social impacts of apparel
and footwear products across the product life cycle and
throughout the value chain. Entering a partnership in 2014
with bluesign® technologies, a world leading provider of
assessment tools for positive chemistry in the textile industry, has enhanced the strong programme we already
have in place for managing the chemicals in our products. The most recent addition includes our partnership
with Parley for the Oceans in 2015. As a founding member, we will support Parley for the Oceans in its education
and communication efforts, as well as its comprehensive
Ocean Plastic Program (A.I.R., Avoid, Intercept, and Redesign) that intends to end plastic pollution of the oceans.

areas that we need to improve.

SUPPLIER
PERFORMANCE

Our Compliance Key Performance Indicator (C-KPI) is our
rating tool to comprehensively evaluate our direct suppliers’ social compliance implementation and its effectiveness. Directly incorporated into the overall supplier rating,
the tool influences our decision on which supplier to use
and helps suppliers to understand the importance of delivering fair, healthy and environmentally sound workplace
conditions. Up to 2015, we have seen a significant positive
increase of self-governing suppliers (includes high rating
of 4C and highest rating of 5C) while more than 40% of
active suppliers in our supply chain have moved to a ‘good’
rating of 3C. For details, please go to page 72.

ONGOING
APPROACH
TO

HUMAN
RIGHTS ISSUES

We recognise our responsibility to respect human rights
and are taking the necessary steps to fulfil this social obligation as a business. In 2015, we continued to apply and
strengthen our own global Human Rights Due Diligence
(HRDD) approach by further improving and deepening our
transparency and our dialogue with key stakeholders as
well as addressing severe human rights risks in our wider
supply chain.
We want to know and publicly show that we are able to manage risks by identifying, preventing and, where necessary,
mitigating the human rights impact of our own operations
and those of our supply chain partners. We are proud to
be the first brand in our industry to develop an operational grievance mechanism to address human rights impacts,
wherever they occur – be this operationally or in the supply chain. In June 2015, we were also the first company to
publish a record of the third party complaints received in
the past year related to
labour or human rights
violations. The record,
HUMAN RIGHTS
which is updated annualDUE DILIGENCE
ly on our website, details
Human rights due dilithe nature of the comgence describes the proplaint and its current
status (i.e. under invescess of how a company
tigation, successfully reidentifies, prevents, mitsolved, unresolved, etc.).

igates and accounts for
how it addresses its a
­ ctual
and potential adverse
­human rights impacts
and those of its business
­partners. This includes
specific ­elements and
processes such as Country Risk A
­ ssessments,
­Operational ­Reviews, Preventive Action, Remediation, ­Complaints Procedures, Internal Reporting
and Public Reporting.

Integral to our efforts to
uphold human rights is
our open dialogue with
stakeholders including
suppliers, governments,
unions and other nongovernmental organisations (NGOs). In June
2015, for example, we
met with ‘Shift’, a leading human rights NGO
which has been instrumental in the development of the UN Guiding Principles Reporting
Framework, the first
comprehensive guidance
for companies to report on human rights issues. As a result
of the meeting, we have committed as a business to incorporate the elements of the Reporting Framework into our
Human Rights Materiality Assessment and build this into
our annual non-financial reporting.

In 2015, we contin­­ued to
apply and strengthen our
own global Human Rights
Due Diligence approach
by further improving and
deep­en­­ing our transparency
and our dialogue with
key stakeholders as well
as address­ing severe human
rights risks in our wider
supply chain.
Our HRDD work does not end with our main stakeholders
and manufacturing partners but includes the wider supply
chain, namely those hard-to-reach places where visibility and influence are not always a given. In order to uphold
our HRDD objectives of monitoring for labour rights compliance and addressing potentially severe human rights
risks, we launched a new outreach programme to address
Modern Day Slavery. The programme tackles the risks
­
posed by human trafficking, forced labour or debt servitude
where coercion, threats or deception can be used to intimidate, penalise or deceive workers, thereby creating situations of involuntary work and exploitation. In cooperation
with our main partners, we seek to reach and educate other
tiers in our supply chain about the need to eradicate human
trafficking, forced labour and child labour. An overview of
our range of activities to tackle Modern Day Slavery in our
­global supply chain in 2015 can be found here.
There is always more to do in developing an effective HRDD
process, but our guiding principle is to deliver real change
through practical action and

approach to Human Rights

and improve lives.

27

We also monitor human rights on other fronts. As part of an
operational assessment to identify potential human rights
risks with regard to sponsorship of major sporting events,
we organised a high-level stakeholder dialogue in London

in June 2015. Joined by FIFA, Amnesty International, Transparency International, the Institute for Human Rights and
Business, and UNICEF among others, the one-day event explored the role of corporate sponsors, the boundaries of
responsibilities for human rights and how to build practical
action. The challenge of moving from principles to practice was solved with both immediate short-term actions as
well as mid-term opportunities for sponsors to engage with
sporting bodies and other stakeholders over the human
rights impacts of sporting events. Further details about
these agreements can be found on our website.

Sialkot is a small city located in the northeast of the Punjab Province in P
­ akistan,
but it plays a big role in a new project
initiated by the ­adidas Group called
‘­Women’s Empowerment Programme’.

For decades, Sialkot has been the
manufacturing base for hand-stitched
ball suppliers to many well-known international brands, including adidas.
But with the market demand shifting to machine-based stitching, many
manufacturers had to scale down or
close completely, which left thousands of female workers jobless with
little chance of new employment due
to lack of skill as well as social and
cultural barriers.
As part of our on-going engagement to
protect the vulnerable groups involved
in the global apparel and footwear
manufacturing industries, including the promotion of rights of female
workers, we initiated a project called
‘Women’s Empowerment Programme’.
The project kicked off in September
2015 with two objectives:

PROGRAMME

FEMALE
WOR–
KERS
IN
PAKISTAN

—	Improve the knowledge and skills of
the redundant female workers to earn
income and find new employment
—	Help female workers at our suppliers
to have better opportunities in the
workplace.
In order to have the biggest positive impact on the local communities, we found
the perfect expertise and experience
in our local partner, the NGO Baidarie,
a non-government and non-profit ­
civil
­society organisation. Through many activities including enhancing skills in diversified areas of earning a livelihood, establishing connections between trained
workers and job providing slots as well
as mobilising workers for taking the initiative for micro-entrepreneurship, we,
together with Baidaire, aim to improve
the lives of 1,000 female workers in the
Sialkot area and provide them with better
opportunities in the workplace.

2 CONCEPTS OF WAGES

THE LIVING THE FAIR
WAGE
WAGE
The living wage allows workers
and their families to afford a
basic, but decent, standard of living
that is considered acceptable
by society at its current level of
economic development.

FOR

FAIR
COMPEN –
SATION
IN

OUR
SUPPLY
CHAIN

 re paid regularly and on
a
time
include the legal minimum
allow decent living
standards
reflect a worker’s performance and skills
reward overtime
follow price increases paid
for the products they are
making

In 2015, the ­adidas Group launched the
Fair Compensation Strategy, which
presents the most advanced level
of work we are attempting with fair
compensation.
Our approach to fair wages is built on
our respect-protect-promote framework and aligned with basic human
rights concepts. In fact, we have been
monitoring supply chain wages since
the inception of our programme in
1997 and have reached several important milestones along this journey. For
example, we started to engage with the
Fair Wage Network in 2009 and commissioned Fair Wage Assessments at
26 suppliers in 7 countries two years
later, benchmarking those results according to 11 dimensions of fairness.
The assessments helped us to mature
our approach towards fair wage progression and expand it beyond simple
legal compliance. However, there were
unsuccessful mechanisms to negotiate remediation between the factory
and assessment teams, and insufficient factory participation to reach the
required economies of scale.

29

STRIVING

A fair wage goes deeper. It con­siders
the fairness of the wage that a worker
is paid by bench­marking if wages:

are
linked to their
em­ployer’s profits and
sales
reflect changes in work
technology
are negotiated indivi­dually or collectively
with workers
and are clearly and
formally communicated
to workers

As a result, in 2014 we made a position statement that distinguished between the “living wage” and the “fair
wage” and identified our approach to
payment of fair wages in global supply
chains.
More recently, in 2015, we aligned
the ­
adidas Group Workplace Standards with the Fair Labor Association’s
(FLA) code language and refocused on
prompt remediation of pay violations
in audit corrective action plans. With
every step we strive to further promote fair wages across our industry’s
supply chain in 2016. We will continue
to work closely with our partners such
as the FLA, to strengthen our prevention programmes and to close critical gaps in wage fairness identified in
our ongoing collection of supply chain
wage data.

SELF-GOVERNANCE

CALLING

BOWKER 		 VIETNAM
FACTORY PRESENTS
FIRST RESULTS OF
HAPPY MANUFACTURING
INITIATIVE

»

We strive for suppliers to be self-governing and support them to raise their
level of management so that they are
able to handle their workers with little
supervision or annual monitoring. The
Bowker Factory, an important strategic ­adidas Group supplier in Vietnam,
serves as a good example of how these
measures drive effective change.
When the factory did not provide a very
good social compliance performance
based on our audits and assessments
back in 2012, the senior management
of the factory took the results of our
compliance ratings to heart and realised it was time to make changes in
order to boost worker’s morale and
decrease the high turnover rate.
Under the direction of the ­
B owker
Group COO and in close cooperation with our SEA team to identify
key areas to focus on in order to create long-lasting change, the factory launched the ‘Respect, Fairness
and Dedication’ project. Also known
as ‘Happy Manufacturing’, it provides action, initiatives and practical

«

guidance for all employees on how to
create a more conductive working environment. Thanks to the strong commitment from top management, the
impact of the initiative has been remarkable: By
—	
promoting and rewarding productivity and efficiency,
—	
improving benefits for workers
and
—	
showing more respect towards
workers thanks to the strict implementation of a zero harassment policy,
the average monthly labour turnover rate decreased by more than 3%,
a double reduction compared to the
same period in 2012 before the project
roll-out. In addition, the quality within the production process – measured by a KPI called Rights First Time
(RFT) – is up to 97%. Also, rework has
been reduced by 80% and the monthly
output has tripled. With morale and
engagement higher than ever, the
‘Happy Manufacturing’ programme
easily makes this a best practice story to improve workers’ welfare of an
­a didas Group supplier.

»We are very lucky to have a strong management team who listens to us and takes our
concerns seriously. There is no hierarchy
here, only teamwork from top to bottom, and
this makes me feel happy and valued.

CHANGE
Through sport we have the power to
change lives and to have an impact
on athletes, teams, leagues, fans and
everyone else involved in sports. As
a company we are proud to support
all those who strive to initiate positive
change.
In 2015, we started to lead a voluntary
initiative in the US offering support to
high schools across the country that
want to change their official team mascot names and identities from potentially harmful native American imagery or symbolism. The offer, which was
announced ahead of the White House
Tribal Nations Conference, includes financial assistance and complementary design resources to provide schools
and high school athletes a pathway to
create new identities, bring people together and provide common ground
to ignite positive change. The project
is now off and running and our team
is working with interested schools on
making a change.
The initiative is an example of the
Group’s new business strategy ‘Creating the New’ as it shows perfectly how
through sport we have the power to
change lives on and off the court and to
tackle even controversial and politically charged topics. It is part of our vision
to work with creators around the world
and engage in important community
and global issues when it helps people
and athletes the world over to create an
inclusive environment that fosters fair
play, inclusion and hope.

THE NEW:

HOW OUR
EMPLOYEES
ARE
EMPOWERED
TO TAKE
OWNER–
SHIP OF THEIR
CAREERS
Our overall objective to empower people also includes the employees of
the ­
adidas Group around the world.
We believe that only when our employees have the best training, benefits and environment can they work at
their best. For this reason, we strive
to create a culture that cherishes and
celebrates collaboration, creativity and confidence – three behaviours
we deem crucial to the successful

delivery of our ‘Creating the New’
business strategy and the well-being
of our employees.
As one element of the strategy, we
strive to provide meaningful reasons to
join the adidas Group. At the same time,
we want to create an environment that
enables employees to develop their
individual path towards their career
goals and makes them want to stay
with us. There are already several programmes in place all across the Group
that aim to deliver a unique working
environment and work towards our aim
to be the ‘employer of choice’.
One of the most recent additions is the
Talent Carousel. While complementary
to other formal learning programmes,
the programme sets itself apart by
providing a new career boost to internal talent: First, it was open to all employees across the Group, regardless of
their location and function, and second,
all elements were tailored to create an
extremely personalised candidate experience. As a result, 20 participants
from across the company were placed
in a new role in a different location. The
goal was to enable them to gain new

CREATING

functional skills and behaviours, learn
about a new culture, broaden their experience and develop new networks. In
addition, they will receive coaching and
mentoring opportunities that will not
only give them a detailed plan on how
to realise their career and life aspirations, but also prepare them to take on a
senior leadership role in the future and
serve as a role model for the next generation of talent. While the Talent Carousel allows employees to take ownership of their careers and play an integral
active part in creating the new, it also
provides an invaluable platform for HR
to test innovative programmes before
they are introduced on a larger scale.
The Talent Carousel, like all other programmes as part of the People Strategy, was developed based on extensive
research, which included the exploration of the personal meaning of work,
global megatrends and their impact
on people, organisations, and innovation as well as the digital and physical
workplace of the future. It also played
an essential part in creating the new
business environment at the ­
adidas
Group to empower our people and help
them to achieve their personal best.

After 64% of our direct suppliers met ‘good’ social compliance performance (3C) or above in 2014,
this was even increased to 69% of all direct suppliers as of the end of 2015.
Read more on page 72.

80% of strategic suppliers
to achieve ‘good’ (3C) score

FULLY ACHIEVED
By the end of 2015, 92% of all strategic suppliers met ‘good’ social compliance performance (3C)
or better.

25% of our strategic suppliers to be in self-governance compliance model (4C
or better).

FULLY ACHIEVED
After 59% of our strategic suppliers were already at 4C or better in 2014, 73% of our strategic
suppliers achieved a 4C rating as of the end of 2015.

Enhance the workers’
grievance system.

FULLY ACHIEVED
Introduced in 2012, we have now rolled out our SMS worker hotline system to three countries
(Indonesia, Vietnam and Cambodia) to cover a total of 58 factories. As of the end of 2015, more than
263,000 workers had access to this innovative service, offering factory workers the opportunity to
ask questions, make suggestions or express their concerns by text.

Report cards for all eligible business entities (BE)
managing our indirect
suppliers to achieve an average performance rating
of 70% or higher.

FULLY ACHIEVED
The target was even exceeded, with an average performance rating of 72% as of the end of 2015.
Report card average score for eligible BEs had already increased to 69% in 2014 although requirements had been increased as well, which had made it more difficult for business entities to achieve
a higher score. The increased score in 2015 shows that BEs managed to embed compliance into
their daily practice more effectively.

Raise the overall understanding and awareness
of occupational health &
safety (OHS) issues specific to the manufacturing
process within the supply
chain.

FULLY ACHIEVED
We have conducted various projects and initiatives such as an OHS officer training in Cambodia,
an Indoor Air Quality test and training in Cambodia, an Electrical Safety audit and workshop in
Indonesia, an Automation Machine Safety risk assessment and workshop in China and a regular
HAVS workshop for TaylorMade-­adidas Golf suppliers.

Promote a common, industry-wide monitoring platform, methodology and
tools to check, measure
and verify fair, healthy and
safe workplace conditions.

LARGELY ACHIEVED — ONGOING
We launched the Fair Compensation strategy by aligning it with our Human Rights Framework
to Respect, Protect and Promote, as well as the Fair Labor Association’s (FLA) Fair Compensation strategy, by finalising a three-year implementation plan and starting that plan by refocusing
on closing out existing wage and compensation violations identified and pending in our audits’
corrective action plans.
In addition, all of our suppliers in Bangladesh have been audited against the new and higher
standards of fire and building safety introduced by the Accord and have made good progress in
closing out issues identified. As a result, we have even been called ‘lead brand’ for our remediation
efforts. Moreover, we have taken the learnings from the Accord process and developed a fire and
building safety risk assessment tool, which has now been applied to other suppliers in Asia.

2015 TARGETS (SUPPLY CHAIN)

EVALUATION

Systematically
promote
motivation and accountability through talent and
performance
management.

FULLY ACHIEVED — ONGOING
As part of our ongoing activities, we drove an approach that focused on individual development of
employees and development conversations with line managers as well as providing opportunities to
both line managers and employees to reflect on their personal strength and development paths. This
was achieved with learning kits on how to lead development conversations and how to give feedback
as well as our mentoring programme. Both leaders and employees were strongly encouraged to
document these in a development plan – online or on paper.
In addition, we promoted motivation and accountability through the following talent and performance
management measures:
—	the ‘Talent Carousel’, a new talent program for globally mobile talents,
—	proactive management of internal talents through the realisation of development plans,
—	ensuring a strong pipeline of candidates,
—	systematic increase of women in leadership positions (we managed to increase the percentage of
women in leadership positions by 1 percentage point to 29% in 2015),
—	as well as the introduction of ‘The Score’, which facilitates open and honest feedback on performance and growth opportunities.

Establish
standardised,
end-to-end, system-supported HR processes to reduce duplication of efforts,
create efficiencies and enforce discipline.

FULLY ACHIEVED — ONGOING
HR Services, a centralised, intranet-based HR support service centre for employees, went live in
Germany in 2014 and offers employees support and answers to HR questions via phone, email and
a Ticket Self Service App. The setup of HR Services has significantly improved processes such as
employee data maintenance, contract management, administration of on- and off-boarding, as well
as increased timely and accurate vo data maintenance and payroll compliance.
In 2015 we also delivered:
—	a centralised Organisation Management maintenance approach which increases data accuracy
and quality while significantly reducing errors and support effort.
—	an authorisation and role concept for HR Partners for the corporate HR system, based on our
organisational structure, initially in Germany, as well as a single sign-on functionality for users.
The request and approval process has been streamlined and ensures access rights according to
functional responsibilities. The revised authorisation approach sets the basis for a successful
launch of a new, consolidated and transparent digital employee profile in 2016.
—	the consolidation of standard and ad hoc employee data related reporting requests, globally and
throughout Europe. This has led to a reduction of manual effort and now ensures the delivery of
timely, accurate, transparent and comparable data sources enabling the organisation to make
data-based decisions.
—	the launch of a consolidated payroll delivery in North America and Greater China as part of our
global payroll strategy.

Further embed leadership
mindsets in daily life.

LARGELY ACHIEVED — ONGOING
While we kept living our leadership mindsets in 2015, against which leaders were measured in
their annual performance review, we have continued to evolve and introduced the so-called ‘3C’
behaviours: creativity, collaboration and confidence that support our culture for the new business
strategy ‘Creating the New’. These behaviours are based on what we want to see in our people and
will be included in the ­adidas Group performance management tool (‘The Score’) as of 2016. They
will also form the basis for the development of leadership programs in the future.

Create the foundation for
open, innovative and collaborative learning solutions.

LARGELY ACHIEVED — ONGOING
After launching the Learning Campus – our Corporate University – in 2014, we conducted two
upgrades to the online platform and its content in 2015 to add apps and improve overall user
experience based on a global user feedback survey. We are also adding content to support strategic
initiatives on a regular basis. As we are developing new learning opportunities all the time, this

As part of our ambition to create responsibly, we are continuously searching for new ways to make better products
and to innovate manufacturing techniques. In 2015, our
partnership with Parley for the Oceans, a thought leader in ocean conservation and eco innovation that raises
awareness to end the destruction of the oceans, took our
ambition to a new level.
Every year several million tons of plastic trash end up in
the ocean, seriously endangering the ecosystem and ultimately our own life space. With this in mind, our partnership with Parley aims to end plastic pollution of the oceans
and accelerate the creation of innovative products and the
integration of materials made from Ocean Plastic waste
into our products.
First announced in April 2015, the partnership builds on
the ­adidas Group’s strong track record in product sustainability and is already showing tangible results proving that
this is not just a strategy far in the future, but a real plan
already in action. Already in June 2015, we announced the
creation of the world’s first shoe made of yarns and filaments reclaimed and recycled from ocean waste. Then,
in December 2015, on the occasion of COP21, we unveiled
an innovative footwear concept, a 3D-printed Ocean Plastic shoe midsole, to demonstrate how the industry can
re-think design and contribute to stopping Ocean Plastic
pollution.
Our support for Parley for the Oceans ranges from communication and education efforts, such as the so-called
‘Parley Talks’ to raise awareness to research and education all the way to the invitation to consumers and employees to be part of the solution. At the same time, we
are adopting Parley’s comprehensive Ocean Plastic Programme A.I.R. (Avoid, Intercept, Redesign), which intends

to end plastic pollution with
tangible steps and initiatives, to our own products
and initiatives.

We are taking extra steps to
avoid the use of plastic and
waste in our industry. For
example, plastic bags will
be phased out in the retail
stores that we own. As of
January 1st, 2016, together
with our partner COTY, we

using plastic bottles at our
headquarters in Germany and are now also offering paper straws and paper food boxes instead of plastic ones.
In addition, from a product perspective, our partnership
also ties into many water saving initiatives that have been
put in motion already. One of them is our DryDye initiative,
which reduces the amount of water used in the making of
our products. Another example is our virtualisation project, which has allowed us to produce 2.4 million fewer
samples between 2011 and 2015. The pillar intercept recently came to action in November 2015 when 20 a

employees took part in the Parley Ocean School on the
Maldives, a programme that blends ocean activism with
experiential learning and activities in a marine environment. They attended workshops, discussion groups and
informal meetings with Parley. Throughout their trip, the
participants learned valuable facts about the true state of
the oceans and took on the challenge to serve as ambassadors going forward with the aim to contribute to a better
future of our industry. In terms of redesign, we celebrated
our partnership by creating the innovative prototype shoe
upper and the 3D-printed Ocean Plastic shoe midsole.
While our partnership with Parley for the Oceans opens
the door for great opportunities to inspire action among
our consumers in the field of sustainability, this is not a
stand-alone project.
Starting with limited collections, the intention is to gradually move inline and fully integrate materials made of
Ocean Plastic waste into our regular ranges. In addition
to supporting Parley for the Oceans at awareness-raising
events, such as at the UN in New York City or on the occasion of COP 21 in Paris, we will continue to create and use

HOW
SUSTAINABLE
MATERIALS
HELP CREATE
SOCIAL
CHANGE
Our commitment to use more sustainable materials does not only reduce
waste and combine sustainability and
innovation beautifully; it also brings
social change with it.
In addition to our Sport Infinity research
project launched in 2015, we have further expanded the use of environmentally preferred materials such as recycled polyester and Better Cotton in
recent years.
As a founding member of the ­Better
Cotton Initiative (BCI) and in close

cooperation with other brands, we
continue to drive the demand for sustainable cotton, improve global cotton
production and the lives of workers in
the overall cotton industry. A great example and proof of the initiative’s success can be found in Brazil, the largest
source of Better Cotton globally: BCI
has significantly influenced the working standards in Brazilian cotton production by stipulating decent working
conditions (including safety equipment,
training and salary negotiations), benefits (including vacation leave and limited working hours) and proper accommodation for the workers and their
families. This positive development is
due to the growing number of producers who commit to adhere to the legal
regulations of the BCI standards and,
by being BCI certified, have access to
international markets and customers
who expect responsible production
practices. The success of the initiative
is also visible in numbers: In 2015, 43%
of the cotton we used globally was Better Cotton, exceeding our original target of 40%. This is a great step towards

BETTER
COT–
TON
43%
100%

our 2018 targets to source 100% of cotton across all product categories in all
our brands as ‘sustainable cotton’.
In addition to Better Cotton, we use several other sustainable materials including recycled polyester, which helps us
to reduce our dependency on petroleum
and leads to less waste on the one hand
and a reduction of toxic emissions on the
other. As a result, the material offers the
opportunity to reduce our environmental
impact while still enabling us to produce
high performance products for athletes.
Prominent examples include the ­Anthem
Jacket collection, versatile warm-up
jackets used by athletes across several sports as well as the German Away
­Jersey for the UEFA EURO 2016™.
Better Cotton and recycled polyester –
along with other materials such as
EcoOrthoLite, eco-friendly footwear for
children, and the use of recycled nylon
in our swimwear collection – are fitting
examples of our commitment to improve our environmental footprint with
sustainable materials and products.

»

«

To manage our supply chain in a responsible manner is one thing, but
not the whole story. Striving to close
the sustainability loop, the ultimate
goal we can achieve with sustainable
products, we constantly look into better materials and advanced manufacturing processes that will reduce the
amount of waste that products turn into at the end of their life cycle. As most
materials degrade towards the end,
it is often necessary to mix them with
virgin resources during the recycling

process, which makes closing the loop
that much more difficult.
In order to develop a material that can
be endlessly recycled using a wastefree, adhesive-free process, we are
leading an innovative research project called ‘Sport Infinity’, introduced
in 2015. In close cooperation with nine
other industry-leading companies and
funded by the European Commission,
the project aims to identify and develop
innovative recyclable composites that
can be broken down into 3D-shapeable materials, and then remoulded in
a waste-free process into a brand new
product, closing the sustainability loop.
In addition to our research project
Speedfactory – which aims to bring
production closer to the consumer with
automation – and our partnership with
Parley for the Oceans, ‘Sport Infinity’
is another big step in our commitment
to innovation and sustainability and
makes the year 2015 yet again a crucial
year for sustainable innovations at the
­adidas Group.

EVALUATION

Reduce colours used within
the a
­ didas Sports Performance
division by 50% (excluding colours required by clubs or otherwise outside the control of the
Design team).

FULLY ACHIEVED
This target was already achieved in 2013. From Spring/Summer 2012 to Spring/Summer
2014, the Sports Performance division reduced its overall colours by 50%, from 360 to 180.

Conduct a virtualisation project
to drive reduction in samples.

FULLY ACHIEVED
By continuing our virtualisation efforts we were able to produce 2.4 million fewer samples
between 2011 and 2015. Reductions were made across all ranges, producing 1,700,000
fewer apparel samples and 700,000 fewer samples of footwear and hardware. Creating
fewer physical samples helped us to further lower our environmental footprint and reduce
global transport.

Optimise packaging solutions.

FULLY ACHIEVED
During 2014 we used single wall carton quality for standard a
­ didas Group carton sizes
globally and generated significant volumes of paper savings.

Ensure all footwear – and an increasing amount of apparel – is
created with sustainable materials and/or more sustainable
manufacturing processes.

FULLY ACHIEVED
At the end of 2015 all of our ­adidas footwear products included environmentally preferred
materials such as recycled polyester, recycled rubber or bio-based thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). In addition, we have been increasing the use of environmentally preferred
materials such as recycled polyester, recycled nylon or sustainable cotton in our ­adidas
apparel and accessories products. In order to decrease our environmental impact, we are
also changing the way we make our products. Some examples of this include using advanced
dyeing techniques like DryDye, that decrease the amount of water, energy and chemicals
used in the dyeing process and creating more efficient designs that ultimately reduce the
amount of material waste by increasing pattern efficiency.

Use 40% Better Cotton by 2015
and 100% ‘sustainable cotton’
by 2018.

FULLY ACHIEVED
We have exceeded this target by sourcing 43% of all our cotton as Better Cotton which is a
great step towards our 2018 target to source 100% of cotton in our products as sustainable
cotton.

EVALUATION

Support the Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC) to further
develop the creation of the HIGG
index.

FULLY ACHIEVED
In 2015, the ­adidas Group continued to support the SAC with both content and technical
expertise for Higg Index 2.0 development. The Higg Index 2.0 is a suite of assessment tools
that standardises the measurement of environmental and social impacts of apparel and
footwear products across the product life cycle and throughout the value chain, and serves
to conduct self-assessment in three areas: Facilities, Brand and Product.
We continued to support the ‘Higg 2.0 Index Facility Environment Module’ adoption in our
strategic supply chain as our primary environmental assessment tool in 2015. In addition, we
are actively involved in and are part of various working groups for the verification protocol
and Facility Environment Module 3.0 (FEM 3.0) development. We believe the FEM 3.0 will
help support convergence and consistency in supply chain evaluations by integrating various
monitoring tools into a single source.
In addition, the a
­ didas Group continued to use the ‘Higg 2.0 Index Brand Modules’ to assess
its own sustainability level in 2015. We are a regular and active participant in the ‘Higg 2.0
Index Product Module’ development known as the Design and Development Module (DDM). In
2015, we actively contributed to piloting the DDM to assess the sustainability of our products
using this standardised approach. We are also actively contributing to the development of
the Materials Sustainability Index (MSI) version 2.0 for future synching with our materials
systems.
Our collaboration with the SAC also applies to our commitment to pilot and contribute to
the European Union’s Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) initiative, which will be used
in 2016 to assess the environmental footprint of a selected set of footwear products across
their full life cycle and test the communication of this information to consumers in real retail
store environments. The feedback on this EU PEF Pilot will be used to further drive the
development of the Higg Index for products.

LARGELY ACHIEVED
In 2015, Sustainable Material Tracking Tool (SMTT) reporting and functional enhancements
were completed and SMTT Version 2.0 was rolled out successfully. In addition, operational
refresher courses were conducted within the a
­ didas Group as well as the supplier base to
deal with minor issues due to system inaccuracies. The SMTT tool is running effectively to
support the traceability needs of our supply base.

RESPONSIBILITY:

The main goal is clear: we strive to continuously reduce our
footprint at our own sites and all across our supply chain
while creating the best for the athlete. When it comes to
our chemical footprint, the management of chemicals in
multi-tiered supply chains is a complex challenge, one
that requires many actors to play a role in achieving effective and sustainable solutions. For years, we have
been running leadership programmes that address this
topic within our area of direct influence. In 2015, we further strengthened our efforts beyond our direct partners
through unique collaborations that allow us to drive further significant change in the industry.
We understand that we are much stronger when we team
up. For this reason, just like with most initiatives and programmes as part of our sustainability work, we promote
an open collaboration with stakeholders, partners and
other companies to create the necessary positive change
to the industry. A key milestone in 2015 came to life in
Taiwan, where we co-hosted the public-facing ‘Chemical Management Summit’ together with other companies
in the textile industry and our partner bluesign® technologies, a world-leading provider of assessment tools for
positive chemistry in the textile industry. Colleagues of
our Brand Operations, Material Sourcing, Social & Environmental Affairs (SEA) and Global Operations strategy teams confirmed the current chemical management
roadmap including joint goals of increased transparency
and how to improve the chemical footprint in our supply
chain. At the same time, the participants also shared best
practices and set action plans for the future. The overwhelming positive feedback and contributions we received
from the close to 200 participants showed that there is
a clear understanding of the chemical management programme, our targets and expectations in our supply chain
as well as the agreement that further change is required.
More importantly, our innovative partners will support
this change and take responsibility for their role in the value chain. We are doing the same with regard to chemical
management by moving our attention beyond the partners
we hold a direct relationship with.

To support these efforts we welcomed more than a dozen
new members to our team in 2015, thus creating an even
stronger and highly specialised cross-functional group that
drives the chemical management programme in a holistic
and innovative way. With different backgrounds in research
and development, sourcing, supplier monitoring and environmental assessment of chemistry, one of the priorities
of our new colleagues was to create further transparency in our supply chain in order to better understand where
and for what purpose chemicals are used. They also helped
us to further deepen our chemical expertise, educated our
product creation teams to ensure they are creating products in such a way that the right chemicals can be selected
and strengthened our research capacities in finding alternatives that meet our high performance and quality standards.

the adidas Group is a role

One example is our innovative collaboration with our
chemical supplier Huntsman Textile Effects, a leading
global provider of high-quality dyes and chemicals with
strong expertise globally, thanks to their local technical
service teams. This new partnership has already resulted in some very practical tools, including the Chemical
Management Guideline (CMG), a new and innovative capacity-building programme for suppliers. To familiarise
with this tool, over 450 people at 30 of our strategic apparel suppliers in five countries received the CMG’s training. Firstly, to strengthen their overall knowledge on how
to record, understand and monitor the chemical inventory as well as the safe handling of the chemical products
from storage to use and, ultimately, disposal. Secondly,

they were to cascade this knowledge to their internal colleagues for an important and efficient multiplier effect.
The chemical inventory of these suppliers, who produce
more than 90% of our apparel material volume, was recorded twice in 2015 in order to monitor the progress.

28% per employee, a reduction of household waste volume
by 27% per employee and a reduction of carbon emissions
by 30% per square metre. For more details, please go to
page 81. Based on this success, we developed the second
generation of our Green Company programme in 2015, including targets to be achieved by 2020. Building on seven
years of achievements, the new targets do not only demonstrate our continued focus on industry leadership in environmental stewardship but also take our ambitions one

Over the past few years, we have been
working closely with the Institute of
Public & Environmental Affairs (IPE),
the Beijing-based non-­governmental

to improve the monitoring of our supply
chain performance in China. As soon as
we are notified of a supplier’s environmental violation, we use our in-house
environmental experts to investigate
and drive continuous improvement of
the issue. At the same time, we are
committed to delivering full transparency of our suppliers’ hazardous chemical use, emissions and wastewater
discharges. We are proud to see that
50% of our total material supply chain
by volume has disclosed their waste­
water data on the IPE platform by now.
In 2015, our increased disclosure practices have been officially recognised:
The ­adidas Group ranks first in the textile sector and second overall out of 167
companies across industries evaluated in the Corporate Information Transparency Index (CITI). Created by the
IPE in close cooperation with the USbased environmental non-governmental organisation, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the index

When it comes to partnerships, we rely on open and transparent communication between all parties to create positive change along our supply chain. A challenge that is
harder when certain products are made under license,
which means that a licensee has the direct relationship
with a supplier and not us. While we regularly audit our
licensee factories to ensure compliance with our Workplace Standards, we went one step further in 2015 and
started evaluating the responsible sourcing practices of
our licensees as their own practices can also contribute
to persistent code violations influencing workplace conditions and workers’ wellbeing in the factories. This has
made us one of the first companies to implement the responsible sourcing concept.
Our key priority to ensure that even those suppliers we
do not have a direct relationship with comply with our
Workplace Standards is an ongoing effort. In 2009, we
already used our engagement with the licensees to develop a Strategic Compliance Plan (SCP) and Report Card
Process, which help the licensees to integrate compliance into their daily performance and us to evaluate it
accordingly. To measure our progress we have set a clear
target for 2015. It states that report cards for all eligible
business entities (BE) managing our indirect suppliers
have to achieve an average performance rating of 70% or
higher. Our efforts were rewarded as this target was exceeded with an average performance rating of 72% as of
the end of 2015. This showed that BEs managed to embed
compliance into their daily practice more effectively. At
the same time, three of our BEs achieved an overall score
of more than 80%, demonstrating that they made strong
progress in managing their supply chain responsibly.

In more detail, the ‘Responsible Sourcing’ concept outlines that licensees seek long-term and mutually beneficial relationships with their suppliers that are based on
a constructive and two-way dialogue, train their staff efficiently on their policy, make sure that departments and
individuals are held accountable, engage in an effective
internal and external dialogue and recognise those suppliers with high performance. Overall, licensees and suppliers have to work together to ensure that a licensee’s
sourcing decision and actions do not harm the workers
making our products or impact the supplier’s ability to adhere to our Workplace Standards.
In order to familiarise our licensees with the new approach, we provided special training to some of them in
2015. We supported them in developing and improving
their internal responsible sourcing policy and related procedures, training their relevant staff and providing effective communication channels between their sourcing and
planning departments and their compliance team. We will
expand these training sessions to the majority of our licensees in 2016.
We believe that with this integrated approach on Responsible Sourcing, licensees will start evaluating their internal policy and practices to avoid causing any negative
impacts with their own practices and improve the working conditions and workers’ wellbeing together with their
suppliers.

Based on our belief that a
licensee’s sound internal
sourcing policy and procedures are essential for a
suppliers’ workplace conditions and workers’ wellbeing, the process saw further improvement in 2015
when we integrated a concept called ‘Responsible
Sourcing’ into our licensees’ SCP. Inaccurate planning and forecasting, inadequate costing approaches
or orders above the factories’ capacity are just some
examples of licensees’ sourcing practices that can force
suppliers to unintentionally follow practices that do not
comply with our Workplace Standards. The new approach
asks licensees to acknowledge and mitigate the negative impacts of their sourcing practices on supplier’s and
their workers, to review their practices and develop their
own policy.

CEO of the ­adidas Group

TOGETHER
FOR
REFUGEES

US

When the refugee crisis hit the global news outlets in 2015, it was hardly
the beginning but rather a development
that had been going on for years.
The ­
adidas Group has been involved
in refugee initiatives for many years.
We focus on areas that we can impact in a meaningful way. Our overall
approach to support refugees follows
our three-pillar model that is based on
humanitarian aid, close collaboration
with public authorities and external
partners as well as volunteers, and the
development of possible employment
integration.
For example, we recently joined the
business-driven integration initiative
‘Wir zusammen’ (engl: us together) in
Germany to drive long-term projects
that aim to help refugees find their

place in society. On top of our monetary donations, we encourage our employees to bring this initiative to life by
organising and joining regular sporting events and other charitable efforts
to support and integrate refugees into
society. This includes employees receiving three additional vacation days
on top as a reward and motivation to
support these activities. In addition, we
are offering a number of short-term internships to 30 refugees to get an insight into our business, retail and logistics endeavours. This will support their
integration into the European business
environment that will be key for their
future life.
On a global level, we have been working
with the non-governmental organisation ‘Luftfahrt ohne Grenzen’ (‘Wings of
Help’) since 2012 to provide and donate
products to refugee camps in Syria and
Turkey on a regular basis. We also react
to current events: when the situation in
Europe – especially in Germany – became more and more dramatic in 2015,
the Executive Board decided to donate
€ 500,000 on top of our regular donations
to several initiatives and programmes.
This includes the SOS Children’s Villages, the refugee aid programme in
our hometown Herzogenaurach as well
as needs-based donations to support

54

THROUGH
SPORT
WE HAVE
THE POWER TO
CHANGE LIVES:

our own c­ompany-driven refugee aid
activities.
In addition to mere financial and product donations, we have also taken a
stand on the refugee situation in Turkey
where refugees are looking for work
without proper ID cards, passports
and work permits and are struggling
to find meaningful officially registered
and insured employment. In order to
address the useful work integration of
refugees and create a legal basis for
employment and sustainable improvement of the refugees’ situation, we
joined other member brands of the Fair
­L abor Association (FLA), Ethical Trading Initiative and Fair Wear Foundation
and co-signed a letter to the Turkish
Prime Minister to regularise employment for Syrian workers in September.
We were happy to see that the Turkish
government published the ‘Regulation
on Work Permits of Foreigners Under
Temporary Protection’ in January 2016,
allowing many of the 2.5 million Syrian
refugees to apply for work permits.
Based on the belief that we have the
power to change lives through sport,
these examples show our efforts
to create positive change where we
can and provide support wherever
possible.

The signing of the Bangladesh Accord
on Fire and Building Safety in 2013, an
independent, legally binding agreement between brands and trade unions,
was a major milestone to work towards
a safe and healthy garment industry
in Bangladesh. While the country only

accounts for a very small volume of our
global production, we saw great value
in joining the Accord and did not hesitate to follow the Accord’s recommendation to be the ‘lead brand’ for all four
supplier factories’ remediation efforts.
As part of our commitment, our Social and Environmental Affairs (SEA)
team engaged closely with the respective factory managements and the Accord engineering team to ensure that
all Corrective Action Plans (CAPs) are
being executed properly and on time.
The team also made several follow-up
visits to the factories in 2015 to check
on the remediation status and provide advice where necessary. While
there are several common non-compliance i­ssues relating to fire doors or

sprinklers as well as electrical cable
installation, none of these are deemed
as high-risk issues and no major
­issues were reported after the Structural Safety Assessment.
In support, a recent survey conducted by the Accord team showed that the
CAPs are mostly on track in all of our
factories, with only a few being behind
schedule. However, this is due mostly to
technical and procurement challenges,
which need approval from the Accord
team and take time, and are not caused
by a lack of commitment. Our SEA team
will continue to ensure that the remediation efforts with regard to fire and
electrical safety are properly executed,
further improving the safety standards
for the workers in Bangladesh.

While Bangladesh
only accounts for
a very small volume
of our global production, we saw great
value in joining the
Accord and did not
hesitate to follow
the Accord's recommendation to be the
»lead brand« for all
four supplier factories’
remediation efforts.

NUMBER OF SUPPLIER FACTORIES
At the end of 2015, we worked with 1,079 independent factories which manufacture
­adidas Group products in 61 countries. 65% of the factories are located in the Asia
Pacific region, 25% in the Americas and 10% in Europe, Middle East and Africa
(EMEA).
In the course of any calendar year there have been notable changes in the number of
supplier factories we work with, as suppliers are added or removed. This is because
business entities are created, bought or sold by the ­adidas Group, or intermediaries – such
as agents – are hired or their services are terminated. The data we are reporting here is a
snapshot in time capturing the situation at the end of twelve months of these movements.

2015 saw a further reduction in the number of suppliers making products in China.
Supplier numbers in India also declined as a result of local sourcing integration, which
is driving greater consolidation. As newly developing sourcing location, the number of
factories in Myanmar expanded further and more factories were added to the supply

chain in Cambodia, Pakistan and Vietnam. Overall supplier numbers in EMEA continued
to decline, with a significant reduction in local sourcing activities in the United Kingdom
and a further reduction in factories producing in Turkey. The number of factories in the
Americas increased slightly due to the onboarding of new US embellishers.

NUMBER OF TRAINING SESSIONS DIVIDED BY REGION AND TYPE
Overall, the number of training sessions conducted in 2015 declined slightly
compared to the previous year, although almost 2,000 people still attended training
sessions. The training offered in each region covered basic, as well as long-term,
strategic topics.
There were two reasons for the drop in the total number of training sessions: firstly,
group training sessions especially related to sustainability training topics partly replaced
individual ones (i.e. for more than one supplier). This offered both higher efficiencies and
opportunities for cross-learning and best practice sharing among suppliers. Secondly,
fewer fundamental training sessions were held since there were fewer factories to
onboard.

In 2015, the SEA team conducted 1,135 social compliance and environmental audits,
using in-house technical staff as well as external third party monitors, commissioned
by a
­ didas Group business entities and licensees.
The total number of initial assessments – the first approval stage for new entry
factories – decreased slightly by 7% compared to 2014. Performance audits for our
established suppliers showed a decline of 4%, reflecting the decline in the number of
suppliers as well as the increase in the number of suppliers that moved to self-governing
compliance activities, including auditing. The total number of environmental audits fell
slightly by 3% compared to the previous year. Specific chemical management audits
form part of the environmental audits and have been undertaken as well. In addition to
these audits, compliance staff conducted multiple supplier site visits to discuss specific
remedial issues, to follow up project work or to conduct training sessions.
There were a total of 285 initial assessments (including initial assessment follow-ups),
72% of which were undertaken in Asia, with China accounting for 48% of all assessments
conducted. Overall, 49% of all candidate factories were either rejected outright or
were rejected for failure to remediate threshold issues in a timely manner. For further

1	Every new supplier factory has to pass an initial assessment to prove compliance with the Workplace Standards before an order is placed. The data
includes both ‘initial assessments’ and ‘initial assessment follow-ups’.

4	Includes audits done in licensee factories. In addition, there was a considerable number of full environmental assessments conducted for selected
suppliers in Asia.

A total of 49% (2014: 47%) of all active suppliers were audited in 2015. ‘High-risk’
countries in Asia 1, the major sourcing region of the ­adidas Group, received extensive
monitoring in 2015 with an audit coverage that was close to 59%. It is important to mention
that our compliance database also includes suppliers located in ‘low-risk’ countries as
well as suppliers designated as ‘low priority’, mainly referring to subcontractors making
non-core components for a finished product. While we include these types of suppliers in
our database to achieve greater visibility of our supply chain, they are currently excluded
from our monitoring activities. Consequently, audit coverage would be higher if only
high-risk countries were taken into consideration.
Our monitoring programme is characterised by a risk management approach, which
means that we do not envisage 100% audit coverage in every country where our factories
are located. Although there has been a decline in audit coverage in some countries, the
intensity of engagement with factories has increased, particularly in respect of those
suppliers with problematic or open threshold issues, or those in need of support to
improve their management systems.

NON-COMPLIANCES IDENTIFIED AT SUPPLIER FACTORIES
Our suppliers are evaluated against a number of critical compliance issues. While
zero tolerance issues – such as forced labour practices – immediately disqualify
a factory from further consideration, threshold issues trigger rejection at new
factories, but can be addressed in a specified timeframe at existing factories.
The charts in this section illustrate the non-compliances identified during initial
assessments and initial assessment follow-up visits to proposed new factories
in 2015.
The first chart presents the labour-related non-compliances identified in supplier
factories. A supplier must resolve identified issues before it can be accepted into the
­adidas Group supply chain. More than two-thirds of the labour-related findings fall
into the top three broad categories: ‘Wages’, ‘Benefits’ and ‘Working Hours/Overtime’.
‘Wages’ covers – among other things – policies and practices in the factory for the timely
and full payment of wages, overtime payments and deductions. ‘Benefits’ relates mainly
to policies and practices for benefits, social and medical insurance, leave and public
holidays. ‘Working hours/Overtime’ covers management systems for working hours,
policies and practices, excessive working hours, regular and overtime working hours
as well as rest days.

1	General Principle covers company policies, employee handbook, management attitude and transparency, employment contracts and filing systems.
2	Disciplinary Practices covers disciplinary policy, procedures and recordings, training, effective grievance systems and non-retaliation policy.
3	Child and Juvenile Labour covers management systems, policies and practices to prevent the employment of child labour and the necessary protections
for juvenile workers, if they are of a legal age to work. The 2% shown here mainly points to the lack of effective management systems to prevent child
labour or effectively manage juvenile labour.
4	Forced and Compulsory Labour covers management systems to prevent forced and compulsory labour, prison labour, slavery and trafficking, forced
overtime, lack of freedom of movement, retention and documents, recruitments agents and fees.
5	Other refers to, for example, HR Management and privacy issues.

Besides identifying non-compliances with our Workplace Standards at factories, the
­adidas Group compliance team particularly focuses on the existence and implementation
of management systems on the supplier’s side. The team identifies any gaps in policies
and procedures related to specific areas such as forced labour, child labour, freedom of
association or discrimination. As a result, the percentages shown indicate the systemic
shortcomings of newly proposed suppliers, rather than the confirmed presence of
specific non-compliances, such as child labour etc. For details, see page 70.
The second chart shows the health & safety non-compliances identified in supplier
factories. Fire and electrical safety are critical areas for any potential new supplier and
together accounted for 20% of the non-compliances identified in 2015. The way chemicals
were stored and used, including the presence of banned chemicals, accounted for 15%
of non-conformances reported. A further 17% of the findings related to management
systems, policies and procedures, and specifically a lack of conformance with our
Workplace Standards and expectations for effective health & safety systems, including
the recruitment and retention of qualified safety staff.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATOR (KPI)
ASSESSMENT: C-RATING AND E-RATING
We audit our suppliers regularly against our Workplace Standards and rate them
according to their performance. To do so, we have established an innovative way
to rate suppliers on their ability to deliver fair, healthy and environmentally sound
workplace conditions.
In 2015, social compliance ratings show that 69% of our direct suppliers were
assessed as ‘good’ (3C) or better and environmental assessment ratings show that
a total of 81% of factories received ratings as ‘good’ (3E) or better.
SOCIAL COMPLIANCE RATING (C-KPI)
The following table shows the average assessment score by unit of measure for active
suppliers. Each unit of measure is scored out of 100%. We use a parallel system to
measure environmental performance, which is described later. Compared to 2014, the
average score of all C-KPI units of measure increased in 2015.
Generally, newly assessed factories start with a relatively low KPI score and build and
improve their management systems and compliance performance over a period of years.
Despite this, we noticed improvements for all units of measure and the cumulative score
in line with the fall in percentage of 1C and 2C – and increase in percentage of 3C and
4C – factory clusters.

The calculation method was changed in 2012 to better reflect actual supplier performance. Numbers are calculated using the latest KPI assessment
rating of each active supplier.

The bar graph overleaf shows comparable data for the past six years using this rating
classification.

72

In 2015, the number of 1C category suppliers, which represent the lowest performing
factories with serious issues and very weak commitment to compliance, decreased to 1%
of the KPI-assessed factories. Such factories are given a one-year grace period to move
up a grade or have their services terminated. Since 2013, there has been a focused effort
to improve the 2C factories, which has led to a 13% reduction of suppliers in this category.
In the same time period, the ratio of self-governing factories (4C & 5C) doubled to 26%.

For our main production facilities, the number of suppliers achieving 3C was even higher:
69% of our direct suppliers had ratings of 3C or better, which represents an increase of
15% compared to 2013. This means that we have overachieved our 2015 target of 60%
of our direct suppliers achieving 3C or better. It is worth noting that the relative number
of factories subject to C-KPI ratings has remained relatively stable at around 45%
throughout the last three years. Overall, all these factories are performing better. While
part of the influence in that upward movement comes from the suppliers achieving better
scores, especially from the notable move to 4C levels, part of it is through consistently
winnowing out 1C and the lowest performing suppliers from the supply chain.
A parallel environmental KPI tool has been developed for a much smaller pool of selected
Tier 1 manufacturing operations and Tier 2 material suppliers, as described below.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE RATING (E-KPI)
We adopt a risk-based approach to identify those suppliers that need to be enrolled into
the ­adidas Group’s environmental programme. Instead of covering 100% of the supply
chain, we focus our efforts on those suppliers with potentially high environmental risks
and those that represent a significant production volume for the Group.
To evaluate these suppliers’ environmental performance, we have developed the
E-KPI rating, which uses the same approach and methodology as the C-KPI rating for
labour compliance. The following table presents the E-KPI performance results from
2013 – 2015.

Suppliers covered by our environmental compliance programme have shown a steady

from 2011 to 2015. In addition, the cumulative E-KPI score increased by almost 7%
compared to 2014, reflecting the effort that has been put into working alongside all
suppliers under coverage to drive continuous improvement in their environmental
performance.
While there was a slight reduction in the total number of factories audited, overall there
has been an upward trend in the E-KPI scores – with previously low-scoring factories
(2E) moving up to higher E-ratings – and a further increase in the number of factories
achieving a 4E score. As a result, a total of 81% of factories were assessed as ‘good’
(3E) or better.

INDEPENDENT FLA AUDITS
In 2015, the Fair Labor Association (FLA) conducted four factory assessments or
remediation verification exercises using the methodology from the Sustainable
Compliance Initiative (SCI).
Since joining the FLA in 1999, more than 300 independent external audits and verification
visits have been conducted at ­adidas Group suppliers. The number of conventional
independent monitoring visits conducted by FLA accredited monitors has gone down
over the years. This is because of a shift from conventional monitoring activities to
engaging in value-added FLA projects that focus on reducing and eliminating chronic
non-compliance issues or improving monitoring methodologies. One such activity
in 2015 was the launch of the FLA strategic plan to evaluate the compensation code
element in practice at affiliated companies.
In 2015, there were four sustainable compliance initiative (SCI) audits done at factories
in Pakistan, China, Vietnam and Egypt. The remainder of our 2015 audit obligation was
directed to the development and launch of the FLA Fair Compensation strategy. The
implementation of this strategy and the 3-year implementation plan is a requirement
for FLA participating companies and accredited programmes.
In 2016, the FLA will continue to focus on fully implementing the FLA’s Core programme,
creating a safe space for thought leadership, improving the representation of its
stakeholder groups and strengthening the organisational foundation. Additionally, the
FLA will explore opportunities for convergence with other multi-stakeholder initiatives
and the work being done to confront the most challenging issues in respect of workers’
rights.

ENFORCEMENT
WARNING LETTERS
Warning letters are an essential part of our enforcement efforts and are triggered
when we find on-going serious non-compliance issues that need to be addressed by
our suppliers. In 2015, we issued a total of 40 warning letters across 10 countries.
The largest number of warning letters continue to be issued in Asia, where more than
60% of all supplier factories are located. Compared to the previous year, the overall
number of first warning letters decreased significantly by 29%. The total number of
second warnings increased in 2015, with ten letters being issued. Suppliers who receive
second warning letters are only one step away from being notified of possible termination
of the manufacturing agreement and receive focused monitoring by the SEA team. The
number of third warning letters issued to business partners (which result in factory
terminations) went down to zero in 2015. The overall decline of Warning Letters is in
line with the improvement of the KPI scores as Warning Letters significantly reduce a
supplier’s KPI score.
It is difficult to generalise about the grounds for a warning letter as it may be issued
for a single unresolved non-conformance or for multiple breaches of our Standards.
The range of issues that resulted in warning letters in 2015 included poor management
commitment, excessive working hours, non-payment of wages and benefits, poor
electrical, fire or chemical safety, poor communication and transparency problems.

1	Including warning letters issued by licensees and agents, but excluding warnings to main suppliers for the non-disclosure of subcontractors, which
are issued either directly through business entities, or by the a
­ didas Group legal department where there is a breach of contract obligations under a
manufacturing agreement.

TERMINATIONS AND REJECTIONS
We work closely with our suppliers to help them improve their performance.
However, where we face situations of severe or repeated non-compliance, we can
and do terminate business relationships with suppliers. In 2015, we terminated
agreements with three suppliers for compliance reasons, that were not a result of
warning letters.

76

We also work closely with the Global Sourcing Organisation and other business entities
to pre-screen potential new suppliers. If our initial assessments uncover threshold or
zero tolerance issues, suppliers are rejected.

In 2015, initial assessments were conducted in 206 factories. During 2015, 101 factories
were either rejected directly after an initial assessment due to the identification of zero
tolerance issues or were ‘rejected with a second visit’ due to identification of one or more
threshold issues, which means they were rejected but given the chance to remediate
non-compliance issues within a specific timeframe. Overall, the ‘first time rejection rate’
of 49% of all new factories visited was a little higher than the previous year.
In addition to the ‘first time rejection rate’, we also capture the ‘final rejection rate’. This
covers factories directly rejected after the first visit that have no chance of a second visit
as well as factories rejected after being visited a second time. At the end of 2015, we had
a ‘final rejection rate’ of 10%. This shows the importance and impact of pre-approval
screening as well as the effort taken by the suppliers to resolve issues and come into
conformance with our Workplace Standards. The remediation of factory issues is
beneficial for workers as it raises the bar in terms of better and timelier pay, improved
benefits, reduced hours and the legal protection of formal employment contracts as well
as significant improvements in basic health & safety within the workplace.
Suppliers who have threshold issues (which are serious but ‘correctable’ non-compliances)
are normally given three months to remediate those issues before being re-audited for
final SEA acceptance. As in previous years, China dominated the number of new supplier
initial assessments and corresponding rejection rates were high.

CERTIFICATIONS OBTAINED BY ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR SUPPLIER
SITES PRODUCING FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET
In 2015, we worked with 31 athletic footwear suppliers who are certified in accordance
with the International Environmental Management Standard ISO 14001 and/or the
Workplace Health and Safety Management Standard OHSAS 18001. These suppliers
produced around 98% of the a
­ didas Group’s global athletic footwear sourcing volume.
We have limited control over the direct environmental impacts of the manufacturing
process and how our suppliers act. The best way to influence the environmental impacts
of our suppliers’ factories is to encourage the introduction of environmental management
systems, and we have made implementing such a system mandatory for all our core
suppliers. Achieving certification to a management system requires factory managers
to plan, manage and review their own environmental performance.

FREIGHT TYPES USED TO SHIP ADIDAS AND REEBOK PRODUCTS
In 2015, we again tracked the environmental impact related to the transport of our
goods. Compared to previous years, there have been some changes which were caused
by an adjustment in product classification. Some product groups are now classified as
Hardware instead of Apparel, leading to an increase in the percentage of Hardware
transported by truck. All in all, the vast majority of our shipments take place via sea
freight.

REDUCING VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), which are typically found in solvents used in our
manufacturing process, can – in high concentration – cause breathing difficulties
and other health problems for production workers. For this reason, we have been
requesting for more than a decade that our footwear suppliers significantly reduce
the use of VOCs in their manufacturing.
By applying innovative as well as environmentally-sound bonding and priming
technologies while following the adidas Group guidelines on the use of chemicals, our
athletic footwear suppliers have been able to reduce the use of VOCs from well above
100 grams per pair to below 20 grams.
2015 is the year of our biggest success so far: we achieved an all-time low of 15.6 grams
of VOCs per pair. Performance improvement in every single country compared to 2013
shows that this is the result of hard work and a true commitment across our entire
manufacturing base.

GREEN COMPANY DATA
Since its launch in 2008, the Green Company programme and its ambitious 2015
targets have driven continuous improvement in the environmental impacts of our
own site operations. As of the end of 2015, we have well achieved our targets for
water savings per employee, household waste reduction and reducing carbon
emissions, but had challenges to meet the targets for paper reduction and energy
consumption per square metre. The data reported covers 48 of our corporate sites,
including administration offices, own production sites and distribution centres.
With water savings of 28% per employee we have well exceeded our targeted savings of
20%. Our overall household waste volume per employee was reduced by 27%, exceeding
the 2015 target of a 25% reduction. Furthermore, we achieved our 2015 target of reducing
carbon emissions by 30% per square metre. These savings have been mainly achieved
through energy efficiency projects and several carbon offsetting programmes. Some of
our sites are still facing common challenges in accessing greener energy and scaling
up their use of renewable energy. However, reducing carbon emissions will remain a
focus of the Green Company initiative.
Our investment in more than 40 energy efficiency projects over the last years, supported
through our greenENERGY Fund, has strongly contributed to energy savings at our
corporate sites leading to a reduction of our energy consumption of 15% per square
metre. But we have faced challenges to meet our ambitious target of 20% savings in
2015. Especially the increased eCommerce business and growing number of employees
have influenced energy savings per square metre at our distribution centres and
administration offices. The same is true for paper reduction. Whereas our administration
offices exceeded the 2015 target to cut our paper consumption by 50% per employee,
the increased amount of products handled at our distribution centres continues to be
a challenge to reducing our overall paper consumption. In total, a reduction of 38% of
paper per employee was achieved by the group of reporting sites including administration
offices, own production sites and distribution centres.
During 2015, we developed and launched the second phase of our Green Company
strategy, including targets to be achieved by 2020. Read more about the results in our
2015 Green Company Performance Analysis on our website.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
The Green Company initiative has been the driver for successfully implementing tools
that help us to continuously reduce the environmental impacts of our corporate sites.
One of them is our shared Environmental Management System (EMS) that is certified
according to the international ISO 14001 standard. The initial goal of the Green Company
initiative was to certify our five main brand headquarters, including the adidas Group
headquarters in Germany, the adidas, Reebok and TaylorMade headquarters in the US
as well as the CCM Hockey headquarters in Canada. After the successful certification of
these sites to ISO 14001 in 2010 and 2011, we decided to extend the system and introduce
the ISO 14001 standard at additional sites, including our distribution centres. In 2014,
we certified our 13th site, the new central distribution centre in Rieste, Germany. A list
of all certified sites is given in the table below.

COMMUNITY AFFAIRS
COMMUNITY AFFAIRS STATISTICS
In 2015, we saw an increase in donation requests compared to the previous two
years. Donation or funding requests significantly varied in nature and purpose.
Incoming requests were carefully reviewed against the adidas Group Corporate
Giving Guidelines to ensure alignment with corporate policies, guidelines and budget
framework.
Compared to 2014, the number of supported projects decreased, which reflects our
more stringent approach in conducting needs assessments. This helped us to focus on
supporting fewer but more impactful organisations.
The amount of product donations decreased, which arises from fewer product placements
in North America due to strategic changes in this market. In the EMEA region, we
targeted major volumes of product donations to support people in severe need such
as refugees at the Turkish-Syrian border as well as in Germany in 2015. To effectively
respond to the refugee crisis in Europe, the adidas Group expanded its financial support
in order to ensure an even more purposeful support. Compared to previous years, we
saw an increase of volunteer hours of our global workforce, which is the result of rising
employee involvement, in particular in the context of refugee support.
With our data tracking system we aim to fully cover activities from all subsidiaries
worldwide. We are constantly reviewing our approach and the system to improve data
quality.
