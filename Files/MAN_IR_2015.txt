COMMITTED TO TRANSPARENCY, SUSTAINABILITY,
AND CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Overview

Dear Readers,

As one of the oldest industrial enterprises in Germany, we have mastered
the art of adapting to societal changes and meeting global challenges with
Portrait
flexibility and a spirit of innovation. Our clearly defined principles and
actively applied values are the foundations on which we build. Our comStrategy
mitment to transparency, sustainability, and corporate responsibility
Integration
guides our steps and shapes our actions.
For the sixth time, we are issuing a report in line with the standards
People
of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) to summarize our sustainability
Production
activities. Using KPIs, we report on our progress in implementing our CR
Strategy 2020+. An integral part of our corporate strategy, it defines objecProducts
tives and initiatives which are assigned to the CR cornerstones of ProducAnnex
tion, Products, People, and Integration. Our CR Strategy 2020+ is based on
our analysis of global challenges such as climate change, environmental
pollution, resource scarcity, and urbanization — viewed through the lens
of the opportunities and risks they represent for the MAN Group.
By cutting the carbon footprint of MAN production sites
by 19.5% compared to the baseline year of 2008, last year we
came a step closer to reaching our climate goal for production
— a 25% reduction in CO₂ emissions by 2020. Our portfolio
of efficient products and services isn’t just a success with
our customers. It also impressed the trade journal Transport, which honored MAN Genuine Parts ecoline with
the European Transport Prize for Sustainability in 2015.
Within our People CR cornerstone, we are stepping up
our efforts to foster the professional growth of talented
women. We have launched a number of programs
aimed at supporting women early in their careers —
including a new talent development initiative targetJoachim Drees
ing female vocational trainees. Digitization also preChief Executive Officer of MAN SE
Foreword

sents new challenges which not only impact on our business model, but
are also transforming the world of work. We will continue to work closely
with the works council to develop new responses to these questions.
The difficult situation facing the people who fled to Germany in
2015 moved us all. Many of our employees spontaneously offered assistance to the refugees who last summer arrived in Munich every day in
their hundreds. In collaboration with our partner SOS Children’s Villages,
we have now launched numerous activities at our sites in Germany to help
support and integrate refugees. These activities are bundled in our “MAN
aid for refugees” initiative.
We are proud of the three prizes we have received for our innovative sustainability communications, not least the European Excellence
Award. This year we will continue to communicate with our different target groups using formats tailored to their needs. This GRI report is aimed
at sustainability analysts and investors, customers, and business partners.
It includes all KPIs and data related to our sustainable business practices
and outlines our activities in line with the United Nations Global Compact’s ten principles of corporate responsibility. It represents our Communication on Progress, upholding our commitment to the largest and most
important international CR initiative. We have also had our KPIs verified
by an independent firm of auditors.
In these challenging times, we reaffirm our commitment to corporate responsibility and invite you to remain engaged in dialog with us on
the subject of CR. We hope you find this report makes informative reading.
Best regards,

Joachim Drees
Chief Executive Officer of MAN SE

Portrait of the MAN Group

The MAN Group
The MAN Group is one of Europe’s leading commercial vehicle, engine, and
mechanical engineering companies. As a producer of trucks, buses, diesel
engines, turbomachinery, and special gear units, all our divisions hold
leading market positions. The Group is active in more than 180 countries.
Our primary objective — sustainable value creation
We have successfully placed our strategic focus on transportation and
energy in recent years. The fact that these are forward-looking and highgrowth sectors can be seen in challenges such as globalization and the
associated rise in international trade, population growth, urbanization,

and climate change. In its Commercial Vehicles und Power Engineering
business areas, MAN offers its customers tailored solutions specifically
designed to reduce emissions and fuel consumption.
Our corporate strategy is built on our global presence and our
broad-based portfolio of efficient products and services. They give us the
stability we need to largely absorb fluctuations in individual markets and
to be prepared for increasing global competition. MAN prioritizes responding to customer needs, with technology leadership and the continuous
expansion of our after-sales business as further key factors in our success.
This strategic approach forms the cornerstone of the MAN Group’s primary objective — sustainable value creation.

Economic environment
The economic environment deteriorated significantly in the year under
review. Although the global economy saw moderate growth and the situation improved somewhat in industrialized nations, economic momentum continued to slow in many emerging economies over the course of
the year. For the MAN Group, the picture is mixed. While the European
commercial vehicles market has recovered, the situation in other regions
such as Brazil and Russia remains tense. The same can be said of the Power
Engineering business area.
The MAN Group generated sales revenue of €13.7 billion in 2015,
down 4% year-on-year. Our operating profit was €92 million. In the Commercial Vehicles business area, it dropped to €-101 million. Restructuring
expenses related to the MAN Truck & Bus future growth program, which
aims at increasing long-term competitiveness, totaled €185 million — a
special item that impacted negatively on operating profit. We paid out
guaranteed dividends to our shareholders of €3.07 per share in 2015. The
MAN Group’s operating return on sales amounted to 2.9% in 2015, remaining largely unchanged compared to 2014 (3%). In the year under review,
MAN paid income taxes amounting to €64 million. We do not take extensive measures to optimize our taxes.
Further information on our financial performance is available in
our 2015 Annual Report.

Investment by Volkswagen AG in MAN SE
A domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (DPLTA) between
Volkswagen Truck & Bus GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of Volkswagen
AG, and MAN SE was entered into the commercial register on July 16, 2013,
and has been effective since that date. On December 31, 2015, Volkswagen
Truck & Bus GmbH held 75.56% of MAN SE’s voting rights and 74.35% of its
share capital. On December 31, 2015, the free float for MAN’s common
shares amounted to 24.44%.
Capital expenditures
In the 2015 fiscal year, the MAN Group incurred capital expenditures totaling €708 million, after €610 million in the previous year. There was growth
in both expenditures on property, plant, and equipment, and on intangible assets. In view of the difficult economic situation, we are reviewing
planned capital expenditures particularly critically, and are systematically
prioritizing them. We are deliberately going ahead with the necessary capital expenditures that will lead to long-term growth and that are designed
to improve our operational efficiency.

STRATEGY AND GOVERNANCE

MAN’s future performance depends on understanding global challenges and
on recognizing the opportunities and risks with regard not only to sustainable
development, but also to our commercial success. MAN’s CR Strategy 2020+
is our response to the worldwide megatrends associated with these challenges.
This is how we live our responsibility — along our entire value chain.
CR Strategy 2020+
Since 2010, corporate responsibility (CR) has been an integral part of MAN’s
Corporate Strategy. And our CR Strategy 2020+ outlines the ways in which
we take responsibility along our entire value chain. It places an emphasis
on the people who work for us, and is aimed at integrating CR in our processes, our production operations, and our products. Four fields of action
have been assigned to each of these four CR cornerstones (, page 6).
We have set ourselves a strategic objective for each field of action.

We have assigned the five core initiatives of MAN’s Climate Strategy to the
Integration, Production, and Products cornerstones of our CR Strategy
2020+. It goes without saying that we will continue to pursue these objectives and initiatives within this framework.
The CR Strategy 2020+ is MAN’s response to the global challenges
which have material significance for the Group. It allows us to identify the
risks and opportunities arising from these challenges at an early stage and
react accordingly. This safeguards the future success of our business and
makes a contribution to sustainable development.

Global challenges: MAN ranking of opportunities and risks

[G4-18] As part of a multi-step materiality analysis conducted in 2014, we
identified the global challenges that are relevant to MAN. This included
not only what our stakeholders expect of the Company, but also MAN’s
own objectives for sustainable commercial success.
Evaluation by MAN CR Steering Committee
The MAN CR Steering Committee (, page 10) discussed and analyzed
twelve global challenges, including climate change, population growth,
resource scarcity, poverty, and health. Using a scale of zero (low) to ten
(high), they evaluated the challenges with regard to business opportunities and risks for MAN (, graphic).

Evaluation by stakeholders
[G4-24, G4-25, G4-26, G4-27] To supplement the materiality analysis performed by the MAN CR Steering Committee, in 2014 we asked our stakeholders what expectations they have of MAN. For this process we elected
to use an international, open, online questionnaire. With the aim of
including as many stakeholder interests as possible, we did not pre-select
target groups. Over a period of several months, more than 1,700 people
participated in the survey on the MAN corporate website. We were able to
analyze more than 150 of these data sets.
Material global challenges facing MAN
In addition to the assessments of the global challenges performed by the
MAN CR Steering Committee and our stakeholders, we also conducted an
analysis of our competitors and consulted expert opinion. This led to the
definition of six material challenges as the basis of the MAN CR strategy as
well as our reporting under the G4 standard of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). These global challenges were then assigned to the corresponding GRI Aspects (, page 9) for which MAN reports at least one performance indicator (, GRI Index page 57 ff.).
We performed the materiality analysis for the MAN Group as a
whole. To take account of regional variations, MAN Latin America conducted an additional, separate analysis, which confirmed the MAN Group
results to a very great extent. In this analysis, regionally relevant issues such
as access to water, biodiversity, and population growth were ranked higher
and are addressed accordingly by the CR activities of MAN Latin America.
At the end of 2015 MAN Diesel & Turbo also conducted a materiality
analysis specifically for the subgroup. In February 2016 the findings of this
analysis were reviewed by experts from specialist functions and measured
against MAN’s CR Strategy 2020+.

Description

Relevance for MAN

The rise in global temperatures leads to natural disasters
such as severe storms and forest fires. In some areas this
causes secondary disasters, such as famine caused by loss
of harvests.

In this context, the transportation and logistics sector is called upon to reduce its emissions of CO2
and other greenhouse gases, as well as nitrogen
oxides and pollutants. Top priority here is assigned
to the development and implementation of alternative drive systems and fuels. All MAN engines comply with current emissions standards.

Energy
Emissions
Transportation

Resources include all raw materials and natural resources
such as water, energy, and land which are necessary for
life and economic activity. Overuse of these resources
leads to water shortages, desertification and erosion, and
rising prices for raw materials and building materials.

As a manufacturing company, resource scarcity
impacts on MAN and makes its supply of production materials less secure. In addition, the finite
nature of fossil fuel resources necessitates the rapid
development of alternative drive technologies.

Materials

The percentage of the total world population living in urban
areas is growing steadily. According to United Nations estimates, in 2030 sixty percent of all people will live in cities.

The quality of life and ecological sustainability of
large cities depends on efficient transportation and
energy solutions, as well as intelligent mobility. MAN
can make a material contribution in these areas.

Energy
Transportation

Severe physical strain, lack of exercise, and psychological
issues such as stress, mental overload, and burnout are
the key challenges in the field of health and create a burden on social welfare and health insurance systems. In
addition, environmental pollution (see below) can lead to
health problems.

For MAN as a manufacturer of heavy industrial
machinery and commercial vehicles, the issue of
occupational health and safety has traditionally
played an important role. In addition to initiatives
targeting our production workers, the prevention of
office-related illnesses is assigned high priority.

Occupational health
and safety
Customer health
and safety

The increasing amounts of waste produced around the
world have far-reaching effects on plant, animal, and
human life. Millions of tons of plastic waste end up in the
oceans and contaminate the groundwater. In addition,
waste incineration plants cause air pollution.

MAN makes every possible effort to limit the negative environmental impacts of its production activities, focusing on the continuous reduction of volumes of waste and assessing the recyclability of
materials in product life cycle analyses.

the CR Steering Committee, which met four times in the year under review
and whose members include managers from the Production, Products,
and Integration functions (e.g. from Purchasing, the Group Works Council,
and Human Resources) and all subgroups.
In addition to the continuous development of the CR strategy, the
CR Steering Committee is responsible for integrating CR in our operating
processes and for systematic stakeholder dialog.
CR cockpit
To facilitate the management of the CR strategy, the Company has developed a CR cockpit which includes the defined KPIs for all fields of action.
This provides reliable information on current progress towards meeting
targets, making it possible to initiate remedial measures if deviations
from those targets are identified.

Activities within the Volkswagen Group
As a strong brand within the Volkswagen Group, we participate in the Corporate CSR & Sustainability and Environment & Energy Steering Groups
in order to play an active part in shaping the Volkswagen Group’s environmental and sustainability strategy.

INTEGRATION
Our business practices are shaped by corporate responsibility (CR). It is our aim to live our responsibility every day.
We continue to boost our competitive edge by anchoring CR firmly in the strategies of our divisions, our operating
processes, and our vocational training and continuing professional development. Responsible corporate governance is
the foundation on which we build. Systematic stakeholder dialog and open communication with our customers help
us integrate CR in our core business activities. Through our corporate citizenship initiatives, we also make a lasting
contribution to sustainable development. In 2015, our activities focused on providing aid for refugees in Germany.
Responsible corporate governance

Compliance program

Challenges and objectives
Our business success is achieved in compliance with the applicable laws
and regulations. In managing and providing oversight of the Company,
the aim is to ensure its continued performance and the sustained creation
of value in accordance with the principles of the social market economy.

Challenges and objectives
MAN does not tolerate illegal or irregular conduct. Managers have a particular responsibility to lead by example, follow rules, and comply with
the law.

Principles and guidelines
Our management complies with internationally and nationally recognized standards of good and responsible corporate governance. Important policies and guidelines include:
Corporate law and financial regulations
German Corporate Governance Code
UN Global Compact
Code of Conduct
Articles of Association and internal policies

Organization
The MAN Group’s Compliance function is currently staffed by 48 employees and headed up by the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO). The CCO reports
regularly to MAN SE’s Executive Board and the heads of other functions on
the current status of compliance activities. In addition to the Compliance
function, MAN has a network of some 120 Compliance Champions, managers who are not full-time Compliance employees but who have taken on
special responsibility for the topic. They support the Compliance organization in the implementation of compliance measures at Group companies that do not have their own local compliance managers in place.

Principles and guidelines
Our Code of Conduct outlines standards of behavior that are binding for
all our employees in their daily work. Our compliance policies also provide
concrete instructions for handling ambiguous situations. Relations with
our associates are regulated by our Code of Conduct for Suppliers and
Business Partners, which requires them to comply with basic principles of
corporate responsibility, transparency, fairness, and data protection.
Systems and instruments
Rolled out in 2010, the compliance program helps us detect non-compliance at an early stage and respond quickly, effectively, and consistently. In
addition to combating corruption, antitrust law, and data protection, a
fourth pillar has now been added to the compliance program: the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing. In 2015, the part of our
compliance management system aimed specifically at combating corruption was certified to the IDW PS 980 standard, which evaluates the concept, applicability, implementation, and effectiveness of the system.
The Disciplinary Sanction Committee is the body responsible for
imposing internal sanctions in the event of compliance violations. It
meets on an ad hoc basis and is made up of the Chief Executive Officer of
the subgroup concerned, the Chief Human Resources Officer of MAN SE,
the Chief Compliance Officer, and the Compliance Officer of the subgroup
in question. The findings of misconduct investigations — as well as the
results of regularly conducted compliance risk assessments — are used to
continuously improve our compliance program and introduce selective
compliance measures.

Memberships
MAN is a member of Transparency International, the World Economic
Forum (WEF) Partnering Against Corruption Initiative, and the German
Institute for Compliance (DICO). We are active in several different DICO
committees and working groups. In addition, we support the Alliance for
Integrity, an initiative of Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Federation of German Industry, and numerous German companies, which promotes integrity in business practices.

Risk management
Challenges and objectives
Operating a business entails constant exposure to risks. With a view to
exploiting market opportunities, we consciously assume risk if we expect
it to contribute sufficiently to increasing the value of our enterprise. As a
basic principle, risk that could jeopardize the Group’s continued existence
may not be entered into; unavoidable risk must be minimized by taking
appropriate measures. Global challenges such as climate change, demographic change, globalization, population growth, and urbanization represent opportunities and risks for MAN, as does the internationalization of
our business activities.
Organization
Our Group-wide risk management system provides us with the necessary
information at an early stage, allowing us to contain risk and take advantage of opportunities. Comprising key elements such as corporate planning — including the mid-year review process — risk and opportunity
management, our internal control system, our continuous controls monitoring system, and our compliance system, it is an integral part of our corporate management and business processes.

Instruments
The assessment of climate-related risks and opportunities is part of the
MAN Group’s overall risk management. To this end, experts regularly
conduct risk analyses, which have concluded that MAN is indirectly
affected by climate change. One or more of the subgroups is subject to
the following risks:
Regulatory risks, particularly with regard to a CO₂ tax or emissions
trading in the logistics sector
Extreme weather events, such as severe storms, flooding, hail, or heavy
snowfall, which could interrupt production or affect suppliers
Risk of damage to reputation — because the use of our products generates greenhouse gas emissions and MAN can only achieve long-term
market success if the Company invests in energy-efficient and lowcarbon technologies
At the same time, the consistent continuation of the European climateprotection policy and the gradual implementation of similar policies in
the BRIC countries will also yield new growth opportunities for MAN.
These include:
Increasing market share through early compliance with regulatory
requirements
Strengthening ties to customers and suppliers through joint efforts to
cut CO₂ emissions
Increasing competitiveness due to greater immunity to energy price
fluctuations, resulting from increased reliance on internal energy generation and renewables

Corporate citizenship
Strategic approach
At MAN we see ourselves as part of society. Our goal is to be a good corporate citizen and promote sustainable development. We can make the most
valuable contributions to issues that relate to our core business areas. Our
activities focus on long-term and sustainable education projects for children and young people. With our attractive initiatives, we are aiming to
make a contribution to society and increase our employees’ identification
with the Company.
We have enjoyed a strategic partnership with SOS Children’s
Villages since 2008. In cooperation with this non-profit organization, we
implement projects around the world — often with the help of volunteer
work by our employees.
Policies
All donations and sponsoring activities must comply with our mandatory,
Group-wide policy. Permissible fields of activity for donations include education, academia, the arts, and community programs (social welfare organizations, charitable and humanitarian projects, and disaster relief efforts).
Instruments
Most of our sponsoring activities and donations are long standing and
closely related to our core business areas. We apply the internationally
recognized standard of the London Benchmark Group (LBG) to measure
the success of our community projects.

Integration in corporate divisions
The integration of CR in the strategies of the divisions, operating processes, and vocational training and continuing professional development
activities is the most important factor in our success. Systematic stakeholder dialog and open communication facilitate the integration of CR in
MAN’s core business activities. In 2015, we also continued anchoring CR in
the functional and cross-functional strategies at MAN Diesel & Turbo. This
process of integration was completed at MAN Truck & Bus in 2014.

Training courses for managers
Our employees live corporate responsibility in their day-to-day work and
act as ambassadors for our CR activities. Our “Manage responsibly” training course raises our managers’ CR awareness and teaches them how to
implement MAN’s CR and Climate Strategies within their spheres of
responsibility. In 2015, some 60 managers and multipliers — such as trainers and works council members — from MAN Truck & Bus successfully
completed this course. Since the program was initiated in 2012, a total of
almost 600 participants have attended 69 such courses. Eighty-seven percent of the managers in Munich have attended this course; 62% in Nuremberg, Steyr, Plauen, and Salzgitter. The course was recognized as best practice within the Volkswagen Group, leading to the development of a
“Manage responsibly” course adapted to the requirements of Volkswagen,
which can be used by all brands. At MAN the development of “Manage
responsibly 2.0” is planned for 2017.

In total, over 1,825 checks were conducted using this tool in the
2015 reporting period. Because approvals are issued for a limited period,
some of the checks were related to renewals of the approvals granted to
individual business partners.
Compliance Helpdesk
All MAN employees can contact the Compliance Helpdesk by phone or
e-mail to obtain answers to compliance-related questions. In the reporting period, 469 questions were answered.
Compliance training
The Compliance function held compliance awareness training courses for
2,091 employees around the world in the year under review. These on-site
training courses focus on providing basic knowledge on combating corruption and on antitrust law. We also conduct special training courses on
antitrust law and combating corruption for employees who are particularly exposed to risks in these areas. In the year under review, these courses

provided in-depth training to 2,834 employees. Since 2015, we have been
offering our managers special on-site compliance training courses. They
focus on specific compliance risks and challenges as well as the special
responsibilities that come with a leadership role. In the reporting period,
306 managers attended these courses. Special classroom training courses
were also held for 392 procurement employees and 178 business partners
in 2015.

Furthermore, in the year under review 3,091 employees successfully completed the first compliance e-learning module on the Code of
Conduct. This e-learning course covers the fundamentals of combating
corruption, antitrust law, and data protection. In the second training
module on the Code of Conduct, 5,334 employees were trained in correct
conduct during searches, dealing with conflicts of interest, and preventing money laundering.

Compliance

Since 2013, employees who are exposed to an increased corruption risk (e.g.
in sales and purchasing) have participated in an in-depth web-based training module on corruption prevention. In 2015, 2,667 employees completed
this module. In addition, a training module called “Antitrust Law: Preventing Antitrust Infringements” was rolled out in the second quarter of 2015. In
the reporting period, 11,364 employees took advantage of this training.

Preventive audits
The Compliance function again conducted three preventive compliance
audits at selected Group companies together with the Internal Audit function in the reporting period. The specific aim of these audits is to review
the local implementation status of the compliance program, as well as
employee awareness of compliance issues in the organization concerned.

Compliance risk assessment
In 2015, we conducted our regular Group-wide compliance risk assessment for the fifth time. The aim was to analyze compliance risks in the
fields of combating corruption, antitrust law, and money-laundering prevention. For the first time we applied a two-stage approach. In the first
stage, we used centrally available data to draw up risk profiles for a total of
81 companies and business units. Based on this information, we identified
39 at-risk companies and business units for in-depth analysis. The second
stage comprised a detailed questionnaire which was completed by the
local management. It contained questions on their specific business model
and business environment as well as their self-assessment of how they
identify and handle compliance risks. The findings of the compliance risk
assessments informed the definition of targeted measures at local level by
the responsible compliance manager and the board of management.

Preventing money laundering
Both the German Money Laundering Act (GwG — Geldwäschegesetz), and
many laws in other jurisdictions require companies to introduce measures to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing. Among other
things, our Group-wide money-laundering policy establishes minimum
standards for handling suspicious business partners and requires investigation of ambiguous circumstances before a business transaction is concluded. We educate our employees on this topic as part of the training
module on our Code of Conduct (, page 16).

Reporting compliance violations
The MAN “Speak up!” whistleblower portal again helped to uncover and
prevent risks in the year under review. “Speak up!” is used to accept and
analyze information relating to serious compliance violations, especially
in the areas of white-collar crime (e.g. corruption offenses and money
laundering), antitrust law, and data protection. MAN employees and
third parties can use “Speak up!” to report compliance violations — confidentially and regardless of time and location. MAN does not tolerate
compliance violations under any circumstances. Reports of possible violations are investigated in detail and violations are dealt with and punished according to the penalties permitted under labor law. In addition,
findings from the investigation of compliance violations are used to continuously improve the compliance system.

Data protection
MAN stands for effective data protection in compliance with legal regulations, applied worldwide based on the rigorous European standards. To
meet these stringent requirements, the MAN Group has a global network
of data protection officers and coordinators. In Germany, four data protection officers work to ensure that the personal data privacy rights of
employees, customers, and suppliers are respected. The network also
includes 76 coordinators in 44 nations outside of Germany who work on
data-protection issues in 90 companies.

Due diligence
CR and compliance risks can ensue from the acquisition or disposal of
equity investments. To prevent such risks, the Compliance function is
involved in acquisition projects from the start. The target company must
complete a due-diligence questionnaire that addresses CR and compliance issues, and includes questions on human rights and environmental
impacts.

Ratings and rankings
MAN is a world leader in climate protection. The CDP investor initiative
awarded us top marks for our transparency and performance in the field
of climate protection, naming MAN as one of the top ten companies in the
“Industrials” sector. This means we have achieved the status of “Sector
Leader, Industrials” in the DACH (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) region.
In 2015, we were included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World
Indexes by sustainability rating agency RobecoSAM for the fourth time in
succession. With a score of 85, we again succeeded in building on the positive results of the previous year. MAN remains one of the top three companies in the industry, as well as being the only German enterprise in its
sector to be listed in these indexes.
The oekom research and Sustainalytics rankings are published
every two years, so there are no new ratings specifically for 2015.

Dialog with policymakers
[G4-26] We are actively working to develop solutions for global challenges.
To this end, we also contribute our knowledge and expertise to the ongoing political debate. Our focus here is on topics relevant to our core business, such as reducing worldwide CO₂ emissions caused by the transportation of goods and people. We maintain an ongoing dialog with the
responsible ministries at the national, EU, and international levels, as well
as with elected representatives and opinion leaders from the government
and the opposition.
The MAN guidelines for lobbying are defined in a Code of Conduct
which applies Group-wide. This Code explicitly outlines our commitment
to nonpartisanship and to making our positions transparent. In 2015,
MAN spent around €80,000 on direct lobbying activities.
Dialog event
The 2014 CR Report was presented at a stakeholder dialog event held at the
SOS Children’s Village in Diessen am Ammersee, Germany, as part of the
celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of SOS Children’s Villages. Some
80 stakeholders, including employees and representatives of local businesses as well as 30 children and caregivers from the SOS Children’s Village, were invited. The dialog focused on MAN’s CR activities in the context
of its long-term partnership with SOS Children’s Villages.
Customer involvement and dialog
Dialog with our customers — one of the core initiatives of MAN’s Climate
Strategy — represents a valuable opportunity to discuss the reduction of
global CO₂ emissions. After all, many of them have already rolled out their
own CO₂ reduction targets. It is essential for MAN to understand future
customer needs; by flowing customer requirements into the development
of our products and services, we create more customer value.

At meetings of the customer advisory panel, first set up in 2009, MAN
Truck & Bus customers exchange ideas with MAN experts and the board
member responsible for sales. Selected customers participate in this discussion and feedback platform.
We also conduct targeted customer dialog at trade fairs for our sector. For instance, at the Power-Gen Europe event MAN Diesel & Turbo presented its new, highly efficient line of gas-powered engines with two-stage
turbocharging.
Customer satisfaction
Along with our employees, customers are our most important stakeholders because they drive our business success. In order to maintain longterm relationships with our customers and to better understand their
needs, we conduct regular surveys in all our business areas to find out how
satisfied customers are with our products and services. MAN Truck & Bus
America has been tracking customer satisfaction each year using the Customer First Study (CFS). As part of the CFS, in 2015 we conducted telephone
surveys of some 29,000 customers — 5,000 more than in the previous
year. More than 90% gave MAN Truck & Bus a “good” rating or better,
while almost 65% responded with “very good.” This indicates that customer satisfaction has risen above 2014 levels.
Every two years, MAN Diesel & Turbo conducts an online survey
which also serves to monitor customer satisfaction. In 2015, some 4,000
customers were asked to give their feedback on the company’s products
and services. Thirty-five percent of the participants rated the performance
of MAN Diesel & Turbo as “good,” 42% as “very good,” and 9% as “excellent.”
We use the results of these customer surveys to check the effectiveness of our customer satisfaction improvement measures and initiate follow-up activities.

Customer information
We provide our customers with comprehensive information and instructions for all our products. By optimizing the operation of our products,
our customers help not only to improve product safety, but also to conserve resources. We therefore inform them specifically about factors
such as rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag which influence vehicle
emissions and fuel consumption. We present information on the CO₂
emissions generated by our vehicles in terms of the total lifetime mileage. The calculations are performed using the Environmental Lifetime
Emission and Energy Consumption Calculator, which our customers can
access at www.manted.de.

We are working to raise awareness of CR, safety, climate, and environmental issues among MAN Truck & Bus sales employees and ensure they
are informed about our EfficientLine trucks and buses and our gas and
hybrid drives. In 2015, some 3,000 sales employees successfully completed this training course. Of these, more than 700 participants focused
specifically on efficiency and environmental topics, and more than 1,000
on product safety issues.

Long-term partnership with SOS Children’s Villages
As part of our long-term partnership with SOS Children’s Villages, we have
pledged annual funding of €150,000 to support SOS Children’s Villages
facilities in Germany and around the globe. In addition to offering financial assistance, we strongly encourage employee volunteering. In 2015,
76 MAN employees volunteered 625 hours in SOS Children’s Villages
facilities.
One international program which we support is the SOS Vocational
Training College in Kality, Ethiopia. Since 2008, MAN has contributed
some €600,000, which has gone toward construction of a new training
building, facilities maintenance, the salaries of five teachers, and MAN
scholarships for the young people. Our decision to continue funding the
project was based on an analysis we conducted using the London Benchmarking Group methodology. Another international project we support is
the SOS Hermann Gmeiner School on the outskirts of the Haitian capital
city of Port-au-Prince, where we cover the cost of five teachers.
In the year under review, the longstanding and successful relationship between MAN and SOS Children’s Villages was expanded to include a
partnership between MAN Diesel & Turbo and the SOS Children’s Villages
organization in Augsburg, Germany.
Aid for refugees
From early in 2015, we focused our charitable activities on providing aid to
refugee children and their families as well as unaccompanied refugee
minors. To help address this issue, here too we are collaborating with our
strategic partner SOS Children’s Villages. We have donated almost €90,000
to the non-profit organization’s refugee assistance programs, earmarked
for its facilities in Munich, Augsburg, Salzgitter, and Dießen am Ammersee. It is our goal to help create a brighter future for refugee children by
opening up opportunities for education and participation in our society.

money will be used to assist unaccompanied refugee minors living in
three group homes in the Bavarian town of Landsberg am Lech. A teacher
has been hired to teach German to the young people, who are also receiving intensive instruction to allow them to continue their secondary education. A detailed report on our engagement on behalf of refugees can be
found in our CR Online Journal.
Donations
Following a donation drive initiated jointly by the Executive Board and the
Group Works Council, MAN topped up employee donations for refugee
assistance and donated the total sum of €200,000. Half of this amount
went to international and regional aid projects: in addition to providing
support for several long-term aid projects at MAN sites in Germany, the

Company donated €25,000 to the UN refugee assistance program. MAN
also donated €15,000 to the City of Munich to help provide refugees with
access to public transportation. The second half of the sum went into an
MAN fund designated for programs which support the integration of refugees through education and training. In 2015, our cash and non-cash donations totaled almost €838,000.
Scholarships
MAN supports 60 recipients of the Germany Scholarship at the Technical
University of Munich (TUM), making us the primary sponsor. Half of the
funding for the scholarships, which are awarded in recognition of out-

standing achievements, comes from the German federal government,
with the other half contributed by companies, foundations, and private
individuals. In addition to TUM, MAN also provides Germany Scholarship
funding at RWTH Aachen University, Deggendorf Institute of Technology,
and the Technical University of Berlin. Around the world we collaborate
with a total of almost 100 technical universities.
Several years ago, MAN PrimeServ China launched its own scholarship program, which allows MAN Diesel & Turbo to support students of
marine technology at Shanghai Maritime University and Dalian Maritime
University in China. Each year, four students are granted scholarships
based on their outstanding academic achievements.

Human resources management

MAN is one of Europe’s leading players in the commercial vehicle and
mechanical engineering sectors. To maintain this position going forward,
we need a first-class team which delivers outstanding performance. 55,030
talented individuals work at MAN. Only by promoting the professional
growth of all our employees — from vocational trainees to executives —
can we ensure that the Company will remain successful in the long term.
This is why our human resources (HR) strategy is built around outstanding performance, the resultant success, and sharing in the benefits of that
success. We also live up to our responsibility to our employees by fostering
health, skills, and dedication. To attract and retain committed, responsible, and competent employees, we need responsible leadership and individualized HR development and training opportunities.

Challenges and objectives
Our HR strategy addresses important challenges such as the health of our
employees, diversity and equal opportunity, and demographic change.
Based on these challenges, we have developed several key fields of action:
occupational health & safety, vocational training & continuing professional development, employer attractiveness & HR excellence, and promoting diversity. Concrete objectives have been defined for each field of
action and are reflected in our CR Roadmap. The long-term positioning of
MAN as a top employer has been anchored in the MAN Group’s corporate
strategy as a key objective since 2013.

Principles and guidelines
MAN and its employees are active in more than 180 countries. We stand
for respect and tolerance, have made a clear commitment to diversity, and
do not discriminate based on age, gender, religion, ethnic origin, or sexual
orientation. Wherever MAN has production sites, we support local economic development by recruiting employees from the region. The following policies provide a binding framework for our human resources work
around the globe:
UN Global Compact
OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises
Code of Conduct
Charter on Labor Relations
Charter on Temporary Work

Systems and instruments
Key systems and instruments used in the implementation of MAN’s

Occupational health and safety management
Challenges and objectives
Shifting demographics and today’s changing working environments bring
significant challenges for occupational health and safety at MAN. These
factors affect our employees’ productivity and require holistic approaches
to maintain their health and provide them with treatment when necessary. Only healthy and productive employees can make a meaningful contribution to the long-term success of the Company. With this in mind,
MAN places high priority on ergonomics and preventive health and safety
in the workplace within the framework of its comprehensive occupational
safety and health management program.
Organization
The corporate health services function at MAN is responsible for guiding
the employer in the formulation and implementation of its Companywide health management strategy. The goal is to define a coordinated strategic approach to health services worldwide by developing principles
which are applicable in every location. In addition, the health services at
our plants act independently to address specific concerns with appropriate measures.
Systems and instruments
At MAN, occupational health measures aim to strengthen our employees’ and managers’ health awareness and encourage them to take the initiative in matters concerning their own health. To this end, we offer
health counseling, training courses, therapeutic measures, and re-integration assistance.

Occupational safety includes all measures related to preventing workplace
accidents, work-related illnesses, and occupational diseases. Our occupational safety management is part of our integrated management system
(, page 37).
Certifying our sites under the OHSAS 18001 management system
for occupational health and safety helps to continuously improve the
safety and health of our workforce.
Across the Group, we systematically evaluate workstation ergonomics and potential workplace hazards. This reflects the high priority
that we assign to improving ergonomics in our production sites with the
aim of keeping our employees healthy and physically fit. In addition, we
conduct regular internal and external occupational health and safety
audits and inspections.

Employee structure
The MAN headcount is defined as active employees, employees in the passive phase of partial retirement, and vocational trainees. It does not
include subcontracted employees.
As of December 31, 2015, the MAN Group employed 55,030 people.
This represents a decrease of 873 employees compared to the end of 2014.
The ratio of employees in Germany to those in other countries changed
only slightly. Our non-German companies employed a total of 23,310 people. This is a year-on-year decrease of 284. Compared to the previous year,
the number of employees working in Germany fell by 589 to 31,720.
The number of employees on fixed-term contracts rose by 23% to
1,467 (2014: 1,193). The number of subcontracted employees decreased by
77 to 802. In 2015, 86 subcontracted employees were taken on as permanent staff. In the year under review, 927 women and 256 men held parttime contracts not related to parental leave.

Employee turnover
The employee turnover rate indicates what percentage of employees left
the company during a one-year period. Employees on fixed-term contracts and employees starting retirement or partial retirement are not
included in the calculation of this indicator. The relevant 2,070 departures
in 2015 result in an employee turnover rate of 4.0%. This relatively low rate
demonstrates the stability of labor relations at MAN. In the year under
review, we hired a total of 4,120 people, while 4,040 left our Company.

Vocational training and the dual model
Our dual model of vocational training ensures the development of the
next generation of outstanding technical and commercial employees. The
program, which is anchored in the MAN Academy, saw almost 800 young
people starting their careers at MAN in the fall of 2015 — in locations
including Germany, Austria, and Turkey. In the year under review we also
rolled out a dual vocational training model at our site in Poland.
MAN offers its vocational trainees the opportunity to enter one of
28 vocational training programs, which provide training in 20 technical
and eight commercial professions. The number of young women entering
our programs and showing an interest in technical professions has grown.
In the year under review, 17.8% of our 2,957 vocational trainees were women.
Dual education programs in cooperation with various universities
are increasing in popularity among young people. At present, more than
200 students from dual education and integrated vocational training
and degree programs are completing the practical part of their studies
at our sites in Germany. And 20.5% of the participants in these programs
are women.
The digitization of the workplace means that going forward, the
restructuring of vocational training programs will present a particular
challenge. With this in mind, projects have been initiated within the
Volkswagen Group.
Our trainees have received several awards for excellence. The four
best MAN Group vocational trainees were honored with the Volkswagen
Group’s 2015 Best Apprentice Award. In addition, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry awards for the best vocational trainee in the machinist program in their respective regions went to a young talent from MAN
Truck & Bus in Lower Saxony and another from MAN Diesel & Turbo in
Bavaria. And an international award also honored a vocational trainee

from MAN Diesel & Turbo, who received the 2015 Apprentice of the Year
Award from the Confederation of Danish Industry in Copenhagen, Denmark.
Continuing professional development and training
Approximately 145,000 participants around the globe took part in some
14,400 continuing professional development (CPD) and training initiatives in 2015. Learning and teaching take place in close cooperation with
internal experts. They pass their knowledge on to their colleagues within
the Berufsfamilien, which include all employees who have a common skill
that they develop further. This training and knowledge transfer takes
place within the Berufsfamilien Academies.
In 2015, the principle of the Berufsfamilien Academies (BFA) was
further expanded and broadened by the MAN Academy to guarantee
uniform standards of quality and competencies around the globe. Here
the focus was on the Berufsfamilien of Sales/After Sales, Engineering,
Purchasing, Finance, HR, and Quality. The Production BFA had already
launched its activities in 2014. The user base of the central MAN training
portal has also been expanded. Employees in our Steyr and Ankara sites
are among those who will be able to take advantage of the full range
of offerings starting in early 2016. This will include a broader spectrum
of digital learning opportunities.
Additional training programs were successfully rolled out to
improve the leadership skills of group leaders (“Meister”) and support
them in their day-to-day leadership roles. In 2015, some 200 group leaders
were trained from the production, logistics, service operations, and vocational training sectors.

Leadership and management training
The selection and training of high potentials for management functions
and leadership roles is a key aspect of HR development. We offer these
employees a comprehensive training program designed to prepare them
for their future leadership roles and management functions. In 2015,
we expanded our leadership and management training program.
The Company’s current requirements determine the focus of these HR
development measures.

Top employer
To secure a lasting position as a top employer, MAN has committed to the
following objectives:
offering comprehensive onboarding programs to integrate new
employees into the world of MAN as quickly as possible
providing topic-specific and interdisciplinary training and CPD
facilitating the creation of professional and international networks
fostering cooperation across business areas
We believe that our employees make the most convincing ambassadors
for the Company’s attractiveness as an employer. “Best Employer of 2016,”
a Germany-wide study conducted by the Statista, Xing, and Kununu online
portals in cooperation with FOCUS magazine, ranked over 2,000 companies. MAN placed 19th in the mechanical engineering category. We were
also ranked 23rd in the 2015 Trendence survey of college graduates in Germany, and finished 19th in the Universum ranking. Our high rankings on
these lists show that our strategy is on the right track.
Fostering young talent
It is our aim to attract and retain talent at an early stage. We offer internships, scholarships, and career development programs to young people
who are attending or have recently graduated from universities and vocational-technical schools. In 2015, the MAN Group supported 23 PhD students and gave some 3,000 students from colleges and schools around the
world a chance to gain first-hand practical experience working in the Company. Also in 2015 MAN Latin America granted scholarships to 44 employees. 64 employees participated in a scholarship program for language
learners launched in 2014.

Our young talent programs target students at more than 100 technical
colleges and universities. The MAN Group was represented at more than
20 specialist and university career fairs in 2015. In addition, our experts
held numerous lectures around the world. For four years now, MAN has
also supported teams from Munich Technical University, Munich University of Applied Sciences, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and RWTH
Aachen in the Formula Student Germany race series. These activities focus
on providing opportunities for face-to-face meetings and discussions
with MAN employees.
[G4-26] Employee opinion survey
In June 2015 we again conducted a survey of our employees. The employee
opinion survey (also known by its German name “Stimmungsbarometer”
or mood barometer) is a standardized, anonymous, voluntary survey of the
employees of all brands and companies in the Volkswagen Group. By participating, employees play an active role in shaping events in the Company.
The survey measures employee satisfaction and identification with MAN
and is also used to gauge the success of MAN’s Top Employer HR strategy.
In 2015, 87% of MAN Group employees participated in the survey
(previous year: 90%). The mood reflected is somewhat more positive than
in 2014. Employees expressed their opinions on MAN’s image, communications, quality and processes, teamwork with colleagues and supervisors,
job satisfaction, and workload. Their responses revealed both strengths
and areas for improvement. The survey results will be used as the basis for
subsequent improvement processes and follow-up activities. Specific
measures will be implemented in departments and teams before the next
survey in 2016.
MAN will redesign its employee survey in 2016, organizing 22 statements into four topic-based sections. This change comes in response to
multiple employee requests for more detailed questions as well as more
conclusive findings.

Retirement benefits
When their active working life comes to an end, employees in Germany
receive benefits from a modern and attractive occupational pension system that constitute a key element of MAN’s remuneration policy. These
benefits offer a reliable additional income on retirement and also provide
cover for the risk of permanent disability or death during their active
employment. Employees benefit from employer contributions that are
tied to their remuneration and can make additional provision through
deferred compensation — which is employer-subsidized for staff who are
covered by collective bargaining agreements.
For employees at sites outside Germany, depending on the usual
practice in each country we make market-based contributions to thirdparty pension plans or retirement investment funds. These also include
defined benefit pension plans, the majority of which are designed to provide life-long annuities.

Job security
As part of a realignment of the MAN Truck & Bus production network, we
have streamlined our European manufacturing, clearly defining the operational focal points of each plant. We achieve higher productivity by bundling similar types of production at fewer sites, while efficient vertical
integration keeps our headcount at a consistently high level. Against this
backdrop, MAN Truck & Bus plans to make a three-digit million euro
investment by 2019. These plans are being rolled out in consultation with
the responsible labor unions in Germany, Poland, Austria, and Turkey.

Employee rights
The MAN Code of Conduct guides our daily behavior and activities.
We respect human rights, do not tolerate discrimination, and are committed to transparency. In the reporting period, no cases of discrimination
were ascertained.
MAN recognizes the rights of workers to form and participate in
unions and to conduct collective bargaining. As of the year under review,
almost all permanent staff in Germany is covered by collective bargaining
agreements. Around the globe, the share of our workforce that falls under
collective agreements has increased to more than 93%.
The Volkswagen Charter on Temporary Work has been rolled
out at MAN Truck & Bus and MAN Diesel & Turbo. The rollout of the
Charter on Labor Relations continued in 2015, with additional participation agreements signed off at the MAN Truck & Bus plant in Ankara, Turkey as well as at MAN Turbo & Diesel at the plants in Copenhagen,
Frederikshavn, and Holeby in Denmark. In the various countries where
MAN is active, employee relations are structured in accordance with
national laws and regulations.

Equal opportunity
MAN is committed to diversity and equal opportunity — respecting and
advancing employees regardless of age, sex, religion, ethnicity, and sexual
orientation. To this end, we are working to promote equal opportunity for
women and men worldwide.
We have placed a special focus on the creation of professional
opportunities for women. Programs like our “Girls for Engineering” camp
and our “WOMAN’s Career Day” are aimed at recruiting talented women
and fostering their career development. We support young women in our
technical and commercial vocational training programs through “KICK,”
our new talent development initiative. As part of the pilot program
launched at the end of 2015, the young women are mentored and attend
special training courses to prepare them for a career at MAN.
MAN offers special HR development measures, such as its mentoring program, to support women who are starting out as specialists and
managers. We offer special programs and training courses for our employees on parental leave. Launched in 2015, a special program at MAN Latin
America also aims to support women on their career paths by focusing
on networking and the exchange of ideas and experiences with female
managers.

Our guidelines for management hiring specify that diversity and the
placement of qualified women in particular are to be given due consideration. Because of a decrease in the overall number of managers, in 2015 we
employed five fewer women in management positions than in the previous year. This means that at 8.5%, the proportion of female managers has
decreased. In 2015, we promoted 14 women within management levels one
to three. This represents 11% of our management promotions. There are
currently no women on the Executive Board of the MAN Group. The number of women who sit on the MAN SE Supervisory Board has increased
to three.
Balancing work and family
MAN continues to work to help its employees achieve a better work-life
balance. Measures include flexitime models, the opportunity to split a
full-time position into two part-time positions, and company daycare
centers at MAN’s Munich and Augsburg sites that care for 154 infants and
toddlers. We also offer part-time hours for management staff. Information
sessions for expecting parents, a seminar on re-entry into the workforce
after parental leave, a vacation program for employees’ children, and
opportunities to work from home round off the resources available at the
Munich site. In addition, in 2015 our employees in Bavaria could take

Dilemma

Women in management positions
We view the diversity of our Company as an important factor contributing to our long-term success. Because heterogeneous teams often
come up with solutions that are more innovative and creative than
uniform groups, MAN places special emphasis on fostering the
careers of women. As of the beginning of 2016, we and numerous
other companies in Germany are required by law to appoint women
to fill 30% of all new Supervisory Board vacancies and define targets
for increasing the number of women on our Executive Board and in
the top levels of management.


Promoting diversity

Unfortunately, it is still the case that relatively few women choose
careers in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). According to the Federal Labor Office, in Germany
only 15% of the people employed in STEM professions are women.
This particularly impacts on vehicle manufacturing and engineering
companies like ours. Although it is our aim to increase the percentage
of women working for our Company, we primarily require managers
and high potentials with STEM backgrounds. We are addressing this
dilemma through a variety of measures. For example, programs such
as our “Girls for Engineering” camp aim to recruit young women for
technical careers at MAN. We also foster the careers of our female
employees by offering targeted training courses and varied professional development opportunities, as well as helping them balance
work and family.

advantage of a caregiver placement service to help find appropriate care
for children and family members. In Latin America, we offer employees a
six-month period of maternity leave.
Inclusion
MAN supports and integrates people with disabilities into its operations.
The Company employed 1,609 people with severe disabilities in Germany
in the year under review (previous year: 1,577).
At the MAN Truck & Bus plant in Salzgitter, inclusion is an integral
part of the vocational training program. As part of the “Changing Sides”
project, vocational trainees from the Braunschweig chapter of Lebenshilfe,

an association for the support of people with disabilities, spend four
weeks at the MAN Academy. In exchange, four apprentices from MAN
spend two weeks helping out in the Lebenshilfe workshop. The project
was awarded with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s Social Transfer Prize in 2015.
But outside Germany too we recognize the importance of providing opportunities to disabled employees. Since 2011, MAN Latin America’s
“New Horizon” program has offered young people with disabilities the
chance to work for the Company on an equal basis, to participate in continuing professional development courses, and to receive a college scholarship. In 2015, 31 young men and women took part in “New Horizon.”

Preventive occupational safety
Across the Group we have continued with a variety of initiatives to cut
accident rates and prevent work-related illness. The success of these measures is demonstrated by the 4% decrease in lost-time injuries in 2015 compared to the previous year. As part of our “Workplace Optimization” initiative, we have systematically assessed the ergonomics of all workstations in
MAN Truck & Bus production sites.
The Health and Safety Competence Forum, which was set up by
MAN Truck & Bus and includes all its sites, aims to facilitate the exchange
of information and the strategic development of occupational health and
safety in the coming years.
In 2015, MAN Diesel & Turbo spotlighted employee health and
safety on business trips. A cross-functional working group took a close
look at all processes related to business travel. Initial measures for improving these processes have already been rolled out.
MAN Latin America has appointed workplace safety sponsors, who
both advise their colleagues on safety questions and report risks to their
supervisors. In 2015, 287 suggestions for improving workplace safety were

Resende plant was able to celebrate an occupational safety milestone: two
million working hours without any missed workdays due to accidents.
Behavior-based safety
The “Always Safe. Always Good” project at MAN Truck & Bus production
sites aims to improve behavior-based safety. This initiative, which was first
launched in Munich and Dachau, has now been expanded to include
Nuremberg and Salzgitter. Some 30 workshops have been held for managers, employees, and trainers, focusing on safe behavior for oneself as well
as staff and colleagues. In the first stage of the campaign, the target is to
reach at least 30% of the employees in each plant with the aim of achieving a lasting improvement in the safety culture. Almost 100% of the
employees at the Steyr site have already completed the training. Planning
for the rollout to non-German-speaking sites was completed in 2015; the
rollout itself will begin in 2016.
MAN Diesel & Turbo places particular emphasis on preventing
occupational accidents. Thanks to the MAN Diesel & Turbo Zero Accident
Initiative, 2015 marks the seventh year in a row in which there has been a
decrease in the severity of workplace accidents within the subgroup.
Established in 2014, behavior-based safety programs were fine-tuned in
the UK, the U.S., and the Augsburg site in 2015. The programs aim to
increase awareness of hazardous situations, systematically remove risks,
and foster safe workplace habits. In addition, the “Safety First” campaign
has made a valuable contribution to improving safety awareness and
occupational health and safety. The majority of MAN Diesel & Turbo’s service engineers have also been trained and certified in line with the Safety
Certificate Contractors standard, which aim to sharpen safety awareness
on customer construction sites and in projects.

Occupational health and safety

One important event in the year under review was the international MAN
Diesel & Turbo HSE Conference focusing on strategy and targets in the
area of occupational health and safety. In 2015, a Safety Week was also held
in India, as well as an all-day event called “Safety Stand-Down Day” for all
employees at MAN Diesel & Turbo sites in the USA.
OHSAS 18001 certification
In the reporting period, the MAN Truck & Bus production and productionrelated sites in Munich and Salzgitter (plant and components warehouse)
(Germany), Steyr (Austria), Poznan (Poland), and Pithampur (India); the
MAN Diesel & Turbo production site in Saint-Nazaire (France); and the
MAN Latin America production site in Quéretaro (Mexico) received OHSAS
18001 certification for the first time. This means that 25 of our sites are certified under the occupational health and safety management system —
eight more than in the previous year.
Occupational health
With our occupational health management program, we are aiming to
successively systematize all health-related measures within the Company.
Our health activities target not only working conditions, but also the
behaviors of the individual employees.
Through our targeted occupational health measures, we encourage
our employees to take the initiative in matters concerning their own
health. This not only includes offerings from our annual health program,
but also initiatives such as stop smoking classes, intraocular pressure
examinations, flu shots, and physical therapy. In cooperation with MAN
Academy, we offer numerous training programs which reinforce employees’ personal responsibility, healthy behavior, and a leadership culture
which promotes good health.

In addition, MAN sees programs and assistance for employees re-integrating into the workplace following a protracted illness or accident not only
as a legal obligation, but as an integral part of maintaining our employees’
ability to work and employability. The “MAN Checkup” is a preventive
health initiative which is also aimed at helping employees remain healthy
as well as identifying any potential risks at an early stage. In 2014, we successfully rolled out the MAN Checkup in the Munich, Nuremberg, Salzgitter, Augsburg, Deggendorf, and Oberhausen sites, and we have continued
to supplement the program with attractive follow-up measures and health
campaigns. At MAN Truck & Bus, in the year under review absences due to
illness averaged 14 days per employee.
At MAN Diesel & Turbo, the employee assistance program (EAP) is
another important pillar of occupational health management. An integral
part of our HR policy for many years, its services include counseling during crisis situations and the development of concrete solutions.

PRODUCTION

Efficiency, resource conservation, and environmental protection are key pillars of our corporate responsibility
activities in the production sector, which also covers the fields of transportation, logistics, and purchasing.
We have set ourselves a clear goal: by 2020 we aim to reduce CO2 emissions at our production sites by 25%
compared to 2008 levels.

Environmental Management
Challenges and goals
In the production sector, climate change, pollution, and resource scarcity
represent relevant global challenges to which the MAN Group is responding. Responsibility for the climate and the environment has traditionally
formed a core element of our corporate culture. We use our integrated
management systems and advanced technology to mitigate the negative
impacts of our activities. We take our responsibility seriously; in 2011 we
drew up a Group-wide climate strategy including the binding goal of
reducing CO₂ emissions at our production plants by 25% by 2020, compared to a 2008 baseline.

Organization
The highest decision-making body in strategic matters concerning the climate and the environment is the CR Board of the MAN Group (,page 10).
The members of the CR Board include the Chief Executive Officers and the
members of the board responsible for Production & Logistics and Research
& Development at MAN SE, MAN Truck & Bus, MAN Diesel & Turbo, and
MAN Latin America. A number of organizational units handle central
steering, operational implementation, and the networking of climate and
environmental matters at the subgroups:
The central Environmental Protection and Occupational Safety functions of the divisions analyze normative requirements, implement and
steer the management systems, and drive them forward in close collaboration with the environmental management officers at the production sites.
The plant managers and heads of production are responsible for operational tasks related to environmental protection. At each site they
are supported by specialist officers responsible for e.g. waste or water
protection.
The exchange of information between these officers across all central functions and sites is assured by regular meetings.

Production

Systems and instruments
The MAN Group operates management systems for environmental protection, occupational safety, and quality. At the production sites these systems are regularly verified by external experts or auditors, as well as by
internal audits.
Other material systems and instruments for the implementation
of the climate strategy and environmental protection include:
at MAN Truck & Bus, environmental protection, energy, and occupational safety policies that specify the CR strategy and provide a frame of
reference for the activities of our employees
at MAN Diesel & Turbo, the corporate policy providing a frame of reference for quality, occupational safety, and security management activities, as well as for environmental management; regulations and guidelines for the organization of environmental and security management
Together with occupational safety, environmental protection is firmly
anchored in the vocational training and continuing professional development activities of our employees.

Transportation and Logistics Management
Principles and guidelines
Reduction of the negative environmental impacts of transportation and
logistics activities also forms part of our integrated environmental management system. At MAN Truck & Bus, targets have been defined in this
respect, including the optimization of transportation structures and procedures. An appropriate tool for computing the CO₂ emissions from transportation activities has been put in place.

To reduce CO₂ emissions within our own logistics chain, we supply our
regional freight forwarders via freight hubs, which consolidate shipments,
optimize vehicle capacity utilization, and avoid vehicles having to make
empty runs. As a commercial vehicle manufacturer, we expect our service
providers to use state-of-the-art trucks that comply with the latest emissions standards.
Group-wide rules governing travel by air, rental car, and train prescribe that journeys should only be undertaken when unavoidable, and
only after first considering alternatives such as video or telephone conferencing. Wherever economically feasible, the most environmentally
friendly form of transportation should always be used.

Supplier Management
Challenges and goals
The MAN Group aims to reduce environmental and social risks in the supply chain while simultaneously optimizing material costs. The objective is
to increase procurement efficiency with regard to both sustainability and
cost-effectiveness.
MAN has adopted the core system of the Volkswagen Group’s
“Sustainability in Supplier Relations” concept. Together with traditional
priorities such as quality, price, and delivery times, the concept has been
thoroughly integrated in our procurement processes. To us, applying and
monitoring sustainability standards in the supply chain is above all a matter of minimizing risk — preventing potential supply shortages and damage to our reputation and ensuring that the quality of the procured supplies and services remains consistent. Both MAN and its suppliers profit
from the long-term supplier relationships which result.

Production

Concept and organization
The concept, which is based on three main pillars, aims to minimize or
prevent negative social, environmental, and financial impacts along our
supply chain:
An early warning system identifies risks along the supply chain.
Contractually mandated integration of the sustainability standards in
the procurement process ensures that these are acknowledged by all
suppliers before submitting a quotation on the Group Business Platform. Otherwise it is not possible to submit a quotation.
Supplier monitoring and development.
We regularly benchmark the effectiveness of our concept against other
companies and intensively analyze the results of sustainability ratings.
Principles and guidelines
Our supplier relations are based on the “Volkswagen Group requirements
regarding sustainability in its relationships with business partners
(Code of Conduct for Business Partners)” which apply across the Group.
They formulate our expectations for our business partners’ conduct with
regard to central environmental and social standards. Among other
things, they are based on the principles of the UN Global Compact, the
International Chamber of Commerce’s Business Charter for Sustainable
Development, and the relevant conventions of the International Labour
Organization. These principles are supplemented by the Volkswagen
Environmental Policy, the environmental targets and regulations derived
from it, the Group’s Quality Policy, and the Volkswagen Declaration on
Social Rights (see the 2015 Volkswagen Sustainability Report). Before sub-

mitting a quotation, the supplier must acknowledge the sustainability
requirements; this acknowledgement must be repeated every 12 months.
Since January 1, 2015, these requirements have been contractually integrated for all suppliers to General Procurement. The requirements apply
to all outsourced goods and services worldwide. We also expect our
tier 1 suppliers to pass these requirements on to their own suppliers.
Systems and instruments
In the interests of continuing supplier development, in the course of our
business relations we make an electronic learning (e-learning) module
on sustainability available to all suppliers in all of the languages of the
defined risk markets. After completing this task, the supplier has to perform a final test.
The Volkswagen Group uses an internal system for sustainable supply chain management. It provides supplier-specific sustainability information, enabling the comprehensive analysis of suppliers. If there is reason to suspect that tier 1 suppliers or their suppliers are failing to comply
with our sustainability requirements, we ask the party concerned for a
written statement using a standardized report (6D Report). Based on the
six points in the report, they can describe the status quo and any remedial
measures. If the answers prove unsatisfactory, we take further appropriate
steps, such as the examination of documents, visits to the supplier’s premises, or other customized supplier development activities.
Through fair dialog in a spirit of partnership and through supplier
development we create sustainability in supplier relations. The focus
throughout all process steps and measures is on such fair dialog and on the
development of the supplier in the interests of long-term collaboration.

Scope of the indicators

Data management specifics

[G4-23] This chapter covers 34 production sites and production-related
sites in the MAN Truck & Bus, MAN Latin America, MAN Diesel &
Turbo, and Renk divisions. Compared to the previous year, we also
included for the first time this year the data of our new MAN Truck &
Bus site in St. Petersburg, Russia.

[G4-22] In 2013, we already initiated a process to improve the accuracy and reliability of the environmental KPIs. In 2015 we again
improved the quality of these indicators by checking old data and —
when necessary — adjusting it. As part of this process, we also again
revised the indicators for the years 2008 to 2014. For this reason,
some KPIs presented in this GRI Report deviate from the data published in 2014.

CO2 emissions reported in the Progress Report on MAN’s Climate
Strategy relate solely to the 29 production sites that fall within the
scope of the Climate Strategy. This means that the nonproduction
sites — the spare parts warehouses in Dachau and Salzgitter (Germany), the Holeby facility (Denmark), as well as the St. Petersburg
(Russia) and Winterthur (Switzerland) sites are excluded.

To improve transparency, for 2015 we have decided to report the
environmental indicators both as totals for MAN SE as a whole and
separately for the Commercial Vehicles and Power Engineering business areas.
Our reporting of the direct and indirect CO2 emissions is aligned with
the emission factors of the Association of the German Automotive
Industry (VDA). One exception here concerns the emissions from district heating: wherever possible we use site-specific emission factors
here, with the VDA factors being applied only where these are not
available.
Further information on our data management can be found in the
chapter on Strategy and Management (, page 10 f.).

Heating oil consumption in the year under review was down by approximately 15%. This was primarily due to the opening of a new combined heat
and power plant at the Plauen site. Natural gas consumption increased by
8%. Other primary energy sources, apart from gasoline, include acetylene,
hydrogen, and propane.

CO2 reduction as part of our climate strategy
By 2020, we are aiming to reduce our CO₂ emissions from production by
25% relative to the baseline year 2008. So far, emissions have been cut by
19.5% — equivalent to 106,000 tonnes of CO₂. This means that our CO₂
reduction over the past year remained stable at the previous year’s level.
To implement our climate strategy, all sites have drawn up plans for saving energy and cutting CO₂ emissions. These often include:
implementing new energy supply concepts
optimizing lighting systems
measures to reduce base load, such as switching off machinery on
weekends and when plants are closed
replacing ventilation systems
optimizing heating control
increasing employee awareness

Dilemma

CO2 reduction
Back in 2011, MAN drew up a climate strategy with the aim of cutting
CO2 emissions at production sites by 25% by 2020 (baseline year
2008). However, it is MAN’s products which are its most powerful lever
in reducing global CO2 emissions. After all, more than 90% of total life
cycle CO2 emissions are generated during the use phase (, page 51).
Our research and development activities therefore focus on making
our commercial vehicles, engines, and turbomachinery perform more
efficiently, consume less fuel, and generate lower emissions.

In the course of developing more environmentally friendly products,
engines have to be subjected to repeated testing. This not only consumes liquid fuel or natural gas, but also causes CO2 emissions at the
sites. We are addressing this dilemma by implementing specific climate protection measures at our sites (, page 42) and regularly
measuring and monitoring their effectiveness. For example, at the
MAN Truck & Bus plant in Nuremberg, we carry out “cold tests” on
our engines, thereby considerably reducing diesel fuel consumption.
Even the braking energy generated on the engine test rigs is fed back
into the internal power grid.

Emissions from transportation and logistics
At 69.5%, truck traffic accounts for the largest proportion of CO₂ emissions
in MAN Truck & Bus logistics. In the year under review, MAN Truck & Bus
caused the release of 75,934 tonnes of CO₂ for incoming supplies and 81,566
tonnes of CO₂ in delivering its products. MAN Diesel & Turbo has succeeded in transferring more of its heavy shipments of large-bore engines
from road to rail, particularly at its Augsburg plant.
Employee mobility
In the year under review, our employees caused 16,000 tonnes of CO₂
emissions by business travel booked through the central travel service,
around 85% of which was for flights. Since 2013, the central Environmental
and Safety Management function at MAN Truck & Bus has been offsetting
the carbon emissions from employees’ international meetings and business trips, making them carbon-neutral. In 2015, it purchased offset certificates equivalent to 80 tonnes of CO₂ emissions.

In Germany, depending on the available infrastructure, we provide subsidized tickets for employees’ journeys to and from work. At our sites outside Germany we provide our employees with bus transfers, for example.
At MAN Latin America’s Resende site in Brazil, around 80% of employees
make use of this service.

Certifications
All 34 MAN production and production-related sites are certified to a quality standard (the majority to ISO 9001). We have set ourselves the target of
also certifying these sites to the ISO 14001 environmental management
standard. The Pinetown (South Africa) and Pithampur (India) production
sites of MAN Truck & Bus went through this certification process for the
first time in 2015. This means that twelve of the subgroup’s 15 production
or production-related sites now have an environmental management
system certified to ISO 14001, while five of them are also validated to the
European Environmental Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) and
regularly publish a site-related environmental statement.
The production sites of MAN Diesel & Turbo, with the exception of
Aurangabad (India), are certified to ISO 14001. The foundry at the Augsburg site is additionally certified to the ISO 50001 energy management
system, which indicates possible ways of making energy savings and
boosting efficiency.
In all, 28 production and production-related sites in the MAN Group
are certified to ISO 14001.
Consumption of resources and raw materials
MAN makes use of raw materials, auxiliaries, and consumables which predominantly consist of steel, copper, aluminum, and various plastics. Managing these resources economically is essential to our success, so saving
them is a Group-wide goal. Costs for raw materials, auxiliaries, and consumables fell by 9% in 2015 in comparison with the previous year.

Recycling and waste
The products manufactured by MAN largely consist of materials which
can be readily recycled. We will record the exact proportions in the future
for product life cycle assessments (, page 51).
In order to save raw materials, we pay particular attention to reusing metals in our foundries. For instance, at our Augsburg plant we remelt
the chips produced when castings are machined. In 2015, we purchased
and reutilized around 18,000 tonnes of scrap from external recycling processes at the Augsburg and Nuremberg plants. During the same period we
also recycled just under 10,000 tonnes of chips and scrap from our own
production in the manufacturing process at the same plants.
Total waste volumes amounted to 112,759 tonnes in the year under
review, 92% of which were recycled. These figures are approximately 7.5%
down on the previous year’s levels.
Hazardous waste for disposal and hazardous recyclable waste were
collected and disposed of at all sites in accordance with waste management legislation. Disposal providers have confirmed proper disposal. No
waste was exported. In 2015, we made further refinements to the way our
data is collected, recording non-production waste (construction waste)

Investment in environmental protection
In the year under review, we invested more than €5.8 million in environmental protection measures. The fall of 63% against the previous year
reflects the prevailing macroeconomic environment and was also influenced by a number of non-recurring items. For example the construction
of an energy recovery system at the Frederikshavn site was among items
that resulted in an exceptionally high level of investment in 2014.

No significant accidents with a negative environmental impact occurred
in the reporting period. No fines for environmentally relevant incidents
had to be paid by any MAN production sites in the reporting period. There
were also no pending legal proceedings or open claims pertaining to environmental protection.

Purchasing
MAN buys in around €7 billion worth of raw materials, goods, and services
annually. The largest proportion is metals and plastics. Faced with a growing, increasingly global, and more complex supply chain, the MAN Group
believes it has a responsibility to promote sustainability along the entire
value chain. The aim is to establish robust and efficient flows of goods
and supplies.

ing from demand for goods and services by MAN has a positive impact on
infrastructure thanks to downstream effects: jobs are created and local
incomes rise. Moreover, regional suppliers are also preferable from an environmental standpoint since transportation-related emissions are lower.

Local suppliers
By purchasing raw materials, goods, and services where our production
operations are located, we contribute to local economic and social development. For example, over 90% of suppliers to MAN Truck & Bus have

Comprehensive product responsibility
Challenges and goals
To meet the global challenges in the areas of health, resource scarcity,
urbanization, and climate change, MAN takes a broad and comprehensive
approach to product responsibility. This focuses on everything from the
development of efficient and safe products and the implementation of
environmentally friendly, resource-efficient production processes to environmentally responsible after-sales activities and customer support. Consequently, product responsibility at MAN is based on four cornerstones
— environment, safety, health, and social responsibility — and takes into
account the entire product life cycle, from raw materials extraction to endof-life disposal. This broad-based approach allows us to meet the increasing expectations of our stakeholders.
Principles and goals
We are committed to continuously improving the efficiency of our products. After all, in most cases our customers base their decision to buy a
product on total cost of ownership. In the freight transportation sector,
Material GRI aspects covered in this chapter:

Products and Services [measures to reduce negative impacts]
Customer Health and Safety

fuel costs account for approximately one third of this sum, which is why
the quest for greater efficiency and low emissions is a key technology
driver. In pursuit of technology leadership, MAN focuses its research and
development activities not only on developing new products and enhancing existing ones but also on:
Reducing fuel consumption and emissions
Alternative drive concepts
Alternative fuels.
Systems and instruments
Future trends and scenarios are an important benchmark for MAN’s strategic product development process. MAN Truck & Bus therefore uses a
“Trend Radar” to assist in the early identification, evaluation, and analysis
of relevant trends. The findings are then integrated into the Product Engineering Process.
To calculate the life cycle environmental impact of its products,
MAN Truck & Bus has adopted a two-step strategy. In addition to the Product Carbon Footprint (PCF), this will in future also include the Life Cycle
Assessment (LCA).
To meet the high safety standards expected of our products, MAN
Diesel & Turbo has set up a Product Safety Committee. With the aim of
embedding safety more firmly in the organizational structure, the relevant Subgroup Policy has been revised and the Executive Board has signed
off on internationally binding Product Safety Guidelines.

Product engineering process
On average, more than 90% of the total life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of the products of both the Commercial Vehicles and Power Engineering business areas are generated during the use phase of the product
(, page 51). Because most of our products have a very long service life —
and are used intensively — we implement a future-oriented product development process to minimize environmental impacts as far as possible.
Our Product Engineering Process defines standard procedures for
product development. These procedures are geared particularly to ensuring the cost efficiency and reliability of our products, where we aim to continuously reduce fuel consumption — and therefore also emissions —
while also minimizing our consumption of materials.

In developing its commercial vehicles, MAN Truck & Bus also takes into
account the results of Life Cycle Assessments (, page 51) and options for
reducing total cost of ownership — for example by cutting maintenance
costs. In 2014, the subgroup took further steps to align its Product Engineering Process with standard procedures at Volkswagen. At MAN Truck &
Bus, environmental and health aspects of vehicle development, such as
measures to reduce pollutant emissions and noise, are regulated by the
Environmentally Compatible Product Development process guidelines.
Our aim is to continuously improve the efficiency of our products.
Although MAN Diesel & Turbo’s engines are today already capable of
achieving over 50% efficiency, our work to reduce fuel consumption is
ongoing.

Potential for reducing the life cycle CO2 emissions of our products
To identify the potential for reducing the life cycle CO₂ emissions of our
products, we calculate Product Carbon Footprints (PCF) for virtually all
product groups of the MAN Truck & Bus subgroup and for selected product groups of MAN Diesel & Turbo. The benchmark products for which calculations have been performed here included not only a dual-fuel engine,
but also a performance-enhancing system (turbocharger) and a Selective
Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system. The calculation methodology is based
on the requirements of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. The findings confirm that more than 90% of our products’ life cycle CO₂ emissions are generated during the use phase.
The product life cycle stages used by MAN Truck & Bus in this calculation model are defined in accordance with standard automotive
industry practice. They comprise:
1. Production
2. Use phase
3. End of life (recycling and waste processing)
Since 2014, we have also been using more specific — and therefore more
realistic — calculation data for the PCF. For example we now use segmentspecific lifetime mileages instead of an average for all trucks. To take a specific example, over a total lifetime mileage of 1.8 million kilometers, a TGX
18.440 4x2 BLS Euro 5 semitrailer tractor produces total greenhouse gas
emissions of 1,746 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent, 98% of which is generated in
the use phase.
In 2013, this truck topped the production charts at MAN. The calculation was carried out in line with the requirements of the GHG Protocol
Product Accounting and Reporting Standard and was verified in accordance with TÜV NORD standard TN-CC 020 and the international standard

ISO 14064-3. We are currently preparing a PCF for the Euro 6 successor
model. In addition, we are looking at the potential for reducing the carbon
footprint of our vehicles during the use phase. The principal focus here is
on fuel-efficiency measures and on calculating the greenhouse gas emissions of potential alternative fuels and drive concepts.
In future, MAN Truck & Bus also plans to perform Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) for its products. In addition to CO₂, these will also take into
account additional environmental impact categories not considered in
the PCF. To ensure that the LCA provides an even more accurate picture of
our products, we are currently collating a database of the materials used in
these products.

Emissions standards for commercial vehicles
The pollutant emissions of heavy-duty commercial vehicles such
as trucks and buses are regulated by a number of European directives and regulations. Unlike passenger cars and light commercial
vehicles, where the measurements are based on full-vehicle testing on a chassis dynamometer, in the case of heavy-duty commercial vehicles an engine dynamometer is used to measure the
engine emissions over a specified cycle of operating conditions. In
this case the standards are expressed in terms of pollutant emissions per unit of work done by the engine, i.e. per kilowatt hour. All
MAN truck and bus engines comply with current emissions standards. This is certified in test reports by state-accredited independent verifiers.

Consistently Efficient product portfolio
Total cost of ownership is an important purchasing criterion for customers. In response, MAN offers a consistently efficient product portfolio in all
business areas.
Commercial Vehicles Cost-efficient and clean transportation solutions from
MAN Truck & Bus include the new TGX EfficientLine 2, which incorporates
a whole series of new, fuel-saving technologies aimed at further reducing
total cost of ownership and CO₂ emissions. Standard specification includes
the EfficientCruise predictive cruise control system, the torque-enhancing
TopTorque system, and the MAN TeleMatics system. The GPS-based EfficientCruise cruise control anticipates upcoming uphill and downhill
stretches and calculates the most fuel-efficient speed in advance. In this
way the vehicle’s momentum can be used to save fuel. These measures
result in fuel savings of up to 6% compared with the previous model. The
TGX EfficientLine is the most successful efficiency model on the market.
Since market launch in 2010, more than 50,000 customers have already
opted for the extra-fuel-efficient EfficientLine models and packages. In
2015, the TGX EfficientLine 2 was named “Truck of the Year” in Spain.

Power Engineering The highly efficient gas engines and emissions control
systems offered by MAN Diesel & Turbo allow customers to comply with
both present and future emissions requirements. The technologies used
in new engines are also offered for retrofitting in engines already being
operated by customers. In its Power Plants strategic business unit, MAN
Diesel & Turbo offers one-stop power plant solutions that are optimized
to meet the requirements of the individual customer. Following the
launch of the 35/44G gas engine (electrical output 10,335 kW) on the power
generation market, the latest addition to the MAN Diesel & Turbo portfolio is the 51/60G gas engine, with an electrical output of 18,465 kW. This
engine too boasts very high efficiency. In 2015, MAN Diesel & Turbo showcased versions of these highly efficient gas engines at Power-Gen Europe
in Amsterdam — the world’s leading technology fair, outside the USA, for
the power plant and power generation industry.
In 2016, the IMO Tier III standard came into force for ships operating in the ports and coastal waters of North America, imposing substantially more stringent limits for nitrogen oxide emissions. MAN Diesel &
Turbo offers customers an IMO Tier III-compliant marine engine portfolio
based on a diverse and extensive range of technologies. We are the first
company to successfully make four-stroke marine engines IMO Tier IIIcompliant, based on a fully modular SCR system that can be used across the
entire MAN Diesel & Turbo four-stroke engine portfolio. The DNV-GL certification body has awarded MAN Diesel & Turbo a Tier III-compatibility certificate for the MAN 8L21/31 four-stroke engine with retrofitted SCR system.

Alternative drive technology
In MAN’s view, alternative drive technology will take on new importance
in the future. While hybrid drive, for example, has long been established in
the local mass transit sector, the challenge for the future will be to establish this technology in long-distance transportation too.
The MAN Lion’s City Hybrid bus offers reductions of up to 30% in fuel
consumption, which equates to a reduction in annual CO₂ emissions of
26 tonnes per bus. In 2015, MAN sold 126 of these vehicles, 68% more than
in the previous year.
With the TGX Hybrid, the Company also offers a hybrid-powered
truck for long-distance haulage. While the diesel engine provides the main
source of motive power, the electric motor operates as a generator on the
overrun and during braking. Tests have showed that this solution can
bring a reduction in fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions of around 8%.
In 2015, MAN Latin America launched an exclusive low-cost, lightweight “Smart Ratio” automated transmission system for trucks and buses
in the 13 to 30 tonne weight range. This technology maximizes the potential of a six-speed transmission by combining it with a two-speed rear axle.
Performance is equivalent to that of a 12-speed automatic transmission,
but at lower cost and weight. “Smart Ratio” technology has already been
implemented on the Constellation truck model, developed by MAN Latin
America. This vehicle is available with hydraulic hybrid drive, which can
reduce fuel consumption by up to 25%, cutting CO₂ emissions by up to
20 tonnes per year. For 2016, there are plans to advance the city bus technologies with prototype development and testing. For the truck model
Constellation a more sustainable cab has been developed with plastic

components manufactured using nanoclay and featuring increased use of
renewable materials, while offering the same standards of quality and
functionality as conventional cabs.
Alternative fuels
Commercial Vehicles When operated on biogas or e-gas, the MAN Lion’s City
GL CNG natural gas-powered city bus is almost carbon-neutral. In addition, life cycle maintenance and operating costs are cut by around 15%.
This vehicle was voted “Bus of the Year 2015” by a jury of European trade
journalists, and was also presented with the Huss publishing group’s
“International busplaner Sustainability Award 2015” in the line-service
category. 387 of the 1,736 city buses supplied by MAN in 2015 were powered
by compressed natural gas. That means CNG buses accounted for 22% of
total sales of MAN city buses. With a market share of 39%, MAN is the
undisputed leader in the European CNG bus market.
MAN already presented its first gas-powered bus in 1943. Since
then, both the engine technology and emissions technology have been
continuously refined and improved. Furthermore, all gas-powered buses
are capable of running on biogas, which means they can provide near carbon-neutral mobility.

Power Engineering Natural gas is a fuel of the future in the shipping industry. The two-stroke dual-fuel ME-GI engine from MAN Diesel & Turbo,
which can operate both on gaseous and liquid fuels, is particularly ecofriendly when running on gas, with a marked reduction in CO₂ and nitrogen oxide emissions, while sulfur dioxide, soot, and particulate emissions
are cut virtually to zero.
MGT gas turbines are ideal for providing decentralized energy supplies. They are small, compact, and flexible, and allow overall efficiencies
of over 88% to be achieved. In the “Green Earth” project, MAN has been
working with Ruhr-University Bochum and the Institute of Combustion

Technology at the DLR in Stuttgart since 2014 to further improve the MGT
industrial gas turbine for use in combined-cycle gas and steam power stations and CHP plants. This project is being subsidized by the German Federal Ministry of Economics.
After Sales
With the MAN Genuine Parts ecoline range of professionally remanufactured used parts, MAN Truck & Bus offers a repair solution that conserves
resources, reduces energy consumption, and cuts costs by an average of
30%. Furthermore, for customers in most parts of Europe, an extensive
range of MAN replacement units and parts is also available. In 2015, MAN
Genuine Parts ecoline was honored with the European Transport Award
for Sustainability by the trade journal Transport.
The MAN “ProfiDrive” driver training program teaches the principles of safe and fuel-efficient driving. One of the modules in this program
is “Connected CoDrive,” an e-learning course in which a virtual co-driver
analyzes driving style and provides tips for more fuel-efficient driving. On
average, drivers can reduce their fuel consumption by 2.3l/100 km after
completing this training. “MAN PrimeServ,” the service brand of MAN
Diesel & Turbo, already enjoys an excellent global reputation. It has a
strong local presence with a network of well over 100 PrimeServ locations
worldwide. The PrimeServ portfolio includes certified original parts, highquality servicing, customer training and retrofits. The retrofits help to
boost efficiency and cut emissions, for example in diesel engines or
marine propulsion systems.
In 2015, MAN PrimeServ took an important step forward in the conversion of marine propulsion systems. The Wessels Reederei shipping
company commissioned MAN PrimeServ to convert the main engine of a
vessel to LNG-capable propulsion. This will bring major cuts in emissions
when running on LNG.

Annex

Product quality
MAN Truck & Bus once again performed strongly in 2015 in the TÜV
Report for Commercial Vehicles, where for the fourth year in a row it was
the truck manufacturer with the highest share of vehicles to pass the main
TÜV inspections free of faults. This made MAN the most reliable brand for
trucks from 7.5 tonnes upward. The report found that one-, three-, four-,
and five-year-old vehicles from our TGL, TGM, TGS, and TGX series had the
fewest faults. MAN also widened its lead in the one-year-old vehicle category, with 85.9% of the trucks proving free of faults (2014: 83%).
Driver assistance systems
Highly and fully automated driving is an increasingly important development focus. As well as improving road safety, these driver assistance systems also help make our vehicles even more efficient. Based on many
years of accident research, MAN Truck & Bus is working to continuously
improve the safety of its vehicles — for example with driver assistance systems such as Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Emergency Brake Assist (EBA),
and Lane Guard System (LGS).
Platooning systems are also improving traffic safety on motorways.
These increase also the capacity of existing road infrastructure, making a
further contribution to more environmentally friendly freight transportation. MAN defines platooning as a vehicle-based system, still at the development stage, in which two or more truck-trailer combinations follow
each other in close proximity with the aid of driver assistance systems,
controller technology, and vehicle-to-vehicle communication. The vehicles are effectively connected by an “electronic tow bar,” with the lead vehicle controlling the following vehicle in the platoon. The distance between
each semitrailer rig is less than 15 meters, or roughly half a second of driving time. The resulting “slipstreaming effect” achieves an overall fuel sav-

ing for the platoon as a whole of up to 10%, depending on vehicle model
and convoy length. MAN is a partner in the platooning project organized
by the Dutch EU Council Presidency. Its work on this project involves road
testing of platooning systems.
Training
For both customers and employees, MAN Diesel & Turbo’s PrimeServ
Academies offer technical training and customized product training —
which can be delivered directly on-site, even on board the customer’s ship
or at the customer’s power station. Technical know-how transfer mainly
takes the form of hands-on product-based training. This is supplemented
by web-based training that combines practical elements with e-learning.
All PrimeServ Academies worldwide operate to the same high quality
standards. The PrimeServ Academies also provide a network for promoting the exchange of knowledge between customers, suppliers, and employees in our research and development departments.
When it comes to product safety, we depend on the support of all
our employees. It is essential to maintain high levels of safety awareness,
along with high standards of competence on the part of employees working in critical areas such as explosion safety or machine safety. The ROST
(Rollout Standardized Safety Trainings) project, which was set up to promote these objectives, continued in 2015. Its goal — to expand the existing
range of continuing professional development programs on product
safety, with a view to ensuring uniform standards throughout the Company — has already been achieved. A total of more than 6,500 participants
received product safety training in 2015 alone. In 2016, the concept will
also be implemented for the International Group Companies (IGC), in the
form of the ROST Global program.

Traffic management systems
How can commercial vehicles operate safely and efficiently in an increasingly congested urban environment? This was the question tackled by
MAN engineers in the UR:BAN research project. The 31 project partners
included companies, universities, research institutes, and cities. The project, concluded in 2016, was subsidized by the German Federal Ministry for
Economic Affairs and Energy. The focus was on the development of new
driver assistance and traffic management systems for trucks and buses. In
this area, MAN contributed to three subprojects: “Human Factors in Traffic,” in which the information supplied by assistance systems is stripped
down to the essentials, which are then presented in an intuitive way to
drivers; “Networked Traffic System,” where MAN developed a green wave
assistance system to ensure fuel efficiency and time savings in urban driving by making optimal use of traffic light green phases; and “Cognitive
Assistance,” which focused on improved 360º urban traffic monitoring for
buses and trucks.
Long trucks
On certain routes, extra-long (up to 25.25 m) trucks have the potential to
help meet the forecast future growth in road freight traffic while at the
same time helping to curb greenhouse gas emissions. An MAN vehicle is
taking part in the German long-truck field trial, which will continue
through to the end of 2016. The trial vehicle is shuttling daily between the
Dachau parts depot and the Salzgitter plant. Further vehicles will also
operate between the Munich and Salzgitter plants. Findings derived from
the scientific monitoring of the field trial show that on average one trip by
a long truck can replace 1.56 trips by a conventional standard truck, reducing fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions by up to 25%. A decision on
whether to grant general authorization for the use of long trucks in Germany will not be taken until the field test has been completed and the
findings evaluated.

Challenge

Mobility in a digitized world
Growing competition and cost pressure pose major challenges for
the transportation industry. However, MAN is seizing the opportunities offered by digitization to further improve vehicle efficiency, cutting costs for the customer and saving resources. Vehicle connectivity is a key focus here.
Based on the MAN TeleMatics onboard module, which provides
customers with key vehicle and driving data in real time, MAN
already offers connected services that reduce fuel consumption,
improve fleet utilization, and reduce the frequency of workshop visits. This solution allows optimal management of fleet capacity and
proactive planning of servicing and maintenance. This allows commercial vehicles to be used more productively — saving both time
and fuel.
Digitization and connectivity opens up a whole new range of potential applications and business opportunities for MAN. However, this
potential can only be unlocked with the aid of innovative solutions
and capital investment. In 2015, MAN invested a total of approximately €43 million in digital projects, and set up a new “Telematics
and Digital Solutions” department to strategically manage its activities in the field of digital technology and telematics services.

Annex

In a limited assurance engagement the evidence-gathering procedures are
more limited than for a reasonable assurance engagement and therefore
significantly less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance
engagement. The procedures selected depend on the practitioner’s judgement. This includes the assessment of the risks of material misstatements
of the sustainability information in the Sustainability Report with regard
to the GRI-Criteria.
Within the scope of our work we performed amongst others the
following procedures:
I nquiries of personnel involved in the preparation of the Sustainability
Report, including data collection, regarding the preparation process,
the underlying internal control system and selected sustainability
information
Inspection of complementary documents and supporting systems
Conduction of site visits as part of the inspection of data collection
and consolidation processes as well as internal control procedures
with regard to the selected indicators at:
– MAN Diesel & Turbo Augsburg, Germany
– MAN Diesel & Turbo Copenhagen, Denmark
– MAN Truck & Bus, Nuremberg, Germany
– MAN Truck & Bus, Steyr, Austria
– MAN Latin America, Resende, Brazil

 nalytical procedures on selected sustainability information of the
A
Sustainability Report
Comparison of selected sustainability information with corresponding
data in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report
Assessment of the presentation of selected sustainability information
in the Sustainability Report regarding the sustainability performance
Conclusion
Based on our limited assurance engagement, nothing has come to our
attention that causes us to believe that the sustainability information
marked with
in the Sustainability Report of the Company for the
period January 1 to December 31, 2015 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the GRI-Criteria.
Emphasis of Matter — Recommendations
Without qualifying our conclusion above, we make the following recommendations for the further development of the Company’s sustainability
management and sustainability reporting:
Further implementation of the group guideline “MAN 10.4 Berichterstattung Corporate Responsibility” that came into force in 2015 and therein
defined process- and control standards

information

[G4-24] Since 2011, each year we have provided our stakeholders with transparent and detailed information about our progress in implementing our
CR strategy. This year’s GRI Report is part of a multipronged reporting
approach aimed at the needs of our different target groups. Our reporting
approach features three different formats aimed at different target groups
— all under the heading of “Corporate Responsibility at MAN 2015:”
In this MAN GRI Report, we provide a transparent account of what we
achieved in 2015 in the area of corporate responsibility and sustainability
and what we plan to accomplish in the future. Available exclusively
online as a PDF, it contains detailed information for analysts, investors,
customers, and business partners.
The MAN CR Online Journal presents an accessible and interactive overview of our CR highlights of 2015. The microsite is aimed at employees,
job applicants, customers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and
members of the general public.
The MAN CR Journal illustrates what CR means at MAN and provides a
clear summary of our activities in 2015. It is primarily intended to provide a quick overview for our employees and customers around the
world. This publication is available for download as a PDF and in print.
Report profile
This report meets the standards of the current G4 version of the Global
Reporting Initiative (GRI). It was prepared in accordance with the GRI G4
Core option. MAN’s CR reporting was preceded by a process of materiality
analysis which also took stakeholder views into account — as described on
pages 5 to 9. The GRI confirmed our selection of material issues through
its Materiality Disclosure Service. The GRI content index outlines our
compliance with the relevant GRI indicators (, page 57 ff.) and represents
our UN Global Compact Communication on Progress.

MAN has systematically aligned its GRI Report with the CR Strategy 2020+.
The sections correspond to the four CR cornerstones, while their subsections are named in accordance with the fields of action (, page 6).
We voluntarily submitted our 2015 GRI Report to a comprehensive
independent audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) which was conducted in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance
Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (revised) (, page 61 ff.). The focus of the audit
was on occupational safety and environmental indicators in production
operations. The verified content is marked in the report with a symbol
.
The marked employee KPIs were audited as part of the 2015 Annual Report
process. The materiality process and the management approach have not
changed significantly compared to the previous year. They were verified
by PwC in its audit of the 2014 MAN GRI Report.
Scope
[G4-17] The 2015 reporting period is identical with the 2015 fiscal year,
which runs from January 1 to December 31. The closing date for contributions was March 31, 2016. The next report should appear in mid-2017.
Unless otherwise specified, the facts and figures published in
this report relate to the entire MAN Group (MAN SE including subsidiaries,
but excluding joint ventures, associated companies, and financial participations).
In the interests of readability, we have not used the full legal names
of MAN SE and its subgroups.
Wherever relevant we have included cross-references to additional
information in the 2015 Annual Report or other MAN Group Internet
pages. The GRI Report, the Journal, and the Online Journal appear in German and English.
