Dear Readers,
There is a notion that is to be found as much in the field of physics as it
is in philosophy: Everything is interconnected.
This may sound very mundane, but it is certainly true. Regardless of
whether we’re talking about globalization, digitalization, climate change,
political crises or the wealth gap: Every single day we, the people,
influence them all through our actions — both for the better and for the
worse. This applies all the more so to us, as a global organization with
over 284,000 employees.
We are aware of the responsibility we bear as a result of this. For that
reason, we want to think things through logically and holistically, and give
answers today to the questions of tomorrow. Starting with the development of ever lower-emission engines and more energy-efficient production processes. Developing alternative drive technologies and new forms
of mobility, such as electromobility or autonomous driving. And demonstrating social responsibility and integrity wherever we, as a company,
have a production presence or do business.

We are convinced that globalization, digitalization, and the human desire
for individual mobility will continue to offer up superb opportunities in the
future and remain engines of growth for the global economy — but only
if our actions are not solely geared to short-term profit, but also take into
account the common good — absolutely in keeping with the UN Global
Compact and the Sustainable Development Goals. We do not just want to
react to what crops up before us on the road ahead — we want to proceed
with foresight and a sense of responsibility.
And your opinions and expectations are very important to us in this respect (see the stakeholder survey and materiality analysis in this report).
We would therefore very much welcome your continuing input — both
critical and constructive — to this process: After all our vision is better
if we look ahead together.
Best regards,

Dr. Dieter Zetsche

Materiality analysis
Our sustainability strategy also takes the expectations of our stakeholders into
account. We use a multi-step materiality analysis for the identification of the fields
of action that are relevant for us and our stakeholders.
This report is oriented toward the G4 guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and
thus takes the materiality principle into account as well. We consider fields of action to be
“material” if they are important for the company as well as for our stakeholders. We use a
multi-step materiality analysis to help us determine what the different assessments, which
do not always coincide, have in common.
Specifying fields of action. We evaluate a variety of sources in order to obtain as precise
a picture of our stakeholders’ concerns as possible. This involves evaluating reader fedback
regarding this report, customer and employee surveys, specialist unit workshops, dialogs with
individual stakeholder groups, and the results of our “Daimler Sustainability Dialogue.” We
also conduct symposia to gather input from our stakeholders, and take into account the analyses of our News and Issues Management team and our Society and Technology Research
Group. In this way, we identify fields of action that influence our company and that we can, in
turn, influence ourselves.

Determining materiality. With the help of a materiality analysis, we compare the results of
the online survey with those of an internal survey of the members of our company’s sustainability bodies as well as the entire Board of Management of Daimler AG. These internal bodies
discuss which topics have material effects on our company from a social, ecological, ethical,
human-rights, and economic perspective.
Consistent action. The materiality analysis shows us the areas to which we have to pay particular attention. As a result, we further intensified our sustainability management activities
in 2015, focusing particularly on the key topics of the materiality analysis. These include
our activities to respect human rights, measures to further reduce the CO2 emissions of our
vehicles, and the research and development of innovative vehicle and drive-system technologies. We also take the results of the materiality analysis into account when selecting topics
for our annual “Daimler Sustainability Dialogue.” The graphics on the following pages depict
the fields of action that were evaluated. The fields are clustered by topic and arranged in
descending order according to stakeholder priority.
More on the stakeholder dialog: p. 13 ff.

Stakeholder surveys. To enable a priority ranking of the identified fields of action, we conduct an international open stakeholder survey every two years. The target groups are not
preselected in advance. For more than one month, all interested parties can participate in the
survey on our website at www.daimler.com, and name and evaluate topics that are important
to them. In our assessment of the results, we give special consideration to the great significance of our primary stakeholder groups (shareholders and investors, customers, suppliers,
and employees) as well as to non-government organizations. We had received more than
700 replies by the end of the last survey in the summer of 2015.

Strategy and management
For Daimler, acting in line with the principles of sustainability means striving to achieve long-term
business success on a viable basis. To make this possible, our activities must always be in harmony
with society and the environment. A key aspect of our sustainable management approach involves
offering safe, fuel-efficient, and low-emission vehicles, as this is the only way to ensure that
we remain a clear leader in the area of sustainability as one of the world’s foremost automakers.

Sustainability is a basic principle of our corporate strategy and a
benchmark for our business success. Our sustainability strategy
is designed to help us achieve our targets as defined in our target
program. We are continuously developing this strategy in order
to ensure we can deal systematically with the fields of action that
are also considered important by our stakeholders.

Our understanding of sustainability

G4-2, G4-9, G4-15, G4-21,

1

At Daimler, we define sustainability as responsible corporate behavior
that leads to long-term business success and strives to achieve harmony with
society and the environment.

2

We are moving toward our targets by making sustainability a firmly
integrated aspect of our operations. We require that all managers and
employees at Daimler understand and accept this mind-set and we also
promote a strong sense of responsibility in this regard among our staff.

3

We maintain a continual dialog with our stakeholders in order to take
their points of view into account.

4

Our business partners are also expected to meet our requirements as
regards responsibility for sustainable operations.

5

Our management structures, processes, and systems are designed in
accordance with the principles of sustainability as well. All of our behavior
is based on legality and integrity.

6

As one of the world’s leading automobile manufacturers, we also seek to be
a leader when it comes to sustainability.

Target program

Our strategic approach
As a globally operating automobile manufacturer, we deal with industryspecific challenges whose associated opportunities need to be exploited
and whose risks need to be minimized:
–		 We are committed to legal and ethical standards and must ensure
that they are observed within the Group worldwide as well as by our
business partners and suppliers.
–		 Road traffic contributes to the generation of CO2 and pollutant emissions, which can endanger the health of pedestrians and people on
the road. We therefore use our power of innovation to create environmentally friendly and safe vehicles that conserve resources to the
greatest extent possible. We also develop sustainable mobility solutions and promote their profitable implementation.
–		 Our operational processes, particularly in vehicle production, are
also associated with environmental effects, which we keep as low as
possible through a system of effective environmental management.
–		 As an employer, we bear responsibility for ensuring fair and attractive
working conditions for 284,015 employees worldwide.
–		 As a good corporate citizen, we want to contribute to the common
good beyond the scope of our business operations and to make use
of our special competencies as we do so.

To adequately meet all of these requirements, we have developed a
Group-wide sustainability strategy, which is integrated into our corporate
strategy and makes sustainability a fundamental corporate principle
at the implementation level. This strategy relates to six main areas in
which we assume responsibility: product, production, employees, ethics,
society, and business partners. In each of these areas, we focus on fields
of action that both we and our stakeholders believe are of essential importance. We set targets, and define target indicators, for each field of
action. Taken together, all of these targets form our medium to long-term
target program.

Main fields of action
We regularly conduct multi-stage materiality analyses to prioritize the
fields of action. These analyses combine our own assessments with those
of our stakeholders, who include our employees, customers, shareholders,
and suppliers, as well as governments, environmental and human rights
organizations, and other civil society interest groups. Their opinions are
also requested whenever we decide on measures for expanding or adjusting our sustainability strategy.

Target program

Our central management committee for sustainability is the Corporate Sustainability Board (CSB), which is headed by Renata Jungo Brüngger (member of the Board of Management, Integrity and Legal Affairs) and
Professor Thomas Weber (member of the Board of Management, Group
Research & Mercedes-Benz Cars Development). The CSB is managed by
Anke Kleinschmit (Head of Group Research and Sustainability and Chief
Environmental Officer). The operational work is done by the Corporate
Sustainability Office (CSO), which consists of representatives of the specialist units and the business divisions.

The principles and policies (full text):
Integrity Code (PDF)
Our Environmental and Energy Guidelines in detail (PDF)
Supplier Sustainability Standards (PDF)

The firm anchoring of integrity into our corporate culture has special
importance in our sustainability strategy. Our standards and policies
of good conduct are formulated in our Integrity Code, which is supplemented by other in-house principles and policies that help our employees
make the right decisions in their day-to-day business.

Governance structures. As a corporation founded under German law,
the Daimler Group has a two-tier management structure that consists of
a Board of Management and a Supervisory Board. Both of these bodies
work closely together in line with the recommendations of the German
Corporate Governance Code. The requirement for sustainable corporate
management is also firmly established at this top management level, as
Board of Management remuneration is also linked to non-financial targets,
such as those related to integrity.

The House of Policies is our digital platform for policies. All internal
policies of the Group and works agreements are compiled here in a userfriendly Enterprise Regulations Database (ERD), which is accessible to
all employees. The ERD is available in ten languages, and the policies are
available in up to 23 languages.

G4-7, G4-15, G4-34, G4-36,

Suppliers

The basic guidance for our business activity is provided by the ten principles of the UN Global Compact, with which we have a special affiliation
as a founding participant and part of its LEAD Group. Our internal principles and guidelines are founded on this international frame of reference
and other international principles.
		 Basic principles and guidelines for our sustainability management:
		 Chart 05, p. 12

Controlling with a sustainability scorecard. We utilize a sustainability
scorecard as an instrument for controlling the key sustainability targets.
The scorecard uses a color-coded “traffic-light” system to signal needs for
action and successes based on quantitative and qualitative indicators.

Quota for women on Supervisory Board nearly reached. With three
women on the shareholders’ side and two women on the side of the
employee representatives, Daimler has almost achieved the 30 percent
quota for women on Supervisory Boards that is required at listed companies. The share of women on the Board of Management was 12.5 percent
in 2015. We wish to achieve a 20 percent share of senior executive positions occupied by women by the year 2020. The share of women in such
positions worldwide stood at 15.4 percent at the end of 2015.

Stakeholder dialog

Independent rating agencies and research institutes conduct numerous
ratings and rankings of sharply varying quality and significance today.
Daimler therefore only supplies data for those ratings and rankings whose
assessment methodology, quality, and transparency can be subjected to
a verifiable analysis.

Dialog with our stakeholders is very important to us. We seek to
conduct a dialog with all stakeholder groups in order to share views
and experiences — and also to discuss controversial topics in a
constructive manner.

Top ranking in the CDLI. Daimler achieved a top ranking once again
in the CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) in 2015. The company
was honored for outstanding commitment and exemplary transparency
in dealing with climate change and scored the maximum number of 100
points in the Climate Disclosure Leadership Index (CDLI). In addition,
Daimler received an “A-” performance rating for its initiated measures,
already achieved progress, and planned strategies for reduction of CO2
emissions, putting it in the top 10 percent of all companies assessed.
We were once again graded “Prime Investment Status” in the rating from
oekom research. Our overall assessment was B- ( a very good grade for
an automotive company) on a scale from A+ to D-.

Organization of the dialog. For our stakeholder relationships we have
defined clear lines of responsibility, communication channels, and forms
of dialog. In addition to institutionalized dialog management, for example
in Investor Relations, Procurement or Corporate Communications, the
Sustainability Board and the Sustainability Office coordinate the dialog
with society at large.
Identification of stakeholder groups. For us, stakeholders are all
parties and organizations that impose legal, financial, operational or
ethical requirements on Daimler AG. One criterion for the identification
and weighting is the extent to which a person or group is affected by
our company’s decisions or can, in turn, affect these decisions. The most
important stakeholders are our employees, customers, shareholders,
and investors, as well as our suppliers. However, civil groups such as
NGOs also have legitimate interests that we take into consideration. The
same applies to analysts, professional associations, trade unions, media,
science, and politics as well as municipalities, residents, and neighbors
of our locations.

Stakeholder dialog media and formats. To ensure the inclusion of
our stakeholders, we utilize online and print media, questionnaires and
surveys, discussions with experts, workshops, and local and regional
dialog events, among others. In addition, we collaborate in professional
associations, committees, and sustainability initiatives. We also stage
interdisciplinary conferences — for example, the symposium on the legal
and ethical aspects of autonomous driving in September 2015, in which
more than 100 experts from business, science, politics, and the media
participated.
Conference on autonomous driving
The “Daimler Sustainability Dialogue,” which is held annually in Stuttgart, brings various stakeholder groups together with representatives of
our Board of Management and the executive management. In order to
promote sustainability standards around the world, we are now organizing
such dialog events in other countries as well. Thus far, events have been
held in China, Japan, and the United States. In the reporting year, we held
the second “Japan Sustainability Dialogue” and, for the first time, a “Sustainability Dialogue” in Argentina as well. One of our important targets is
to promote the further internationalization of the sustainability dialog.

Local dialogs. We are also engaged in dialog with the stakeholders at
our locations. One example is our planned Testing and Technology Center
in Immendingen on the Danube, which will be built on the site of a former
military base. From the very start, we sought a dialog with the people in
the region and addressed their concerns. We also established the Daimler
Forum, where the residents of Immendingen can learn about the status

Periodic stakeholder survey. We conduct an open international online
stakeholder survey every two years. The survey allows all interested
parties to evaluate the relevance of various sustainability issues for our
company. The survey conducted in 2015 was participated in by more than
700 persons and organizations.
Feedback for our target program. The results of our stakeholder survey,
and the key results of the “Daimler Sustainability Dialogue,” form the
external point of view for our materiality analysis, which is used to formulate our target program. In this manner, we focus our efforts on initiatives
that both we and our stakeholders view as essential. Our aim is to translate the results of the dialog and exchange into verifiable targets and
initiatives that can be implemented in cooperation with our stakeholders.

Political dialog and representation of interests. Our principles for
political dialog and lobbying provide the basis for responsible and
ethical lobbying. This entails neutrality in dealings with political parties
and representatives of interest groups. Our discussions with political
decision-makers are designed to make our planning more secure and
enable us to contribute our ideas to the process of social change.

Our discussions focus on CO2 regulations, vehicle safety, new mobility
concepts or electric mobility. Other key issues include trade policy,
location-specific issues, education, and HR policy. We summarize our
company’s positions on environmental, economic, transportation, and
energy issues in an annual brochure that is targeted at the general
public.

Risk management
For us, risk management requires the early identification, assessment,
handling, and monitoring of risks. To this end we have established management and control systems, which are combined in a uniform Groupwide risk management system — also in keeping with the legal requirements. Our focus here is on environmental and industry risks, financial
risks, risks arising from warranties, and legal risks, as well as compliance
and reputation risks within and outside the company.
The Group Risk Management Committee (GRMC) defines and designs
the framework conditions for the Group-wide internal control and risk
management system and reviews the effectiveness of the established
processes. It also serves as a platform that ensures holistic risk analysis.
The responsibility for operational risk management lies in the divisions,
corporate functions, and legal entities. The respective responsible officers
have the task of identifying and evaluating risks that are relevant for
their unit, as well as for developing, implementing, and monitoring all
necessary measures. The risks are documented and sent to Group Risk
Management, which processes the information and reports on it to the
GRMC, the Board of Management, and the Supervisory Board.

Social

Target program

Other initiatives established in the context of risk management are
Compliance Risk Assessment, the integrity reviews of business partners,
environmental risk analyses at our production locations, and the consideration of consumer protection issues in our quality management system.
We also conduct risk analysis related to data protection and human
rights and systematically integrate environmental protection throughout
the entire life cycle of our vehicles.

responsibility and transparent reporting at all of our production facilities
around the world. More than 98 percent of our employees work at locations with environmental management systems certified according to
ISO 14001. In addition, we regularly conduct environmental due diligence
processes at our locations, and we are also working on a Group-wide risk
management system for human rights.

Ethical responsibility
We at Daimler are convinced that only companies that act with integrity will be successful
in the long run. As a globally operating company we take responsibility and strive to be a leader
in ethical corporate governance. That is why we’ve anchored integrity in our corporate
culture as a fundamental value.

A culture of integrity
Integrity is one of four corporate values that form the foundation
of our business activities. One of the key tasks of our sustainability
management is the promotion of ethical behavior.
With a view to advancing our culture of integrity, we have engaged in a
continuous dialog with our employees since 2011. Because integrity
cannot be imposed from above, regular discussions of integrity issues are
an integral part of our daily work. We regularly communicate integrityrelated topics in our internal media and also provide the company units
with an extensive amount of material on the intranet.
Our Integrity Code is one of the results of the employee dialog. It is
based on a mindset developed jointly with our employees, and defines the
principles for our business conduct in daily operations, such as fairness,
responsibility, mutual respect, transparency, openness, and the observance of laws and rights. The Code, which is valid throughout the Group,
is available in 23 languages. A guide providing answers to the most frequently asked questions offers practical support for specific situations in
our day-to-day business.
Since March 2015, the employees at our German locations have been
able to turn to a central contact and advice center for help. This
Infopoint team provides advice concerning integrity-related issues in daily
business, supports employees in other matters, and arranges appropriate
contacts.

Suppliers

Social

Target program

Innovative communication formats help our employees concern
themselves with integrity. For example, more than 55,000 employees
worldwide have taken part in our online game “Monster Mission” since
September 2014. The game invites employees to playfully address integrity-related issues related to their daily work and raises their awareness
of the basic principles of the Integrity Code. The game is accessible
to all employees via the intranet and the extranet.
Integrity Code (PDF)
Our extensive range of training offers is also based on the Integrity
Code. We base our integrated training program on an annual planning
cycle — from needs analysis and execution to the feedback and monitoring process. It encompasses, among other things, the following topics:
integrity, compliance, data protection, and antitrust law. We offer classroom instruction and web-based training courses, depending on the risk
and the target group.
Integrated training program (only available in German)
In addition to modular training documents, we provide our network of
trainers with materials for the methodical implementation of the content.
These materials include trainer guidelines and explanatory videos that
can be used for specific target groups according to the risk associated
with the participating functions.
Our internal training measures contribute to the permanent anchoring
of ethically and legally impeccable behavior in the company and help our
employees handle specific practical issues.

A web-based basic training course on integrity, compliance, and law
is made available to all employees on the intranet. Every new Daimler
employee has to complete this course when he or she is hired. The
course is part of the employees’ welcome package. In 2015, about 50,000
employees from various levels of the hierarchy participated in our training
program.
The Integrity Code also defines the expectations regarding our managers with regard to integrity. Because managers serve as role models
and bear a special responsibility, modules on integrity are included in all
our seminars for the qualification of new managers. In addition, integrity
and compliance are important criteria in the annual target agreements
and target achievements of our managers. Integrity expectations are also
part of the agreed-upon objectives for the remuneration of the Board of
Management.
The Advisory Board for Integrity and Corporate Responsibility is
staffed with independent external experts from business, the scientific
community, government, the media, and non-government organizations.
The Advisory Board regularly examines our activities, discusses current
topics with representatives of our company, and accompanies the integrity process at Daimler with a constructively critical approach.
We engage in a dialog with our stakeholders in order to promote public
discussions. For example, we held a symposium in 2015 about the legal
and ethical aspects of autonomous driving.

Human rights
Respect for human rights is one of Daimler’s top priorities. We
attach great importance to employee rights, fair working conditions,
and the rejection of all forms of discrimination, forced labor, and
child labor.
Our approach to upholding and respecting human rights is based on the
stipulations of the UN Global Compact and the UN Guiding Principles on
Business and Human Rights. In line with their requirement for corporate
human rights policies, we have specified operational responsibilities
and approaches for all of our employees and business partners. These
requirements are defined in our Integrity Code, the Supplier Sustainability
Standards, and our supplier agreements. The responsibility for human
rights issues belongs to the Board of Management division “Integrity and
Legal Affairs.”
All of our employees, in particular the security officers, attend training
courses on human rights issues. Employees and external informers can
use the facilities of the BPO (Business Practices Office) whistleblower
system to report suspected human rights violations and obtain “access
to remedy” as defined by the third pillar of the UN Guiding Principles on
Business and Human Rights.

these requirements are passed on to downstream suppliers of the
value chain.
In-depth due diligence reviews. At our production facilities, we conduct
a due diligence process in keeping with the UN guiding principles. This
process enables us to identify country-specific risks. Among other tools,
we use the Human Rights Compliance Assessment (HRCA) of the Danish
Institute for Human Rights for this purpose. We achieved our target of
conducting a total of 19 country analyses by the end of 2015. The following countries were analyzed: Argentina, Brazil, Canada, the Czech Republic, Egypt, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico,
Portugal, Romania, South Africa, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and
the United States.
No significant need to take action was discovered in the analyzed entities in which Daimler is the majority shareholder. The analyses merely
revealed that the human rights situation could be optimized at a few
locations. The necessary improvements were made with regard to special
financial benefits of the company (such as special payments during
maternity leave or benefits for socially disadvantaged groups), background checks for high-risk service providers or information gaps regarding awareness of integrity-promoting instruments. Consequently, our
regulations extend beyond the locally applicable legal requirements in
all the countries examined. Based on our above mentioned assessments,
Daimler did not have any suspected cases of child labor or forced labor or
violations against the right to collective bargaining or freedom of association in 2015. Indigenous peoples are not affected by the activities at our
production locations.

We investigated the accusation made in 2014 by six former employees
of our production plant in Portland, Oregon in the United States. At the
beginning of 2015, Daimler Trucks North America reached a settlement
with the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries concerning a severance
agreement. The settlement contains additional compliance measures
to ensure that working conditions at the plant prevent harassment and
discrimination.
The Daimler Human Rights Respect System will replace the Human
Rights Compliance Assessment in early 2016. It primarily encompasses
the following four process steps:
1.		 The identification of potential human rights risks.
2.		 The initiation and management of countermeasures.
3.		 The use of a monitoring system that focuses especially on high-risk
units.
4.		 Regular reports about critical issues. Although these reports will be
for internal use, they will also fulfill external reporting requirements.
Because the concept is completely new, it was, and will continue to be,
developed in a cross-functional process and key issues are discussed with
external stakeholders.

Our Supplier Sustainability Standards and our contract terms contain
stipulations in which we call on our direct suppliers to respect human
rights. We examine the observance of sustainability standards by our
suppliers in a multi-stage process and on the basis of a risk analysis that
we carry out for each country and category of goods. The complaints
management process that is conducted via the World Employee Committee enables whistleblowers to reveal possible human rights violations
by suppliers. However, on the complex chain of subcontractors we only
have indirect influence. We therefore use communication and training
measures to promote the transfer of our standards to suppliers in downstream stages of the value chain.

Compliance
Daimler acts in accordance with ethical principles and complies
with all relevant laws, voluntary commitments, and internal regulations — we do this as a matter of course. Our top priority is to
comply with all anti-corruption legislation, as well as to protect and
promote fair competition as stipulated by our Integrity Code.
Our Compliance Management System (CMS) is based on national and
international standards and supports our measures for ensuring compliant behavior in our daily business. We review the effectiveness of the
system on a continuous basis and adapt it in line with worldwide developments, changed risks, and new legal requirements. We thus continuously
improve its efficiency and effectiveness.
Our Anti-Money Laundering Policy for the trade with goods was put in
place to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. It lays
the foundation for Group-wide compliance with the respective national
legislation. The Chief Compliance Officer serves as the anti-money laundering officer of Daimler AG. A center of competence supports this officer
in the management and coordination of money laundering prevention
measures in the goods trade.

Consistent compliance with sanction lists. Daimler takes appropriate
measures to ensure that the legal sanctions specified by legislators are
observed. With a view to effective and efficient implementation, we have
introduced a worldwide system-based standard process.
Systematic minimization of compliance risks. Every year, we systematically analyze and evaluate the compliance risks of our business units.
The results of this analysis are the basis of our risk controlling. A key
focus of our risk-minimization measures is on sales companies in highrisk countries. The responsibility for implementing these measures and
the supervisory duty lie with the managers of the respective company,
who work closely together with the Group Compliance unit.
Effective compliance structures. Our compliance organization is
divisionally oriented, because this enables us to effectively support and
advise the divisions. A divisional or regional compliance officer is available to perform these tasks. Moreover, local compliance partners around
the world ensure that our standards are observed. The divisional and regional compliance officers report directly to the Chief Compliance Officer.
This safeguards the compliance officers’ independence from the business
divisions. The Chief Compliance Officer, in turn, reports directly to the
Board of Management member who is responsible for Integrity and Legal
Affairs as well as to the Chairman of the Supervisory Board.

Our whistleblower system BPO (Business Practices Office) enables
Daimler employees and external whistleblowers to report irregular
conduct worldwide. The BPO accepts such reports around the clock, as
well as anonymously to the extent permitted under local law. It draws our
attention to potential risks and specific violations, enabling us to avert
damage from our company. Our globally applicable corporate policy
ensures investigations are fair and sensitive, takes into consideration
the principle of proportionality, and protects whistleblowers as well as
the affected parties. In Germany, reports can also be sent to the BPO
via a “neutral intermediary.” This intermediary is an independent attorney,
who is obligated to maintain strict confidentiality by the oath of professional secrecy. There were a total of 110 BPO cases during the reporting
year. Of the 60 cases that were closed “with merit,” one was categorized
as “bribery.” We responded to these cases with appropriate measures.

We provide specific qualification training, which supports the Compliance
staff in dealing with the frequently changing legal and regulatory situation. In addition, all new Compliance employees receive comprehensive
introductory training in a practical Compliance seminar.

Daimler has a Group-wide Antitrust Compliance Program that is oriented
to national and international standards. The program establishes a binding, globally valid Daimler standard that defines the approach to be taken
in the assessment of issues related to competition law. Our standards are
as strict as those of the European antitrust authorities and courts, and
thus ensure a consistent level of compliance and advice in all countries.

Sharing experiences about compliance in practice. In cooperation
with the Daimler Compliance Academy, we have designed an annual
practice-oriented seminar that provides a platform for discussing compliance trends and challenges. The seminar, which was held in 2015 for the
second time, is targeted at compliance professionals from all industries.
Practice-oriented compliance seminar (only available in German)

We ensure fair competition and comply with the laws (especially
the antitrust laws) that protect and promote competition.

As part of our integrated training program, we offer web-based training
and classroom training sessions on antitrust law to our managers and

Data protection
Daimler maintains high data protection standards worldwide. Our
Data Protection Policy meets the requirements of the European
Union’s Data Protection Directive and establishes clear data protection principles for all companies of the Daimler Group.
The Chief Officer Corporate Data Protection works to ensure compliance with the applicable data protection laws and internal standards
in the Daimler Group. He is assisted in this work by local data protection
coordinators. He provides advice, initiates communication and training
measures, and monitors compliance with the data protection laws and
Daimler’s Data Protection Policy. His tasks also include complaints
management and the fulfillment of reporting requirements whenever
data protection regulations are violated.
Incidents in 2015. In the reporting year, there were no significant
data protection violations and no fines were imposed. The number of
complaints received by Corporate Data Protection increased compared
with the previous year. In two cases, supervisory authorities conducted
investigations in response to customer complaints.
Training program for data protection awareness. As part of our
integrated training program, we offer comprehensive data protection
measures to inform and train our managers and employees. These
measures are continually optimized and updated. In 2015, we developed
a new web-based course for training employees worldwide. More focal
topics will be added in 2016.

Target program

Effective data protection in vehicles. One of the major automotive industry trends is connectivity, the connection of vehicles with the Internet.
Together with increasingly sophisticated assistance systems that enable
highly automated driving, connectivity creates new challenges for data
protection and information security.
Vehicle connectivity requires more data protection than does a smartphone. We also want to justify the customers’ trust in the security of our
vehicle technology when it comes to connectivity. Among other things,
this requires data processes to be transparent for customers. That is why
we are working on multi-manufacturer projects that aim to make data
processing transparent and offer customers options to choose from.
In 2014, we helped draw up the Consumer Privacy Protection Principles
for Vehicle Technologies and Services of the US automaker associations
as well as the data protection principles for connected vehicles of the
German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which particularly
take European regulations into account. During the reporting year, we
began to determine which steps have to be taken for the complete implementation of these principles.
In 2015, the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA)
presented principles for the handling of person-related data in connected vehicles and services. We were also involved in drawing up these
principles.

The new E 220 d enables economical low-emission driving at a previously unattained level. A completely newly developed diesel engine, a lightweight design,
and sophisticated aerodynamics together ensure the highest degree of efficiency.
As a result, the new E 220 d consumes up to 13 percent less fuel than the predecessor model and boasts impressively low emission values in normal driving
operations as well.
The new E 220 d has nothing to fear from a critical examination of its emission values
— not even within the framework of the soon to be launched “Real Driving Emissions”
testing system. It was clear to Mercedes-Benz from the very beginning of development
operations that the new business saloon should convincingly combine maximum fuel
efficiency with minimal emissions — not just on a test rig but also, and more importantly, on the road.
Daimler incorporated a large number of technological innovations into the E 220 d in
order to achieve this ambitious goal. In particular, we focused on the powertrain, the
energy management system, aerodynamics, and lightweight engineering. The result is
up to 13 percent lower fuel consumption and significantly lower emissions. The model’s
comprehensive recycling concept and its higher share of quality recyclates and renewable raw materials also result in significantly better overall environmental performance.
A new engine generation. The new E-Class is offered at market launch in two powerful yet efficient drive system variants based on the same platform: the E 200 with a
four-cylinder gasoline engine and the E 220 d with a four-cylinder diesel unit. The diesel
engine with the designation OM 654 marks the launch of an all-new, highly efficient
engine family. The engine, which is designed to meet the stringent requirements associated with the future “Real Driving Emissions” regulations, delivers unprecedented
performance in terms of emissions and fuel efficiency. The cylinder head and crankcase
in the OM 654 are made of aluminum, while the NANOSLIDE® cylinder wall coating
developed by Daimler reduces friction between the steel pistons and the cylinder wall.

28

The all-new Mercedes-Benz stepped recess combustion process is being used for the
first time in the OM 654. The process is based on a new type of graduated bowl geometry for passenger car engines. The special alignment of the bowl shape, air flow, and
fuel injection nozzles ensures excellent exploitation of air in the engine and thus faster
combustion and higher efficiency with extremely low particulate emissions.
In combination with the new 9G-TRONIC nine-speed automatic transmission, the new
diesel engine in the E 220 d offers average NEDC fuel consumption of just 4.3 to 3.9
l/100 km, depending on the tires the vehicle is equipped with. That corresponds to
CO2 emissions of between 112 grams and 102 grams per kilometer — a value that only
a few much smaller models have been able to achieve until now. Fuel consumption
in the predecessor model (at the time of the market phase-out) ranged from 4.6 to 4.5
l/100 km.

Effective exhaust gas treatment. A multiple exhaust gas recirculation unit additionally reduces in-engine nitrogen oxide emissions produced during combustion. The unit
has a combined high and low pressure system, both of which are cooled. The entire unit
is mounted near the engine and consists of an oxidation catalytic converter, a dosing
and mixing device for AdBlue, and a combined diesel particulate filter with SCR (selective catalytic reduction) coating. Unlike previously used systems, the diesel particulate
filter and the SCR unit are not separated from one another but instead are installed in
the same compartment. Along with lowering the weight of the exhaust gas treatment
system, this compact design also reduces the amount of space needed for the engine.
In addition, it helps ensure that the particulate filter heats up rapidly and the oxidation
catalytic converter engages quickly.
Sophisticated aerodynamics. The outstanding aerodynamics of the E 220 d also make
a significant contribution to the model’s fuel efficiency. With a drag coefficient of 0.23,
the new E-Class models set new standards in this regard. A large number of details
were optimized and new ideas were implemented in order to achieve top values in wind
tunnel tests. For example, most model variants are available with the AIRPANEL radiator shutter system, which opens and shuts the radiator grille depending on the cooling
requirements.
Outstanding environmental performance. In addition to offering the highest levels
of safety, agility, and comfort, the new E 220 d boasts above-average environmental
compatibility and efficiency. The model’s substantially lower fuel consumption and
reduced emissions are supplemented by a high level of overall resource efficiency. This
is made possible by a comprehensive recycling concept and the use of a higher share
of recyclates and renewable raw materials. The new E-Class diesel model thus boasts
outstanding environmental performance. Upcoming variants such as the E 350 e
have the potential to improve this performance even further. For example, the E-Class
PLUG-IN HYBRID will also enable all-electric and thus locally emission-free driving.

For us, product responsibility requires a combination of three
things: the greatest possible customer benefit, the highest safety
standards, and maximum eco-friendliness. To achieve this goal, we
depend on environmentally sound product development and innovative concepts. This extends from trailblazing vehicle and powertrain technologies to intelligent lightweight construction, the use
of natural materials, the remanufacturing of components, and the
application of sophisticated assistance systems that can prevent
accidents.
In the area of environmental compatibility we observe the Daimler
Environmental and Energy Guidelines. The second guideline is as follows:
We develop products that are particularly environmentally friendly and
energy-efficient in their market segments, and are therefore the leaders
in these segments. Therefore, our mission is to fulfill demanding environmental standards and deal sparingly with natural resources. Our measures for environmentally compatible and energy-efficient product design
take into account the entire product life cycle — spanning development,
production, and product use, as well as disposal and recycling.

Our DfE experts are involved in all stages of vehicle development as a
cross-divisional team. In addition, we systematically integrate environmentally compatible product design into our environment and quality
management systems according to ISO 14001 and ISO 9001. Since 2012,
Mercedes-Benz has been in full compliance with the relevant ISO 14006
standard.
Mercedes-Benz models with environmental certificates.
Mercedes-Benz has been certified according to ISO TR 14062, the
standard for environmentally oriented product development, since 2005.
Certificates issued by the TÜV SÜD inspection agency confirm that a
vehicle has been developed according to the requirements of the ISO
standard. Before such a certificate is issued, inspectors closely analyze
and assess all environmentally relevant processes — from development
and production to use and recycling. Several Mercedes-Benz models have
been awarded the environmental certificate in their second generation.
The environmental certificates of the Mercedes-Benz models
Comprehensive life cycle assessment. Evaluating the environmental
compatibility of a vehicle requires an analysis of the emissions and
use of resources throughout the entire life cycle. The is done by means
of an ecological assessment, which examines all environmental effects,
from the extraction of raw materials and vehicle production to product
use and recycling. At Mercedes-Benz Development, we use life-cycle
assessments to evaluate and compare different vehicles, components,
and technologies.

A vehicle’s environmental impact is largely decided in the first stages
of development. By integrating environmentally responsible product
development (Design for Environment, DfE) at an early stage of the development process, it is possible to minimize the impact on the environment
more efficiently. That is why continuous improvements in environmental
compatibility are a major requirement in the creation of the product performance specifications.

mix that is tailored to the market requirements. The main focal points of
our development of particularly fuel-efficient, and environmentally compatible powertrain technologies in all our automotive divisions are defined
in our initiative “The path to emission-free mobility”:
–		 Further development of our vehicles with state-of-the-art combustion
engines with the target of achieving significant reductions in consumption and emissions.
–		 Further efficiency increase through hybridization.
–		 Electric vehicles with battery and fuel cell drive.

Charging stations for electric vehicles. In order to push the establishment of a charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, we are taking part
in various initiatives together with other manufacturers and suppliers,
research facilities, energy providers, and government. These initiatives
include the state-funded charge@work project organized as part of the
“Showcase Electromobility Baden-Württemberg” campaign. In addition,
as part of the initiative Quick Charging for Corridors and Metropolitan
Areas (SLAM), we are working together with partners from industry and
research to examine business models for the operation of quick-charging
stations in metropolitan areas and along the connecting traffic corridors.
Electric vehicles with fuel cell drive are also suitable for long driving
distances due to their great range and quick refueling. However, due to a
lack of hydrogen filling stations, such vehicles remain largely unattractive
to customers. That is why Daimler is promoting the development of a
comprehensive hydrogen infrastructure jointly with partners from politics
and the energy sector.

Fuel consumption and
CO2 emissions
The largest share of primary energy consumption and CO2 emissions over
the life cycle of a vehicle is attributable to the usage phase. In the case
of a car with a combustion engine it is about 80 percent. The remaining
20 percent is consumed almost entirely during the manufacturing process. Vehicles with alternative drive systems have lower CO2 emissions
during the usage phase. However, the primary energy consumption
of these vehicles generally increases during production because of the
energy needed to manufacture certain components such as batteries,
electric motors, and electronic control systems.

Fleet values in the US. In the US, fleet values are regulated by two
co-regulating standards for the reduction of greenhouse gases in vehicle
fleets: the Greenhouse Gas Standards (GHG) and the Corporate Average
Fuel Economy Standards (CAFE). Separate target values are set for cars
and light trucks for each manufacturer. If a manufacturer does not meet
the GHG standards, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) identifies
the vehicles from the manufacturer’s fleet to which the overrun of the
limit is attributable. A penalty payment is then imposed on all affected
models.

Fleet values in China. In China, domestically produced and imported
cars are assessed differently. A differentiation is also made between sixteen weight classes. The fleet fuel economy target relative to the weight
of Daimler’s “domestic” fleet was 9.3 liters/100 km, and the actual value
achieved in 2015 was 7.5 liters/100 km. The target for imported vehicles
was 9.6 liters/100 km, and 8.3 liters/100 km was achieved. We have
set ourselves the target of reducing the fleet consumption of our cars in
China by 25 percent in the period from 2012 (the base year of the current
fuel economy regulations) to 2019. Our achievements thus far have put
us on the right track.

Consistent lightweight design. The innovative aluminum hybrid body
of the new GLC is about 50 kilograms lighter than a traditional body made
of steel. This pays off: The lightweight body and other measures in the
GLC 220 d 4MATIC contribute to a reduction in fuel consumption of up to
20 percent as compared to the predecessor model (market phase-out).

The A-Class is now even more efficient and cleaner than before. The 2015
model upgrade included the conversion of all models into Euro 6-compliant vehicles. Technical improvements such as turbocharging, the Camtronic system, multi-spark injection, and the ECO start/stop system have
lowered CO2 emissions from 98 g/km to 89 g/km. This led to a higher
ranking for the A-Class in the VCD list of environmentally friendly cars for
2015/2016. The A 160 CDI and A 180 CDI are now among the 10 percent
of all vehicles that received top marks in the ranking.

Declining CO2 emissions for our vans. An EU directive on the emissions of vans with a total weight of up to 2,585 kilograms entered into
force in 2011. The regulation stipulates that beginning in 2017, the average emissions of such vans may not exceed 175 g CO2/km. As of 2020,
the CO2 level will drop to 147 g CO2/km. Taking into account vehicle
weight, Mercedes-Benz vans must comply with a maximum CO2 fleet level
of 210 g CO2/km in 2017. However, our vans were already lower than that
level in 2014. We aim to achieve a further reduction of more than 10 percent by 2018. During the reporting year, the fleet value was 3.5 percent
lower than in 2014.

We use cutting-edge technologies to further reduce the pollutant emissions of our cars and commercial vehicles. Our target is to fulfill future
emission requirements in advance as much as possible. For example,
our direct-injection engines are below the stringent particulate matter
limit of the second Euro 6 stage, which won’t go into effect until 2017
and reduces the number of particulates by another 90 percent compared
to the first stage. All diesel-powered vehicles and 50 of 69 gasolinepowered direct-injection Mercedes-Benz Euro 6 models were already in
compliance with the tightened limit of 6 x 1011 particles in mid-2015.

Noise
We have significantly reduced the noise emissions of our passenger cars,
trucks, and buses in recent years through a series of improvements. Our
main concern at present is to find satisfactory solutions for the conflicting
objectives we repeatedly face in the area of noise reduction. Especially
in commercial vehicles there are technical areas in which reducing noise
and lowering fuel consumption are at odds. Thus, for example, an encapsulation of the powertrain dampens the engine noise. At the same time,
however, it requires a stronger cooling system, which raises the fuel consumption. The additional fuel consumption can be countered with higher
injection pressures, which in turn lead to harsher combustion noise.

One of our key obligations is to ensure the safety of our customers and
all other road users. Mercedes-Benz experts have been conducting inhouse accident research on critical traffic situations and real accidents

The production of vehicles naturally requires great quantities of materials.
Therefore, one of the focal points of our development tasks is to keep
the requirement for natural resources as low as possible. In particular,
we strive to limit the use of raw materials that are only available in limited
quantities and are frequently associated with a great ecological burden,
in the early stages of development. In addition to the economical use of
resources, the reconditioning of components and the recycling of used
materials play an important role.

Less weight, more recyclates, more natural materials. Our target is
to make our vehicles lighter while continuing to reduce the environmental effects of materials used in their production. For this, we are using
new lightweight materials and components, on the one hand. On the
other hand, we are increasingly using renewable materials and recycling
materials.
Intelligent lightweight construction can further reduce vehicle weight
without sacrificing safety and comfort. In this context, the selection of
materials as well as the component design and manufacturing technology
also play an important role — not every material is suitable for every component. At 35 percent, the vehicle body accounts for the biggest share
of total vehicle weight, followed by the chassis at 25 percent, the comfort
and safety equipment at 20 percent, and the engine and transmission
at 20 percent. Thus the most effective approach is to focus on the vehicle
body.

Renewable raw materials. Renewable materials offer many advantages:
–		 In contrast to fiberglass, the use of natural fibers generally leads to
		 a reduction of a component’s weight due to their lower density.
–		 They can be processed with conventional technologies.
–		 The resulting products are generally easily recyclable.
–		 In energy recovery their CO2 effect is almost neutral, because only
as much CO2 is released as was absorbed by the plant during its
growth.
–		 They contribute to the reduced consumption of finite fossil
resources.

Hybrid versus conventional: Environmental check. Vehicles with hybrid and electric drives contain very many valuable resources. This pays
off if you look at things in terms of the entire life cycle. For example, the
new C 350 e requires the use of more resources in the manufacturing
phase than does the C 250, but it also uses disproportionately fewer raw
materials in the particularly critical usage phase.
	360-degree environmental check for the C 350 e
Consistently high recyclability. During vehicle development we also
prepare a recycling concept, in which all components and materials are
examined with a view to their suitability for the various stages of the
recycling process. As a result, all Mercedes-Benz models are 85 percent
recyclable and 95 percent recoverable. The key aspects of our activities
in this area are:
–		 The resale of tested and certified used parts through the
		 Mercedes-Benz Used Parts Center (GTC)
–		 The remanufacturing of used parts
–		 The workshop waste disposal system MeRSy (Mercedes-Benz
		 Recycling System).

Removal of workshop waste with MeRSy. Our MeRSy Recycling Management System for disposing workshop waste helps to collect and recycle or professionally dispose of waste material created during the maintenance or repair of our vehicles. In 2015, a total of 30,085 tons of old
parts and materials were collected and recycled and around 1,207 tons of
coolant and 778 tons of brake fluid were reconditioned.
Making resource efficiency measurable. For years now, the global
economy has been growing — and with it the burden on the environment
and the consumption of resources. Achieving more with less is therefore
the order of the day for sustainable development. We have conducted
several studies that address issues related to resource efficiency. Our
focus here is on the development of procedures for calculating resource
efficiency.
Focus on resource conservation in the “Daimler Sustainability
Dialogue” 2015. What types of indicators should be used to measure
resource availability and efficiency if such indicators are to be both scientifically consistent and suitable for practical application? These and other
questions related to resource conservation were addressed in a workshop
during the “Daimler Sustainability Dialogue” in 2015. The dialog event is
held annually with representatives of government, business, the scientific
community, non-governmental organizations, associations, and trade
unions.

Mobility concepts and services
Transport infrastructure and transport systems frequently operate at
their limits, especially in urban areas. That is why Daimler has developed
a range of pioneering mobility concepts — from the car sharing provider
car2go and the mobility platform moovel to the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
system.

A culture of customer orientation. We sell our products and services
in nearly all countries of the world. In order to be successful, we need to
be able to address in detail the specific wishes of our customers in every
market. To this end, we have been organizationally reinforcing our corporate structures and aligning them with our five business divisions even
more strongly in recent years. The corporate departments have also been
better aligned with the market requirements of the business divisions. For
us, customer dedication is not a purely organizational measure but one
with which we associate the goal of ensuring a comprehensive culture of
customer orientation at all units throughout our entire company.
Improving customer satisfaction. Our business units have established
quality management systems for the continuous monitoring and improvement of customer satisfaction. The goal of our program “CSI No. 1 —
Delightful Customer Care” is to make Daimler Number 1 in the world for
customer service. Country-specific CSI action plans are agreed upon and
implemented on the basis of international benchmark studies, internal
data surveys, and customer surveys.
Processes and behavior patterns at all sales stages and at all hierarchical
levels are continuously enhanced to ensure maximum customer orientation. The measures include process improvements, training courses, and
dealer consulting and coaching, as well as the incorporation of key figures
relevant for customer satisfaction into the monetary control instruments
for sales and service.

Target program

Mercedes-Benz Cars has been at the top of many rankings for years.
Customer satisfaction at Mercedes-Benz Trucks has also been significantly improved since the introduction of CSI No. 1 in 2012. In 2015, we
expanded the CSI program to 11 markets.
“Mercedes Benz 2020 — Best Customer Experience” is the name of
the growth strategy we derived from the organizational realignment of
passenger car sales and marketing operations. The strategy encompasses
numerous new approaches for sales, aftersales, and financial services.
We strive to offer our customers a consistent premium brand experience
across all points of contact. To this end, we employ a holistic approach.
Our strategy focuses on the following:
–		 Brand openings and personal contact with customers
–		 Digitization of all channels
–		 New differentiated sales formats and HR profiles for dealerships
–		 Personalized customer management across all channels
We reach out to customers where they live and work, and we give them
the opportunity to contact us anytime and anywhere. Our focus is on
creating a seamless customer journey. We also offer our customers and
anyone interested in the brand customized support and service solutions
tailored to their individual needs — throughout the entire life cycle of
their vehicle. In terms of vehicle connectivity systems as well, our focus
is always clearly on the customer.
Customer feedback on vehicle quality. The Mercedes-Benz brand has
always stood for technical innovation and high quality. In order to safeguard exactly this type of quality over the long term, we use our Internal
Vehicle Quality Study (German abbreviation: IFQS) to analyze feedback on
the quality of Mercedes-Benz vehicles from our company car users and
customers who obtained their vehicles via the Employee Sales system.

>40,000
company car drivers and Employee Sales customers use the
online questionnaire of the Internal Vehicle Quality Study (IFQS)
each year to provide feedback on vehicle quality.

The goal of IFQS is to identify recurring defects and areas in need of
improvement at an early stage and to determine whether the measures
we take have a noticeable positive effect on the customer experience.
Every year, we receive reports on quality deficiencies via the IFQS online
questionnaire from more than 40,000 company car drivers and Employee
Sales customers in Germany, the United States, China, and South Africa.
Some 900 staff members from development, quality, and aftersales units
use this data to continually optimize and refine our products. Thanks to
IFQS, over 370 causes of problems were analyzed in the years 2014 and
2015 — in many cases by directly examining the vehicles about which
complaints were made. In the same year, measures related to more than
330 IFQS issues were introduced in ongoing series production operations
and changes were defined for successor model series with regard to approximately 400 issues.
Divisional key account system. In the course of the increased alignment of our corporate organization with the business divisions we have
introduced a divisional key account system at Daimler Financial Services,
which enables us to offer financial services that are tailored to an even
greater extent to our customers’ needs.

Target program

Customer service at the divisions. Those who buy our vehicles also
wish to receive great service during the period of use. For example,
they want to have close contact with the customer service department,
individual advice, effective processing of warranty and damage claims,
first-rate maintenance, and optimum parts supply. Quick and targeted
assistance is ensured by customer centers and service support points,
which address customer concerns around the clock.
–		 The Mercedes Benz Customer Assistance Center (CAC) in Maastricht is the central point of contact for customer concerns and
complaints regarding sales, service, and technology issues in Western Europe. We also maintain local assistance centers in other core
markets. At the CAC in Maastricht, approximately 600 employees ensure that customers are assisted around the clock. One of the CAC’s
key tasks is to coordinate Mercedes-Benz Service 24h, which also
includes the organization of breakdown assistance. When necessary,
the center also tells customers how repairs or processes are coming
along. This is an especially important benefit for commercial customers. The service activities at the CAC extend beyond the repair and
service center business and include service contracts, warranty extensions, and motor insurance.
–		 600 service outlets for bus customers in Europe are operated by
OMNIplus, which is a brand of Daimler’s EvoBus subsidiary. In addition to operating a professional parts supply system, the comprehensive network of outlets offers bus customers service deals and contracts, driver and repair shop training programs, pre-owned vehicles,
and customized financial services. In 2012, OMNIplus introduced a
customer complaint management (CCM) system, which combines all
of the customer service department’s complaint processing channels
into a single unit that also enables the company to evaluate the complaints that customers make.

provide their customers with a closely knit service network that
encompasses more than 800 dealerships, distributors, and service
and repair centers in the United States and Canada. Quick parts
delivery is ensured by DTNA’s comprehensive distribution network,
which stocks more than 200,000 categories of spare parts at seven
locations. The network also serves customers of DTNA’s Thomas
Built Buses (TBB) subsidiary. In order to further improve customer
satisfaction, DTNA has also introduced a new Initial Buyer Tracking
Survey system that generates customer feedback for specific vehicle
systems.

Information and advertising — with respect. All our advertising, sales
promotion, and sponsorship campaigns are subject to an in-house audit
procedure to ensure that they are in compliance with the applicable laws
and Daimler’s standards and codes of conduct. We also observe industry
principles such as the European advertising sector’s Code of Ethics. As a
matter of principle we avoid the use of violent, discriminatory, sexual, or
religious elements in our advertising. Respect for foreign cultural norms
and religious beliefs is a particularly important concern in our international campaigns. Sustainability issues are increasingly taken into account
in brand and product communications. For example, Mercedes-Benz’s
efficiency programs include a range of innovative technologies for drive
systems, aerodynamics, and lightweight design that enable a marked
reduction of fuel consumption and emissions. We are also increasingly
highlighting the topic of sustainable mobility at motor shows. For example, in 2015 we expanded our fleet of plug-in hybrid vehicles to include
three new models, which we presented at the motor shows in Frankfurt
am Main, Germany, and Geneva, Switzerland. The Concept IAA and Vision
Tokyo research vehicles that we presented also feature technologies that
set new standards for aerodynamics and efficiency and point the way to
standard technologies of the future.

Daimler has established systematic safeguards for consumer protection.
All of our products are subject to top quality and safety requirements
throughout their entire life cycle. Our quality management systems in
particular play an important role in this context. In addition, requirements
for the avoidance of product flaws are defined in the product safety policy
of Daimler AG. Compliance with these requirements is monitored through
periodic audits.
Daimler is obligated to instruct users of our products about their use and
possible risks associated with it, to warn against dangers, and to label
our products. These requirements are also described in our product
safety policy. In the context of our product responsibility we also fulfill the
requirements of the REACH and CLP chemical regulations in Europe.
We abstain from publishing a report of possible violations. Due to the
absence of any legal obligations or industry-wide standards, we believe
this would not ensure comparability with our competitors.
Product information for our customers. Our service booklets and operating instructions tell customers how to save fuel and use their vehicles in
a safe and responsible manner. We provide additional information online.
For example, the Mercedes-Benz website provides interactive owner’s
manuals and detailed service information. The Mercedes-Benz Service
app, which includes numerous features for mobile use, can also be downloaded from the website. The Guideline for Rescue Services is also available online with instructions for the quick rescue of accident victims from
Mercedes-Benz vehicles.

Transparent financial services. We attach great importance to ensuring
extensive transparency and top quality in all areas of our financial services business — from investment counseling to loan approval and leasing
agreements for vehicle purchases. It goes without saying that we conduct
our activities on the basis of the legal consumer protection requirements.
As a member of the Bankers’ Trade Association we have signed a code of
conduct, which defines our high standards for the granting of installment
credits and credit lines. We guarantee that all the relevant information
about credit and loan agreements will be fully available before the contract closing and will be explained by us upon request. We handle customer data with extreme sensitivity and care.
Data protection and networked mobility. The increasing trend toward
Internet connectivity in vehicles is presenting us with new data protection challenges. We not only need to protect vehicle electronic systems
from possible hacker attacks; we also need to ensure the security of personal data. Our top priority here is ensuring that customers can decide
for themselves how their data will be used. Our customers, for example,
are able to decide which types of data may be forwarded. They can do
this by issuing their consent, signing a contract or pushing a button. It’s
important that every customer knows which data is collected for which
purpose and when — and we provide our customers with comprehensive
information about this process. We also protect our customers’ data from
being manipulated or misused. To this end, we continually refine our data
protection measures in line with the latest developments in information
technology.

Targeted control. In order to eliminate or reduce environmental risks in
advance, we regularly audit our locations in accordance with globally uniform standards. Suppliers must observe our sustainability requirements
and are expected to operate with an environmental management system
that is certified according to ISO 14001, EMAS or other comparable
standards. In addition, Mercedes-Benz specifications define requirements
for the environmental compatibility of our component deliveries. Furthermore, the Mercedes-Benz contract terms contain requirements concerning materials selection, banned substances, and recycling, as well as
compliance with environmental legislation.
Strict environmental risk analysis. Our environmental risk analysis
system encompasses all processes of relevance to the environment:
emissions into the atmosphere and wastewater, waste management,
hand­ling of hazardous materials, and damage to the soil and groundwater.
A team of auditors visits all Daimler locations at fixed intervals — including the locations we operate as a majority shareholder with partners. The
auditors conduct interviews and plant tours. The findings are documented
in reports to the heads of the production locations and summarized in
“Summary Reports” for top management. In addition, the analysis process facilitates the sharing of best practices that flow into the Daimler
standards, which are valid worldwide.

Targets achieved. In the sum of all divisions, we achieved our target of
reducing production-related CO2 emissions per vehicle by 20 percent
Group-wide by the year 2015 as compared to 2007. For the European
plants we set an additional target of reducing absolute CO2 emissions
by 20 percent relative to the 1992-1994 reference period. We have also
made good overall progress toward achieving this target in recent years,
but due to the production increase in 2015 we have sightly deviated from
the set target.

Reduced CO2 emissions. We want to further reduce CO2 emissions in
the years ahead with the help of new energy-saving production methods,
even more efficient processes, and the use of renewable and low-carbon
fuels. One of our targets is to reduce the specific energy consumption at
Mercedes-Benz Cars by 25 percent between 2015 and 2022.
As a result of the above-mentioned measures, energy consumption increased by only 0.8 percent in 2015 and CO2 emissions even fell by 1.2
percent, despite markedly increased production volumes. The latter effect
is also partly due to the sale of Atlantis Foundries. The total emissions depicted in Chart 28 and Chart 30 result from the combustion of fossil fuels
and purchases of electricity and district heating from third-party energy
producers.

Climate-friendly energy supply. For the heating of our plants we use
low-carbon natural gas and, where available, district heating. Many
locations make use of highly efficient cogeneration facilities, which are
operated by Daimler or by a regional provider. The expansion of combined
heat and power (CHP) units is an important pillar of our eco-friendly
energy supply system. Since 2011 we have set up 35 CHP modules with

Approaches to saving energy. Our energy projects at all locations are
operated on the basis of exact record-keeping through a dense network
of automatic electricity meters. In line with this, we design our energysaving measures in accordance with four points:
1.		 To avoid unnecessary use of energy during production breaks, we
use intelligent switch-off and standby controls.
2.		 Furthermore, we are reducing the energy waste caused by compressed air leaks, heat losses, and excessive process requirements
(e.g. temperature specifications). In these areas, we exploit the
reduction potential of the production processes themselves and of
the building infrastructure.
3.		 We achieve the most significant efficiency increases by replacing
old production facilities with state-of-the-art plant technology and
new building construction.
4.		 Moreover, we are raising our employees’ and managers’ awareness
of energy conservation issues with the help of events and communication measures. In addition, energy-saving suggestions are
rewarded within the scope of the company suggestions system.
Fuel cell with fourfold benefits. The AMG plant in Affalterbach is using
an innovative fuel cell facility to supply its new logistics center with

Air purification
Solvents (volatile organic compounds or VOCs) in particular are released
during vehicle production. In addition, sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOX), and particulates are also emitted into the
atmosphere. Substances that damage the ozone layer are only emitted
in tiny residual amounts. Through the introduction of largely solvent-free
paint systems, we have already achieved a drastic reduction of solvent
emissions; Mercedes-Benz Cars, in particular, is the benchmark here in
comparison with its competitors. We are also unlocking further reduction
potential through the use of new technologies, primarily in the painting
of commercial vehicles and major components.

A new kind of air purification process. At the Gaggenau plant, a new
process enables the dry deposition of fine paint droplets (overspray) to
purify the air inside the paint booths. As a result, the plant emits around
160 tons less CO2 than was previously the case and has to dispose of
nine tons less paint sludge as hazardous waste.

The recycling and reuse of raw materials, indirect materials, and supplies
in our plants has been a self-evident activity for years now. We currently
achieve a waste recovery rate of 91 percent. Our cutting-edge technical
processes and environmentally sound production planning additionally
enable us to avoid waste from the very start. With a view to meeting our
special responsibility as a waste producer, we regularly audit the waste
disposal operators of our production plants in accordance with an established process. None of our waste is exported to other countries.

At our car plants, we aim to reduce water consumption by 15 percent by
2022. The introduction of a new painting process is expected to make the
biggest contribution to this reduction.

The incoming and outgoing delivery traffic in our plants as well as the
distances our employees travel for work and business also affect our
environmental performance through emissions, noise, and resource use.
We minimize the environmental effects of these transports through the
use of an efficient logistics system and of rail transportation and inland
shipping. We replace business travel with conference calls, video conferences or online conferences wherever possible and expedient. Employees

Optimization of transport logistics. Our global transport logistics operations currently serve 75 manufacturing plants in around 30 countries
and about 8,500 retailers in almost all areas of the world. We transported
around 2.8 million vehicles worldwide in 2015. In the first half of 2015
alone, we also transported almost 3.8 million tons of production materials in Europe. The global transport volume amounted to around 330,000
standard containers of sea freight and about 66,000 tons of air freight.
In order to reduce the associated CO2 emissions, we are working hard to
optimize the logistics network. Our main target here is to optimally connect the transportation hubs with one another so that the distances can
be reduced and capacity can be better utilized. Innovative transportation
concepts and new transport systems also play a major role here.

We select logistics concepts on the basis of not only their costs, duration,
and transport quality, but also their CO2 emissions. When selecting
providers of logistics services, we also take sustainability criteria into
account, ranging from environmental certificates and the use of environmentally compatible equipment to the utilization of trucks that meet
the latest Euro emissions standard.
Efficient return transport of shipping containers. One drawback of
reusable shipping containers is that they have to be sent back to the
supplier. In order to optimize this return transport, 17 Daimler plants in
Europe have joined forces with five regional logistics centers to create a
network and an IT-based container management system. As compared
with the original situation, 2,200 tons of CO2 emissions were thereby
avoided and freight costs considerably reduced in 2015 alone.
Improved employee transportation system. In Indonesia, companies
offer their employees transportation to work in the mornings and back
home after the workday is over. In 2015 the Mercedes-Benz plant in
Wanaherang optimized such employee transport by improving routes,
using appropriately sized vehicles, and increasing capacity utilization. As
a result, the transport system now emits 24 percent less CO2 than before.

Our production plants cover a total area of around 4,800 hectares, 61
percent of which are occupied by buildings and transport areas. Because
land is a limited public resource, we use these areas as efficiently as possible through dense, multi-level building development. Whenever possible,
we also design outdoor areas within our plants to serve as a habitat for
indigenous plants and animals. In this way, we can facilitate biodiversity
even amidst the industrial architecture. For example, peregrine falcons
have found a new home on chimneys of our plants in Wörth and Sindelfingen. In the Tuscaloosa plant, natural vegetation and beavers with their
dams ensure the retention and preliminary sedimentation of rainwater.
Because of the way we use land and the location of our plants primarily
in industrial zones, no significant negative effects on endangered species
are to be expected.
Biodiversity index. To measure the effect of our activities, we have
developed a biodiversity indicator whose practical viability is currently
being tested in several plants. The indicator categorizes our horizontal
and vertical areas in accordance with their environmental value. This
indicator enables us to set targets for our plant-specific environmental
protection programs and clearly evaluate the progress that has been
made.

Human resources strategy and objectives. We need correspondingly
effective employees if we are to be continuously successful and achieve
our goal of making a key contribution to the sustainable mobility of the
future. This means that we need to gain, develop, and retain highly qualified people. That’s why we are permanently striving to further increase
our already high appeal as an employer — within the company and on the
external market. Because our managers should motivate their employees
to achieve a top performance, it is crucial that we instill outstanding leadership skills into our management. In addition, we want to take on social
responsibility and let diversity flourish in our global company. A professional HR organization and efficient operating processes form the basis of
the implementation of our human resources strategy.
Areas of action. We have derived key areas of action from these overarching objectives — ranging from generation management to topics such
as diversity and equal opportunity, life balance, and the qualification training of specialists in the growth markets. For each area of action we have
defined specific objectives that are also reflected in the target agreements of our managers.
Control. The main control tool we use is our HR Scorecard, which uses
key performance indicators to provide information about the sustainability of human resources measures and processes in the individual areas
of action.

In addition, we use flexible working-time models and collectively agreed
framework conditions, which enable us to make better use of market
opportunities and absorb fluctuations in demand. At the same time,
these agreements help us respond more effectively to rising manpower
requirements in certain areas. We are continuously enhancing our working time regulations to prevent layoffs and safeguard employment for the
long term. In doing so, we achieve as much flexibility for the employees
as possible — with regard to time and space as well as to the content of
their work. We additionally promote this goal in committees and associations. In 2015 we also conducted a broad-based survey in which we asked
our employees what they think about current developments in mobile
working.

In 2015 we also began to realign our Group’s own sales operations for
Mercedes-Benz vehicles in Germany. The objective is to ensure the optimal service for our customers in the largely saturated German market so
that we can operate economically and profitably over the long term and
thus safeguard jobs. To this end, we have grouped sales and service outlets into sales directorates and established two new sales companies that
will integrate the sales business of cars and trucks in the future. We have
sold some captive dealerships and will sell some more over the short
to medium terms. This will not result in any changes for the customers.
Our employees, meanwhile, are protected by company agreements and
collective bargaining agreements. The logistics centers that were previously allocated to the sales and service outlets will be reassigned within
Daimler AG.
Employees by regions and business divisions
Employee representation and co-determination. Our employees have
the right to organize themselves in labor unions. We also ensure this right
in countries in which the freedom of association is not protected. More
than 95 percent of our employees in Germany and more than 80 percent
of our employees worldwide are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Our employees in Germany have extensive co-determination rights
which are regulated by the German Labor Management Relations Act.
Although there is no requirement to adhere to collective bargaining agreements at some Group companies, the employees at these companies
have works councils in keeping with the above-mentioned law.

Target program

Partnership with employee representatives. We work closely together
with the works councils and trade unions. Important partners here include the World Employee Committee (WEC) and the European Works
Council. In 2015 the WEC was extended to additional countries in which
Daimler operates so that it is now represented in 15 nations. At the corporate level, ten members of the Supervisory Board represent employee
interests.
Comprehensive information, regular communication. We inform the
works council about all important business changes and conclude agreements regarding the effects wherever the German Labor Management
Relations Act requires it. We notify the employees of far-reaching changes
early on. In addition, the employee representative bodies at the Group
and company levels (the Group Joint Management-Employee Economic
Committee and the WEC) are also informed about the economic situation
and important changes within the Group and at the Group companies.
Moreover, we regularly inform the WEC of any violations of our Principles
of Social Responsibility.

Employees identify themselves strongly with the company. The
well-being of our employees is important for us. That’s why we regularly
conduct employee surveys to determine how satisfied our employees
are and how strongly they identify themselves with the company. The
constantly high participation rate demonstrates that the survey is well
accepted. The feedback from the employees flows into our Employee
Commitment Index (ECI) and helps us enhance our organization and
leadership culture. Our ECI is clearly above the global average attained
in a benchmark comparison.

Attractive and fair remuneration. We remunerate work in accordance
with the same principles at all affiliates around the world. Our Corporate
Compensation Policy establishes the framework conditions and minimum
requirements for this. It applies to all groups of employees. In our desire
to offer attractive salaries and benefits we also give consideration to
local market conditions within the specified framework. We audit the local
compensation systems on a regular basis through sampling procedures.

Social
responsibility

Target program

Industry-typical salaries. The salaries are determined on the basis of
the employees’ tasks and performance, and in line with their qualifications and experience. We pay salaries that are customary for the market
and the industry, which are significantly above the legal minimum wages
that apply at many locations. In addition to the statutory minimum wages,
salaries and wages are often determined by collective bargaining agreements. In the event of union affiliations, our affiliates generally offer
additional voluntary benefits. For example, the employees of Daimler AG
in Germany currently receive overall remuneration that is significantly
above the level specified in collective bargaining agreements.
Weekend work and overtime. The length of our employees’ workweek
is generally regulated by the company or by a collective bargaining agreement. In Germany, the workweek is 35 hours long in the manufacturing
sector. Deviations are possible on the basis of agreed-upon regulations.
Overtime is only performed within the framework of a requirements planning forecast and has to be approved. In general, we allocate working
times in such a way that remuneration remains stable even if the amount
of work sometimes fluctuates. This is made possible by a time-account
system.
Fair pay. In setting the base remuneration we are not guided by gender
or place of origin, but exclusively by the employee’s job and responsibility, and we thus eliminate any form of discrimination. Salary decisions
are made on the basis of the “multiple-eye principle.” Transparency is
ensured by regular income reviews. In addition, the principle of equal pay
also applies to temporary employees, who receive a regular remuneration
in accordance with the collective bargaining agreements for the metal
and electrical industries during their assignments in the manufacturing
sector.

Compensation of managers. The more responsible the position, the
higher the variable remuneration component. On the one hand, the variable component takes into consideration the company’s performance. On
the other, it is based on the extent to which the manager has achieved the
individually agreed targets, which are discussed between managers and
their superiors as part of a uniform worldwide process. Sustainability
criteria also play a role in this context.

Attractive company pension plans. Upon retirement, our employees
can generally expect to receive attractive company pensions — in addition
to the statutory and privately financed benefits. This applies to both fulltime and part-time employees. Depending on the country and company,
we normally offer defined benefit or defined contribution pension plans.
In addition, employees can also make provisions for retirement by means
of deferred compensation.

Performance assessment and target-oriented leadership. In order to
measure and control each individual’s performance, we use standardized
leadership processes such as LEAD for managers and NAVI for employees
of Daimler AG. In these processes, the individual agrees to quantitative
and qualitative targets with his or her supervisor, and employees generally
agree to a personal development goal as well. Depending on the individual’s position and management level, the objectives also include diversity
and compliance targets.

All permanent employees of Daimler AG are entitled to participate in the
company pension plan. As a result, they not only receive such a pension
in old age but are also covered against premature insured events such as
disability and death. The employee-funded company pension plans and
the pension benefits are generally also available to temporarily employed
people.

At the end of the year the supervisor decides whether the objectives have
been reached. The individuals’ goal attainment and leadership and work
performance as well as the employees’ development potential are then
discussed in company-wide management conferences. The supervisor
personally discusses the results with the employee. Potential measures
for professional development are then discussed as well.

The Global Pension Policy stipulates the requirements for our pension
plan models. We cover the majority of our pension obligations with pension assets. In addition, the pension claims of the employees in Germany
are insured by the German businesses’ Mutual Benefit Association for
Pension Security (PSVaG). It is impossible to make general statements
about the percentage of salaries that is deducted for pension plans, because these plans vary widely worldwide in terms of their type and extent.

“Diversity is everywhere. Every person
and every country is unique. In our
global society we encounter this diversity each and every day. That’s why we
need a corporate culture that respects

knows how to utilize them effectively.
To achieve this, we need to listen attentively and permit diversity.”

True to the motto “I’m one of you,” Diversity Management creates the
general conditions for a culture of diversity, which include the clear rejection of any form of discrimination, as well as the creation of a work environment that is free of prejudice.
In addition, we offer awareness-building and training measures, particularly for our managers. We are especially increasing the managers’
awareness so that they respect the various dimensions of diversity and
integrate them into their daily work. We are strengthening their appreciation of diversity and helping them to develop skills for dealing with
unconscious bias.

The slogan “I’m one of you” shows that diversity management
affects everyone at the company — from the Board of Management to
every individual employee. The Daimler Board of Management has clearly
committed itself to diversity. All the members of the Board of Management support our Diversity Statement and actively advocate the realization of its principles:
–		 Promoting diversity. We respect and appreciate the diversity of our
employees. We encourage them to contribute this diversity to the
company.

–		 Creating connections. We utilize the multifaceted experiences, perspectives, and skills of our employees around the world. They reflect
the diversity of our customers, suppliers, and investors.
–		 Shaping the future. Each individual makes a contribution to creating an environment characterized by respect and mutual appreciation. This is how we are shaping Daimler’s future together.
In order to implement all of this in the company, our Diversity Management concentrates on four fields of action:
1.		 Gender Diversity
2.		 Generation Management
3.		 Internationalization
4.		 Working Culture
In addition, over 3,000 Daimler employees worldwide are involved in 11
official employee networks. In their organizations, the employees reflect
all of the dimensions of diversity management at Daimler.

Gender diversity. Daimler has a self-designated target of increasing the
share of women in management positions within the Group to 20 percent by the year 2020. In 2015 more than 15 percent of our executives
in middle and upper management were women. To achieve our objective,
we have installed a stringent internal reporting and forecasting system
and are promoting women through special programs and seminars. This
applies in particular to female professionals in the fields of engineering
and technology. In 2015, over 35 percent of the trainees who entered the
company through our CAReer program were women.

Generation management. In 2024, one in two employees of Daimler
in Germany will be 50 years or older. The average age of the employees
will then be about 47 years. With the increase in the retirement age, generation diversity will expand. We consider the demographic transformation to be an opportunity and we are using our generation management
measures to help adapt ourselves to these challenges. In doing so, we
are specifically focusing on measures for maintaining the health and performance of younger and older employees and promoting cooperation
between people of all ages.

–		 We are using qualification measures and employment methods that
encourage “lifelong learning” in order to promote our employees’
further development and ensure their employability.
–		 To maintain our employees’ capabilities, we implement ergonomic
improvements, offer courses on how employees can promote their

Annual Diversity Day. We hold an annual Daimler Diversity Day on the
basis of the Diversity Charter. The third Diversity Day took place in June
2015 in line with the slogan “Move Diversity!” At Daimler, the event was
celebrated with numerous activities in 26 countries on four continents.
Global assignments. Throughout the world, around 1,800 Daimler employees from 30 countries are taking part in international assignments.
By far the most important country in which assignees from Germany work
is China, with a share of almost 40 percent. It is followed by the United
States at around 15 percent and Hungary at around 6 percent. Other
important target countries include South Africa, India, and Japan.
However, we also promote the assignment of employees from our global
locations to Germany so that they can build up networks and deepen
their know-how. Such expats from abroad also help to make Daimler in
Germany more international. We currently have around 190 global assignees in Germany, with most of them coming from the United States, India,
and China.

Working culture. We are creating appropriate framework conditions to
strengthen our supportive working culture, which is based on appreciation and respect. These measures range from fair and flexible working
time regulations to mobile working from home and on the road.
Flexible working arrangements. Many employees attach great value
to the ability to structure their working hours individually. To make this
possible, we have created appropriate framework conditions that enable
our employees to reconcile the needs of their work and their private lives
as well as possible. To this end, we agree on individual working (time)
models with the respective employees.
Of the 2,756 employees who took advantage of parental leave during
2015, 69 percent (2014: 73 percent) were male. More than 90 percent of
the fathers took two “partner months” of leave. We encourage all employees who take parental leave to later return to their jobs at the company.
That’s because we value the knowledge and experience of our employees
so much that we cannot do without them and don’t wish to lose them.
Furthermore, work agreements additionally enable employees to suspend
their careers for several years for a sabbatical or training measures — with
the promise that they can return to Daimler afterwards.

children aged six or younger.

Expansion of job-sharing opportunities. We also promote job sharing,
in which two employees share the same task/position and work up to
30 hours per week each. In this way, we help our employees reconcile
the needs of their work and their private lives. This is especially important
for managers, whom we thus enable to work part-time. However, reliable
agreements are needed for this arrangement, which we promote and
support. In mid-2015, more than 100 employees worked in job-sharing
positions at the team and department level.

Part-time community for managers. The Level 4 Part-time Community is an online platform where our Level 4 managers can contact one

We are competitive and innovative only as long as we can attract and bind

High-quality vocational training. Our industrial-technical and commercial vocational training, as well as our studying programs at the Cooperative University, enable us to attract most of the junior talents we require.
To keep abreast of the latest developments, we continuously expand
our job portfolio as required. In Germany, the Daimler Training System
(DAS) ensures the high quality and efficiency of our technical vocational
education.
With our international exchange programs for trainees and trainers, we
create the basic requirements for mobility and flexibility, as well as for
foreign language and intercultural skills. In 2015, around 70 trainees and
15 trainers had a chance to gather their first international experience.
Moreover, ten trainees took part in an exchange project in Poland in cooperation with the Action Reconciliation Service for Peace.
In addition, we are continuously internationalizing our training activities
in order to achieve high training standards throughout the Group. For
example, we have developed the Mercedes-Benz Qualification System
(MBQS) for our international passenger car locations. In several countries,
we are also creating our own company training centers and qualification
structures or supporting the respective region’s offers. Furthermore, we
are also establishing dual education elements outside Germany.

target groups and providing them with a wide variety of training programs
from career entry level to further qualification:
–		 The Cooperative University (DH) at Daimler combines a scientific
study program with internships at 13 company locations in Germany.
In 2015, Daimler had 650 DH students. We hire around 200 DH
graduates each year.
–		 The FacTS program supports young skilled workers who have completed our technical professional training courses with outstanding
results, in the first years of their careers. The program currently has
41 participants, and 16 skilled workers have completed the program
to date.
–		 The international trainee program CAReer enables outstanding
university graduates to enter our company. Highly qualified participants who have an international profile receive support during and
after the program phase, and are perfectly prepared for their prospective management tasks at the company. CAReer promotes the
participants’ personal development and enables them to learn skills
in a variety of divisions worldwide. The program’s participants are
given a permanent job contract from the very start. In 2015 we hired
about 200 trainees, about 40 percent of whom were women and
more than one-third were international participants.

Further training and qualification — lifelong. In keeping with the principle of lifelong learning, we enable our employees to obtain further education and training — professional as well as personal — throughout their
careers. Once a year, supervisors and employees meet to discuss qualification topics and agree on appropriate measures.
Futher education is regulated by the general works agreement on qualification, which also provides that employees can leave the company for up
to five years in order to obtain additional qualifications, and subsequently
return to the company. In 2015 around 400 employees used this opportunity. Moreover, managers can facilitate employee’s qualification efforts
with time credits and financial support.

the same high-value opportunities. In 2015, around 3,800 managers
from 60 locations took part in the Leadership Program. DCA’s complete program covers the areas of leadership and specialist knowledge (HR, Finance, Procurement, IT) in addition to cross-functional
knowledge and academic development. DCA held about 1,000 professional qualification courses for about 15,000 employees. A total of
13,500 people took part in around 1,800 interdisciplinary qualification events throughout Germany.
5.		 Lean management is now well established in all of the production
units and supporting processes at Daimler.
6.		 Compliance: We provide training courses to promote legally compliant behavior within our company. Our Corporate Compliance
organization is responsible for these courses.
The Daimler Academic Programs enable qualified managers and
skilled employees to study with support of the company. Participation
is determined by means of an internal selection process and the respective employees’ personal development plans. In the winter semester
of 2015-2016, 173 employees studied as part of the program.

Executive development with LOOP. As a result of Leadership enhancement through Orientation, Openness and Participation (LOOP), all
managers receive feedback concerning their leadership behavior from
employees, colleagues, and individuals from relevant areas of work. LOOP
supports the managers’ personal development, fosters an open dialog,
and strengthens the feedback culture. In 2015, we continued to roll out
the LOOP process, which commenced in 2013. As a result, our department heads around the world will begin to receive feedback in 2016. In

Globally uniform guidelines. The Daimler Group operates on the basis
of globally uniform principles of prevention, which are tailored to national
laws and international standards. Our Health & Safety unit is responsible
for occupational medicine and occupational safety, occupational health
promotion, ergonomics, social counseling, and integration management.
In addition, our health management and occupational safety are integral
elements of our risk management systems.
Maintaining and promoting employee health. As part of our health
management measures, we conduct a wide variety of projects to develop
solutions that are implemented at the company. These solutions range
from the workplace-related “Daimler HealthCheck” at three pilot locations so far to ergonomic workplace design and an IT system that makes
it easier to permanently reintegrate employees whose health is impaired.
Added to this are facilities such as our social counseling service, which
helps employees deal with psychological problems, conflicts, and life
crises. In addition, we offer special programs to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.

Medical care for employees. At Daimler, occupational and emergency
medicine includes all measures for the prevention of work-related illnesses or occupational diseases, health maintenance in the workplace,
as well as for diagnostics and therapy of accidents and acute illnesses. It
lies within the area of responsibility of our plant and company physicians
worldwide.

The specialist departments and the occupational health and safety organization are responsible for implementing preventive health measures.
After a risk assessment team has systematically recorded all of the risks,
the employee in question is medically examined in accordance with
Germany’s Regulation on Preventive Occupational Medicine (ArbMedVV).

Daimler AG provides all of its employees with comprehensive medical
care. This care is supplemented by the measures and services of the
company health program and the personal counseling organization.
If an employee is suspected of suffering from an occupational illness,
the company documents the occupational medical checkups and doctors’
diagnoses and reports the information to the responsible employers’
liability insurance association.

as through joint initiatives with other manufacturers. We check to
make sure that our standards are complied with and that violations
have appropriate consequences.
Our success depends, not least, on our good and trusting cooperation
with suppliers all over the world. This cooperation is based on shared
requirements and values, which include the companies’ compliance with
our Sustainability Standards along the supply chain.
Around 2,900 employees work in Daimler’s procurement units at more
than 50 locations worldwide. Our established procurement management
committees ensure the cross-divisional management of sustainability

Our Supplier Sustainability Standards define our requirements for

and business ethics and compliance. They are a binding component of the
contractual conditions and form the basis of all of our business relations
with manufacturing suppliers and service providers worldwide. By signing
the contract, our direct suppliers commit to observing our sustainability
standards, communicating them to their employees, and spreading them
to their upstream value chains. We support them in this through targeted
information and training measures. The Daimler Supplier Portal serves as
the central information platform.

Increasing procurement responsibility at the local level. As part of its
global growth strategy, Daimler is increasingly shifting its value added to
the respective sales markets and production locations. We are therefore
continuing to expand our procurement organization’s international presence. As a result, Procurement will incorporate additional local suppliers
in order to increase the local share of the value added. For example, while
the value added from vehicle and engine production at the Beijing Benz
Automotive Co., Ltd. (BBAC) car plant in Beijing currently has around 60
percent local content, this figure is scheduled to rise to about 80 percent
in the future. To this end, we have already developed 250 local suppliers.
This has clear benefits for sustainability, because locating procurement

Certified environmental management in the supply chain. We expect
our suppliers to take on responsibility for the environment, and we request proof of their certified environmental management according to ISO

70 percent of our suppliers of production materials (based on revenue) to
have such a certificate. This figure already amounted to 45 percent at the
end of 2015. We also expect selected suppliers of non-production materials to have an environmental certificate. We choose these suppliers on
the basis of a risk filter.

over the world. We also include in this process the local supplier industry
in countries with sustainability risks. In cooperation with other automobile
manufacturers, our Procurement has been organizing supplier training
courses since 2010. In 2015, training programs were held in China, South
Africa, and India. Such courses had previously already taken place in
Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Russia, and Turkey. A total of 19 local training
sessions have been held worldwide since 2010. We are also planning to
use an e-learning training module in the future to ensure that all of our
suppliers around the world can continuously progress.

ensure that we can continuously improve our measures and activities.

Social standards for contracts for work and services. The awarding
and performance of contracts for work and services is subject to standards that extend beyond the existing legislation. Our standards define
the requirements with regard to occupational health and safety, accommodation, remuneration, use of temporary employees, commissioning
of subcontractors, and freelancing. These social principles are relevant
for all orders that exceed a period of two months and are realized on the
business premises of Daimler AG in Germany. The relevant suppliers are
required to fill out and sign a declaration concerning their compliance
with the standards. This is a prerequisite for receiving new orders. An
auditing team from Procurement determines whether the standards are
being observed.

To make global supply chains more sustainable, we are active in various
national and international trade and industrial associations such as econsense, the Association Materials Management, Purchasing and Logistics
(BME), the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), the
American Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG), and the European
Automotive Working Group on Supply Chain Sustainability, which was
founded as an industry initiative within the European corporate network
CSR Europe. The goal of this collaboration is to develop a recognized
company-wide and industry-wide frame of reference. One of the first results of this cooperation is the Automotive Industry Guiding Principles to
Enhance Sustainability Performance in the Supply Chain. To date, Daimler
and 13 other automobile companies from all over the world have committed themselves to comply with these minimum social and environmental
standards.
As part of CSR Europe we are cooperating with experts from the procurement units of other manufacturers to develop tools for minimizing
sustainability risks. For example, an industry-wide questionnaire with
which suppliers can self-assess their sustainability performance has been
developed. This questionnaire is recognized and used by all companies
that take part in this initiative. In 2015, we used these principles to assess
more than 40 percent of our suppliers of production materials (based on
revenue). In addition, we specifically used the questionnaire in high-risk,
non-production-material product groups such as transport logistics. On
the basis of the results, we derive measures for improving sustainability
performance and communicate these measures to our suppliers.

In 2016, we aim to proceed with the questionnaire’s systematic rollout.
We continue to cooperate with other automobile manufacturers and associations in this area as well so that we can jointly promote sustainability

the joint questionnaire for their own suppliers.

Responsible raw material procurement. Certain regions of the world
are exposed to the risk that armed conflicts could be financed with the
revenue from the sale of raw materials and minerals such as tin, tantalum,
tungsten, and gold. To prevent this from happening, various voluntary
initiatives or legislative guidelines have been introduced aiming at a
declaration of the origin and the responsible procurement of such raw
materials. In the United States, for example, the Dodd-Frank Act stipulates that companies listed on US stock exchanges must certify the
source of these commodities along the entire supply chain. In Europe, the
European Union also envisages legislation on this matter.
Daimler supports an effective and practicable approach for the establishment of responsible procurement of raw materials. Even with great effort,
companies cannot always precisely determine the source of a raw material, especially if they are at the end of long and complex supply chains.
We therefore cooperate with industry associations such as the German
Association of the Automotive Industry in order to promote possible solutions that are feasible and that bring us closer to achieving this goal.

We use a multi-stage concept to implement uniform sustainability standards and monitor their observance in our global supply chain.

Supplier Sustainability Standards

management

1.		 Regular review of our active suppliers. To identify sustainability
risks with regard to issues such as child labor, environmental protection, corruption prevention, violations of freedom of association or
		 violations of human rights at an early stage, we conduct a risk analysis of our suppliers by country and commodity at regular intervals.
This analysis enables us to identify suppliers that are subject to
		 increased risk and to take preventive measures. We use media
and database research to review cases of actual sustainability and
compliance violations. We systematically follow up all reports of
violations.
2.		 Assessments of new suppliers before contract awards. Particularly in the case of new suppliers from high-risk countries, our
		 auditors ask specific questions concerning their compliance with
sustainability standards during on-site assessments. We also conduct a more thorough audit when necessary.

3.		 Escalation process. In the event of a suspected or actual violation
of our sustainability standards by a supplier, we follow an established
escalation process, which begins with a request for an explanation
		 of the measures taken to remedy the irregularities. If any doubts
		 remain, we seek direct contact with the supplier or demand a written
statement from the supplier’s company management. All suspected
violations are examined by the responsible management committees
and with the involvement of the procurement heads. We work very
closely together with the employee representatives when dealing

Education

Sustainable development is not possible without the targeted global
promotion of science, research, and technology. Sharing knowledge
across borders and promoting innovation are important factors in this
respect. We therefore support universities, research institutes, and interdisciplinary scientific projects around the globe. We have consolidated
these activities in foundations.

Education creates opportunities and opens up doors to a future full of
possibilities. We believe that improving access to education is one of the
most long-lasting investments we can make for society and for our company. We are involved in a variety of education projects around the world
with a view to promoting people’s enthusiasm for science and technology
and also their ability to look beyond working life and go through life with
an open mind. The projects we support also promote equal opportunity.

The Daimler and Benz Foundation is investing around E1.5 million in the
“Villa Ladenburg” project, in which researchers are examining the future
effects of self-driving vehicles on the individual and society.

Within the framework of the Donors’ Association for the Promotion
of Sciences and Humanities in Germany, the Daimler Fund supports,
among other things, the German President’s Award for Innovation in
Science and Technology, which is presented each year by the German
Federal President and is among the most important scientific awards
in Germany.

Promoting science

The Daimler and Benz Foundation is endowed with E125 million. As
a driving force of the knowledge society it promotes in-depth scientific
exploration of research ideas in the areas of environmental protection
and ultra-safe technology. Furthermore, it also supports a think tank on
the subject of mobility that is to research the effects and socially relevant
aspects associated with autonomous driving.

The STEM education initiative “Genius — Daimler’s young knowledge
community” aims to get young people enthusiastic about science and
technology. The initiative offers technology workshops that enable
children and teenagers to learn in a playful and practical way, and supplies teachers with instructional materials and continuing education
courses for the teaching of technology classes.

Art and culture

Our “journey on the road to accident-free driving” is not just about using
suitable systems to relieve the burden on drivers, protect them, and support them in hazardous situations. For us it is more a question of ensuring
the safety of all road users. We pursue this goal with traffic-education
projects for schoolchildren and safety training programs for adults, for
example.

Art has the power to build bridges. A rich cultural life and a lively art
scene also foster creativity and innovation. That is why promoting art and
culture is very important to us. Our cultural activities include the Daimler
Art Collection, which was founded in 1977 and has now grown to around
2,600 works by 700 different artists. The emphasis of our activities
is generally on the regional promotion of culture, with a focus on jazz,
classical music, and the promotion of film in addition to the visual arts.

To date, MobileKids has made more than 1.2 million children fit for
road traffic — in Germany and many other countries.

Nature conservation
We share the responsibility for preserving the diversity of natural habitats
for future generations. That is why we have been supporting the projects
and initiatives of environmental organizations around the world for many
years now. In this way, we contribute to making sure the earth remains a
place worth living in.
Thriving wetlands are valuable habitats and carbon sinks. With the
support of Daimler, nature conservationists are rescuing two wetlands
(one in the Black Forest, the other in the Allgäu region) that are at risk of
drying out.
With our help, a renaturation project of the Global Nature Fund aims to
rescue mangrove forests in Asia.

Partnerships around the world. In Berlin we support the Berlin Philharmonic, the German Opera House in Berlin, and the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern music festival. In Stuttgart, we support the Theaterhaus theater, the
jazzopen, the International Bach Academy, and the animated film festival,
among others. In China, we are involved in a strategic partnership with
the National Center for the Performing Arts and we sponsor the International Music Festival. In South Africa, we are active as partners of the “21

the footsteps of national icons like Nelson Mandela.
We support the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation in order to make

For us, being a global company means we have a global responsibility.
That is why we support the social environment at our locations as well
as a wide variety of aid projects around the world. And we do not stop at
emergency disaster relief. We also set up longer-term projects aimed at
helping people to help themselves.
Extensive support for refugees. Daimler has been helping refugees for
a long time. For example, it has cooperated with “Wings of Help” since
2013 to send four convoys with relief supplies to Syrian refugee camps in
Turkey and two flights with similar supplies to northern Iraq. In addition,
we are providing the city of Stuttgart with E100,000 annually for three
years for a fund to welcome refugees. We are providing an additional
E100,000 to fund refugee projects of the Bürgerstiftung Sindelfingen.
We also donated E1 million to the child relief organization “Bild hilft e.V.
– Ein Herz für Kinder.” Moreover, we fund German language courses for
refugees, donate food from the Daimler cafeterias, and offer a support
fleet of Mercedes-Benz vehicles to relief organizations. We are currently
also determining whether company doctors from Daimler could provide
medical care to people in refugee centers.

G4-37, G4-DMA, G4-SO1

Furthermore, Daimler is assisting the social integration of the refugees
and supporting the relief activities of its employees. For example, our
employees donated E300,666 to help refugees. The company contributed
the same amount. The total sum of E601,332 was donated to the German Red Cross (DRK) in support of refugees. The fundraising campaign
was jointly initiated by the company management and the General Works
Council in Germany. Special “action days” were also held, during which
employees helped refugees. Plans are also being drawn up to renovate
refugee centers and build playgrounds for the children. Among other

In November 2015, Daimler launched a “bridge internship” for refugees.
The first group of approximately 40 participants spent 14 weeks at the
Mercedes-Benz plant in Stuttgart-Untertürkheim, where they learned the
basics of industrial production work. The participating refugees were
selected by the Federal Employment Agency, the Jobcenter Stuttgart, and
the Jobcenter Esslingen. In the future, Daimler wants to offer such “bridge
internships” at many other Mercedes-Benz plants in Germany. The aim
is to equip several hundred refugees with qualifications that help integrate them into the German labor market and enable them to get jobs in
German industry.
To help people living in great poverty, we also fund the Ekukhanyeni
project in Lawley near Johannesburg.

In this Sustainability Report we assess the economic, environmental, and social impact of our
business operations in 2015 and present our current target program. We make this comprehensive report available as a navigable PDF file to ensure that the information it contains is
easy to find and use. As a result, topics and information can be directly called up in the same
way as they are on a website.
Moreover, additional online information can be immediately called up through the links in the
PDF file. This information supplements the PDF file and offers additional possibilities of use.
For example, the website features a search function, an extensive thematically linked GRI
Content Index, and a key figures tool, with which you can create tables and graphics adapted
to your information needs.
The information provided in our Sustainability Report applies to the entire Daimler Group with
its business divisions. The reporting period corresponds to our financial year, which runs from
January 1 to December 31.

We engaged the auditing and consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers to examine the Corporate Sustainability Report. The review was based on the International Standard on Assurance
Engagements 3000: Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical
Financial Information (ISAE 3000), published by the International Auditing and Assurance
Standards Board (IAASB).
The auditing firm subjected our Sustainability Report to a critical assessment of its correctness, completeness, comparability, comprehensibility, and relevance. The main focus of the
review was on the corporate level and was supplemented by samples from individual production plants. The following areas were reviewed:
–	the Group-level management systems and processes that are used for recording,
gathering, consolidating, and processing the data published in the report;
–	the control processes for sustainability reporting at the Group level;
–	the accuracy of Group-level figures in tables and statements:
–	production-related key figures on “CO2 emissions, water consumption, and recycling
rate”
–	“average CO2 emissions of the European passenger car fleet of Mercedes-Benz Cars”
–	accident statistics
– Supplier Management
At the conclusion of the review we received a review certificate, which presents the aim,
purpose, and foundations of the review, the work performed, and its conclusions. Internal
reporting is conducted through the Corporate Sustainability Board (CSB).
Audit certification

The report is ‘In Accordance’ with the GRI G4 Guidelines – Comprehensive option

In 2006, Daimler joined the multi-stakeholder network of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)
as an organizational stakeholder. This report was prepared in accordance with the internationally recognized guidelines on sustainability reporting GRI G4. The report was submitted for
the GRI Content Index Service, and GRI confirmed the accuracy of the GRI Content Index.

Our UN Global Compact Progress Report

Focusing on the essentials

Daimler has committed itself to upholding the ten principles of the UN Global Compact. We
were one of the first signatories of the UN Global Compact, and we participate in the LEAD
group established in 2011. We have been involved in thematic and regional task forces and
initiatives of the UN Global Compact since 2013. With this Sustainability Report we are meeting our obligation to report regularly on our initiatives regarding human rights, labor standards
and employee rights, environmental protection, and the fight against corruption.

From a thematic standpoint, the Sustainability Report continues to focus on the areas highlighted in our materiality analysis. We also concentrated on the main key figures in our inclusion of the GRI Content Index.
Materiality analysis: pp. 04 ff.

In July 2015, we submitted the Sustainability Report 2014 together with the the document
„Realizing the Blueprint-Corporate Action Plan“ as our official UN Global Compact Communication on Progress. We will present the next Communication on Progress in July 2016.
UN Global Compact Communication on Progress

In addition to a system and data quality audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), we also
perform detailed benchmark analyses. In parallel we also have an internal process for the
review of targets, measures, and fields of action.

The reporting process and quality assurance

Scope of reporting and data acquisition methods
We want to become better and better
Daimler is continuously enhancing its sustainability activities and measures. This also applies
to its Sustainability Reporting. This report was prepared in line with the principles of materiality, stakeholder inclusiveness, completeness, and sustainability context.

Economic data. The information about economic relationships presented in the Sustainability Report for 2015 is based on data from the Daimler Annual Report 2015. The latter’s
Management Report and Notes sections were attested to with an unqualified opinion by the
auditing firm KPMG Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft AG.
Further information can be found in the Annual Report 2015.

New features in this report
We took a new approach to our Sustainability Report 2015, eliminating the journalistic features and reports that are more appropriate for a broader readership. We will inform these
readers about our sustainability activities in additional publications. As a result, the Sustainability Report now adresses primarily on meeting the information requirements of experts
such as analysts, rating agencies, NGOs, and sustainability organizations. We have, accordingly, concentrated even more strongly on providing content that is of importance to these
groups. The key figures, data, and facts are therefore clearly presented in a focused and easyto-find manner.

112

Employee data. The facts and figures in the Employees section are based on the Daimler
Annual Report 2015. The reporting on human resources data is based mainly on the
“HR ePARS” electronic human resources planning and reporting tool, which combines the
data of all consolidated companies within the Daimler Group. This information is supplemented with data acquired with the aid of the ePeople and HR EARTH electronic human
resources management systems. The texts and diagrams in this section indicate whether
the data refers to the entire Group or only to parts thereof.

Corporate environmental protection

Collection of data on corporate environmental protection. Daimler has been systematically compiling key environmental data from its German plants since 1992. In 1997 and 1998
its data acquisition was gradually extended to include production plants outside Germany.
Since 2002 the data acquisition and analysis have been handled with the aid of a database.
The data in this report reflects the structure of the Group in 2015 and includes all production
plants of which the Daimler Group is a majority shareholder as well as the German and
other European locations for logistics, service, and sales. It does not include the locations
of Daimler Financial Services. To ensure comparability with the data for previous years, the
data for the entire reporting period does not include parts of the company in which Daimler
is no longer the majority shareholder. For this reason, the timelines may differ from those of
previously published data. New parts of the company have been included from the time at
which they became part of Daimler. In comparison with the previous year, in 2015 the Arnstadt production plant in Thuringia, Germany, was included for the first time and Atlantis
Foundries in South Africa was sold. The environmental data for 2015 refers to a total of
72 production locations and subordinate sites as well as to 34 logistics, service, and sales
locations.
Specific environmental and energy data. Resource consumption and emissions are largely
dependent on the number of units produced. That is why we calculate specific values for
the individual divisions. This involves matching the number of vehicles produced in the consolidated plants of each division with the appropriate data from the production facilities.
We measure the specific values of the Cars, Trucks, Vans, and Buses divisions according to
the divisional allocation that has been in force since 2006. This distribution was calculated
back into the past as far as possible in order to obtain consistent timelines. The specific
data gained in this way can only serve as general benchmarks, because it does not take into
account the different ways in which the vertical integration of production has developed,
the diversity of products, or the special features of the production network, which in some
cases extends across divisions.

How we calculate and document our CO2 emissions
Daimler calculates and documents its CO2 emissions in accordance with the 2004 Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative
(Scopes 1 to 3). In doing so, we fully consider all relevant majority holdings of the Group
(control approach).
We document all CO2 emissions from stationary sources (Scope 1), indirect emissions
resulting from the generation of the purchased electricity and district heating (Scope 2),
and emissions resulting from the use of our products (Scope 3). Thus we also take into
account the emissions produced before and after our own activities.
–	Scope 1: We calculate our direct emissions from the combustion of fuels, heating
oil, natural gas, liquid gas, and coal with fixed factors as specified by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) or the German Emissions Trading Office, DEHSt. We began to include the combustion of fuels in the calculations
of Group-wide CO2 emissions for the first time in 2010. The calculation also includes
the consumption of energy for production purposes (e.g. forklifts) and test benches
in Product Engineering. Company cars assigned to specific individuals are not taken
into account. If data is available, the results of previous years are also included in the
calculation.
–	Scope 2: In our calculations of indirect emissions from district heating and electricity from external sources, we differentiate by time and region. If more detailed data
is not available, we use the current factors of the International Energy Agency (IEA).
In the United States we use the electricity generation factors published by the EPA.
The CO2 emissions from electricity production for the German locations are calculated on the basis of the applicable factors of the German Environmental Agency
(UBA). In order to remain consistent with our previously published timelines, we have
not taken into account the electricity trading balance and the changes made in 2015
to the emission factors of fuels in the UBA assessment. Beginning in 2016, CO2
emissions will be calculated according to separate assessments for “market-based”

and “location-based” emissions. This calculation will be based on the new guideline
of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative for determining Scope 2 emissions, which
was published in 2015. To this end, we are currently determining the CO2 emission
factors of the local power companies at our locations worldwide.
–	Scope 3: We calculate CO2 emissions from the use of our products on the basis of
our sales figures and the average fleet consumption values. For this calculation, we
assume that each car travels 15,000 kilometers each year. At the moment, no statutory test cycles are prescribed for trucks and buses. The European Commission is
working on a computer-based simulation program (VECTO) that aims to make manufacturers’ statements regarding the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of trucks
and buses comparable. We will use this program as soon as it is approved. We calculate other indirect CO2 emissions from the purchased services and preliminary work
for business travel and truck deliveries, which we use as examples.
CO2 emissions from externally procured green electricity. With a view to reducing our production-related carbon emissions and continuously improving our energy
supply, we are investing in facilities such as cogeneration units within our plants and
are optimizing our external energy procurement. Since 2011, we have been purchasing
green electricity and have leased a highly efficient combined cycle plant to provide combined heat and power (a Plattling combined cycle plant). Accordingly, we distribute the
electricity produced there among our German plants. We accordingly allocate the CO2
emissions attributable to the power generated in the Plattling plant to the production
facilities; we calculate these emissions on the basis of the CO2 factor specific to the individual power plant.
At this time, we are not calculating the figures for other greenhouse gases across
the Group. As the calculation of climate-relevant coolants in the German plants shows,
the emissions from such refrigerants account for only a negligible amount in the parts
per thousand range.

Independent
Assurance Report
To Daimler AG, Stuttgart
We have been engaged to perform a limited assurance engagement regarding several sustainability key performance
indicators selected by Daimler AG (the Company) in the Sustainability Report 2015 (the Report) for the business year from
1 January to 31 December 2015.
Scope and Subject matter
The sustainability key performance indicators and information selected by the Company for the calendar year 2015
(CO2 emissions of the European fleet, energy consumption, total CO2 emissions scope 1 and 2, waste recovery rate, water
consumption, accident frequency as well as supplier management), which are included in the scope of our engagement,
can be found on the pages 34, 54-55, 59-60, 65, 81-84 of the Report. The assessment of the materiality analysis of the
Company was not part of our engagement scope.
The Company prepared sustainability key performance indicators and information in accordance with the Sustainability
Reporting Guidelines Vol. 4 (pages 16 to 18) of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).
Responsibility of the legal representatives
The Company’s Board of Managing Directors is responsible for the proper preparation of the report in accordance with
GRI’s criteria as stated in the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 4 (on pages 16 to 18) of the GRI.
This responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the report and the use of
assumptions and estimates for sustainability disclosures which are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, the
responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining systems and processes relevant for the preparation
of the report.
Our Independence and Quality Control
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants
issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity,
objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior.

Target program

We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (revised)
‘Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information’. This Standard requires that
we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the assurance engagement, under consideration of materiality,
to provide our conclusion with limited assurance.
In a limited assurance engagement the evidence-gathering procedures are more limited than for a reasonable assurance
engagement, and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance engagement. The procedures selected
depend on the practitioner’s judgement.
Within the scope of our work we performed amongst others the following procedures:
– Inquiries of personnel responsible for the preparation of the report regarding the process to prepare the reporting of
sustainability information and the underlying internal control system;
– Inquiries of personnel responsible for the reported information regarding fleet emissions (and fuel consumptions) as
well as reconciliation of selected information regarding fleet emissions (and fuel consumptions) with the official fuel
consumptions and emissions type-test values of the Federal Motor Transport Authority of Germany;
– Inspection of documents regarding the sustainability strategy as well as understanding the sustainability management
structure, the stakeholder dialogue and the development process of the Company’s sustainability program;
– Inquiries of personnel in the corporate functions that are responsible for the chapters product responsibility, corporate
environmental protection, employees and suppliers;
– Gaining an understanding of the systems and processes for collection, analysis, validation and aggregation of sustainability data and its documentation on a sample basis;
– Performance of site visits as part of the inspection of processes for collecting, analyzing and aggregating selected
data:
– in the corporate headquarter in Stuttgart,
– in the plant in Rastatt (Germany),
– in the plant in Chennai (India);
– Analytical procedures on sustainability data disclosed in the report;
– Comparison of selected data with corresponding data in the Company’s Combined Management Report;
– Gaining further evidence for selected data of the report by means of inspection of internal documents, contracts and
invoices/reports from external service providers.
Conclusion
Based on our limited assurance engagement, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the key performance indicators on the pages 34, 54-55, 59-60, 65, 81-84 of the Report of the Company for the business year 2015 has
not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with GRI’s criteria as stated in the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 4 (on pages 16 to 18) of the GRI.

Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality
control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional
standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

of forced labor
Principle 5	Abolition of child labor

We assign a very high priority to recognizing and protecting human rights within our company and in the locations where we
operate. For us as an automaker, the emphasis is on employee rights, fair working conditions, and the rejection of every form of
discrimination and of forced labor and child labor. We have firmly assigned the responsibility for human rights issues in the
Integrity and Legal Affairs division in the Group’s Board of Management. In addition, we emphasize this issue in our corporate
governance structure for sustainability.

Principle 6	Prevention of
discrimination

To ensure that hiring processes are free of discrimination, whether gender-specific or in other forms, the fixed base salary is
based on the individual’s position and level. The same goal is served within our regular income reviews by mandatory documentation, the inclusion of several people in each process, and a central HR system that ensures transparency. Our in-house income
reviews have shown that the amount of the remuneration paid for comparable tasks is affected by factors such as individual
performance and the amount of experience a person has gained in a particular position, but not by the person’s gender.

Principle 7	Precautionary environmental protection

Risk prevention is particularly important when it comes to managing the local effects of our business activities. This applies,
for example, to environmental protection in the production process. Our environmental management system defines structures
and processes that ensure transparent reporting and clear areas of responsibility at all levels of our production facilities
around the world. More than 98 percent of our employees work at locations with environmental management systems audited
and certified according to ISO 14001. In addition, we regularly conduct environmental due diligence processes at our locations.

Principle 8	Initiatives for
promoting environmental responsibility

Daimler has been systematically compiling key environmental data from its German plants since 1992. In 1997 and 1998 its
data acquisition was gradually extended to include production plants outside Germany. The data in this report reflects the
structure of the Group in 2015 and includes all production plants of which the Daimler Group is a majority shareholder as well
as the German and other European locations for logistics, service, and sales. It does not include the locations of Daimler
Financial Services. The environmental data for 2015 refers to a total of 72 production locations and subordinate sites as well
as to 34 logistics, service, and sales locations.

Principle 10	Measures against
corruption

In our Integrity Code we have made a binding pledge to comply with all relevant laws, voluntary commitments, and internal
regulations, and to do business in accordance with ethical principles at all times. In doing so, our main focus is on the observance
of all applicable anti-corruption regulations as well as the protection and promotion of fair competition. In this respect, our
managers have a special responsibility due to their role model function. Consequently, integrity and compliance are key criteria
in the annual target agreement process and target achievement of our managers.

Principle 10

Based on our Integrity Code, we offer a comprehensive range of training courses that include sections on ethical conduct in
daily operations, corruption prevention, our whistleblower system BPO, and antitrust law. We offer classroom instruction and
web-based training courses, depending on the risk and the target group.
In addition to the cross-hierarchical Group-wide dialogs concerning ethical conduct, we ensure ethical practices and legally
compliant behavior in our daily business with the help of our Compliance Management System, which is based on national and
international standards.
Our divisionally oriented Compliance organization serves as a partner for the business divisions in their detection and treatment
of market-specific risks. Each division is supported by a divisional or regional Compliance Officer, who advises the business units
on compliance issues. Moreover, local compliance partners around the world ensure that our standards are observed.
Ethical conduct and compliance with the regulations by our business partners is a required prerequisite for trusting collaboration.
In our selection of direct business partners, we take care to ensure that they act within the law and observe ethical principles.
