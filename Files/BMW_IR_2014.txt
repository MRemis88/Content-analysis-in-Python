PREFACE
At the BMW Group, we believe that sustainability
means investing in our future.
Our approach is holistic, focused on implementing sustainability throughout the value chain and ensuring that
sustainability is firmly entrenched within our company structures and practised by our employees. To achieve
this, we are gradually refining our sustainability strategy and setting long-term objectives in c­ learly defined areas
of activity.
We have steadily reduced fleet CO₂ emissions with our Efficient Dynamics technology strategy over the years.
Average emissions for our European fleet currently stand at 130 grams of CO₂ per kilometre. With BMW i,
we have made sustainable mobility a reality. Our customers now have a choice: with the BMW i3 and BMW i8, they
can enjoy sheer driving pleasure with either an electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle. We will continue to electrify our
vehicle fleet – and this will help us reach our 2020 goal of reducing European fleet emissions to half the l­evels
recorded in 1995.
Our understanding of sustainability includes efficient use of resources, as well as lower CO₂ emissions.
We achieved a major breakthrough in power consumption in 2014 and now obtain more than half our electrical
energy worldwide from renewable sources.

Norbert Reithofer
Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG

By including sustainability considerations in all our business decisions, we create added value for the company.
At the same time, we are demonstrating our commitment to international conventions such as the ten
principles of the UN Global Compact. Beyond that – and this is crucial – we create innovations with tangible
benefits for society.
Consistent action clearly pays dividends. The BMW Group has been one of the top-rated companies in major
sustainability rankings for many years: we are the industry leader in both the Dow Jones Sustainability Index
and the Carbon Disclosure Project.
We believe that sustainable action makes our business model more competitive and secures our company’s
future growth.

“It is our goal to engage in sustainable operations.
Among other things, this means designing new
­products to master the global challenges of our times.
Our innovations should be designed to serve our customers and society. As such they contribute towards
the long-term success of our business model.”
Dr.-Ing. Dr.-Ing. E. h. Norbert Reithofer
Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG

“Before deciding to implement a project, we first analyse
its potential profitability. Our sustainability activities
should also be designed to make a positive contribution
to the business. We want to attract new customers by
offering low-emissions vehicles. We invest in resource
efficiency because it reduces our energy and disposal
costs in the medium term.”
Dr. Friedrich Eichiner
Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG — Finance

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

“Our highly skilled and motivated workforce creates real
benefit for the company. After all, the only way for a
sustainability strategy to be successful is if it is lived and
implemented each and every day – in Germany, China,
the USA and every other country we do business in.”

Dr. Ian Robertson (HonDSc)

“We aim to increase the efficiency and reduce emissions
of our vehicles, while at the same time making them
safer and more comfortable. With Efficient Dynamics
technologies, the innovations of BMW ­ConnectedDrive
and BMW i, we have laid the groundwork for a
­sustainable future.”

“We will continue to expand our successful car-sharing
system, intensifying our focus on adding more electric
vehicles. Car-sharing provides relief in terms of traffic
and the environment, especially in dense urban areas.
We also work with innovative start-up companies to
develop tomorrow’s sustainable mobility concepts.”

Klaus Fröhlich
Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG — Development

Peter Schwarzenbauer
Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG — MINI, BMW Motorrad,

“For us, Clean Production means consistently investing
in resource-efficient technologies and our vision of
long-term emissions-free production at every one of
our production facilities worldwide. By 2020, we aim
to almost halve our energy requirements per vehicle
produced compared to 2006.”

“Our customers are at the heart of everything we do.
Their satisfaction with our products and services is
a prerequisite for our sustainable future. Under the
banner of “Future Retail” we are constantly evolving
the customer retail experience, with the aim to be
the benchmark in our industry and beyond.”

“Hand in hand with our partners in the supply chain,
we are making our supplier network more sustainable.
Saving resources, raising awareness of sustainability
and fostering innovative ideas – these are all oppor­
tunities to leverage potential.”

BUSINESS MODEL

Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft
(BMW AG) has its headquarters in Munich
(Germany). Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH
began operations in 1917, having been
founded in 1916 as Bayerische Flugzeugwerke
AG (BFW). The firm became Bayerische
Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW AG)
in 1918.
The BMW Group is one of the most successful manufacturers of cars and motorcycles in
the world and its BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce
premium brands are three of the strongest
in the automotive industry today. In addition
to its car brands, the BMW Group also has
a strong market position in the motorcycle
industry and is a successful financial services
provider. In recent years, the company has
also become one of the leading providers of
premium services for individual mobility.
One example of this is DriveNow, the carsharing programme the company offers in
collaboration with Sixt SE.
The BMW Group is an international company,
represented in over 140 countries around
the globe. At the end of the year it employed
116,324 people (2013: 110,351). The company
has a large research and innovation network,
with 12 locations in five countries around
the world. Currently, its production network
comprises 30 locations in 14 countries. The
worldwide vehicle sales network is made up

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

of approximately 3,250 BMW, 1,550 MINI
and 130 Rolls-Royce car dealerships. The
company also has approximately 1,000 BMW
Motorcycle dealerships around the globe.
With these brands, the BMW Group offers
its customers a wide range of products for
individual mobility in the premium segment.
In addition, the BMW i brand is further
expanding the concept of what “premium”
actually means. BMW i is even more strongly
characterised by the idea of sustainability; it
stands for vehicles that lead the way in terms
of electric drive, revolutionary lightweight
construction, exceptional design, and mobility
services that have been designed from the
ground up.
BMW Motorcycles also focuses on the premium segment, offering a wide range of
products which since the beginning of the
current financial year have also included the
C Evolution e-scooter for urban mobility.
Innovative technologies and a large number
of driving apparel options contribute towards
increasing customer safety and comfort.
The financial services segment is a partner
to the sales organisation, and is represented
in over 50 countries. The largest business
area in this segment is loan financing and
leasing of BMW brand cars and motorcycles
for private customers. Under the brand

name Alphabet, the BMW Group has an
international multi-brand vehicle fleet business that offers loans to large customers to
finance their car fleets. It also provides comprehensive management of company vehicle
fleets in 19 countries. This also includes
full-service solutions such as the corporate
car-sharing programme AlphaCity, as well as
AlphaElectric, a comprehensive e-mobility
solution.
Long-term thinking and responsible action
have always been the basis for our business
success. In addition to business aspects,
other integral parts of the BMW Group’s
strategy are environmental and social cri­
teria along the entire value chain, product
responsibility in all areas as well as a clear
commitment to resource efficiency.

CONSISTENT IMPLEMENTATION OF CORPORATE STRATEGY
NUMBER ONE

Our Corporate Strategy Number ONE was established
in 2007, and we have been consistently implementing
it ever since. It has defined targets to 2020 and is clearly
defined: the BMW Group aims to be the leading supplier
of ­premium products and premium services for individual
mobility.
To achieve this goal, we focus on four areas of action and
their key objectives:

STRATEGY
1.1

Our management approach

1.2

Stakeholder engagement

For us, constant integration of sustainability into our
business model is an investment in our future. By acting
sustainably, we leverage new business opportunities,
minimise risk and seek to overcome social and business
challenges at an early stage.
At the same time from our perspective, sustainability is
capable of making a positive contribution to the long-term
business success of the company. Taking social and envir­
onmental responsibility for everything we do is an
­integral part of how we perceive ourselves as a company.
We are convinced that the lasting economic success of
any enterprise these days is based increasingly on acting
responsibly and ensuring social acceptance. Efficient and
resource-friendly production processes and state-of-theart solutions for sustainable individual mobility offer a
clear competitive advantage.

Sustainability
as part of the competitive advantage and core principles

Our sustainability vision is in line with the Action 2020
programme that we developed in collaboration with other
companies on the World Business Council of Sustainable
Development (WBCSD). It provides the basis for our sustainability goals and our efforts to integrate sustainability
along the entire value chain as well as in all underlying
processes – thus creating added value for the company,
the environment and society.
In 2013 and 2014, we reviewed our sustainability vision
as well as our targets and measures with regard to the
main challenges facing the automotive industry. In terms
of sustainability, climate change and its consequences,
as well as air pollution, availability of resources, urban
mobility and road safety are of particular relevance. However, it is just as important to remain aware of effects on
society along the entire value chain. Our Sustainability
Leadership goals are characterised by four principles.
innovation: We see social challenges as
– Eanntrepreneurial
opportunity to provide new products and services.
mpact on society: Our actions and innovations benefit
– Isociety
as well as our customers.

SEEING TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AS AN
OPPORTUNITY
The automotive industry is currently going through a process
of technological transformation. We want to be pioneers and
drivers of this transformation process. We base our efforts on
two complementary approaches: evolution and revolution. The
further development of technologies such as highly efficient
combustion engines, lightweight construction and hybrid
drivetrains – that is what we call evolution. We see revolution,
on the other hand, as being zero-emissions mobility with new
drivetrain technologies, combined with new materials and innovative mobility services. Both the evolutionary and the revolutionary approaches of the BMW Group are designed to make
a long-term contribution towards further reducing the CO²
emissions of our products.

2014 Strategy Review, we added two new goals to our
sustainability goals for 2020: we want to support intercultural understanding in the area of Employees and

Corporate Citizenship, and in terms of Production

MANAGING SUSTAINABILITY

Sustainability is a component of our corporate strategy.
For this reason, our Sustainability and Environmental
Protection department has been directly incorporated
into our Corporate Planning and Product Strategy unit
since 2007, under the mandate of the Chairman of
the Board. This unit is responsible for the sustainability
­strategy and sustainability management worldwide.
Some of the department’s tasks are:
o identify and take an internal approach to addressing
– Tcore
challenges.
and monitor sustainability goals.
– TToo develop
further develop, specify and integrate our sustain– ability
initiatives into individual divisions, taking

–
–

account of the entire value chain.
To provide a central corporate function for environmental protection (Group Representative) and manage
the environmental protection network.
To manage global centres of competence on a range
of environmental issues.

The entire Board of Management is represented on the
Sustainability Board, which makes decisions on the
long-term alignment of the sustainability-related areas
of action of Strategy Number ONE. The heads of central
Corporate Communications and Sustainability and
Envionmental Protection are also members of the Sustain­
ability Board, which convenes twice a year to assess the
company’s progress. The topics are prepared for presentation to the Sustainability Board by the ­Sustainability
Circle, which comprises department heads from all
­divisions see Figure 03. A dual management system is
in place – the Board of Management of the company is
responsible for management tasks, with the Supervisory
Board providing advice and monitoring see Chapter 2.1.

Integrating sustainability as a strategic corporate objective
Sustainability has been established at the BMW Group
since 2009 as a strategic corporate objective based
on specific targets and key performance indicators.
­Sustainability is therefore an explicit component of the
BMW Group’s management system. This means on the
one hand that every major project must be measurable in
terms of “Sustainability” as a corporate objective, ensuring that, in addition to economic factors, environmental
and social aspects are also accounted for in the decision-­
making process.

It also means that sustainability as a corporate objective
is broken down to the level of business areas and div­
isions. As a result, the personal targets set for managers
include sustainability aspects and criteria which have
an effect on their performance-based remuneration.

From the materiality matrix it is evident that the topics of CO² emissions and climate change continue to be the most relevant for both stakeholders and the BMW Group.
The topics of environmental and social standards in the supply chain, product safety as well as alternative drivetrain technologies are also top priorities.

IDENTIFYING KEY ISSUES

We carry out a materiality process in order to identify
in good time which topics may bring opportunities and
risks to our business today or in the future. To do this,
we regularly analyse the importance of current sustainability topics, both from the perspective of different
stakeholder groups as well as that of the company.
The materiality analysis results in the materiality matrix,
which is used to verify the direction our sustainability
objectives and indicators are taking. We judge a core area
to be particularly significant if it is categorised as very
important by both our stakeholders and the BMW Group
see Figure 05.

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

The list of topics on the materiality matrix itself is also
reviewed on a regular basis, the last time in 2013. In 2013,
the review process involved telephone interviews with
12 representative stakeholders, including customers, suppliers, investors, authorities, NGOs and scientists from
different regions of the world.
We then combined the interview results from 2013 with
the results of the stakeholder survey and analysis from
2012. This provides us with an updated rating of the issues
from an external perspective. To update the internal
­perspective, we conducted a materiality workshop with
18 representatives from the relevant company divisions
(including their strategy offices). Our experts from
­Corporate Strategy then collated the results.

Evaluation and result

The BMW Group is industry leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI). This makes the BMW Group the only company in the automotive industry
to be listed every year since the Index was established.

On the Global 500 rating of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the BMW Group again achieved 100 out of a possible 100 points for transparent reporting.
It also received top marks for climate protection measures, taking first place again in 2014. As a result, the BMW Group is listed on the worldwide Climate
­Performance Leadership Index (CPLI) of companies with Performance Score A – the only company in the automotive industry to achieve this top ranking for
five consecutive years.

In addition, we maintain continuous dialogue with our
stakeholder groups see Chapter 1.2 and look for solutions
to the challenges society is facing. Current topics include
expansion of sustainable mobility concepts and challenges
resulting from the rapid spread of digitalisation. This
­concerns new functions and services as well as all areas
of data security.

the same time, we explain clearly and transparently what
can be expected of us. By fostering dialogue with our
stakeholders, we want to build trust and consolidate partnerships. This is why it is important to have one strategy
for stakeholder engagement worldwide. Our Stakeholder
Engagement Policy forms the basis for continuous dialogue. It defines the goals of the dialogue, sets the criteria
for identifying and prioritising our stakeholders and
­provides a template for a range of suitable formats and
communication channels see Figure 07.

Stakeholder engagement

The BMW Group engages in ongoing dialogue with its
stakeholders at all its locations and in relevant markets.
We aim to identify trends early on, and integrate them
into our strategy process. Although not all differences of
opinion can be resolved in dialogue with our stakeholders,
each party can gain an understanding of the other side’s
position.
As a global corporation with a complex value chain,
both our manufacturing activities and our products have
an effect on the environment and society. Knowing the
­position of our stakeholders and at the same having the
opportunity to explain the extent of our room for influence in terms of social and environmental issues enables
us to increase the level of acceptance of the actions we
take and the decisions we make. In spite of this, there
remains a certain amount of potential for conflict. The
dialogues show that on certain questions of mobility the
position of individual stakeholders and that of the
BMW Group remains divided. Stakeholder dialogue also
allows us to analyse the market situation with regard
to market-­relevant topics such as the introduction of
­electromobility, and to communicate key m
­ essages to
information multipliers in advance.
Strategically aligning our engagement with stakeholders
We want to understand the different perspectives of our
stakeholders and to respond in an adequate manner. At
SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

One of the cornerstones of this dialogue is our ongoing
and systematic identification and prioritisation of stakeholders. To this end, we regularly map out stakeholder
groups that are involved in strategically important topics
at all relevant locations. We foster our dialogue with
stakeholders by developing different formats.
Our subsidiaries, our political offices in the different
markets as well as our plants engage in regular dialogue
with local stakeholders on relevant topics. A range of
committees and channels allow our different corporate
departments to contact relevant stakeholder groups
directly.
Our basic goal is to host at least one multi-stakeholder
dialogue per year in Europe, Asia and North America
respectively. We set the themes for these stakeholder
­dialogues according to how currently relevant they are.
In 2014, for example, we conducted stakeholder dialogues
on the topics of electromobility, mobility services and
the BMW Group’s ambitions in the area of sustainability
leadership.
In addition to these events, we also have direct contact
with individual stakeholders on specific occasions when
special topics arise. For example, in 2014, a number of
non-governmental organisations contacted us to request
information on social and environmental standards in
the value chain. Connectivity is another topic we have

taken up in dialogue with our stakeholders, and it has
been a point of discussion at several events in different
countries.
All of our stakeholder dialogue formats are based on one
principle: the views of our stakeholders feed back into
the company. The participants from the BMW Group
ensure that the results of the discussions and their personal impressions flow back into the organisation and our
decision-making committees. This is how they contribute
towards making sure that external perspectives on relevant topics continue to be discussed within the company.
On the other hand, the stakeholder organisations that
take part in the dialogues become familiar with the
BMW Group’s views and positions on certain topics
and can take account of this in their day-to-day work.
YOU CAN FIND FURTHER INFORMATION ON SPECIFIC EVENTS OF THE
BMW GROUP DIALOGUE FORMAT ON THE BMW GROUP WEBSITE UNDER:

The political offices concern themselves with public
affairs as they affect environmental, financial and socio-­
political topics and deal with relevant economic policy and
industry-specific issues. In the period under report, the
main topics in this regard were how to put CO₂ regulation
into practice, how to deal with trade barriers, fair taxation
legislation as well as social challenges such as demographic change.
CO² regulation in Europe
Legal regulations on emissions are becoming increasingly
stringent worldwide, continually posing new challenges
to the automotive industry. As early as in the year 2000,
the BMW Group set the course for reducing fuel consumption and emissions.

The European Union (EU) has set the target for all new
vehicles at 130 g of CO₂/km by 2015. The EU defines
­targets for CO₂ emissions based on vehicle weight. Based
on this, the BMW Group has set itself the goal of decreasing levels to under 140 g of CO₂/km. Between 1995 and
2014, we reduced the CO₂ emissions of our newly sold
vehicles in Europe (EU-28) by 38%. Average CO₂ emissions
were 130 g/km in 2014. The BMW Group had already
achieved the EU target by 2012.

Stakeholder engagement

All manufacturers will be required to reduce emissions of
their new vehicle fleet in Europe to an average of 95 g/km
by 2020. From the outset, the BMW Group made a clear
commitment to this target. By 2020, we want to cut the
CO₂ emissions of our vehicle fleet at least in half compared
to 1995.
The BMW Group would like to see countries throughout
the EU take similar measures to those already in place in
other countries and regions when it comes to promoting
electromobility. In Japan, China and the USA in particular,
alternative drivetrains are receiving stronger govern­
mental support.
Promoting the transatlantic free trade agreement
As a global enterprise, the BMW Group supports the
further opening of worldwide markets as well as the con­
tinuous reduction of tariff and non-tariff trade barriers.
Thus, the BMW Group is also in favour of consolidating
transatlantic relations and welcomes the bilateral negoti­
ations on a comprehensive and far-reaching economic and
trade pact between the EU and the USA (Transatlantic
Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP). Reducing trade
barriers should lead to considerable benefits for corpor­
ations and will therefore also have positive effects for consumers on both sides of the Atlantic. The BMW Group
is calling for gradual elimination of tariffs in the auto­
motive industry as well as the elimination of non-tariff-­
related trade barriers and closer regulatory cooperation,
in particular with regard to harmonising technical
standards.
Shaping our urban future with electromobility
The global social, economic and environmental changes
we are facing call for new solutions that are specifically
designed for urban spaces. Electromobility is an important step in this direction. However, in future we need
to introduce additional effective measures that support
the success of this technology.

The BMW Group also plays a active role in the National
Platform for Electric Mobility (NPE), a German governSUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

ment advisory committee on electromobility founded by
Chancellor Angela Merkel in May 2010. This platform
aims to push for progress on electromobility, create a
lead market for e-mobility in Germany and speed up the
market launch of innovative electric vehicles. Here again,
the BMW Group provides the government with its
knowledge and research results and actively helps shape
political discussion of framework conditions via input
from established political networks internationally.
Supporting democratic parties
The BMW Group supports the work on social policy
­carried out by the democratic parties in Germany (CDU,
CSU, SPD, FDP and Bündnis 90/Die Grünen). The company places high value on transparency in this regard
and complies with the relevant legislation. In 2013, the
BMW Group began to change its procedure for supporting political parties. Since 2014, it has supported the work
on social policy carried out by the democratic parties in
Germany solely through content-based partnerships. The
BMW Group has made this change in order to focus its
engagement on content, for example, by providing financial support for public discussion forums and dialogue
formats. All partnerships are subject to the clear sponsorship guidelines of the BMW Group.

In the past, the BMW Group primarily donated vehicles
for use. The parties provided the BMW Group with confirmation of receipt of a donation by stating the corres­
ponding value or rental rate. In 2013, this procedure
was temporarily continued for the CSU. This led to a final
­settlement for vehicle transfer of €5,881 see Figure 08.

FORECAST
The BMW Group aims to further expand its dialogue with stakeholders internationally. We will continue to hold at least one
annual Stakeholder Dialogue event in Europe, North America

Only in a constructive dialogue can viable solutions be developed to successfully meet the challenges of the future.

STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT
The BMW Group’s vision for 2020 is to be the world’s most
successful and sustainable provider of premium products
and premium services for individual mobility. The responsible
use of resources and the assumption of social responsibility
are prerequisites for achieving this vision.

Key objectives of the BMW Group are to achieve sustainable, profitable growth, increase the value of the business,
safeguard jobs and maintain corporate autonomy.
These objectives can only be achieved if available equity
and debt capital is employed profitably and if the profit
generated sustainably exceeds the costs of capital
employed. The achievement of this central business management objective is measured in terms of “value added”,
or the contribution made to business value growth
during the financial year ¹. In 2014, value added was
€3,839 million (2013²: €3,639 million).

1 Value added corresponds to the amount of earnings over and above the cost of capital.
For an exact definition see General Information on the BMW Group in the Annual Report 2014.

to the Group Financial Statements in the BMW Group Annual Report 2014.

Decisions made in favour of new products or technologies
lead to cash flows lasting many years. Such decisions
therefore have a considerable influence on the long-term
development of the business. The enterprise is, however,
evaluated based on its annual results. Strategic management and financial planning ensure that we achieve our
annual profitability targets. This in turn forms the basis
for continuing to invest in the future viability of the
business.

In order to ensure sustainable, profitable growth, the
BMW Group continually invests in its employees, in new
products and production structures, in systems and processes. Despite the increasing number of models and
variations, the application of uniform standards worldwide and the use of modular products and processes
allow us to efficiently develop and profitably man­ufacture
new products of the highest quality standard, including
vehicle types that have so far been produced only in
small numbers, such as electric-­battery-driven vehicles
and plug-in hybrids.

Addressing the challenges faced by the automotive industry in the context of sustainability see Chapter 1 is a key
driver for our investment decisions. Important examples
of our integrated investment approach in the Automotive,
Mobility Services, Employee, Sales and Production Sites
segments are:
easures to further improve the efficiency of conven–	Mtional

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

Achieving financial success with our Efficient Dynamics strategy
Foresighted corporate planning leads to sustainable success. The competitive advantage offered by the Efficient
Dynamics strategy we adopted in 2000 is one reason
why the BMW Group had its fifth record year in a row in
2014, despite continuing high investments, in particular
in future-oriented products and production structures as
well as in processes and skills.

With its products and services, the BMW Group was
able to increase its Group revenues to €80,401 million
(2013²: €76,059 million). Sales figures were up for all
three Group brands, BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce, with
a total of 2,117,965 vehicles delivered to customers
(2013: 1,963,798). The same goes for motorcycles, with
­123,495 delivered in 2014 (2013²: 115,215).
A significant financial indicator at Group level is the
Group profit before tax. In 2014 it totalled €8,707 million
(2013: €7,893 million) and was thus 10.3% above the previous year’s figure. Operating performance is managed at
segment level (Automotive, Motorcycles, Financial
­Services) on the basis of the capital rates of return RoCEs
and RoEs for details on the BMW Group management system
see General Information on the BMW Group in the Annual Report 2014.
Due to the central importance of the Automotive segment
for the Group as a whole, consideration is also given to
additional key value drivers which have a significant
impact on RoCE and hence on segment performance.
This is the EBIT margin ³, which at 9.6% was within the
target range of 8–10%, despite extensive investments.
Another indicator is the level of EU fleet emissions,
which thanks to increasingly efficient drivetrain systems
and more electric vehicles declined by 2.3% in 2014 to
130.0 g CO₂/km (2013: 133.0 g CO₂/km).

FUTURE BUSINESS VIABILITY THROUGH SUSTAINABLE
MANAGEMENT

The future viability of any enterprise is closely tied to its
success as a business. Global megatrends such as urban­
isation and climate change are leading to modifications
in the regulatory framework and to changing customer
demands and business models. For example, premium
customers from the retail and fleet business increasingly
expect a carmaker to demonstrate a comprehensive
understanding of product responsibility and to implement
the corresponding measures. Mobility services and networked mobility are new business fields to be mastered
see Chapter 3.
With its Efficient Dynamics strategy see Chapter 3 and
overall performance in the area of sustainability, the
BMW Group has developed a true competitive advantage. Please see the following for a few examples of
how sustainability contributes to the financial success
of the BMW Group.
Boosting sales through innovative models and mobility services
Investments in innovative mobility concepts contributed
to the success of the BMW Group in 2014. Examples:
in financial year 2014, 16,052 BMW i3 and 1,741 BMW i8
models were sold. By the end of 2014, over 390,000
­customers had registered for our DriveNow car-sharing
scheme, thus almost doubling user numbers compared
to the p
­ revious year. In addition, the company has been
­running the scheme at an operational profit since early
2014. At corporate level, full-service solutions such as the
corporate car-sharing scheme AlphaCity as well as the
e-mobility solution AlphaElectric are ensuring the success
of our fleet service provider Alphabet. With its products
and solutions, the BMW Group helps also fleet customers
achieve their CO₂ targets.

Outlook

The ratings reflect the solid financial profile and the very high level of creditworthiness of the BMW Group.
This gives the company good access to the international capital markets as well as opportunities to take
­advantage of attractive refinancing conditions that are of particular benefit to the Financial Services business.

Maintaining the confidence of the capital market through
future viability
The confidence of the capital market in the future via­
bility of the BMW Group business model once again led
to top scores in capital market ratings and hence to low
­refinancing costs in 2014.
Reducing risks and increasing efficiency potential through
sustainability in supplier management
Active management of sustainability risks along the
­supply chain reduces compliance and image risks, among
others. We have established a comprehensive supplier
management system for this purpose see Chapter 5.

We work with our suppliers to continuously improve
resource efficiency. Since 2013 we have therefore been
participating in the supply chain programme of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). The transparent reporting
of strategy and efficiencies achieved in energy and water
consumption as well as reductions in CO₂ emissions
reveals potential for working together to further improve
resource consumption and hence reduce manufacturing
costs and environmental impact. For example, the suppliers
surveyed reported savings of over 21 million tonnes in
CO₂ equivalents in 2014, representing significant savings
on energy costs across the corresponding manufacturing
processes.

Reducing costs through resource efficiency
Resource efficiency reduces the risk of availability bottlenecks and price fluctuations, thus contributing directly
to higher earnings by reducing costs. Between 2006 and
2014, energy and water consumption and waste and
VOC emissions per vehicle produced in the worldwide
BMW Group production network were reduced significantly. This allowed us to achieve €15.8 million in cost
savings in 2014. Increasing resource efficiency and minimising waste as well as the continuous optimisation of
our environmental management processes, which are
ISO 14001-certified at all BMW Group production plants,
lead to lower investment needs on environmental
protection.
Staying competitive through sustainable
human resources policies
The BMW Group ranked as one of the most attractive
employers worldwide in 2014. Our leading role in the area
of sustainability means that our employees tend to identify with the company and its products. This is one of the
reasons for our low employee turnover rate, which in
turn reduces hiring costs. In order to live up to our claim
of technology and innovation leadership, we try to attract
the best talent and promote each individual’s s­ pecial skills.
The diversity of our customers should also be reflected
in the workforce of the BMW Group.

A variety of health education offerings promote the health
of our workforce. Healthcare measures also help to counteract employees’ age-related physical limitations. Work
safety measures reduce accident risks. These initiatives
promote better performance on the job and the avoidance
of illness- and injury-related absenteeism. They thus also
contribute to the achievement of competitive human
resources expenditure.

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

IDEA MANAGEMENT
Idea management at the BMW Group is a worldwide tool to
­involve and empower employees, giving them the opportunity
to contribute their ideas and have an impact on change within
the company. This is done through a process that is transparent
for all those involved, from idea submission through the forwarding of the idea to the relevant departments for evaluation
all the way to a bonus paid to the employee if the idea receives
a positive assessment.
Idea management improves the company’s competitiveness
and promotes employees’ loyalty to the company as well as
their motivation and entrepreneurial thinking and action.
The ideas submitted lead to improvements in products and
processes as well as to significant savings. In 2014, a total of
approximately 7,700 ideas were put into practice, resulting in
savings of €31.0 ­million ¹.
In order to further strengthen idea management, the upgraded
IT system used since 2012 by BMW AG will be introduced
incrementally at the international company locations. In 2014,
the company sites in the UK and our plant in Steyr (Austria)
were integrated into the idea management system. The international rollout will continue in 2015 with the plants in
­Spartanburg (USA) and Rosslyn (South Africa).
This system is accompanied by ongoing internal measures to
further encourage employee participation. One example is the
Idea Management Award launched in 2014.
1 In general, strong fluctuation is possible as certain ideas may make a larger contribution to the
savings achieved in some years more than others.

The sustainable, profitable growth of the BMW Group
creates value. Direct positive economic benefits are risk-­
commensurate returns for capital providers, attractive
salaries for employees as well as a social contribution
through income tax payments. These are quantified in
the allocation statement for net value added.

The majority of employees hired after 1 January 2014
receive defined-benefit pension commitments with a
minimum interest rate.

The net value added results from the value of work performed less the value of work bought in during the financial year including depreciation. At €20,620 million
(2013¹: €19,217 million) it has remained at a constant
high level. The bulk of the net value added, 47.4%, is
applied to employees (2013¹: 46.9%).

In 2014, pension fund assets rose to €15,861 million
(2013: €13,461 million). Pension provisions increased to
€4,604 million (2013: €2,303 million). The main reason
for this increase is the drop in the discount rate used for
actuarial calculations in Germany from 3.50% to 2.10%.
The assets of pension plans in the BMW Group are
administered by trusts and are thus legally separate from
the company’s assets. The company’s need to draw on
the operational business to fund pension payments will
be substantially reduced in future as these payments
will come primary from the assets of the pension funds
or trusts.

In addition to an attractive salary, company benefits and
pensions are also important components of employee
remuneration. These mainly consist of defined-benefit
pension plans, which include old-age pensions, invalidity
and survivor’s benefits, and medical care (only in the
USA and South Africa) after reaching retirement age.

Driving economic development
As a global enterprise, the BMW Group contributes to
positive economic developments and prosperity worldwide. It currently employs 116,324 people in attractive
jobs. The purchase of intermediate products secures jobs
in our supply chains. Attractive products and services are
the basis for an economically viable dealership network.

The BMW Group strives to achieve balanced growth in
all markets and on all continents by following the prin­
ciple of “Production follows the market”. In 2014, we
expanded our production network to encompass 30 production sites. Joining the network are the Araquari plant
in the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina as well as the
­contract manufacturing of MINI models at VDL Nedcar
in the town of Born in the Netherlands.
The BMW plants in the international markets make a
contribution to market development there. Shifting part
of the value chain to the respective sales markets leads
to a reduction in currency risks through natural hedging.
At the same time, a locally based automotive industry is
also a driver for growth and employment at each plant
location, for example through employee salaries, taxes
paid to cities and municipalities, as well as through the
suppliers who open businesses around the plant sites.
By implementing innovations and opening up new
­business fields, the BMW Group fosters the creation of
new value chains and jobs. Examples:
n 2014, the BMW Group continued to build on its

FORECAST
In 2015, we will continue to consistently pursue our path of
profitable growth.
In terms of business management, we will strive to further
boost sales in the Automotive and Motorcycle segments and
to further increase our profit before tax.
A wider range of plug-in hybrids in future models will contribute
towards this. B
­ uilding on the success of the BMW i8, we will
introduce the BMW X5 PHEV in 2015.
In order to help shape the technological transformation that
is currently taking place in the automotive industry, in 2015
we will continue to invest in the development of innovative
vehicle concepts and mobility services.

Compliance and
anti-corruption

The BMW Group Compliance Committee comprises
the heads of the following departments: Legal Affairs,
­Corporate and Governmental Affairs, Corporate Audit,
Organisational Development and Corporate Human
Resources. It manages and monitors activities necessary
to avoid non-compliance with the law (legal compliance)
and reports regularly to the Board of Management and
the Supervisory Board on all compliance-related issues.
The BMW Group Compliance Management System
includes training and communication measures, indi­
vidual counselling, consistent follow-up on cases of
non-compliance as well as the management of compliance-relevant processes and controls.

STRATEGIC DIRECTION
The BMW Group is unconditionally committed to lawful and
responsible conduct.

Current legislation provides the binding framework for
the BMW Group’s wide range of activities around the
world. It is therefore essential that the Board of Management and all employees are aware of their relevant legal
obligations and comply with them with complete conviction. This shapes the public image of the BMW Group
and creates confidence in our products and brands. Earning this confidence is in turn the basis for our business
success.

INTEGRATING COMPLIANCE IN THE ORGANISATION

In order to protect the company systematically against
compliance-related and reputational risks, the Board
of Management created a Compliance Committee
several years ago, mandated to establish a Compliance
­Management System throughout the BMW Group.

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

The extent and intensity of compliance activities are
based on an annually updated Group-wide compliance
risk assessment covering all 331 BMW Group business
units and functions worldwide.
COACHING AND COMMUNICATING COMPLIANCE

The BMW Group Legal Compliance Code, which was updated
in 2014, is the cornerstone of the Group’s Compliance
Management System, spelling out the Board of Management’s acknowledgement of the fact that compliance is a
joint responsibility (Tone from the Top). This document,
which explains the significance of legal compliance and
provides an overview of the various areas relevant for the
BMW Group, is available on the intranet in German and
English as well as 11 other languages for the convenience
of all employees.
Since 2014, new employees receive a welcome e-mail about
compliance when they join the company to demonstrate
the special commitment of the BMW Group to compliance
matters.
Managers in particular bear a high degree of responsi­
bility and must set a good example in the process of
­preventing infringements. Managers throughout the
BMW Group accept this principle by signing a written

performed for national sales companies and in the Financial Services segment in China, UK and Canada.

More than 25,400 managers and staff (2013: 20,300)
worldwide have received training in compliance and
anti-corruption basics since the introduction of the
BMW Group Compliance Management System. Successful participation in the training programme is mandatory
for all BMW Group managers and is ensured through
corresponding personnel processes. In this way, the
BMW Group achieves full training coverage for its managers in compliance matters. In addition to this basic
training, in-depth training is also provided to certain
groups of staff on specific compliance issues. Advanced
training on competition and antitrust law was introduced
in 2013 and already completed the same year by 3,900
employees.

In order to avoid legal risks, all members of staff are
expected to discuss compliance matters with their managers and with the relevant departments within the
BMW Group, in particular Legal Affairs, Corporate Audit
and Corporate Security. The BMW Group Compliance
Contact serves as a further point of contact for both
employees and non-employees for any questions regarding compliance.

Additional Compliance Market Coachings have been
implemented in local markets since 2012. These seminars
strengthen the understanding of compliance in selected
units and enhance cooperation between the central
BMW Group Compliance Committee Office and decentralised compliance offices. In 2014, market coaching was

toll-free numbers in all countries in which BMW Group
employees carry out activities.
Compliance-related queries and concerns are documented and followed up by the BMW Group Compliance
Committee Office using an electronic Case Management

risks. These procedures are particularly relevant for
­relations with sales partners and service providers such
as agencies and consultants.
Depending on the results of the evaluation, appropriate
measures – such as communication measures, training
and possible monitoring – are implemented to manage
compliance risks. The Business Relations Compliance programme has already been launched in 32 units (from a
total of 70) since 2012 and will be rolled out successively
over the coming years throughout the BMW Group’s
worldwide sales organisation. We will also continue in
2014 to include compliance clauses in dealer and
importer contracts to protect contractual relationships.
INFORMATION FOR THE ENTIRE WORKFORCE —
The BMW Group’s Compliance publication

designed to identify potential corruption risks are carried
out. In 2014, one Compliance Spot Check was performed.
To ensure compliance in the BMW Group, it is essential
that employees are aware of and comply with applicable
regulations. The BMW Group does not tolerate violations
of law by its employees. Culpable violations of the law
result in employment contract sanctions and may involve
personal liability consequences for the employee involved.

FORECAST
In addition to rolling out the Business Relations Compliance
programme in further units, the BMW Group plans to conduct
three Compliance Spot Checks in the coming year as well as
continuing to develop its online compliance training.

The BMW Group reports on legal infringements in its
Annual Report if the events in question could be of interest for shareholders, analysts and other stakeholders
due to economic consequences. We are not aware of any
such infringements having occurred in 2014.
ENSURING COMPLIANCE BY BUSINESS PARTNERS

In the same way that the BMW Group is committed to
lawful and responsible conduct, it also expects no less
from its business partners. In 2012, the BMW Group
developed a new Business Relations Compliance programme aimed at ensuring the reliability of its business
relations. Relevant business partners are checked and
evaluated with a view to identifying potential compliance

STRATEGIC DIRECTION
The BMW Group has a company-wide decentralised risk
management system in place in order to identify, analyse and
actively manage any risks within or outside the company that
could endanger the achievement of our business objectives.

The BMW Group operates in a dynamic environment
where it is constantly confronted with new opportunities
and risks. Professional risk management is a fundamental
prerequisite for being able to deal successfully with
changes in prevailing political, legal, technical, social or
economic conditions. In order to achieve growth, profitability, efficiency and sustainable levels of business in
the future, the BMW Group deliberately exposes itself to
­certain risks.
Risk management at the BMW Group is based on a
­company-wide decentralised network, which is supervised by central risk management. The risk management
process is geared towards meeting the criteria of effectiveness, usefulness and comprehensiveness. The design
of the BMW Group risk management network is regularly
checked against the internationally recognised COSO
framework (COSO: Committee of Sponsoring OrganizaSUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

tions of the Treadway Commission). Corporate Risk
Management also works in close cooperation with the
Compliance Committee, the internal control system and
the Corporate Audit department. Integral components
of the risk management process are identifying risks early
on, comprehensive analysis and risk assessment, the
coordinated deployment of appropriate control tools, and
the monitoring and evaluation of measures taken.
Opportunities and risks in the area of sustainability are
discussed by the Sustainability Circle. The strategic
options and measures that result for the BMW Group are
presented to the Sustainability Board. Risk aspects discussed are integrated into the Group-wide risk network.
The close ties between the Risk Management and Sustainability Circles ensure that risk and sustainability
management are closely coordinated.
DEALING WITH POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND GLOBAL
ECONOMIC RISKS

As one of the world’s leading providers of premium products and premium services, the BMW Group faces some
major challenges. In many countries, individual mobility
is subject to political regulations and national industrial
policy. Changing values in society and fast-growing
urbanisation call for new mobility solutions. At the same
time, the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in the euro area
and volatile economic conditions continue to unsettle
markets and consumers. The slowdown of economic
momentum in China, one of the BMW Group’s main
markets, poses further risks.
The escalation of political conflicts and terrorist activities
as well as natural disasters or possible pandemics could
all have a negative impact on the global economy and
international capital markets. The BMW Group counters
these risks primarily by internationalising its sales and
production structures in order to reduce the potential
impact of risk exposures in individual countries.

TURNING STRATEGIC AND INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC RISKS
INTO OPPORTUNITIES

with Sixt SE for mobility services as well as a cooperation
with Toyota in the field of hydrogen.

The automotive industry worldwide is faced with increasingly strict requirements for reducing fuel consumption
and emissions.

The market introduction of alternative drivetrain technologies means new challenges and additional investments
are in store for the automotive industry. At the same
time, the BMW Group views this development as a
chance to put its engineering expertise and innovative
strength to use. Issues such as greater fuel economy and
the reduction of emissions are fundamental parameters
that we automatically include when designing new products. The BMW Group generates carbon footprints for
selected vehicles so that it can capture data on CO₂ emissions throughout the entire life cycle from the development stage.

Government intervention into activities that have an
impact on climate change is intensifying, the aim being
to reduce air pollution in densely populated areas. Resulting regulatory changes (e.g. city tolls or CO₂-based taxes),
trends in fuel prices as well as environmental influences
and a higher degree of environmental awareness among
the public all have an impact on customer behaviour. The
BMW Group is facing these changes with our Efficient
Dynamics strategy, which includes improving the efficiency of conventional drivetrains, future electrification of
the drivetrain and e-mobility as well as mobility services.
We are also working on solutions for sustainable mobility
in densely populated areas. Our Efficient Dynamics
­strategy gives us an edge on the competition. These
improvements result in tangible benefits for the c­ ustomer,
increasing the attractiveness of our products and strengthening the brand image of the BMW Group.
Continuing on our present growth course depends above
all on our ability to develop innovative products and services and to bring them to market. With the introduction
of the BMW i brand, new target groups are being
addressed and the company is consolidating its reputation
as a sustainable and future-oriented enterprise. The existing product portfolio in the area of mobility services was
expanded through the rollout of DriveNow, ChargeNow
and ParkNow see Chapter 3.5. The BMW Group is keeping close watch over the long-term trend towards greater
sustainability, which opens up sales opportunities for
sustainable products with possibly stronger pricing. With
the introduction of new business models and the use of
its growing partner network, the BMW Group is taking
full advantage of these opportunities. This includes for
example the implementation of the 360° ELECTRIC
portfolio in the field of electromobility, a partnership
SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

AVOIDING ENVIRONMENTAL AND NATURAL RISKS

The BMW Group minimises its exposure to natural and
environmental risks by implementing a number of technical and organisational measures. Particularly relevant in
this respect are climatic changes as well as the increased
incidence of environmental events such as flooding or
hurricanes. Production interruptions and breakdowns
pose risks that the BMW Group tries to c­ ircumvent by
taking corresponding precautionary ­measures. Such
measures are incorporated into the production and logistics structures at the initial planning stage to make provision for such eventualities, both in terms of likelihood
of occurrence and loss impact. In addition to technical
fire prevention, these measures include preventive maintenance, protecting company sites from potential risks
such as flooding, spare parts management coordinated
between plants as well as the planning of alternative
transport routes.
To avoid negative ground impact and groundwater pollution, we develop appropriate preventive strategies and
initiatives at our company sites. When choosing a new
site for a facility, we analyse and take into account the
effects of climate change in the region and the risk factors
associated with it.

We also use this information as a decision-making cri­
terion when choosing suppliers. In order to identify and
counteract any risks to our supply of parts and materials
early on, we assess the extent to which supplier sites
are exposed to natural hazards such as floods or
earthquakes.

FORECAST
In order to achieve growth, profitability, efficiency and sustainable levels of business in the future, the BMW Group deliberately
exposes itself to risks. In the future, both the world economy
and our business processes are going to become even more
complex. We must therefore further optimise the interplay
between risk management, strategy and dialogue with external
partners. Central offices of the BMW Group keep close watch
over changes in the legal framework. We evaluate the resulting
opportunities and risks to derive possible concrete measures
or alternative implementation scenarios. We then present our
proposals to the Board of M
­ anagement for its decision.

ENSURING COMPREHENSIVE DATA PROTECTION
The BMW Group meets all data protection requirements when
handling personal data from its customers, prospects, employees and business partners. The protection of information and
data is an integral component of our business processes and
is based on the International Security Standard. In the field of
vehicle communication as well (Connected Drive), data security
and prevention of misuse are a key concern.
We view data protection not only as the fulfilment of statutory
requirements, but also as a way of promoting customer and
employee trust in the BMW Group.
In 2014, the BMW Group successfully complete the validation
process for the B
­ inding Corporate Rules (BCR) scheme. The
BCR guarantee a data protection standard that is to be upheld
and maintained by BMW AG and all its subsidiaries. This ensures that in the BMW Group personal data is always handled
at a uniformly high security level, regardless of whether the
data are processed for example in Europe, Asia or America.
With the introduction of the BCR, the BMW Group established
a Group-wide committee for ensuring a uniform level of data
privacy worldwide. Personal data is only collected, processed
or used if this is legally permissible, or with the consent of the
interested party.
The board or management team in each BMW Group company
is responsible for data protection at that company. Each group
company has its own local Data Privacy Protection Officers.

Human rights

Assuming social responsibility is an integral part of the
BMW Group’s perception of itself as a business enterprise. In 2001 it was therefore one of the first German
companies to sign the UN Global Compact. With the
Joint Declaration on Human Rights and Working Conditions at the
BMW Group, the Board of Management together with
employee representatives reconfirmed this commitment
to respecting human rights.

STRATEGIC DIRECTION
The BMW Group is committed to respecting and observing
human rights within its sphere of corporate influence and
action. It models its conduct on the UN Guiding Principles on
Business and Human Rights.

The BMW Group’s philosophy and core principles include
a commitment to respecting human rights within the
company’s sphere of influence and action. We consider
it an integral part of sustainable management to fulfil
this responsibility both within the company as well as
along the value chain. As an international enterprise
with highly complex supply chains, the BMW Group is
exposed to increased risk of being confronted directly
or indirectly with human rights violations. We therefore
treat the protection of human rights as a top priority and
require our business partners to do the same.

Our due diligence process for human rights is modelled
on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights. We use these principles to critically reflect on our
processes and to ensure the observance of human rights
within the company and along the value chain throughout our sphere of action and influence. In particular,
we require our employees to respect human rights and
protect them in their daily actions. We also oblige our
business partners to comply with human rights. One focus
here is the integration of human rights aspects into the
risk management process for suppliers.
We constantly monitor current developments in the
international human rights debate and we analyse potential need for action to be taken by the BMW Group.
In 2012, we performed a s­ ystematic analysis of the rights
cited in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with
regard to their relevance and implications for different
business units. Based on the results, we reviewed our
strategic alignment and used what we learned to continuously develop our due diligence process for the company
and in relation to our business partners. We regularly
report on our progress to the Sustainability Circle and
the Sustainability Board.
TRAINING EMPLOYEES

We educate our employees on the position taken by the
BMW Group and on the specific requirements with
regard to human rights in business operations. The topic
is a fixed part of our sustainability training, which is

CARRYING HUMAN RIGHTS A STEP FURTHER —
Getting business partners and suppliers on board

aimed in particular at new employees and trainees, as
well as our Web-based training on sustainability for all
employees. Information and course materials are available
online at all times for our managers and employees. The
goal of the training is to raise employee awareness of
human rights and the approach taken by the BMW Group
and to inform them on what they have to be alert to in
their daily actions and whom they can turn to for
questions.

MAKING SURE PARTNERS HAVE HUMAN RIGHTS CLAUSES

For purchasers and commodity managers, we offer a dialogue event on sustainability in the supply chain that also
deals with the issue of human rights. In 2013, we achieved
our Balanced Scorecard goal of training over 80% of our
purchasers in sustainability. To maintain this level, we
conducted further training courses in 2014 for new purchasers and those who had not yet received training, and
will continue to do so in 2015. You can read more in the
chapter on Supplier Management see Chapter 5.

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

The Board of Management of BMW AG is committed to
consistently respecting human rights. We expect the
same from our business partners and take this issue into
consideration when making investment decisions.
Obliging business partners and suppliers to observe
human rights
We expect our business partners to consistently observe
human rights and see this as an important criterion for
long-term business relations. The commitment to human
rights is included in the General Terms and Conditions
of Business and the international purchasing conditions
of BMW AG. In practice it is ensured, among other things,
with the help of our risk management process for sup­
pliers see Chapter 5.

Starting in 2015, all dealership contracts in Europe as well
as all contracts with importers worldwide will contain a
binding human rights clause, including a requirement to
comply with the core labour standards of the International
Labour Organization (ILO). Our goal is to integrate this
clause into all dealership contracts worldwide by 2016.

in China also explicitly committed to observing human
rights.
Taking human rights criteria into account in
investment decisions
Human rights requirements are part of our risk management process and are also taken into account in investment decisions and the choice of company sites. When
subcontracting to local business partners for investment
projects, we make sure they are committed to observing
human rights.

FORECAST
Together with internal process partners and in dialogue with
external stakeholders, we will continue to develop our due
­diligence process further in 2015. We also plan to integrate a
human rights clause into all dealership contracts not only
in Europe but all over the world by 2016.

In 2014, approximately 100% of the order volume for all
our material investments in property, plant and equipment
(including production equipment and buildings) were
covered by human rights clauses.
ADDRESSING HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS

If employees have any questions regarding human rights,
they can ask their line managers or the BMW Group
Human Rights Contact helpline. Employees also have the
opportunity to submit information about possible human
rights violations within the company via the BMW Group
SpeakUP Line – anonymously and confidentially. The
BMW Group SpeakUP Line is available in a total of
34 languages and can be reached via the Internet in
47 countries. The Human Rights Response Team, which
includes one representative from the Works Council,
handles the reports by employees and initiates measures
as required to remedy possible violations. In 2014, no
violations of human rights within the company were
reported via internal channels. Two relevant reports were,
however, received on possible violations in the supplier
network. These were checked and could not be confirmed.

Our management
approach

As a leading provider of premium products and services
for individual mobility, the BMW Group takes a comprehensive approach to product responsibility and its implementation throughout the product life cycle. For us,
sustainability starts with the development of fuel-efficient
vehicles that are safe for drivers and other road users.
Product responsibility also covers resource-efficient
development and production processes as well as integrated and high-quality customer care. Recycling concepts
ensure that our vehicles provide valuable raw materials
after they reach the end of their life cycle. We are also
developing intelligent services to shape the mobility of
the future.
We strive every day to meet our customers’ requirements,
to comply with legislation and to retain our competitive
edge. To achieve this we combine product innovation with
the highest quality possible. Our management approach
in this regard takes a broad, life-cycle-oriented perspective
on product responsibility.

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

REDUCING EMISSIONS –
PROMOTING MORE SUSTAINABLE MOBILITY

Governments are increasingly taking measures to combat
climate change and reduce urban air pollution caused
by hazardous substances. Worldwide, requirements are
becoming more stringent to increase fuel efficiency of car
fleets and to reduce vehicle emissions (e.g. particles, CO,
HC, NOx). 94% of the vehicles we sell are subject to
­corresponding regulations and legislation. For example,
certain countries have introduced CO₂ taxes or limited
vehicle registrations by placing restrictions on the number
of plates issued. We are also aware that air quality in the
cities presents a challenge for urban mobility in terms of
NOx and particles.
Customer behaviour is also affected by increasing regulation, fuel price trends, environmental impact and rising
awareness of climate change. Low-emissions vehicles,
alternative drivetrain systems as well as mobility services
are becoming more and more important to our customers.
We are facing these changes with our Efficient Dynamics
development strategy. First, this strategy aims to make
vehicles with conventional petrol and diesel engines more
efficient through engine optimisation, lightweight design,
aerodynamics and energy management. The next step
is then to tap into the new potential that electric vehicles
generate in terms of sustainable mobility. BMW’s philosophy includes implementing Efficient Dynamics not only
in niche models, but also as a standard component in our
high-volume vehicles. In this way, we can have a greater
effect in terms of environmental protection see Chapter 3.2.
Our visionary BMW i electric vehicles are spearheading
our long-term efforts to produce entirely emissions-free
vehicles. BMW i also offers innovative services for individual mobility see Chapter 3.5 and represents a new
understanding of the “premium” concept, defined chiefly
in terms of sustainability.

TAKING A BROADER VIEW OF PRODUCT RESPONSIBILITY

Our product responsibility is, however, not limited to
producing eco-friendly vehicles. As a provider of premium products and premium services for individual
mobility, safety is fundamental to our sense of product
responsibility. This goes for our customers’ safety as well
as the safety of other road users. Through active safety
features we try to prevent accidents, and we use passive
safety systems to mitigate their effects see Chapter 3.3.
Other elements in our approach to product responsibility
are increasing resource efficiency in the supply chain
see Chapter 5, resource-efficient production see Chapter 4
and high recycling and reuse standards that make the
materials cycle as complete as possible see Chapter 3.4.
Finally, we aim for a high degree of customer satisfaction.
We conduct studies and customer interviews and constantly analyse customer feedback to find out how we can
improve even further from our customers’ perspective
see Chapter 3.6.

We use Life Cycle Engineering to increasingly integrate
environmental aspects into the design and development
of our products. With regard to existing vehicles, we aim
to achieve a significant improvement in environmental
impact from one vehicle generation to the next. The
checks and balances for this process are oriented towards
ambitious targets, and we apply the Life Cycle Assessment
in accordance with ISO 14040/44 to evaluate the progress
made in the development process.
Life Cycle Engineering was used in the development of the
BMW i8 as well as in the BMW i3 before it. The result of the
Life Cycle Assessment in accordance with ISO 14040/44
for the BMW i8 series vehicle as well as for the BMW i3 was
certified externally by the German automobile certification body TÜV SÜD. Life Cycle Engineering is also carried
out on BMW Group vehicles with combustion engines.

ENSURING SUSTAINABILITY THROUGHOUT
THE VEHICLE LIFE CYCLE

A large part of the environmental and social impact
caused by a vehicle throughout its life cycle is determined
during the initial development stage. Some of the main
influencing factors are material selection, production
technologies, supplier selection, engine type, as well as
the recyclability of the vehicle’s components.
For us, high sustainability levels have the same significance as, for example, cost or weight criteria in the development process of the vehicle. This is based on an
integrated accounting method that assesses the environmental, economic and social impact of our products
throughout their life cycle. The method includes, for
example, data from the purchasers’ sustainability risk
­filter see Chapter 5 as well as a business assessment
see Chapter 2.

MANAGING PRODUCT RESPONSIBILITY
WITHIN THE COMPANY

The above-mentioned aspects of product responsibility
are an integral part of the target systems and organisational processes of our vehicle development see Figure 15.
One important example is the management process we
use to achieve global CO₂ vehicle fleet targets. This process
entails the BMW Group defining specific CO₂ targets for
each product line and each new vehicle project. A department within the Strategy unit is responsible for monitoring and further developing these targets. The Complete
Vehicle Architecture unit coordinates the development
and implementation of fuel-saving technologies in the
individual vehicle projects. This ensures that the market-­
specific fleet requirements are taken into consideration
in the very early stages of vehicle project development
and are subject to Efficient Dynamics measures during
the development process.

REDUCING CO² EMISSIONS –
OUR EFFICIENT DYNAMICS STRATEGY

Based on our Efficient Dynamics development strategy,
the BMW Group reduces the energy requirements of
every vehicle through intelligent lightweight construction,
innovations in energy management and consistently
­optimised aerodynamics. Furthermore, the efficiency
technologies are constantly being expanded and further
developed.

STRATEGIC DIRECTION
The BMW Group will have reduced CO² emissions of the
­European new vehicle fleet (EU-28) by at least 50% by 2020
(base year 1995).
By 2020, the BMW Group will be the leader in taking a
holistic approach to premium electromobility.

The BMW Group is getting closer and closer to its vision
of sustainable mobility. We use innovative efficiency
technologies in all vehicle models. In addition, we are
adding electrically powered cars to our model range.
In view of climate change and scarce resources, we want
to further reduce the CO₂ emissions of our vehicles.
The automotive industry is also facing new challenges
worldwide due to intensified emissions l­egislation for
vehicles. 94% of the vehicles we sell are subject to corres­
ponding legislation. As early as 2000, even before regulations were passed, the BMW Group was already setting
the course for reducing fuel con­sumption and emissions.
By 2020, we will reduce the CO₂ emissions of our vehicle
fleet by 50% compared to the base year 1995.

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

At the same time, we are successively offering more electrified drivetrains based on the BMW i drive technologies,
including for models of the core BMW brand. After the
successful introduction of the battery-driven electric
model (BEV) BMW i3 and the plug-in hybrid (PHEV)
BMW i8, the BMW X5 plug-in hybrid with eDrive technology
will be launched in 2015.
Between 1995 and 2014, we were able to reduce CO₂
emissions of our newly sold vehicles in Europe (EU-28) by
over 38% see Figure 16. Average fuel consumption in 2014
was 6.0 litres of petrol per 100 kilometres or 4.9 litres
of diesel per 100 kilometres. In Europe (EU-28), average
CO₂ emissions were 130 g of CO₂/km.
At the end of 2014, 53 of our models had m
­ aximum CO₂
emissions of 120 g/km. This means that we have similar
fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions to a number of
other large carmakers in Europe.
The average fleet CO₂ emissions per kilometre worldwide
decreased in 2014 by 4.4% to 152 g of CO₂/km (2013:
159 g of CO₂/km). Average CO₂ emissions in the USA
were 168 g of CO₂/km and 176 g of CO₂/km in China.
The regional differences in fleet consumption result from
differences in customer purchasing patterns.

driving situation. In addition, vehicles with automatic
transmission can cruise at between 50 and 160 km/h:
as soon as the driver releases the gas pedal, the drivetrain is decoupled and the vehicle is controlled by rolling
and wind resistance exclusively, thus running at minimum
consumption. The Proactive Driving Assistant uses data
from the navigation system to tell the driver about speed
limits, tight bends and roundabouts or turns ahead,
and gives tips on the most efficient way to drive.

For example, driving in ECO PRO mode will reduce fuel
consumption by up to 15% depending on the individual’s
driving behaviour. As soon as ECO PRO mode is activated,
it optimises the drivetrain systems management as well
as the heating and air-conditioning functions to ensure
maximum efficiency. ECO PRO mode also gives the driver
specific hints on how to drive more efficiently, for example
by displaying the most efficient gear to drive in for each

NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN PRACTICE — BMW ConnectedDrive

PLUG-IN HYBRIDS — BMW X5 xDrive40e

To complement our efficiency technologies, BMW ConnectedDrive uses the BMW navigation systems to map
out the traffic situation on main roads almost in real
time. This enables the driver to avoid congested areas
and save on fuel.

LEVERAGING FURTHER POTENTIAL WITH
HYBRID DRIVETRAINS

BMW ConnectedDrive is a package of intelligent technologies that interconnect the driver, vehicle occupants, the
vehicle itself and the environment. The system is based
on the two pillars of driver assistance systems (comfort
and safety functions) and services (infotainment and
mobility products).
As well as reducing the carbon emissions of our cars, we
are constantly working to bring down other emissions.
We are playing a pioneering role in meeting the Euro 6
standards, which call for a significant reduction in nitrogen oxide (NOx) levels, in particular for diesel vehicles.
Thanks to BMW BluePerformance technology, since 2008
customers in some markets can choose from a large range
of models with particularly clean diesel engines that
­comply with Euro 6 standards or other strict regulations
that apply outside the EU.

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

The electrification of the drivetrain by way of various
hybrid solutions is another vital component of our
­Efficient Dynamics strategy. This enables us to realise
further fuel-saving potential.
Since autumn 2012, the BMW Group has been marketing the models BMW ActiveHybrid 3, BMW ActiveHybrid 5 and
BMW ­ActiveHybrid 7. In 2014, we introduced the plug-in
hybrid BMW i8, with an electric range of approximately
37 kilometres and CO₂ levels of 49 g/km in the EU cycle.
In 2015 and 2016, further plug-in hybrids will be added
to our portfolio. Plug-in hybrid models use up to 50% less
fuel than their combustion-powered equivalents.

ZERO-EMISSIONS LOCAL DRIVING WITH
ELECTRIC DRIVETRAINS

An important component of our Efficient Dynamics
Strategy are our electromobility activities. On the basis
of these activities we introduced the BMW i brand in
2013 and are successively implementing electromobility
in our core brand models.
Since 2007, our project i has been developing completely
new concepts for individual mobility as well as vehicle
architecture and production that integrate sustainable
solutions in an even more innovative fashion along the
entire value chain.

one or add an electric engine (conversion approach).
What we did from the very beginning was to plan new and
independent vehicle concepts (purpose-built approach)
in order to exploit the full potential of the new drivetrain
technology and make it practicable for customers. This
includes intelligent lightweight design – using carbon-­
fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) and a host of new, more
environmentally friendly materials and highly resource-­
efficient production. The result is visionary vehicles that
represent an ideal balance between vehicle weight, range
and driving enjoyment. BMW i is thus creating the basis
for a substantial reduction in CO₂ emissions see Figure 17.

The resulting models of the BMW i sub-brand do not
­simply replace the combustion engine with an electric

expressly for travel between the outskirts and the city
centre. The main focus here is on two requirements:
firstly, that performance is comparable to that of a
­combustion-powered maxi-scooter, and secondly that it
has a high range in practice.
Increasing range with hydrogen and fuel cells
As an alternative to developing purely electric drivetrains,
we are also doing research into hydrogen and fuel cell
technology as further solutions for local emissions-­free
driving with a greater range. Hydrogen is used here as
an energy source that is converted by the fuel cell into
­electricity and water.
CHARGING ELECTRIC VEHICLES — Solar carport concept from DesignworksUSA

Charging electric vehicles with renewable energy
An electric car can only reach its full potential when it
runs on electricity that is as carbon-neutral as possible.
We estimate that around three-quarters of all electric
vehicle owners in Germany recharge their vehicles at
home from renewable energy sources.

BMW i customers can benefit in this regard from the
BMW Group’s strategic partnership with Naturstrom AG.
This gives BMW i customers the option of purchasing
a suitable renewable ­electricity package for charging
their electric vehicles. We also have a partnership with
­Solarwatt, a company that manufactures solar modules
for surfaces like carports and house roofs. This allows
customers themselves to produce green power to
recharge their BMW i3 or BMW i8 ­in their own homes.
In other international markets, for example in France,
the UK, the Netherlands and the USA, we offer our
BMW i customers similar solutions with local partners.
Further markets will follow in 2015.

The BMW Group is collaborating with the Toyota Motor
Corporation (TMC) in this field. Together, we aim to
develop series-ready components by 2020. The partnership is working on tank technologies, fuel cells, an electric engine and a battery, among other things. Both
companies are also cooperating on the development of
technologies for producing lightweight bodies.

FORECAST
We will continue to offer innovative solutions for the diverse
mobility needs of our customers. We are deliberately focusing
our efforts on building a broad technology base so that in the
coming years we can offer tailored solutions worldwide for
wide-ranging individual mobility needs. We will also expand
our range of vehicles that meet the Euro 6 standard.

Product safety

STRATEGIC DIRECTION
The BMW Group protects its customers and other road users
from injury by creating networks of active and passive safety
systems.

As a provider of premium products and premium services
for individual mobility, safety is fundamental to our sense
of product responsibility. This goes for our customers’
safety as well as that of other road users. We take an
­integrated approach to mastering this challenge, which
encompasses not only passive and active safety systems,
but also aspects such as product information, safety
­training, the avoidance of potentially critical materials
as well as minimising emissions in the vehicle interior.
In addition to new legislation on the reduction of fuel
consumption and emissions, carmakers are also facing
increasingly stringent safety regulations. These include
criteria for testing active and passive vehicle safety.
This changes the requirements placed on vehicles, and
new safety technologies have to be developed as a result.

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

For more than 30 years, we have been carrying out systematic research into the causes of accidents and developing technologies and strategies to improve the safety
of all road users. We take an integrated approach to this
task, which means we analyse the entire process chain,
from accident prevention to post-crash applications. Based
on these analyses, we integrate active safety features into
all vehicles to try to prevent accidents from happening
in the first place, and apply passive safety features to
­mitigate their consequences.
In addition, the BMW Group is working with partners
from the industry and research in order to develop a
method of evaluating primarily active safety in a real-life
environment.
Preventing accidents through active and passive safety systems
Active safety includes perfect chassis coordination,
­optimal traction and effective brakes. Electronic chassis
control systems also contribute towards preventing
accidents.

One of the main ways we increase safety is through
driver assistance systems, which are now being increasingly integrated into our model ranges. They play an
important role in making driving safer by providing a
second set of eyes to observe what is happening on the
road in order to warn and support the driver.
One example of this is the warning system with city
braking – a driver assistance system that uses camera
images to analyse the urban traffic situation and warn
the driver of potential collisions with pedestrians. The
system received the Euro NCAP Advanced Award in
2014. As well as for other models, it can also be ordered
for the BMW i3, MINI Cooper and BMW 2 series Active
Tourer and should be available for all of our vehicles in
the future.
The traffic jam assistant is another support function:
in long and monotonous driving situations, for example
in traffic congestion, the vehicle helps to keep the car

feature from 2017. In addition, our range of safety technology products is undergoing rapid expansion, for
example through innovations in chassis control systems
and lighting technology.
Guaranteeing product and service information for customers
Information on the safety of our vehicles and on protecting the health and safety of our customers can be found
in the in-vehicle operating manuals, in printed form or
as an app, and they are also available on the Internet.
This is complemented by vehicle labelling and additional
background information on service, accessories, components and BMW ConnectedRide.
INNOVATIVE SAFETY TECHNOLOGIES IN MOTORCYCLES —

the strain on the driver.
A number of other passive safety systems in our vehicles
also protect the health and safety of road users and save
lives on a daily basis. These include energy-absorbing
crumple zones, safe passenger cells, restraint systems
and air bags.
Setting safety standards with BMW motorcycles
BMW Motorcycles has firmly established safety as part
of its corporate strategy and has developed the integrated
Sicherheit 360° (Safety 360°) concept. The concept is
based on three complementary modules: innovative safety
technologies in the motorcycle, high-quality, functional
driver apparel, and training courses for every driving
level and every terrain.

Since 2013, all BMW Motorcycle models are equipped
with ABS as a standard component. The company is
­acting early to implement ABS in motorcycles. This will
become mandatory in the euro area from 2016 onwards.
According to EU law, all newly registered motorcycles
above 125 ccm must be equipped with ABS from 2016
and all newly homologated motorcycles must have this
SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

The BMW Group is obliged by the applicable legislation
to inform customers about the proper use of its products
and services as well as any potential risks and hazards.
In the European Union, for example, we report on the
fuel economy of our vehicles based on the NEDC (New
European Driving Cycle). We also publish information
on fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions for each vehicle
model on the websites of the individual brands.
Training courses in safe driving
Since 1977, the BMW Group has also been offering training courses in driving safety in order to help protect road
users. Today, we offer some 50 different training courses
in 30 countries worldwide for BMW and MINI cars and
BMW motorcycles. BMW is the first manufacturer of
­premium automobiles to offer a training course with an
electric vehicle – the BMW i3 eDrive Experience. Drivers
learn about the special product features and receive
­comprehensive safety training. In the year 2014, more
than 25,000 participants in driving safety courses learned
how to identify critical driving situations and respond
properly, and how to avoid such situations in the first
place if possible. Over the next few years, these professional Driving Experience courses will be made available
in further markets as part of our international­isation
strategy, so that an even greater number of p
­ articipants
can benefit from them.

Using safe materials
In the early development phase, we evaluate the potential
materials to be used in a product or process to determine
their risk potential and eliminate any problematic mate­r­
ials from the outset. This ensures that all legislation with
regard to product safety, health and the environment is
complied with worldwide for every phase of the vehicle
life cycle (from development to utilisation, and right
through to the recycling stage).

We apply our high BMW Group standards to all current
and future supply materials. Material mixes are analysed,
evaluated and after approval stored in a dedicated BMW
database. As well as all series parts, all auxiliary production substances and process materials such as paint and
adhesives also undergo rigorous qualification processes
that eliminate undesirable materials and specify measures
to be taken in the area of occupational health and safety
and environmental protection.
Avoiding emissions inside the vehicle
Due to our internal commitment to Responsible Care,
the BMW Group has been collaborating with independent
toxicologists since the 1990s in order to ensure that the
targets set by the experts are met in all new vehicles.

By consistently avoiding the integration of substances
that people may be sensitive or allergic to into vehicle
components, the risk of an allergic reaction within the
vehicle interior is reduced to a minimum. The use of
­special interior air filters also significantly reduces the
introduction of allergenic substances such as pollen
from the air outside into the vehicle.

FORECAST
In the coming years, we want to further strengthen both active
and passive safety features. We will focus here on the consist­
ent introduction of warning and emergency brake systems for
all vehicle categories.
We are also expanding our competencies in the areas of
­technologies and methodology. This is in line with our vision of
creating highly automated driving experiences. It will enable
us to offer a range of modern driver assistance systems and to
come another step closer to the ideal of accident-free mobility.

Resource efficiency and
recycling management

STRATEGIC DIRECTION
The BMW Group integrates sustainability throughout the
entire life cycle of its vehicles. It completes materials cycles
in order to grow the business in spite of scarce resources.

Intelligent design and the use of secondary and renewable
raw materials enable us to minimise our consumption
of valuable resources. When optimising our recycling
­structures, we are now preparing for increasing v­ olumes
of electric vehicles in the future.
Resource efficiency and life cycle management are the
main pillars of our sustainability agenda. There are two
good reasons for this. Firstly, we see global scarcity of
resources (e.g. food, water, land, energy and raw mate­r­
ials) as a risk to economic and political stability.
And secondly, efficient use of resources also gives us a
direct competitive advantage. For example, it helps
reduce dependencies on external suppliers and thus mitigate the negative effects of price fluctuations and supply
bottlenecks. This means we have a vital business-based
interest in resource efficiency above and beyond simply

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

complying with legislation such as the end-of-life vehicles
directive.
USING RAW MATERIALS AND RESOURCES INTELLIGENTLY
For us, intelligent use of raw materials and resources
begins long before the time comes to dispose of them.
In the initial development and architecture phase, we
already design our vehicles and processes with a view to
minimising the use of valuable resources.
Making recycling part of the process from the outset
In the early stages of vehicle development, the decisions
our designers and engineers make, including the mater­
ials and components they select, will determine the reusability of our vehicles decades into the future. In line
with our Design for Recycling principle, we create our
vehicles in such a way that their components can largely
be reused or recycled efficiently once the vehicle reaches
the end of its life cycle.
Reducing use of rare earths
How we use rare earths can contribute towards reducing
fuel consumption, for example by increasing the efficiency
of electrical systems.

When employing these valuable raw materials, a careful
balance is drawn between weight, function and costs.
The further development of magnetic materials by BMW’s
materials developers led to a considerable reduction in
the use of rare earths, without any negative functional
impact. For other components, too, it has been possible
to find alternatives to rare earth elements which may
become scarce.
End-of-life vehicle recovery and recycling
Established recovery systems for end-of-life vehicles,
components and materials ensure that they are reintegrated into the raw materials cycle. So we do not consider
end-of-life vehicles as waste to be disposed of, but rather
as a secondary source of raw materials. We recycle 95%
of materials in our current vehicle models.

Steel and iron still make up the largest proportion by weight of materials
used in BMW Group vehicles. The percentage share of each material is not
­comparable with the figures for 2013 due to a refinement of the calculation
method. Weighting of the representative vehicles by number of units began
this year. We also increased the number of representative vehicles, e.g. by
­adding MINI and BMW i models. The influence of materials used in Project i
is not yet m
­ easurable due to the small number of units produced so far.

In the early 1990s – long before the legislation came into
effect – the BMW Group began to build an extensive network within the European Union for the recovery and
recycling of end-of-life vehicles (ELV). Each BMW Group
ELV that is returned complete within this network is
recycled at no charge to the last owner. In cooperation
with its national sales companies, the BMW Group has
installed recovery systems for end-of-life vehicles in 30
countries so far, offering vehicle owners environmentally
friendly recycling and disposal at dedicated recovery centres. Our European dealerships are contractually obligated
to meet the BMW Old Parts Recycling Retail Standard.
SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

New drivetrain concepts, new challenges
The incremental introduction of new drivetrains and the
modified vehicle concepts that result are presenting new
challenges in terms of how we use resources. One ex­
ample is the increased use of components made of innovative, lightweight carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP).
This is the material used in the passenger compartments
of the BMW i3 and BMW i8. BMW also plans to use CFRP
in other models.

CFRP could potentially also be used in mats, rear ­window
shelves, pillar trims, etc.
At our recycling and dismantling centre, we continuously
test recycling concepts for new vehicle components that
are used in hybrid models and electric vehicles. Batteries
from hybrid and electric vehicles can either be integrated
into existing recycling networks or used in 2nd Life
applications.
Using secondary and renewable raw materials
Secondary raw materials are finding more and more
applications in our vehicles. Up to 20% of the thermo­
plastic materials in our automobiles are already made
from recyclates. One example is the substrate used for
the centre console and the door armrest. By increasing
the use of recyclates in our vehicles, we need less crude
oil for the manufacture of polymer materials. This saves
energy and resources.

Wherever it makes technical, business and environmental
sense and is socially acceptable, we replace artificial
­primary materials with natural, renewable materials. The
focus here is on naturally cured leather for the vehicle
interior and biopolymers in technical areas. Alternative
natural fibre materials are also used as a substitute for
the plastics used in the past. Examples of this are the
wool used in seat upholstery, flax, kenaf and sisal fibres
in substrate materials for door panels and rear window
shelves as well as wood fibre in seat recliner coverings.
Example: renewable materials and recyclates in the BMW i3
The interior of the BMW i3 offers door and instrument
panels based on a natural fibre structure, naturally cured
leather and open-pored eucalyptus wood from 100%
FSC®-certified forestry. Up to 25% of the thermoplastic
material in the BMW i3 has been substituted by renewable
materials and recyclates. High-quality PET recyclate is
used for the polyester materials of the seat covers.

FORECAST
In the coming years, we want to further improve our resource
efficiency and increasingly complete our material cycles.
We are also looking into innovative solutions for the reuse
of old batteries from electric cars. The aim is to extend as far
as possible the life cycle of lithium-ion batteries developed
­specifically for use in the BMW i3. To achieve this, we are
developing a number of concepts for reusing batteries after
they have been removed from the vehicle. Used batteries can
be employed, for example, as stationary energy storage units.
This allows them to help optimise use of renewable energy or
reliable energy supply to buildings.
A recycling and dismantling centre modelled on the centre
in Munich (Germany) will be opened in Shenyang (China) in
early 2016.

STRATEGIC DIRECTION
The BMW Group will have permanently changed mobility patterns in selected metropolitan areas by 2020 by introducing
integrated mobility services.
The company will be the leading supplier of premium products
and premium services for individual mobility.

SHAPING THE MOBILITY OF THE FUTURE — Focus on digitalisation

The BMW Group aims to make the entire value chain of
future mobility as sustainable as possible. Environmental
sustainability is a focus here, along with social impact
and economic viability. The challenges of urban mobility
in particular demand change – not only in terms of the
vehicles offered on the market but also with regard to
brand-new mobility services.

We want to shape tomorrow’s mobility. With this in
mind, the BMW Group has introduced the BMW i brand,
offering visionary vehicles and providing innovative
­services for individual mobility. BMW i represents a new
understanding of the “premium” concept, defined chiefly
in terms of sustainability.

DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING SUSTAINABLE
MOBILITY SERVICES

The BMW Group today faces the challenge of recognising
changing global mobility trends early on and meeting
them successfully. Several questions need to be addressed
in this regard: What is the future of individual mobility in
cities with increasingly dense populations? What concepts
are needed in order to make mobility climate-friendly
and easy on resources?

For example, we focus on mobility services in the areas
of car-sharing (e.g. DriveNow), finding parking (e.g.
­ParkNow), recharging (e.g. ChargeNow) and mobility for
business customers (e.g. AlphaCity). We also carry out
continuous research into mobility concepts for the future.

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

BMW i offers innovative services that enhance urban
mobility – both with and without a car. In our efforts to
help shape the cities of the future, we provide intelligent

Car-sharing for business customers with AlphaCity
With the innovative car-sharing product AlphaCity, companies can offer their employees an additional alternative
to other modes of transport, for either business or private
use. While DriveNow is specifically aimed at private customers, AlphaCity is a sustainable solution for businesses
and their employees. As the vehicles can be used by a
number of employees, the company benefits from the
opportunity to reduce the size of its vehicle fleet and thus
to save on costs. For employees, AlphaCity is an attractive additional perk as they can use the vehicles outside
office hours and at the weekend at very reasonable
conditions.

AlphaCity is currently available in nine countries:
­Germany, Austria, France, the Netherlands, England,
Denmark, Belgium, Spain and Italy.
Creating sustainable parking patterns with ParkNow
ParkNow is an app and Web-based service that is fundamentally changing parking patterns. First, it makes the
urban parking situation more transparent. And it also
allows users to book their parking space in advance and
then be guided directly to their selected space. So P
­ arkNow
users are also protecting the environment as the traffic
caused by drivers searching for parking spaces, which
accounts for a significant share of traffic volume in some
cities, is no longer an issue.
Convenient electromobility with BMW i 360° ELECTRIC
One example of our holistic approach to electromobility
is our 360° ELECTRIC product and service package.
It includes recharging both at home with the BMW i wallbox and on the go at public charging points that accept
ChargeNow – a recharge card that enables access and
payment at a large number of charging points installed by
various providers. 360° ELECTRIC also includes Assist­
ance Services with ConnectedDrive services designed
specifically for electromobility as well as further service
and repair offers. In addition, BMW Add-on Mobility
gives customers access to conventional BMW vehicles for
long-distance travel as well as the car-sharing service

ChargeNow: Cross-border and multi-provider access to
a network of partner charging points
ChargeNow is an important component that is paving
the way to sustainable electromobility. It makes recharging at public charging points as simple and transparent
as possible. With ChargeNow, BMW i drivers can quickly
find one of 24,000 public charging points in a large and
constantly growing partnership network. Drivers can
locate ChargeNow charging points via the BMW i
­ConnectedDrive services in the navigation unit, using a
smartphone, or on the website. Locating and using public
charging points couldn’t be easier. Since November 2014,
for example, BMW i customers from Germany, Austria
and Belgium have been able to use their ChargeNow card
to gain cross-border roaming access to the entire charging
infrastructure of all three countries.

Find the perfect parking space with JustPark
JustPark is an online market place for parking spaces
that connects owners of unoccupied spaces with those
searching for one. The service was launched in London
and is now available throughout the UK. This reduces
traffic volume caused by drivers searching for parking
spaces, leading to lower CO₂ emissions and less time
wasted, as the driver can navigate directly to the reserved
parking space.

Analysing scenarios
Our traffic researchers and engineers are hard at work
on finding solutions for the mobility of tomorrow. For
example, since 1998, the Institute for Mobility Research (ifmo),
a research organisation that is part of the BMW Group,
has been studying the mobility challenges that various
means of transport will be facing in the future. The institute’s research findings are incorporated into the strategy
­process of the BMW Group.

In 2001, ifmo started drafting future scenarios of various
means of transporting people and goods in Germany.
These research-based forecasts have since been extended

losing sight of issues such as affordability, traffic safety
and minimal environmental impact. In 2014, the
BMW Group was involved chiefly in urban projects in
Hamburg (Germany), Chengdu (China) and Indore
(India).

In many cases, the BMW Group collaborates nationally
and internationally with a number of different local,
regional and pan-regional partners in order to test, for
example, electromobility in day-to-day life and to improve
its application in practice.

Research focus on mobility in the world’s megacities
The research project Mobility Trends in Cutting Edge Cities
analyses mobility trends in Paris, Vienna, Singapore,
Santiago de Chile and Tokyo. The majority of the people
in these cities still own a car, but also use other modes
of transport, deciding on a day-to-day basis which one
they will choose.

Another research project, new utilisation concepts for
individual mobility, looks at the market potential of
mobility services in the sharing economy. Who is willing
in principle to share a car, and what sustainable mobility
strategies can be developed for the future based on this?
A further project examines the effect of information and
communications technologies (ICT) on physical mobility.
It has become clear as a result of this research that ICT
cannot replace physical mobility. People do not travel less
due to new virtual technology, but they travel differently.

The BMW Group sees itself as a driving force in terms of mobility
research and would like to continue to take a leading role in
shaping sustainable urban mobility. For this reason, we have
set up the Center of Competence Urban Mobility. Together with
cities and other stakeholders, the Center will work towards
solving urban traffic issues with the help of our products and
mobility services. With this in mind we continually strive to
identify new trends at an early stage and to translate the most
promising research findings into practical applications.
In the coming years, we intend to further expand our car-sharing
service both in Germany and internationally, increasingly
­integrating electric cars.
Online applications and networking opportunities will change
the face of future urban mobility. We will continue to work
on intelligent networking of mobility services (DriveNow,
­ChargeNow, ParkNow) in order to make urban mobility more
flexible, convenient and sustainable.

Sustainable Mobility Project – shaping urbanity together
The BMW Group is participating in the three-year Sustain­
able Mobility Project II initiated by the World Business
Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). The

together with selected city administrations to promote
sustainable urban mobility. The goal is to collaborate with

FOCUS ON THE CUSTOMER — Consultation at the BMW Welt

STRATEGIC DIRECTION
Compared with our competition, the BMW Group is top in
terms of customer satisfaction in the respective market
­segments when it comes to vehicle concepts and reliability
as well as the sales and support experience we offer.
We provide our customers with all the information necessary
to make a careful and deliberated decision when purchasing
a vehicle.

Our corporate Strategy Number ONE puts customers at
the centre of all we do. Their satisfaction with the products
and services of the BMW Group is key to our current
and future business success.
High levels of customer satisfaction offer the BMW Group
a number of opportunities. Satisfied customers are more
loyal, upgrade their vehicle purchases over time and are
more likely to recommend the dealership, the model or
the service they have used (upselling potential). They also
tend to avail of other BMW Group services (cross-selling
potential). Consolidating and increasing customer satisfaction is therefore very important for our long-term
­business success.
SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

And we are aware of the fact that customer satisfaction is
not only created while customers are using our vehicles
and services, but that the services that come before and
after purchase also play a decisive role. So the general
brand image of the BMW Group is also very important
when it comes to customer satisfaction. In many markets,
in addition to the classical factors such as product and
service quality, the overall image of companies is becoming increasingly dependent on their image as a sustainable
company.
Achieving a high degree of customer satisfaction is the
responsibility both of our corporate headquarters and
of our international subsidiaries. The sales organisations
in our largest markets (such as the USA, China and
­Germany) report regularly to a specially established committee which deals exclusively with customer satisfaction.
Since 2011, the CustomerFirst initiative has been focussing on increasing customer focus in all areas of the company. The initiative’s activities aim to align all processes
and decisions towards customer benefit.
We are aware of the fact that the product recalls by a
number of carmakers last year led to a considerable
amount of public attention. As in previous years, the
BMW Group took voluntary, immediate and consistent

action in such cases in 2014. Whenever necessary or
advisable from a customer perspective, we called back all

Customer satisfaction

Since 2010, we have been gathering transparent feedback
from our BMW and MINI customers on the performance
of our dealerships in several important markets. This is
based on an ongoing customer satisfaction survey which
we carry out by telephone, in writing and online. We
publish the results of this survey by way of a 5-star rating
system and short customer statements on the website
of the respective dealership. This level of transparency
reflects the BMW Group’s customer focus strategy.
Experiencing sustainability in sales and services
The BMW Group wants its customers to experience what
sustainability means to us. Selected sales facilities have
therefore been constructed as Green Buildings with low
energy consumption, high levels of energy efficiency as
well as natural light and air conditioning. We have also
ensured that Green Building requirements are being met
for new builds by integrating them into the Europe-wide
Retail Standards for our retail partners.

Sustainability is also an integral part of our sales training.
Our goal is for the sales staff at our dealerships to be so
well informed that they are able to answer any questions
customers may have on the BMW Group’s sustainability
activities.

ETHICALLY CORRECT ADVERTISING

The BMW Group develops central advertising campaigns
for its brands. The campaigns are then adapted by those
responsible for the respective country markets, ensuring
that local and national circumstances and requirements
are complied with. We are careful to ensure that our advertising complies with all relevant legislation and that no
social groups are discriminated against. The BMW Group
has its own standards and behaviour guidelines with
regard to advertising, which are subject to continuous
review. Internal committees help us to ensure that our
advertising complies with these principles and other
­ethical criteria.
The BMW Group does not offer any products whose sale
is prohibited in specific markets. We provide our customers with all the information necessary to make a careful
and deliberated decision. No essential information is
­concealed or presented in a misleading manner.
Our principles also include incorporating sustainability
as a theme in advertising. This is done both by means
of stand-alone campaigns as well as through continuous
vehicle-integrated communication. Some examples of
stand-alone campaigns are advertising for the Efficient
Dynamics models and the online CO₂ Finder.
Our local marketing specialists are responsible for implementing our advertising campaigns in each country.
The BMW Group is not aware of having violated any regu­
lations pertaining to advertising during the reporting
period.
IMPROVING EVEN FURTHER THROUGH CUSTOMER SURVEYS

In 2014, we surveyed approximately 2.3 million customers
in 90 markets to find out about their needs and experiences. This feedback is then incorporated into the development and optimisation of our products and services.

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

67

Our surveys show that our customers’ needs vary considerably from country to country. We must take these
national and cultural differences into account. To do this,
we constantly carry out customer surveys. In 2012, we
implemented stricter standardisation requirements for
the customer satisfaction surveys carried out in our
­subsidiaries in order to ensure the completeness and
comparability of the results.

were approximately 1,700 of these product experts in
over 1,000 dealerships worldwide. The Product Genius’
task is not to sell vehicles but to offer the customer
­comprehensive advice – with no pressure to purchase.
The first new Brand and Retail Stores have now been
established on shopping strips in cities like Rome and
­Brussels. And Future Retail also provides professional
HR management to help dealerships find and train the
right employees.

The BMW Group wants to further enhance the satisfaction
of its customers in the coming years and to expand our direct
contact to them. In order to achieve this, we will gradually
extend our customer surveys and our Future Retail programme
to more countries.

FROM CAPE TOWN TO MUNICH
The BMW 318i – affectionately nicknamed “Percy” – has been
going for more than 20 years, clocking up over 400,000 kilometres. And it still managed the journey from Cape Town to
Munich without major incident.
This was especially important to its owner Mike Lomberg,
a test driver from South Africa. After all, Percy was the reason
why Lomberg regained a sense of mobility and independence
again when he was confined to a wheelchair after suffering a
car accident 25 years ago. Out of sheer gratitude, Lomberg
decided to return the old BMW 318i to its manufacturer to
have it recycled. His friends Rowan Jelley, Ian Scrimgeour and
Max Cromarty instantly agreed to help him. It took the three
South Africans at least three months to complete the 17,000kilometre trip, during the course of which they met all sorts of
wonderful people from their continent. “Percy’s an engineering masterpiece. The car didn’t just have a positive impact on
Mike Lomberg’s life, it made a dream come true for us in many
ways,” said Scrimgeour when the group arrived in Munich on
13 July 2014.
The three have documented their trip
and stories.

Our management
approach

The BMW Group aims to be not only the leading, but
also the most sustainable, premium provider of individual
mobility. We therefore pursue a policy of comprehensive,
Group-wide environmental management. The company
integrates environmental considerations into all its major
investment decisions at an early stage, setting itself ambitious targets and using key environmental indicators to
constantly track and monitor how it is performing. We
also transfer best-practice solutions from within the company to the entire production network and are convinced
that by taking farsighted action now and by integrating
environmental principles into all business processes we
can achieve added value both in terms of the environment
and our business.

We have been able to achieve reductions in the past eight
years in the following areas:

Energy consumption

– 34.2%

Water consumption

– 33.1%

Process wastewater

– 42.7%

Waste for disposal

– 74.0%

CONSOLIDATING ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
WITHIN THE ORGANISATION

Environmental protection is part of our sustainability
management system. The steering committee of our
international environmental protection network controls
environmental management under the direction of the
Group Representative for Environmental Protection.
Every machine, every building and every area at each
production site is assigned to an operator. That operator
is responsible for the products, processes, machines and
technical systems in his or her allocated area as well as
their environmental impact.
Sharing best practices
In line with our Clean Production philosophy, we design
our manufacturing processes for minimum environmental
impact and resource consumption. We underscored this
commitment in 2001 when we signed the International
Declaration on Cleaner Production of the United Nations
Environment Programme.

Environmental improvements that have been effective
at one location are implemented at other locations wherever possible. Our six competence centres (for water,
waste, energy, emissions, training and the environmental
management system) are staffed by environmental
experts from the different plants and by specialists from
Corporate Environmental Protection. They discuss legal
requirements and best-practice solutions with technology
experts from the production plants and develop reference
systems on which to base future planning and process
improvements.
Considering environmental issues when making investments
One main method of enhancing resource efficiency is to
take account of environmental aspects when planning
any new investments. This allows potential improvements
in efficiency to be identified and implemented at an
early stage. If they are found to be insufficient, we seek
out more environmentally friendly alternatives.

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

Establishing environmental management systems
The BMW Group has established environmental management systems at all of its production plants and plans to
install them at all future facilities. These encompass both
the corporate planning departments (e.g. Production and
Development) as well as the network of international
locations. With the exception of the motorcycle plant in
Manaus, Brazil (which is certified according to the
­Brazilian national standard), these systems are certified in
accordance with ISO 14001. The systems at the German
and Austrian sites have undergone additional external
audits and meet European Eco-Management and Audit
Scheme (EMAS) standards. The BMW Group thus has
environmental management systems in place at 100% of
its production plants. We have also installed environmental
management systems at our dealerships in Germany,
Austria and Switzerland. All German dealerships, as well
as six others in Europe (in Vienna, Zurich, Rome, Milan,
Madrid and Barcelona) are already certified in accordance
with ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001.
Requiring environmental protection from partners and suppliers
As well as ensuring that environmental standards are
complied with and improved at its own production plants,
the BMW Group expects its partners and suppliers to
do the same. We require proof from our main suppliers
that they have an environmental management system
in place see Chapter 5.

We also work closely with our joint venture partners
SGL Group and Brilliance Automotive Ltd. to implement
continuous improvement in the area of environmental
protection. For example, our joint venture with SGL
Automotive Carbon Fibers in Moses Lake (USA) uses
renewable hydropower to produce its carbon fibres.

RECOGNISING AND PROTECTING BIODIVERSITY
The BMW Group takes ownership of the environmental impact
of its activities. Part of this responsibility involves researching
the impact of our production processes on the animal and plant
world. At certain locations, for example at our testing centre
in Aschheim close to Munich, we have gathered evidence of
this impact. As a result we gained knowledge about the ­existing
animal and plant species and were able to preserve or even
improve the biodiversity at that location. In Aschheim, we identified, for example, the butterfly species Polyommatus b­ ellargus
and Colias hyale/alfacariensis as well as the grasshopper
­Oedipoda caerulescens – all of which are on Germany’s red list
of endangered species – and we are taking measures to protect
the stocks of these species.

With an average of 1.29 kg of VOC emissions per vehicle
produced, we are also below the strict maximum levels
stipulated in Germany which we apply to all plants worldwide. There is only one exception, a plant at which the
national maximum levels are of course complied with and
for which we are already preparing further VOC reductions. Emissions per vehicle produced dropped by 18.9%
in 2014. This is mainly due to the fact that the retrofitting
of the paint shop at the Dadong plant in China with an
exhaust air purification system had a full-year effect for the
first time. These are some of the ways we made a significant contribution towards lower environmental impact.

F.22 Solvent emissions per vehicle produced

In the coming year, this kind of biodiversity research will also
be introduced at selected international production plants.
The research will be based on a set of BMW Group biodiversity
guidelines.

Minimising environmental damage from
volatile organic compounds (VOC)
In our Group-wide environmental efforts, we also aim
to minimise the impact on the environment of our VOC
emissions. By the year 2020, we aim to reduce VOC
­emissions by 45% compared to the reference year 2006.

At the end of 2014, we had reduced VOC emissions by
48.6% compared to 2006. This means that we have
already more than achieved the target we set ourselves.
However, we will continue to reduce emissions through
to 2020.

STRATEGIC DIRECTION
Our vision is to achieve a completely carbon-neutral energy
supply for the BMW Group. One of the main levers we use
to do this is energy efficiency. By 2020, we plan to reduce
energy consumption per vehicle produced by 45% compared
with 2006.

The BMW Group is continually reducing its energy consumption and is intensifying its efforts to produce more
power in-house and to use energy from local renewable
sources. The company also actively supports the expansion
of renewable energy. This enables us to increase our
autonomy and profitability and ensure that our production
is not impacted by energy bottlenecks. At the same time
we are reducing our environmental impact and making
sure that we work as efficiently as possible with scarce
raw materials.
The BMW Group uses the most environmentally friendly
and sustainably profitable energy source at each production plant. Security of supply also plays a role here.

IMPROVING EFFICIENCY OF PROCESSES AND BUILDINGS

We monitor and optimise our energy consumption on an
ongoing basis. For this purpose, we use an energy management system based on the environmental management
systems ISO 14001 and EMAS. In addition, we are also
continually improving the environmental management
systems on the basis of internal and external audits.
We set ourselves ambitious goals that we aim to achieve
with the aid of the latest technologies and continuous
optimisation of vehicle production processes.
These are some examples of our process improvements:
aste heat utilisation at the Landshut plant
–	W
At our Landshut (Germany) facility, heat exchangers

enable us to reuse the waste heat from the foundry for
heating and cooling. The waste heat provides hot water
for the plant and is also fed into special machines that
cool the production process. This saves us over €1 million annually and also helps us to achieve a positive
effect for the environment. In future, 10,000 tonnes of

CO₂ will be saved per year and energy consumption
will sink by 15,000 MWh.

The resulting reduction in energy costs in the face of
­rising medium-term energy prices makes a significant
contribution towards the BMW Group becoming more
profitable and more competitive.

ustainable production through intelligent energy
–	Sdata
management

The introduction of the intelligent energy data management (iEDMS) system, which is part of the BMW Group
production concept “Industrie 4.0”, has enabled us to
optimise energy consumption of building and supply
structures at selected facilities. This system captures and
evaluates all relevant data. Worldwide, the BMW Group
aims to reduce its energy consumption by up to 7% by
applying iEDMS at our production plants.

We now use combined heat and power systems (CHP) at
a total of eight locations and are continuing to expand the
CHP system at the Landshut plant. These systems allow
us to utilise both the electricity generated as well as the
­resulting waste heat.

AQUIFER PROJECT IN DINGOLFING
In 2013, in collaboration with the Technical University of
­Munich, the BMW Group launched a research project on innovative temporary storage of thermal energy in a high-temperature
“aquifer” store. The basic idea of aquifer storage is to tempor­
arily store superfluous thermal energy that is not immediately
needed (for example in summer months when thermal energy
is generated in combined heat and power systems) 500 to 700
metres below the earth’s surface and to draw it back for use
in winter. This is a unique project worldwide and is making an
important contribution towards fundamental research in the
area of thermal storage. If it is successful, new opportunities for
decentralised energy production and storage will be opened up,
and this could lead to significant CO² savings. The Bavarian
Ministry of Economics, Infrastructure, Transport and Technology
is providing approximately €4.5 million in funding for the project,
as it could make an important contribution towards the transformation of the energy industry in Bavaria.

DESIGNING SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS

The reference system for sustainable construction is the
basis for new-building projects and building conversions
at the BMW Group. It sets down principles and concepts
for buildings throughout the BMW Group and enables us
to monitor the measures taken during the individual
project phases. The aim is to minimise consumption of
energy and resources during all phases of a buildings life
cycle – from planning, construction, use and renovation
right up to renaturation. This is not only a cost-saving
measure – we also aim to have as little impact on the
environment as possible. Based on this reference system,
we were able, for example, to receive LEED (Leadership
in Energy and Environmental Design) certification for all
buildings erected for the production of the BMW i3 at our
Leipzig plant.

TAKING ADVANTAGE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY

In addition to the intelligent use of energy, we are also
focusing on renewable energy expansion. Our vision is to
draw 100% of our energy requirements from renewable
sources. Instead of relying on energy from one specific
source, we will take a look at local conditions and decide
which concept makes most sense at each location.
In 2010, we implemented a development plan to assess
the potential of each production facility and we are now
­putting it into practice step by step.

RAISING EMPLOYEE AND MANAGER AWARENESS OF
HOW TO DEAL WITH ENERGY

Teaching trainees how to deal with energy efficiently is
an integral part of vocational training at the BMW Group.
In addition, we offer courses on value-creating production
systems, a systematic approach to improving efficiency
in technical and administrative processes that addresses
the entire workforce. Using a training demonstrator,
employees can actively learn how to use energy efficiently.
In summer 2014, we also published an interactive online
training module for all employees in Germany and Austria
on the subject of energy efficiency in the BMW Group.
We now have an English version for our international
locations.
FURTHER REDUCING ENERGY CONSUMPTION PER VEHICLE

Our efforts to continually improve energy efficiency
pay off. For example, in 2014 we were able to further
reduce our energy consumption per vehicle to 2.25 MWh
(–4.7% compared to the previous year see Figure 25).
This represents an improvement of 34.2% over the base

of reducing energy consumption per vehicle by 45%
compared with 2006.

FORECAST
The BMW Group will continue to successfully pursue its energy
targets in the coming years. We will continue to expand the
use of renewable energy and, from 2015 onwards, we will participate in the energy market with tried and tested combined
heat and power systems. This will be our contribution towards
securing a stable energy supply. In addition, we are collabo­r­
ating with a number of universities to develop new approaches
and methods. Two current activities that we will continue to
pursue in the coming years are the Aquifer project in Dingolfing
(Germany) that explores the possibility of underground thermal
storage and a research project into how to find ways to use
spent batteries from BMW i vehicles as Second Life batteries
for flexible stationary storage of renewable energy.

STRATEGIC DIRECTION
The BMW Group aims to be the leader in using renewable
­energy for production and value creation. Our vision is to
achieve CO²-free energy supply.

The consequences of climate change are highly relevant
for the BMW Group. Global climate change affects the
behavioural patterns of our customers. At the same time,
in order to counteract climate change, many governments
are creating new framework conditions through fleet
emissions targets, new fuel taxes, efficiency labels and
other measures such as emissions trading systems. And
climate change can lead to extreme weather conditions,
resulting in bottlenecks in the supply chain and on the
production line.
Reducing CO₂ emissions along the entire value chain
makes sense for the BMW Group, both from an environmental and from a business perspective (due to lower
energy consumption, avoidance of CO₂ charges as well
as attractive offers that fulfil the requirements of many
of our fleet customers’ green car policies). With this in
mind, we are taking action along our entire value chain:

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

In this area we continually reduce emissions caused by
the use and disposal of our products, in our supply
chain, in transport logistics and by employees commuting to and from work (Scope 3). 70% of these Scope 3
emissions are generated during the utilisation phase
(not including upstream fuel). With our Efficient
Dynamics strategy see Chapter 3.2 ­we are continually
reducing the average fleet emissions of CO₂ per kilometre worldwide – in 2014 by 4.4% to 152 g of CO₂/km
(2013: 159 g of CO₂/km). The average CO₂ emissions of
the three main regions were 130 g of CO₂/km (EU-28),
168 g of CO₂/km (USA) and 176 g of CO₂/km (China).
Another 20% of the Scope 3 emissions were generated
in the upstream supply chain. We constantly work with
our suppliers to look for further possibilities to use
resources more efficiently see Chapter 5.3. With Design
for Recycling, we ensure that as many of the components as possible flow back into the materials cycle
once the vehicle has reached the end of its life cycle.
This leads to lower CO₂ emissions in the value chain
see Chapter 3.4. And finally, we increase the CO₂ efficiency of our transport logistics on an ongoing basis.

REDUCING CO² EMISSIONS AT OUR PRODUCTION PLANTS

For many years now, the BMW Group has been working
to use resources more efficiently and reduce CO₂ emissions at its production facilities. And we will continue
along this road.
In order to realise our vision of CO₂-free energy supply,
we follow a road map that includes medium to long-term
targets as well as specific action that has to be taken in
the short term see Chapter 4.2. At the same time, investSUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

ment in medium and long-term measures has to make
economic sense. For this reason, we monitor and analyse
regulatory requirements worldwide as well as future
trends in the energy sector, and we take this into consideration when making decisions.
Some of the main points on our road map are the con­
tinuous improvement of energy efficiency, use and
expansion of energy and CO₂-efficient combined heat
and power systems, focused expansion of renewable

energy supply capacity and the purchase of certificates
of origin for parts of our energy supply.
In 2014, total emissions in our production network
amounted to 1,369,877 tonnes of CO₂ (2013: 1,322,316
tonnes). This is only a slight increase of 3.6%, in spite of
a significant increase of 7.6% in production volume. The
ongoing reduction in CO₂ emissions per vehicle p
­ roduced
demonstrates that we have already made considerable
progress along this road. Emissions per vehicle produced
decreased by 2.9% to 0.66 tonnes of CO₂ (2013: 0.68
tonnes of CO₂ per vehicle produced). We were also able
to increase the share of green energy to 48% of energy
purchased in 2013 and to 51% in 2014.

CHOOSING LOW EMISSIONS OPTIONS IN LOGISTICS

The global transport volume required to supply our
­production plants with materials, to deliver our vehicles
and to supply spare parts to the markets has grown
­considerably in the past few years. This is primarily due
to an increase in global production and sales volume,
combined with regional shifts in these volumes. Above-­
average growth in North America and Asia means that
long transport distances must be covered.
The increase in transport volume in recent years has also
led to more CO₂ emissions caused by transport logistics.
To keep these emissions as low as possible, we are optimising our logistics based on the following principles:

–	Production follows the market.
e are continually increasing the percentage of
–	Wlow-carbon
modes of transport.

Improved energy efficiency, the use of highly efficient and environmentally
sustainable combined heat and power systems (CHP) as well as renewable
energy led to a reduction in CO₂ emissions per vehicle produced in the
­reporting period of 2.9% to 0.66 tonnes (2013: 0.68).

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

An overview of our transport capacity
In 2014, the BMW Group had a total transport volume
of approximately 37.2 billion tonne-kilometres, emitting
around 1.52 million tonnes of CO₂ in the process.

Compared to 2013, transport volume increased by 10.2%.
This is due on the one hand to an increase of approximately
7.9% in the number of BMW and MINI vehicles produced
and shipped. On the other hand, system limits for the
collection of data to encompass additional transport volume were extended. Total CO₂ emissions rose by 9.7%
compared to the previous year; excluding new volumes
the increase was 5.6%. Shifts in the ratios of modes of
transport used can likewise be attributed mainly to the
extension of the system limits for data acquisition
see Figure 28.

­(material supplies to plants and spare parts delivery) for BMW and MINI vehicles in Germany, the UK, the USA, South Africa, China, Thailand, India and CKD/SKD locations as well as for delivery of spare parts to the parts supply centre ZTA in
­Dingolfing (Germany). Outbound volumes (distribution of vehicles and spare parts) are included up to arrival at the distribution centres in the markets worldwide as well as for some markets up to arrival at the dealerships.

Expanding the use of low-carbon modes of transport
We are continually increasing the share of low-carbon
modes of transport. We give rail transport preference
over road transport wherever possible.

For example, we have for years been using a daily train
from the greater urban areas of Hanover, Wuppertal and
Frankfurt to supply each of our Bavarian plants. This
strategy enables us to avoid some 30,000 truck trips per
year, saving more than 13,000 tonnes of carbon emissions
in the process. We also make a significant contribution
to relieving the congestion on traffic routes. Since 2014,

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

all three of these railway connections have been running
entirely on electricity from renewable sources.
Applying a rail strategy in order to secure capacities
We developed a rail strategy to secure sufficient rail
capacity for our vehicle distribution. By applying this
strategy we were able to secure for the long term approx­
imately 75% of the relevant covered-wagon rail freight
capacity available in Central Europe. For this purpose, two
of our transportation service providers are investing in
­additional covered railcars. By 2015, we will have at our
disposal over 300 new, state-of-the-art covered wagons –

83

all new wagons will be equipped with “whisper brakes”
that significantly reduce noise emissions from the trains.
We increased the average volume of rail transport of
BMW Group vehicles from the plants to 63.3% in 2014.
This was up from 60.7% the previous year see Figure 29.

At our production plants, we will continue in the coming year to
work on our vision of a CO²-free energy supply for our locations.
One example of how we are reducing CO² emissions in 2015 is
the commissioning of a biogas-fired combined heat and power
system to supply energy to our plant in South Africa. We will
also further reduce CO² emissions upstream and downstream

Promoting sustainable mobility for our employees
Staff commuting is a major item on the BMW Group’s
logistics balance sheet. Here, too, we try to keep our
impact on the environment as low as possible. Among
the measures that are in place are our plant buses which
reduce the number of individual drives to work.

In Germany, 42% of all employees travelled to work by
plant bus or public transport in 2014, and another 7% by
bicycle or on foot. The carbon footprint for employees
at our German locations was 4.5 kg of CO₂ per employee
and day in 2014 (2013: 4.6 kg).

Waste management

STRATEGIC DIRECTION
By 2020, the BMW Group aims to reduce waste per vehicle
produced by 45% compared to 2006.
We want to reduce all waste for disposal to a minimum, to the
extent that this is technically and legally possible. We will
achieve this by improving our waste separation processes and
working hard to find further recycling and reuse options for
the individual waste types.

With raw materials becoming increasingly scarce worldwide, the BMW Group engages in recycling manage­
ment throughout material life cycles. Part of this entails
­continuously optimising our processes and reducing
waste volume. Because what we think of as waste is often
a valuable resource, which we try to use intelligently.

AVOIDING AND RECYCLING WASTE

When we recycle materials or residual materials, we
­comply with the five-step hierarchical model set down
by the European Union.

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

GLOBAL CHALLENGE — waste avoidance at the BMW Group plant
in Spartanburg (USA)

1.	Prevention: Where possible, we avoid creating waste
in the first place. This is the best solution, both in
­economic and environmental terms.
2.	Reuse: We reuse any viable waste material immediately.
Otherwise we prepare it for reuse in its original area
of application.
3.	Recycle: If reuse is not an option, we recycle the ma­
terial in such a way that we can reintroduce it to the
­cycle. It can then replace primary raw materials.
4.	Recovery: We incinerate most non-recyclable waste
materials. We also use other recovery options such as
filling caverns in salt mines.
5.	Disposal: Only the small volume of non-recyclable
waste that is then left over is earmarked as waste for
disposal.

In order to comply with this target hierarchy we focus

materials on the same machine (closed loop) or to
first prepare them and then reuse them (post-industry

vehicle production came from. Old plastic containers
go through a recycling process that produces new

MANAGING WASTE VOLUMES

FORECAST

The BMW Group’s own waste information system (ABIS)
is used to decide which disposal procedure is most suitable for each type of residual material. The method specified is then implemented at all plants, provided that there
is a suitable disposal provider in the respective country.
ABIS was introduced at our new plant in Araquari
­(Brazil) in 2014.

We already achieved our aim of reducing waste volume by
45% by 2020 compared to the base year 2006. In spite of this,
we will continue to minimise the share of waste for disposal in
2015, and will integrate as many residual materials as possible
into a complete life cycle management system.

ABIS is also used to document the individual waste flows
and categorises waste as hazardous or safe in accordance
with country-specific regulations. There were no incidences of the import or export of treated or untreated
hazardous waste in the reporting period.

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

Due to local legislation in Shenyang (China), the BMW Group
operates a wastewater treatment system for all wastewater
generated by its Tiexi plant. In the past, the filter cake from
this wastewater treatment system has been disposed of in a
landfill. In future, we will try to find other recycling possibil­
ities in the Chinese province of Liaoning, where the plant is
located.

STRATEGIC DIRECTION
By 2020, the BMW Group will have reduced water consumption and process wastewater by 45% per vehicle produced
compared to 2006. Our vision is to achieve wastewater-free
production processes.

Water is becoming an ever scarcer resource: over onethird of the global population live in countries with
­inadequate water supply. At the same time, access to
clean drinking water is a basic human need. As a result,
careful use of this resource is becoming more and more
important. We are working hard to reduce our water consumption and are developing wastewater-free processes
for our production lines.
Currently, there is no risk to water supply at the
BMW Group’s production plants, even though we are
active in countries with high water risk, such as South
Africa, the USA and China. However, in these countries
in particular, we are continuing to reduce our water
­consumption in order to help preserve a resource that is
very scarce in these regions. In the USA, for example, we
reduced water consumption by 60% between 2006 and
2014. We try to use drinking water only when it is necesSUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

sary for reasons of hygiene. We aim to gradually increase
use of process water (industrial water) and hence reduce
our consumption of drinking water. We want our wastewater to contain only as many substances as can be
­broken down naturally.
86% of the water used by the BMW Group comes from
the public drinking water system. 14% is groundwater.
We are planning in general to reduce use of drinking
water at our production plants. There was no consumption of water from sensitive sources (i.e. water from
­conservation areas) during the reporting period.
Due to legal requirements the limits are regularly controlled. BMW Group water guidelines provide worldwide
standards on how to handle substances that could be
hazardous to the water supply. These standards usually
exceed the local requirements.

SAVING RESOURCES THROUGH STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNOLOGY —
Paint shop at BMW Brilliance Automotive plant in Tiexi (China)

REDUCING WATER CONSUMPTION

We use the environmental management system ISO 14001
to manage our water consumption. The three largest water
consumers at the BMW Group are the sanitary facilities
for our workforce (45%), evaporation mainly at cooling
towers (around 33%) and the production processes, in
particular at the paint shops (21%). We are continuously
improving our resource efficiency in all three areas by:

–	Replacing sanitary fittings with water-efficient versions.
radually replacing open cooling towers with closed

and using groundwater for cooling. This allows
used water to be reintroduced into the system.

waterless processes (for example dry separation
at the paint plants).

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

One specific example is the recycling system we retro­
fitted to improve wastewater processing from the paint
shop at our plant in Dingolfing (Germany). Up to
18,000 m³ of fresh water per year is now saved at the
plant.
Water consumption per vehicle was 2.18 m³ in 2014.
This represents a reduction of 33.1% compared to the
base year 2006 see Figure 32.
Finding individual solutions to conflicts in meeting targets
In the reporting period, although we faced a number of
challenges such as large construction projects and
unscheduled maintenance work with washing and cleaning losses, we were able to maintain the previous year’s
level of consumption. However, we did run into some
conflicts when it came to meeting our targets, so individual solutions had to be found. For example, although
changing the paint process from wet to dry (dry separ­
ation) does reduce water consumption, it also creates
stone powder, which must be disposed of. Our Leipzig
plant developed a solution to this conflict by making
the stone powder available for use by a cement plant.

We plan to further reduce our water consumption in the coming
years. To achieve this, we will continue to close the water
cycles in the paint shops and in engine production as well as
replace old sanitary facilities and open cooling towers when
they have reached the end of their life cycles.

Recycling systems process this kind of wastewater so that
it can be reused in the same or other process steps:
Two specific examples:

had a full year effect for the first time. Using membrane
technology, the anolyte wastewater is purified and
returned to the production cycle.

In 2014, the water consumption per vehicle produced
was 0.47 m³ see Figure 33. This was the same volume as
in the previous year and represents a drop of 43% compared to 2006. We have therefore already almost reached
our goal of reducing consumption by 45% by 2020.

Our global supply chain network makes a major contribution to value creation and innovative strength, and
hence to the success of the BMW Group. Our suppliers
therefore play a significant role in helping us to achieve
our sustainability goals and in the contribution the
BMW Group makes towards the sustainable development
of society as a whole.
Our collaboration with our suppliers is based on common
visions and convictions. This entails a mutual understanding of product and production quality, innovative
strength, security of supply and competitive prices as
well as the continuous integration of our sustainability
goals into all production and business processes. In times
of complex global supply chains, involving a large number
of suppliers and sub-suppliers, these goals present a
­considerable challenge but also a great opportunity.
As part of our global growth, the BMW Group is shifting its
value creation along the supply chain even more strongly
towards respective sales markets. Besides reducing currency
risks, local sourcing offers numerous additional benefits.
It both helps us support communities and regions and also
improves our logistics, resulting in lower CO₂ emissions.
For example, we locally source approximately 60% of the
goods and services needed to manufacture vehicles at our
largest production plant in Germany. At other production
plants as well, we make sure that we create value locally.

risk management enables us to ensure

that all BMW AG suppliers, both of direct and indirect
goods and services, comply with sustainability stand­

	We have developed our own method of carrying out
this comprehensive risk analysis of relevant supply
chains: we model the supply chains, gather the data of
the relevant suppliers and evaluate the sustainability of
the suppliers right back to the raw material extraction

suppliers’ CO₂ emissions, water and energy consumption. In order to ensure transparency of resource
­consumption in the supplier network, BMW AG was
the first German carmaker to join the CDP Supply
Chain Programme.
INTEGRATION WITHIN THE ORGANISATION AND
INTERNAL COOPERATION

Within the company, three specialist divisions work
closely together: Sustainability in the Purchasing and
Supplier Network, Sustainability and Environmental
­Protection, and Raw Materials Management. They
assume joint responsibility for ensuring sustainability
in our supply chains.

labour and social standards. The BMW Group Sustainability Standard is an integral part of the request for
­proposal documentation for new suppliers and is thus a
key tool in the integration of sustainability aspects into
the procurement process.
Each potential new supplier must take into consideration
the BMW Group sustainability requirements when submitting a proposal. When the decision for a particular
supplier is being made, a standard template provides the
committees responsible with all relevant information.
Sustainability is one of the decision-making criteria,
alongside product and production quality, security of
supply, innovative strength and competitive pricing.
ENGAGING WITH STAKEHOLDERS

Engaging with our stakeholders is an additional
­important tool in our continuous efforts to improve our
measures and activities and to identify and discuss
­external trends.
It has become evident from our dialogue that stakeholders
expect companies like the BMW Group to assume more
responsibility along the supply chain. Key recommendations that resulted from a Stakeholder Dialogue 2013
included applying solutions from other industries to the
automotive industry, and systematically focusing and
­prioritising the company’s own activities (for example
with respect to certain raw materials or supply chains).
In addition, the stakeholders advised industry-wide and
cross-industry cooperation to develop joint approaches.

DEFINING PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS FOR SUPPLIERS

For the BMW Group, it is essential that our business
partners meet the same environmental and social stand­
ards we set for ourselves. The BMW Group Supplier
­Sustainability Standards are the foundation on which
this process is based. The standards establish basic principles that are to be adhered to by all BMW Group sup­
pliers. This includes compliance with all internationally
recognised human rights as well as environmental,

COLLABORATING IN INDUSTRY INITIATIVES AND NETWORKS

Engagement in initiatives, networks and associations
and the resulting dialogue beyond the boundaries of our
company are essential for us to continuously improve
our sustainability strategy see Figure 35.
At the European level, for example, we have been col­
laborating since 2012 with ten other carmakers in the
­European Automotive Working Group on Supply Chain
Sustainability, which is coordinated by CSR Europe.
Within this workgroup, we jointly develop measures to
minimise risk and work on projects to increase sustain-

ability in supply chains and to establish standard minimum requirements for suppliers. One result this group
has produced is the first industry-wide Self-Assessment
Questionnaire on CSR/Sustainability for Automotive
­Sector Suppliers, which was published in April 2014.
In autumn 2014, the BMW Group started applying this
questionnaire.
Furthermore, as a member of econsense, the Forum

The standard was developed in a multi-stakeholder process involving companies and NGOs. The ASI Performance Standard was finalised on schedule at the end of
2014 and represents a key milestone in the initiative’s efforts to establish ASI-certified products. It is one of the
first comprehensive sustainability standards for the entire
value chain of metal as a raw material.

EFFICIENT USE OF RAW MATERIALS — Carbon, lightweight construction material

SUSTAINABLE EXTRACTION AND PROCUREMENT
OF RAW MATERIALS

Raw materials are the basis for every industrial production process. However, with today’s multi-layered and
dynamic global supply chains, actually tracing the route
of a raw material from the mine to the end product is an
extremely complex undertaking. This is mainly due to
the intermediate trade and processing stages and commodities trading on the stock exchange. It is therefore
quite a challenge to implement sustainability standards
as early as the raw materials extraction stage.

Ensuring sustainability along the entire supply chain requires
joint effort and long-term action. The BMW Group will therefore
continue to expand its collaboration with other carmakers to
promote sustainability in supply chains. We will also work even
more closely with our suppliers in order to achieve greater
transparency in the supply chain for critical components and
raw materials. In addition to aluminium, we will be focusing
on conflict minerals as well as selected renewable materials
in 2015.

In view of this, the BMW Group focuses on selected
­relevant or critical raw materials and supply chains.
We analyse and evaluate the supply chains as well as
the action required and then derive measures that we
­implement in conjunction with our suppliers.
For this purpose, we also participate in cross-industry
­initiatives for sustainable use of raw materials. For ex­
ample, we joined the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative
(ASI) in December 2012. Aluminium plays a major role in
lightweight construction, because it weighs s­ ignificantly
less than steel. The ASI aims to establish a standard for

As a global enterprise, the BMW Group faces the challenge of using sustainability management to find the
right solutions under very diverse local conditions.
Increasing internationalisation of procurement in regions
such as Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America has led to
new and bigger sustainability risks. We therefore continuously improve our sustainability risk management system
in order to become familiar with the respective country,
industry and product risks and to ensure compliance with
our sustainability standards.

applied its own self-assessment questionnaire).

As part of the continuous improvement of our risk
­management process, we introduced two new aspects in
2014. One was the “nomination process”, an upstream
step before the procurement process to ensure that nominated potential suppliers comply with our sustainability
requirements. We also carried out modular online assessments of suppliers in addition to our sustainability audits.

All agreements made by BMW AG with its suppliers
­contain clauses based on the principles of the UN Global
Compact and the International Labour Organization
(ILO). These principles also specify that a contractual
commitment must be made to comply with human rights,
labour and social standards as well as to implement

STEP 1: IDENTIFY RISKS

STEP 2: SELF-ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE

Using special filters to identify risks
In the first step of our risk management process, our
­proprietary sustainability risk filter evaluates the envir­
onmental, social and governance risk potential of all
existing and new suppliers. The filter takes into account
both location-specific and product-specific risks. This
includes, for instance, an assessment of social risks in
­certain countries, such as child labour or forced labour.
We also consider environmental risks such as damage to
nature, emissions and process materials containing substances that can be hazardous to health. The respective
production facility of the supplier, rather than its head
office, is assessed in each case. If sub-suppliers are thought
to be repeatedly in breach of sustainability standards,
the supply chain is also evaluated using the sustainability
risk filter. We continuously improve the system used for
the risk filter.

Ensuring sustainability standards via self-assessment
questionnaires
The risk filter forms the basis for the next step, i.e. supplier self-assessment via questionnaire. Since 2009, we
have been asking suppliers to complete this questionnaire to provide a self-evaluation of their sustainability
management and related activities. Until 2014, we used a
self-assessment questionnaire developed by BMW, based
on our sustainability standards. Since autumn 2014, we
have been using an industry-wide questionnaire based
on Guiding Principles that apply to all OEMs (original
equipment manufacturer). This questionnaire ensures
that minimum standards are complied with throughout
the industry. We introduced modular online assessments
in order to ensure compliance with BMW-specific and
other additional requirements.

Using the media to identify potentially risky suppliers
We also use media screening to identify potentially critical
suppliers. Through systematic observation and analysis
of supplier-specific media coverage and social media posts,
we can identify potential risks at an early stage.
SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

When new suppliers offer us their services, they must
make a clear commitment in their self-assessment to
social standards such as compliance with human rights.
Sustainable use of materials such as secondary aluminium
is also verified at the request for proposal stage. The
OEM questionnaire also asks for information on whether

Seizing opportunities

the environmental management system in accordance
with ISO 14001 is in place, integration of recycling
aspects in product development as well as on recycling
concepts. After the proposal has been submitted, these
details are included as key decision-making indicators
in the procurement process. In 2014, approximately
3,000 suppliers submitted the information we requested.
Correcting sustainability deficits
If a low sustainability level is identified on the supplier’s
self-assessment questionnaire, we communicate the
industry-wide standard recommendations to them. Additional BMW Group-specific measures are agreed between
the supplier and our Sustainability in the Purchasing and
Supplier Network division. For suppliers with known
sustainability deficits, we supplement the supply contracts
with corrective action plans and clauses. We can thus
ensure that all sustainability requirements will be met by
start of production or provision of services.

This approach reflects our conviction that sustainability
in supply chains can only be achieved if we work hand
in hand with our suppliers. Our goal is for compliance
with these standards to be viewed as a matter of course.
This applies not only to our suppliers, but also to their
sub-suppliers. We only have indirect influence on sub-­
suppliers. However, we oblige our direct suppliers to
ensure that our sustainability requirements are also met
by their sub-suppliers. We also develop individual action
plans for specific supply chains.

STEP 3: CONDUCT AUDITS
Sustainability standards verified by external auditors
Supplier production facilities that are at high risk of
breaching sustainability requirements and facilities
­suspected of such a breach are subject to independent
audits. The first step is a detailed examination of sustainability performance at the supplier’s production facility
using a specially designed catalogue of criteria. Based on
this, verifications and certifications are carried out by
external auditors. If we conclude at some point that
­further validation of the supplier is necessary, we then
initiate a complete on-site sustainability audit. This audit
includes, for example, plant inspections and interviews
with management and employees, as well as a review of
the management system.
Corrective action plan based on audit result
If the results of an audit show non-compliance or potential for improvement, we work with the supplier to
develop a specific plan of action and provide assistance
with implementing this plan. If the supplier is uncooperative or in breach of a fundamental BMW Group sustainability clause, termination of business relations may
follow. Our goal, however, is to determine the majority of
risks during the first two steps, to manage these risks
and to help suppliers raise their sustainability standards.
Audits represent the final stage of our risk management
process and are carried out only in exceptional cases.

When we become aware of individual cases of non-­
compliance with our sustainability principles, our Supply
Chain Response Team handles them, applying a defined
three-step process:
1.	The management of the supplier company is asked
to respond to the specific issue or case.
2.	If the management responds and if the supplier is
cooperative, we visit their company in order to ensure
that the non-compliance will not be repeated.

3.	If non-compliance is confirmed and the supplier is not

result as a final step.
The Supply Chain Response Team is made up of one
respective representative from Operational and Strategic
­Purchasing, Corporate Strategy (a sustainability expert),
­Corporate Communications and the Works Council. The
team had to take action in three cases in 2014. In one
case, the accusation was a breach of environmental standards, another was a Health and Safety issue and the
third related to a number of breaches of basic labour
standards. In the Health and Safety case, a careful audit
showed that no BMW location was affected. In the case
of breach of basic labour standards, the supplier was
asked to respond and the location was inspected. No
­evidence that would lend merit to the accusations was
found. In the environmental standards case, measures
were developed to ensure that no limits would be
exceeded in future. Some of these measures have already
been implemented and audited. Others are still in the
implementation phase.

FORECAST
Based on what we have learned, we want to be even more
­proactive in our risk management activities. In addition, the
OEM questionnaire will enable us to establish sustainability
requirements even more firmly within the request for proposal
process. And finally, BMW employees will additionally implement social audits in order to secure the social sustainability
performance of our suppliers.

STRATEGIC DIRECTION
The BMW Group sees collaboration with its suppliers as an
­opportunity to integrate sustainability into the entire value
chain. A long-term, close cooperation with our p­ artners allows
us to tap into new potential for sustainable o­ perations in the
supplier network.

We can achieve a lot if we work together with our sup­
pliers. We promote innovative ideas, increase awareness
of sustainability along supply chains and protect valuable
resources by increasing efficiency.
We cooperate with our suppliers to turn the challenges
presented by sustainability into an opportunity and to
leverage potential.
The action we take here focuses on three areas:
1.	We improve efficient use of resources by creating
transparency and agreeing on corresponding goals
and action to be taken.

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

For many years now, the BMW Group has been working
to use innovative technologies and processes to reduce
resource consumption and to increase energy efficiency
on the production line. Because much of the value-added
is created by our suppliers, it is not enough for us to
only set sustainability standards for our own production.
The BMW Group’s Sustainability Standards are valid
­worldwide and their integration is mandatory along the
entire supply chain.
For this reason, we joined the Supply Chain Programme
of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) in 2014. CDP is
a non-governmental organisation that aims to reduce
energy and resource consumption and thus counteract
climate change. By participating in this programme, suppliers can record their resource consumption on a generally accepted platform and derive cost-saving potential as
a result. Within the CDP Supply Chain Programme we
annually monitor and analyse resource consumption and
CO₂ emissions and identify improvement potential for
suppliers, who we select according to turnover volume,
emissions and consumption aspects. Based on this, we
currently achieve coverage of over 45% of production-­
relevant procurement volume for BMW AG. The resulting
transparency is further disseminated in terms of quality
and quantity through the agreements made in supplier
development interviews as well as the contracts granted
each year.

COLLABORATING WITH SUPPLIERS WORLDWIDE — Suppliers in China

These measures help us to assess suppliers’ efficiency
and to work together to uncover ways of saving energy
and resources and to develop over time. 81% of the
BMW suppliers taking part in the CDP have integrated
climate change into their corporate strategy, 77% took
the initiative to reduce emissions in 2014 and 69% set
themselves specific targets to achieve this. Savings of
over 21 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent were reported
to us from our supplier network for the year 2014. These
savings mainly resulted from an increase in energy efficiency in production processes and from optimisation of
transport processes. As a rule, investment by suppliers
for these measures pays off within three years.
TRAINING FOR EMPLOYEES AND SUPPLIERS

We offer a wide range of training courses for purchasers,
internal process partners and suppliers. This makes them
more aware of the topic and they learn about cause and
effect. We also clearly communicate our expectations to
them. In this way, we enable participants to make decisions that contribute towards greater sustainability in the
supply chain. These are the training courses we offer:

we aimed to provide sustainability training to at least
80% of our more than 800 purchasers. To achieve this
aim, we c­ arried out mandatory training courses in 2013
and reported the number of participants as a target
value on the balanced scorecard to the top management level. In order to continue to ensure we have a
high number of trained purchasers, training courses

RECOGNISING INNOVATION — BMW Supplier Innovation Award 2014

PROMOTING INNOVATION

We incentivise our suppliers to develop innovative
­solutions to the challenges presented by sustainability.

In 2015, we will expand our resource efficiency programme by
taking concrete action based on the knowledge gained from our
participation in the CDP Supply Chain Programme. In addition,
we will continue to develop our sustainability training formats
for suppliers and employees. In addition we continue to promote and reward innovations initiated by our suppliers.

The Learning from Suppliers forum
In 2012, the Learning from Suppliers forum was established to give our suppliers the opportunity to showcase
best-practice case studies on innovative and sustainable
solutions for products, materials and production processes. At this monthly series of events, suppliers can
present sustainable product and process innovations at
the BMW Group Research and Innovation Centre in
Munich. The aim of the event is to encourage an exchange
of information on the topics of innovation and sustainability, while closely interlinking these two issues in
strategy, product and process development from the very
beginning.
Supplier Innovation Award
The BMW Supplier Innovation Award was presented for
the third time in 2014. It went to a total of eight supplier
companies for outstanding innovation and development
performance, among other things in the area of
sustainability.

Our management
approach

The success of the BMW Group is based on the dedication
and technical expertise of our employees. We make every
effort to attract and keep the best people. To achieve this,
we offer them attractive and secure jobs, comprehensive
development and training opportunities, and good longterm prospects. We also offer above-average pay and give
our employees a number of options to help them balance
work and private life.
The increasing average age of the world population as well
as changing job profiles and a shortage of skilled workers
in Germany call for flexibility and foresight in human
resources planning. We therefore aim to position ourselves
even more consistently as an attractive employer on all
relevant labour markets, for all target and age groups
see Chapter 6.2.
International and intercultural alignment of our human
resources strategy
Based on our Strategy Number ONE, the BMW Group
Human Resources Strategy was passed in 2008 and has
been continuously developed since then, keeping close
watch over regional trends.

For the European locations of the BMW Group, there is
a European Works Council composed of employee
­representatives from European production sites of the
BMW Group.

COMPREHENSIVE EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATION

The timely and comprehensive involvement of employee
representatives, in particular when major operational
changes are planned, is an integral part of our corporate
culture. The BMW Group therefore undertakes the
­following to make sure this happens.

Employee representation at the other international locations of the BMW Group follows the respective national
regulations, with employee representation most recently
established in India (Chennai plant) and in the sales
and financial service companies in China.

In accordance with the German law on co-determination,
BMW AG has a Supervisory Board with equal representation of all parties, including external representatives of
the competent trade union as well as company representatives from the works councils formed at the BMW AG
company locations.

Freedom of association is one of the principles set down
in the Joint Declaration on Human Rights and Working Conditions
at the BMW Group. The BMW Group complies with con­
ventions 87 and 98 of the ILO (International Labour
­Organization), which guarantee workers freedom of
­association and the right to collective bargaining. This
also includes, for example, the right to establish and to
join independent trade unions and other advocacy
­organisations as well as protection against discrimination
on grounds of membership in a trade union or employee
representative body.

At the German BMW AG locations and the subsidiaries
within Germany, works councils are formed according to
the German Works Constitution Act. The local works
councils also delegate representatives to the Group Works
Council of BMW AG.

BUILDING SKILLS FOR THE FUTURE — Further training at the BMW Group

STRATEGIC DIRECTION
The BMW Group is regarded as an attractive employer and
has a common management understanding of the importance
of employee focus.
The BMW Group promotes flexible working hours and gives
employees a range of options to help them find the right
­work-life balance.

As of one of the world’s most attractive employers, the
BMW Group has a decisive advantage in the competition
for skilled workers. We intend to build further on this
advantage by offering employees attractive additional
benefits and helping them to develop their personal
strengths.
But at the same time, we face many challenges. For ex­
ample, as the BMW Group becomes more international,
there is an increasing need to work across different time
zones, which is not always easy to reconcile with employees’ personal lives. Needs and requirements can also
­differ quite significantly from country to country as
­society becomes more individualised and the range of
different lifestyles increases.
SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

Securing skills for the future
We therefore try to set the course at an early stage. As
part of strategic human resources planning, we determine
annually the skill sets we need based on our corporate
and departmental strategies and we align our young
­talent and further training programmes as well as our
hiring plans accordingly.

Demographic effects on the structure of the workforce
and thus on future staffing requirements are highly relevant for human resources planning. In 2013, BMW AG
therefore introduced an IT-based strategic human
resources planning system, and in 2014 extended its
scope to cover our large international plants as well.
ABOVE-AVERAGE REMUNERATION AND SOCIAL BENEFITS

The BMW Group policies for remuneration and additional
benefits apply for all of our companies. We pursue a total
remuneration approach in which salaries as well as our
extensive range of benefits are considered part of a total
package. The main guiding principle is fair pay. For every
location worldwide, the total remuneration package must
be above the average for the respective labour market.

Offering additional social benefits
Apart from the fixed and variable salary components,
the BMW Group also offers its employees a wide range
of social benefits, such as a company pension.

Due to the significant decline in profits, in 2009 and 2010 BMW AG employees did not receive
any bonuses for 2008 and 2009.
1 New employees receive full bonuses after four years of employment.
2 New bonus system from 2011 based on personal base value.

In addition to a fixed salary, our employees receive a variable share in the company’s profits. Due to the positive
business development in 2013, employees took home a
record-breaking profit share in 2014.
Our remuneration system is gender-neutral. To make sure
that this is the case all over the world, all our companies
are interviewed regularly. In 2014, a multidimensional
monitoring process was established within BMW Group
in Germany to annually check the gender-neutrality of
remuneration. Data from more than 60,000 employees
were analysed. Analysis results confirm that our gender-­
neutral compensation system has been successfully established. Carrying out this analysis annually will enable
us to detect any counter-­trends at an early stage.
Based on a voluntary commitment, the compensation
received by temporary workers employed by BMW AG is
oriented on the collective agreements applicable to our
core employees in the automotive industry and not the
collective agreements in the temporary work sector.

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

The employees at our international sites are similarly
offered numerous social benefits geared toward supplementing the social services available in their country.
In the USA, for example, we offer above-average health
insurance coverage for employees and their families.
Employee pension plans
The BMW Group supports its employees in Germany
and internationally with attractive pension programmes
to safeguard their standard of living when they reach
retirement.

The pension benefits focus on three fields:
provisions for retirement;
–		FSinancial
urvivors’ benefits in case of death of the employee
– (spouse
and children who are still in education);
nsurance against a reduction in earning capacity
–	Idue
to occupational disability.
In Germany, the BMW Group offers members of management (approx. 2% of the workforce) and all those
who joined the company after 1 January 2014 a defined-­
contribution pension plan. The money is invested in the
capital market and generates an attractive return throughout its entire period. All other employees in Germany
are paid a fixed pension depending on their years of
­service and their level.
At the international locations of the BMW Group, there
are many different types of pension arrangements. In
Mexico, as soon as we open a new plant we set up a company pension scheme for our employees and also offer
them further options for accumulating assets through
social benefits. An attractive pension plan was also introduced at the production location we opened in Brazil

in 2014. Overall, 90% of our workforce has access to a
pension plan.
IMPROVEMENTS THROUGH FEEDBACK

Employee surveys (e.g. on satisfaction, health or customer
focus) and other feedback systems are key management
tools at the BMW Group.

A Group-wide employee survey is conducted every two
years, most recently in 2013. 89% of those surveyed were
­satisfied on the whole with the BMW Group. Very positive ratings were also given to attractiveness as an
employer (91%), social benefits (85%) and job security
(87%) see Figure 41.
We complement the employee survey with IT-supported
feedback systems for managers: Feedback for Managers
(outside Germany) and 360+ Feedback in Germany, the
USA, the UK and Austria (Steyr plant). This feedback
­system will be successively introduced in other countries
as well. With the aid of these tools, managers can compare
the feedback provided by their staff, colleagues and
superiors with their self-assessment.

Retaining satisfied employees
In 2014, the employee attrition rate fell to 1.41%
see Figure 42. This was mainly due to fewer people retiring during the year. If retirement figures are excluded,
the attrition rate remains very low, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the proven programmes and measures of
the BMW Group geared toward positioning the company
as an attractive employer.

The thoroughness of our feedback systems becomes
apparent in the fact that we also regularly survey the
­participants in our young talent programmes as well as
students on internships with the BMW Group. These
­surveys enable us to obtain a realistic picture from young
people of how they perceive the BMW Group, enabling
us to derive any necessary measures for improvement.
In addition to the many positive results, the surveys also
show us where we need to take action, especially with
regard to processes and structures as well as customer
focus. For instance, we can improve how we define
responsibilities. The aim is to place even more focus on
the requirements and desires of our customers in our
day-to-day activities. We will measure the effect of these
follow-up measures derived from the 2013 employee
­survey with the next survey in 2015.

Austria, the USA and the UK can also take sabbaticals of
up to six months (in the UK this initiative is open to our
managers only). In the UK, up to 40 weeks parental leave
can be taken on full pay, well in excess of the statutory
allowance.

FLEXIBLE WORKING HOURS — Teleworking at the BMW Group

Enabling mobile working
The option of working without being tied to a specific
location also helps to ensure a positive work-life balance.
On the basis of a successful two-year pilot project for
mobile working, a new company agreement was signed,
which came into force on 1 January 2014. The new
mobile working instrument gives both employees and the
company greater flexibility. Mobile working does not
mean a bigger volume of work, but rather a more flexible
organisation of existing working time to gain more
­personal freedom and flexibility. Childcare and caring
for dependents can then be better integrated into the
­everyday work routine and thus gain greater acceptance
as an important part of life.

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

The campaign motto “Flexibel arbeiten, bewusst
abschalten” (Work flexibly but know how to switch off)
illustrates that optimal performance at work depends on
genuine regeneration in an employee’s free time. Outside
of agreed work time, employees have the right to switch
off and not be available. BMW is a pioneer in this respect
and its concept of mobile working was duly recognised
this year by the German Association of Human Resources
Managers with its BPM Award for outstanding achievements in human resources management. Dialogue between
employees and their superiors promotes target-focused,
flexible working as well as the long-term health and
employability of our staff. Less than a year after the introduction of mobile working, the response has been
extremely positive, with some 20,000 employees taking
advantage of this option.

Supporting parents with childcare
We have established childcare services at many of our
German and international locations. With the support of
parents’ initiatives, we were able to accommodate over
300 children aged zero to six years at our German sites as
of the end of 2014.

At BMW Group facilities around the world, childcare
­services meet local and regional requirements. We also
offer a special working time model (Home and Elder
Care) for employees who care for sick or elderly family
members.

FORECAST
The long-term establishment of mobile working is an innovative
step towards self-determined working hours, more focus on
results and greater flexibility in tailoring working environments
to individual requirements. It is supported and communicated
as a joint effort by top management and the works council. The
BMW Group is taking a pioneering role in fostering the necessary dialogue between employees and managers, in particular
on the topic of availability.
The employee survey in 2015 will measure the success of the
action taken since the last survey and highlight any new areas
that may need to be addressed.

STRATEGIC DIRECTION
To preserve the health and the performance of our employees
in the long term, we promote personal responsibility and an
appropriately designed work environment.

The BMW Group attaches great importance to the health
and performance capability of its employees. This is even
more the case in these times of demographic change,
when especially in Germany an ageing workforce must
meet increasing demands at work. Our main measures in
the area of occupational health and safety are integrated
health management, working initiatives to suit an ageing
workforce and a high degree of safety at work. We also
offer extensive prevention, rehabilitation and exercise
programmes.

new technologies presents the company with additional
challenges in the area of occupational health and safety.
INTEGRATED HEALTH AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT

In Germany, special committees on occupational health
and safety are in place at every plant. These committees
convene once every quarter to consult on occupational
health and safety issues as well as accident prevention.
Each committee consists of employer representatives,
experts in occupational health and safety, company physicians, safety officers and additional experts. Occupational
health and safety committees are also in place at all international locations. Up to 90% of BMW Group employees
are represented by committees on occupational health
and safety and environmental protection.
At present, occupational health and safety management
systems certified according to the OHRIS (Occupational
Health and Risk Management System) and OHSAS
(Occupation Health and Safety Assessment Series) are in
place at 19 of our 30 production plants; the other facilities
work with systems that meet national standards. The
new production site in Brazil will be certified according
to the international standard in the spring of 2016.
The accident frequency rate at the BMW Group, including subsidiaries, was 5.1 accidents per million working
hours in 2014. There have been no fatal accidents at the
BMW Group for the last nine years.

Our employees are our most important success factor.
To make sure they can perform at the highest level, we
try to raise awareness among our workforce that it is
worthwhile to cultivate a healthy lifestyle. Our managers
know that their leadership behaviour can have an impact
on the health of their staff and they therefore do their
best to create a healthy work environment. Dealing with

The foundation for ergonomic working conditions on the production line is already laid during the product development

Within the new system limits (around 88% of BMW Group employees captured
in data), the accident frequency rate is 5.1; based on the system limits of the
2013 financial year, the figure is 4.4 (improvement of 8.3%).

This process already begins in the early stages of product development. We then continuously monitor workstations during
series production to further optimise ergonomics with a view
to ensuring ageing-appropriate conditions on the BMW production lines. Job rotation, workplace physiotherapy and the
involvement of production staff in the ergonomic improvement
process are integral elements in our production system. A
seminar developed in 2014, called introduction to ergonomics
and the use of the ABAtech method (requirement and capacity
analysis) in ergonomic assessment, will serve as a basis for
­further improvements in working conditions.

TAKING PREVENTIVE MEASURES

The BMW Group takes an integrated approach to health
management in accordance with its Health Initiative,
which is applied internationally.
Prevention is a core element in our health management
system. The BMW Group complies with international
standards in prevention, adapting them to national
­circumstances. We implement prevention campaigns
internationally, setting common goals and standards.
For example, every employee at our German locations
is entitled to use our company-owned gyms and take
­special courses there. And our ProBike initiative allows
employees at our Munich locations to cycle from one
meeting to the next for free.

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

In addition to motivating our employees to get more
­exercise through a variety of offerings, the cafeterias at
the BMW locations conduct numerous campaigns and
measures to promote healthy nutrition. The traffic-light
system of food labelling in all company restaurants is
one example of how guidance is provided for a healthy
and balanced diet.
To promote ergonomic workplace design for employees
who are primarily office-based, the BMW Group developed the seminar “Gesundes Arbeiten im Büro” (Health
at the Office) and implemented it successfully in 2014.

Providing health check-ups
The BMW Group offers its employees annual check-ups,
which are tailored to the local needs at our international
locations. Comparable with the check-ups covered by
statutory health insurance in Germany, these examin­
ations include the recording of vital signs.

Employees on deployment to other countries and their
families receive country-specific health advice, check-ups
and all other necessary preventive care.

SUPPORTING AN AGEING WORKFORCE

The BMW Group sees demographic change in Germany
as a challenge we are actively addressing. In a society
in which the average age is increasing, we can only be
­successful in the long run if we strengthen the health
and performance of our employees and consistently take
advantage of their wealth of experience. In our Today
for Tomorrow programme, we have been developing a
variety of constructive responses to demographic change
for several years now.

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

As our workforce ages, we aim to create working conditions worldwide in which young employees can remain
healthy as they grow older and older employees can
contribute their particular strengths. The BMW Group
therefore speaks not of age-appropriate but of ageing-­
appropriate working conditions that preserve employee
health and performance. Nearly 50,000 employees will
benefit worldwide by the end of 2014 from the Today
for Tomorrow programme and the resulting measures.
INTEGRATING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND
SUPPORTING REHABILITATION

At our plants, we make every effort to safeguard the jobs
of employees with debilitating health issues in the long
term. All social partners work together to ensure that
employees who are no longer able to carry out the work
they once did as well as severely disabled employees are
provided with adequate working conditions and fully
integrated into working life.

programme will take place in the spring of 2015 in Germany,
Austria and the USA. Accident frequency rate calculations,
which due to system restrictions currently include only 88%
of the BMW Group workforce, will be expanded further.
The programme Today for Tomorrow will be reviewed in 2015
to verify its adequacy for future requirements.

The figure for severely disabled employees is based on the statutory requirements in accordance with the German Social Insurance Code (SGB IX). In
addition, the BMW Group awarded contracts amounting to around €30 million to workshops for the severely disabled in 2014. Around €7 million of
this figure can be written off in accordance with the compensatory levy act.
The order volume increased by around 1 million compared to the previous year.

ATTRACTING AND FOSTERING TALENT

We invest in attracting and promoting talent on an ongoing basis. This enables us to fill our staffing requirements
in the long term in a dynamic, fast-changing environment.
The BMW Group’s global package of measures ranges
from vocational training to young talent programmes for
student target groups to high-potential programmes for
future managers.
BMW Group expenditure on training and further education programmes increased in 2014 to €335 million
(+16.3% year on year). On average, our employees participated in 3.9 days of further training in 2014 see Figure 47.

The education and further training of our employees is
of growing importance. It is essential to keeping pace
with technological advances in the automotive industry.
Through advanced training courses, the BMW Group
promotes the individual strengths of our trainees, skilled
workers and managers.
In the coming years, there will be a significant increase in
the demand for well-trained skilled workers. This is particularly true in the case of innovations such as drivetrain
electrification and the use of hydrogen technology and
fuel cells. To meet our demand for qualified employees,
we try to detect talent at an early stage and develop it in
full through the right education and training. We also
offer our employees a large number of development and
certification programmes. The BMW Group thus consist­
ently fosters the concept of life-long learning.

On the reporting date, the company employed a total of 4,595 young people
in vocational training and young talent programmes worldwide.

Establishing dual vocational training worldwide
We believe in the dual vocational training system. For
this reason, we are extending the proven German system
to our international locations as well. Our production
locations in China, the USA, South Africa and the UK are
already working with the dual system and are setting
national standards in their countries. For 2015 and 2016,
we plan to launch training courses according to the dual
system in Brazil, Mexico, Thailand and India.

Expanding international student programmes
In keeping with the BMW Group’s global corporate philosophy, participants in our young talent programmes are
provided with both financial support and focused training
in their areas of expertise as well as other additional skills.

In 2014, approximately 250 young talents took part in
the ongoing, practice-oriented bachelor’s and master’s
programmes funded by the company in Germany. Around
230 doctoral candidates are currently studying for their
PhDs with the BMW Group. Their research and innovative
spirit benefits departments in all areas of the company.
Some 50 young people from all over the world are taking
part in the international bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral
programmes introduced in 2014.
Through strategic partnerships with selected universities,
we promote and support activities in the target fields of
young talent retention, management training as well as
research and innovation worldwide.

The BMW Group inaugurated a worldwide Corporate
Leadership Programme in 2010 that imparts clear messages on leadership derived from the company’s corporate
and human resources strategy. In 2014, we further
expanded this programme internationally to ensure that
it is also applied to the lower hierarchy levels throughout
the BMW Group. To foster international young talent, the
BMW Group developed the Global Leader D
­ evelopment
Programme. Integral components of the programme are
various practical phases in Germany and abroad, targeted
training measures, and diverse net­working and exchange
opportunities. Special emphasis is placed on developing
intercultural competence.
Topic-specific training
BMW Group employees can gain state-of-the-art expertise
by taking part in funded study courses outside working
hours. We continuously adapt the topics to the company’s
requirements, for example by offering courses in electromobility, lightweight construction, composite materials
and hydrogen/fuel cells.
Web-based sustainability training
Since 2013, an interactive Web-based training course has
been available to all employees worldwide that was
­specially developed to familiarise them with the principles
of sustainable management and its relevance to day-today practice.

FORECAST
A further expansion in our Corporate Leadership Programme
and international young talent programmes for student target
groups is planned for 2015. The selection of in-house further
training courses will also be expanded, including at our international locations. To this end, we plan to set up international
education and training networks on specific topics. This will
create transparency and help us to identify where further
action is required. Standard or newly conceived education
and training products can then be offered worldwide.

STRATEGIC DIRECTION
We want to maintain the 15–17% share of women in our
­general workforce and also achieve this ratio in management
positions by 2020, both in Germany and worldwide.

Modern society is characterised by a variety of different
lifestyles. The diversity of the population as a whole
has increased in the wake of globalisation, demographic
developments and changing values in society. As an
­international company, the BMW Group regards an intercultural workforce, an appropriate gender balance and
a good age mix as beneficial to our business. We are convinced that a diverse workforce enhances our innovative
strength and further increases our competitiveness.
In all their diversity, each and every one of our employees
is accorded equal levels of appreciation, respect and
opportunity. To further promote diversity among our
workforce, the Board of Management passed a targeted
Diversity Concept in 2010, with a definition of three
areas where diversity is to be strengthened throughout
the company, taking due consideration for local
conditions:

– Age and experience.
Special attention is paid to these three diversity dimensions throughout the BMW Group. At all of our locations,
we seek to prevent discrimination on the grounds of gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, age or origin.
The BMW Group SpeakUP Line offers all employees
worldwide the possibility to anonymously and confidentially report breaches of this principle. Employees can
also address their queries to their own managers, the

RAISING MANAGERS’ AWARENESS OF DIVERSITY
AND INCLUSION ISSUES

Diversity and inclusion are central themes in the compulsory further training programmes for managers. Participants in these programmes reflect on these issues by
trying to see things from different perspectives. In the process, they learn to take advantage of the specific potential
of teams that are particularly diverse in terms of gender,
age and the cultural backgrounds of their members. Over
2,000 managers were trained on this theme in 2014.

GETTING YOUNG WOMEN INTERESTED IN TECHNICAL PROFESSIONS —
Fostering young talent at the BMW Group

Getting women interested in technical occupations
We place a special emphasis on women in both our
­academic young talent programmes and our vocational
training programmes in an effort to recruit more female
employees in the long term. The proportion of women
in the Global Leader Development Programme was over
50% at the end of December 2014. This creates the basis
for a new generation of leadership that is more feminine,
technically competent, well-networked, and sensitive
to cultural and social issues.
ENHANCING INNOVATIVE STRENGTH THROUGH
CULTURAL DIVERSITY

As a company that is currently active in over 150 countries, we see diversity among our workforce as a major
opportunity. In Germany, we currently have employees
from 108 different countries working together very successfully. The diversity of our employees helps us to understand the specific needs of our customers worldwide.
We foster cultural diversity by focusing on recruiting new
employees locally at our facilities in the growth markets
and by recruiting employees from other countries to

work in Germany. To enhance cooperation, we also
­promote employee exchanges between companies of
the BMW Group worldwide.
To further promote an international perspective and
intercultural understanding among our new employees,
we designed our BMW vocational training as well as
the Global Leader Development Programme with the
needs of international participants in mind.
As an international company with an intercultural workforce, we focus on recruiting managers with international
experience and are also working to increase the share of
international top managers. The international character
of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board
of BMW AG also reflects the global scope of the company’s
business.

Demographic change in an aging workforce is also reflected in the age
­structure at BMW AG. While the share of employees under 30 remained
constant year on year and the share of employees between 30 and 50
slightly decreased, the share of over 50-year-old employees increased.

Innovative Employer Award for Best Practice in Age
­Management (AARP). In addition, the wide range of
­support offered by our Health Initiative helps employees
stay healthy in the long term. To complement this, we
raise awareness among managers of the challenges posed
by mixed-age teams.

FORECAST
The BMW Group will continue to promote a diverse workforce
through targeted Diversity Management. In 2015, we plan
to pursue and further expand existing measures in this area.
For example, with our ProGesundheit 2015 (Pro-health 2015)
campaign we will hold trade fair events at BMW locations to
raise awareness among staff for the topic of age/experience.
When setting up our plant in Mexico, we will engage in specific
human resources marketing that addresses and recruits candidates from target groups of different ages. Additional targets
will be set in the coming years to further develop our Diversity
Strategy, not only for gender but also for the dimensions of
­cultural diversity and age/experience.

TAKING ACCOUNT OF AGE DIVERSITY

When setting up new locations or divisions we recruit
people from a range of age groups. For example, at our
new BMW locations in Brazil and Mexico we are recruiting a mixed-age workforce from the start. This will allow
us to avoid age structure issues and to focus on tapping
into the specific strengths of different age groups.
The number of years each employee works for the
BMW Group is increasing. This is a result of earlier entry
into the company and later exit, due for example to rising
retirement ages. In order to benefit from the special
strengths and experience of employees of different ages,
we have introduced extensive programmes for flexible and
mobile working see Chapter 6.2. To maintain employees’
performance as the workforce ages, we introduced the
Today for Tomorrow programme, for which we have
received a number of awards, including the International

Corporate Citizenship

Our management
approach

Intercultural innovation and social inclusion as well as
responsible use of resources are some of the main focal
areas of our strategy. Knowledge transfer is a particular
area of focus. We offer educational projects to promote
understanding for these topics. In addition, road safety
measures and social projects play an important role at
a local level.
All of our activities as a corporate citizen are based on
one main goal – to provide long-term benefit to each
­society we are engaged with. In exceptional cases, such
as (natural) catastrophes, we also provide support spon­
taneously and independently of our main focus areas.

Corporate Citizenship forms an integral part of the
BMW Group’s vision of itself as a business enterprise.
With this in mind, we address current challenges in
­society and focus on those areas in which we can apply
our core expertise to achieve specific and measureable
improvements. We believe that our corporate citizenship
activities contribute towards mastering challenges in
­society, while at the same time bringing economic benefit
to the company. Thus we can utilise the experience and
expertise we gain to the benefit of our core business.

TAKING RESPONSIBILITY AS A CORPORATE CITIZEN
AT A LOCAL LEVEL

For us it is important to scale up our corporate citizenship activities on an international level and to help
­people to help themselves in the long term. In addition
to our global focus areas of intercultural innovation and
social inclusion as well as responsible use of resources,
we also support neighbourhoods in the vicinity of our
plants and thus contribute to local development.

COMMITMENT TO COMBATING HIV/AIDS — BMW Group plant in Rosslyn (South Africa)

It is both our objective and duty to be a dependable partner to society. We mainly focus on topics that are relevant
for us, and on regions in which we have manufacturing
activities. Our aim is to integrate the company into society
and to create mutual acceptance and a positive image at
and around our locations. In the UK and South Africa,
for example, we carry out a local analysis in the proximity
of our production plants, and implement a variety of
projects as a result. In Oxford (UK), for instance, we place
a special focus on inter­cultural communication, and in
Rosslyn (South Africa) we are committed to the fight
against HIV/AIDS.

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

REWARDING VOLUNTARY WORK BY EMPLOYEES

To complement our Corporate Citizenship measures,
we bestow awards on those employees worldwide who
deserve recognition for what they have given back to society. This is the company’s way of thanking those employees who do voluntary work in their free time. In 2014,
employees from ten countries applied, and four projects
were presented with the award. Each project focused
on different aspects of social responsibility. The winning
projects range from training programmes for mentally
and physically disabled sportspeople in the USA, to
­providing support for mentally disabled children and
their mothers in Bangladesh, to development projects in
­southern India and support for farmers in isolated regions
of China in the planting and sale of their products.

SHAPING THE FUTURE THROUGH FOUNDATIONS

We believe it is possible to successfully shape a society
that is based on social cohesion and innovation if the
competencies and skills of each individual are harnessed
for the general good and used to implement social change.
Our foundations contribute towards making this happen.

BMW FOUNDATION HERBERT QUANDT
The BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt brings people from
different cultures, nations and sectors together to drive social
innovations, promote global dialogue and encourage decision-­
makers to act responsibly. We take this approach in order to
break down barriers between policymakers, industry and civil
society, so that the community can benefit from the creative
diversity that results from cross-border collaboration.

Corporate Citizenship

BMW’s Eberhard von Kuenheim Foundation sees itself as
a creator of forums within which social responsibility can be
fostered in Germany. Its mandate is to promote entrepreneurial
thinking and action above and beyond the economic context.
Under the motto freude am neu:wagen (try something new),
it develops and tests new solution models for today’s social
issues. Projects with selected partners create forums for
­social innovation and responsibility. When the projects reach
­completion they become independent entities that have their
effect in day-to-day life.
Some examples of Eberhard von Kuenheim Foundation projects
are Lehr:werkstatt (teaching workshop), Junge Vor!Denker
(youth thinking ahead) and Sinnvestition (sensible investment). The teaching workshop, a further education project for
teachers and teaching diploma students, posted its highest
ever number of participants for the school year 2014/15, with
550 applicants and 183 tandems. In addition, the JOBLINGE
project, initiated by the Boston Consulting Group in collabor­
ation with the foundation, was named Integration ­Project of
the Year 2014, receiving the Goldene Victoria award from the
Deutschlandstiftung (Germany Foundation) under the aegis
of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Since 2007, over 2,000
young people have found vocational training or work positions
via JOBLINGE – 70% of whom come from an immigrant family
background.

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

The political format BMW Foundation ­Global Table, introduced in 2014, has enabled the BMW Foundation Herbert
Quandt to create unconventional, strategic dialogue between
decision-makers from Europe and from the developing econ­
omies in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The topics for the first
two-year event cycle are resources and security.
Another example is the further development and global distribution of the concept of Social Intrapreneurship. With this
concept, we aim to support those employees in corporations
and administrations who drive innovations that equally benefit
the organisation and society.

The BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt and the Eberhard
von Kuenheim Foundation plan and manage their programmes themselves. Both foundations are independent,
both legally and with respect to their content. In some
areas, the foundations collaborate with the BMW Group
in order to make their commitment effective on a larger
scale. In 2014, they invested a total of €5.4 million (2013:
€5.22 million) in non-profit programmes and projects.
ESTABLISHING PARTNERSHIPS WITH UNIVERSITIES

Since 2011, we have been realigning our partnerships
with universities worldwide. Eight strategic university
partnerships and collaborations have now been set up or
expanded in Europe, the USA and Asia. Each strategic

The BMW Group has been promoting art and culture
for over 40 years. Our focus in this area is on classical
music and jazz, contemporary and modern art, as well
as architecture and design.

Corporate Citizenship

Our cultural activities enable us to increasingly be seen
as a corporate citizen, to stand out from the competition
and to enhance our reputation. In addition, they transfer
an image that contributes towards a positive perception
of the BMW Group among the general public. The unrestricted creative freedom of our cultural partners is guaranteed at all times. The aim is to support international
projects in markets that are of particular relevance to the
BMW Group, such as China and the USA.

MEASURING THE EFFECTS OF OUR ACTIVITIES

Corporate citizenship should have a measurable effect.
For this reason measurability is high on our list of prior­
ities. Since 2010, we have been measuring the effects of
our corporate citizenship activities using the iooi (Input
Output Outcome Impact) method, which was developed
in cooperation with other DAX-listed corporations in a
working group established by the Bertelsmann Foundation.
This method provides guidance for the systematic tracking of expenditure on and impact of corporate citizenship
activities.

In 2014, we successfully expanded our cultural activities
at international level. For example, we published a book
on the BMW Art Cars in three languages, established
the Open for All format in China and initiated the BMW
Art Journey as well as a global cultural partnership with
Soho House. The feedback we receive, for example from
­creative artists, customer surveys and in the form of
­positive media reports, demonstrates the high level of
public acceptance of our cultural activities.
MANAGING AND COORDINATING CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP

Within the company, the Sustainability Board is respon­
sible for corporate citizenship. The Corporate Commu­
nications Department, in close collaboration with the
department for sustainability strategy and environmental
protection, is responsible for managing our corporate cit­i­

Communications at headquarters, local initiatives are
taken care of by local production and sales organisations.

The BMW Group focuses its activities in the area of donations on society
and the community as well as science and education, providing targeted
support of projects connected with the company’s core competencies and
activities. Donations made by the BMW Group in 2014 were approximately
20% higher than in 2013.

Before we start a corporate citizenship project, we examine
the social challenges faced at local level. The key question
we ask ourselves is whether and how the expertise we
provide can actually improve local conditions.
In 2014, we spent a total of €34,523,920 (2013:
€28,944,466), of which €10,199,438 took the form of
donations (2013: €8,485,289). To see how these funds
were allocated to our various areas see ­Figure 55 and
see Figure 56. Total expenditure on corporate citizenship
activities of the BMW Group increased compared to the
2013 financial year. The main reasons for this were individual lighthouse projects that were expanded in the 2014
financial year, for example the Intercultural Innovation
Award and Junior Campus. In addition, due to new legislation, expenditure on CSR activities in certain markets
were increased in order to comply with regulations.

STRATEGIC DIRECTION
Due to its core areas of expertise, the BMW Group is a leader
in intercultural communication. In the areas of intercultural
­innovation and social inclusion, we plan to reach out to a total
of one million people by 2020.

Through our activities as a corporate citizen, we contribute
towards mastering social challenges together and promoting understanding between different cultures. We
also benefit as a company from our corporate citizenship
activities. For example, we become more familiar with
local social structures, reach new target groups and learn
to see things from an alternative perspective. Our corporate citizenship activities also enhance the reputation of
the company and lead to closer dialogue with our stakeholders.
In 2014, our focal areas were intercultural communication
and social inclusion as well as knowledge transfer on
­sustainable use of resources. In addition, road safety
measures and social projects play an important role at a
local level.

PROMOTING INTERCULTURAL COMMUNICATION AND
SOCIAL INCLUSION

As a global corporation with a multinational workforce,
the BMW Group has been working for many years now
to promote understanding between different nations,
religions and ethnic groups. One of our core areas of
expertise is professional diversity management.
Between 1997 and 2010, the BMW Group Award for
Intercultural Learning went to a large number of innovative projects and individuals worldwide. In 2011, we further developed this award to establish the Intercultural
Innovation Award in collaboration with the United
Nations Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC). The award
recognises innovative concepts that are designed to solve
intercultural tensions and conflict. In addition to providing
financial support, we also offer the award winners the
opportunity to benefit from any BMW Group competencies that may serve their purpose.
For a period of one year, a pool of experts offers projectrelated support and provides advice on organisational
development. We also carry out workshops with the
award winners and BMW employees, where participants
receive training in how, for example, to deal with investors, develop a business plan and manage human
resources, as well as gaining expertise in communications,
marketing and the use of social media.
Since its establishment in 2011, more than 420,000 people
worldwide benefited from the award.

RAISING AWARENESS FOR RESPONSIBLE USE OF
RESOURCES

EXPERIENCING MOBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY

Responsible use of resources is a major challenge in
­society today. We want to raise awareness of the need to
protect the environment and resources. Particular focus
is placed here on children and disadvantaged groups
in society. The SEED project in South Africa, our waste
­separation project in Thailand and the Green Future
Camp in South Korea are just some of the examples of
our range of activities.

SEED – ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS IN
SOUTH AFRICA
The Schools Environmental Education Development Project
(SEED) aims to raise young people’s awareness of environmental
issues and encourage social responsibility. The SEED programme was launched in 1996 at 15 schools in the vicinity of the
BMW plant in Rosslyn and has since expanded to 60 schools.

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

Promoting understanding and enthusiasm for technology
and sustainable mobility among children and adolescents
is another aspect of our corporate citizenship activities.
One example is the BMW Group’s Junior Campus.
Together with renowned educators and scientists, the
company developed a concept that enables people to use
all their senses to discover mobility and sustainability.
The first Junior Campus was opened in autumn 2007 at
the BMW Welt in Munich.
Here, children can carry out interactive research as well
as tests and experiments that allow them to experience
the life cycle of a car from a mobility perspective.
In 2014, 13,149 children and adolescents took part in
the workshops.
Junior Campuses have now also been established in
­Berlin (Germany), Incheon (South Korea) and Moscow
(Russia). The concept has been adapted to local conditions in each country.

Corporate Citizenship

SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES

The BMW Group has 30 manufacturing and assembly
plants in 14 countries. Its sales network has 42 subsid­
iaries. Wherever we are represented in the world, we are
committed to social responsibility.
Helping to improve society
Two good examples of our activities in this area are the
BMW Warm Heart Fund and the BMW Korea Future
Fund. Both funds offer a platform that enables the
BMW Group, its workforce, dealerships and customers
to make a contribution towards improving society in
the respective countries.

BMW WARM HEART FUND
The BMW Warm Heart Fund was established in 2008 by BMW
China and BMW Brilliance Automotive in collaboration with
the China Charity Federation (CCF). Since the foundation was
­established, donations totalling over CNY 90 million (approximately €12 million) have been made, around half of which bene­
fited the local population. In the past six years, over 65,000
customers and employees have contributed to the BMW Warm
Heart Fund, and over 85,000 people across the country
­received support.
The fund financed, for example, the BMW Joy Home Children
Care programme, which provides both material and psycho­
logical support to children in underdeveloped regions in China.
By the end of 2014, 53 BMW Joy Home Centers had reached
out to over 40,000 children in 28 provinces.
The BMW Joy Future programme offers financial and educational support to outstanding students from less privileged
families. By the end of 2014, just under 6,200 students had
received financial support totalling approximately CNY 1.5
­million (around €200,000).

SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2014

BMW KOREA FUTURE FUND
The BMW Korea Future Fund was established by the BMW Group
Korea in 2011, and has since been making a valuable contribution to Korean society under the motto Responsible Leadership
for Future. This fund supports various projects to promote
child development.
The BMW Driving Center in Incheon (South Korea) opened in
2014. The Center also offers a Junior Campus. Here primary
school children can discover a diverse educational programme
on the topics of mobility and road safety. A mobile Junior
­Campus had already been opened in 2012.
In the Young Engineer Dream Project mentoring programme,
technically minded young people receive special support from
BMW and MINI experts. The first year was brought to successful
completion in September 2014 with a visit to the BMW plant
in Shenyang (China).
In addition, the BMW Korea Future Fund supports the Hope
Sharing School programme, which offers meals and schooling
to disadvantaged children during the school holidays. Over
20,000 children have participated in the programme since
2012. The fund’s activities are rounded off by its support of the
business plan competition From Idea to Startup, which is targeted at students and graduates. Almost 3,500 students have
participated in this competition since 2012.

FORECAST
The BMW Group will continue to expand its corporate citizenship activities in line with its core areas of expertise, i.e. intercultural innovation, social inclusion and resource efficiency.
In the area of intercultural innovation and social inclusion,
we now aim to achieve in 2018 our original goal of providing
benefits to a total of one million people by 2020. We will
­continue to expand Junior Campus internationally. Our focus
markets for 2015 are the UK and China.

Stakeholdererwartungen
Stakeholder expectations (from our worldwide dialogue events in 2014)
E-mobility

Sustainability Leadership

Improve infrastructure for electromobility

We can only achieve this by entering into partnerships with other companies. With
ChargeNow, BMW i drivers can quickly find one of 24,000 public charging points in
a large and constantly growing partnership network worldwide.

Reduce cost of electric vehicles

As with any technical innovation, the initial series models are quite expensive.
Once batteries go into mass production, prices will fall. So we are dependent here
on our suppliers as well as market developments.

Secure green energy sources

In Germany, BMW i customers can purchase an accompanying Naturstrom AG
green energy package directly from us. In the international markets, we will offer
our ­customers similar solutions with local partners.

Improve battery recycling

We are developing a variety of Second Life concepts for batteries. Used batteries
can be employed for example as stationary energy storage units. This allows them
to ­optimise use of renewable energy supply in buildings.

Increase number of electric vehicles
in our fleet

Our sustainability ambition is in line with the Action 2020 programme that we
­developed in collaboration with other companies on the World Business Council
of Sustainable Development (WBCSD). It provides the basis for our goals and
­activities: The BMW Group integrates sustainability along the entire value chain
and in all underlying processes – thus creating added value for the company,
the ­environment and society.

Set ambitious CO² targets for our fleets

The BMW Group is getting closer and closer to its vision of sustainable mobility.
We use innovative efficiency technologies in all vehicle models. In addition, we are
­adding electrically powered cars to our model range. Due to climate change issues
and scarce resources, we want to further reduce the CO² emissions of our vehicles.
We have set ourselves an ambitious new target: by 2020, we will reduce the CO²
emissions of our vehicle fleet (EU-28) by 50% compared to the base year 1995.

Transparent lobby work

We participate in the political debate in a constructive and transparent manner.
Some of our key positions can be found in this report, e.g. with regard to the practicability of the CO² regulations in Europe or how to deal with trade barriers. There are
extremely strict transparency requirements regarding support for political parties.
All partnerships are subject to the clear sponsorship guidelines of the BMW Group.

Improve prevailing conditions that
promote sustainability

We deliberately enter into alliances with policymakers, businesspeople and
­decision-makers in society in order to have an impact along our entire value chain
above and beyond our direct sphere of influence. For example, the BMW Group
participates in a number of multi-stakeholder platforms, e.g. the World B
­ usiness
­Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) as part of the Sustainable M
­ obility
project, the National Platform on Electromobility (NPE) in Germany and the
­Aluminium Stewardship Initiative, which defines sustainability standards in the
­international value chain.

Integrate sustainability into
the marketing strategy

Sustainability is an integral part of our sales training. We aim to ensure that sales
personnel can provide information to the customer on all BMW Group sustainability
activities and the sustainability performance of the various products. Sustainability
aspects are also the focus of both brand communication of the BMW i as well as our
What’s next campaign.

In the year under review, 16,052 BMW i3s and 1,741 BMW i8s were sold. Development of this market going forward is strongly dependent on external conditions
such as battery, crude oil and electricity prices. In the coming years, we will also
be ­adding plug-in hybrid vehicles to our range.

Mobility services
Further develop services to promote
e-mobility

One example of our holistic approach to electromobility is our 360° ELECTRIC
­service package. It covers everything from recharging at home and at public charging
points to range of different assistance systems. BMW Add-on Mobility gives
­customers access to conventional BMW vehicles for long-distance travel as well as
the car-sharing service DriveNow.

Improve access to mobility services

For example, DriveNow is now available in Munich, Berlin, Düsseldorf, Cologne,
Hamburg, Vienna, London and San Francisco. In October 2014, we introduced
a roaming function which allows over 360,000 DriveNow customers who are
already r­ egistered in Germany to use our car-sharing service abroad, too.

Promoting intermodality

In the near future, BMW i ConnectedDrive Services will use the Intermodal Routing
service to include public transport, current schedules and to guide drivers to a free
parking space close to the respective station or stop.

Facilitate the search for parking spaces

Our ParkNow app will permanently change the way people find parking spaces. It
makes the urban parking situation transparent and spaces can be booked in advance.

Comply with data protection regulations
in all areas

In Germany, our Group-wide data protection guideline Binding Corporate Rules
(BCR) was official recognised by the state office for data protection in 2014.
The BMW Group successfully complete the application procedure for this kind
of recognition.

About this report

The BMW Group Sustainable Value Report (SVR) 2014
has been published to provide stakeholders with comprehensive information about the company’s sustainability
strategy and the progress made in integrating sustainability into its corporate processes. This year, the Sustainable
Value Report is being published on the same date as the
BMW Group Annual Report for the first time.

Independent Assurance Report
GRI Index
Imprint/Contact

Topics have been selected and weighted in accordance
with the findings of a systematic materiality process
see Chapter 1. Where appropriate, references are also
­provided to supplementary information in the Annual
Report or on other BMW Group websites.
Each chapter starts with a one-page overview of the
main facts. In 2014, these included progress made as well
as a forecast of future objectives. In addition, the report
­contains the key performance indicators that control and
monitor the BMW Group’s sustainability performance.

The reporting period is the 2014 calendar year. The
­effective date for all facts and figures is 31 December
2014. The “Key facts and figures” section generally maps
the figures for 2009 – 2014 (with the exception of newly
added key figures). They refer to the entire BMW Group
with its three brands BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce. There
are, however, some exceptions concerning site-specific
topics and local sustainability programmes. Wherever
this is the case, the entity the figures apply to is specified
accordingly, e.g. BMW AG. Where necessary and possible,
calculation methods are explained in footnotes to the
respective graphical figures.
The Sustainable Value Report (SVR) is published annually.
The last SVR was released in May 2014 as an interactive
PDF covering financial year 2013. The SVR is available
on www.bmwgroup.com/sustainability. The next Sustainable
Value Report (SVR) will be published in early 2016.

The “Key facts and figures” section see separate PDF
d­ ocument provides a transparent list of all of the key
­sustainability indicators, together with explanatory texts.
The report is published in German and English.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

The BMW Group’s Sustainable Value Report 2014 has
been compiled in accordance with the Global Reporting
Initiative (GRI G3.1) guidelines. To what extent GRI
­indicators are met is shown in the GRI Index. At GRI
level A+ (GRI checked), this SVR 2014 meets the
­maximum requirements detailed in the GRI guidelines.
Sector-specific aspects have also been considered on
the basis of the GRI Automotive Sector Supplement
(Pilot Version 1.0).

The BMW Group SVR contains various forward-looking statements about future developments which are based on the
­current status of the BMW Group’s assumptions and forecasts.
They are thus subject to a variety of predictable and unpredictable risks, uncertainties and other factors, so that the actual
outcome, including the company’s financial and assets position,
its development or performance could differ considerably.
The BMW Group makes no commitment to update such
forward-­looking statements or to adapt them to future events
or developments.

PRACTITIONER’S RESPONSIBILITY

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion based on our work performed as to whether anything has come to our
­attention that causes us to believe that the information in the Report of the Company for the business year 2014 has not
been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the above-mentioned criteria of the Sustainability Reporting
­Guidelines Vol. 3.1 (pp. 7 to 17) of the GRI. We also have been engaged to make recommendations for the further development of sustainability management and sustainability reporting based on the results of our assurance engagement.
We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000.
This Standard requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the assurance engagement,
under consideration of materiality, to provide our conclusion with limited assurance.
In a limited assurance engagement the evidence-gathering procedures are more limited than for a reasonable assurance
engagement and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance engagement. The procedures
selected depend on the practitioner’s judgement.
Within the scope of our work we performed amongst others the following procedures:
	Inquiries of personnel responsible for the preparation of the Report regarding the process to prepare the reporting
of sustainability information and the underlying internal control system;
	Inspection of documents regarding the sustainability strategy as well as understanding the sustainability management
structure, the stakeholder dialogue and the development process of the Company’s sustainability programme;
Inquiries of personnel in the corporate functions that are responsible for the individual chapters of the Report;
	Recording of the systems and processes for collection, analysis, validation and aggregation of sustainability data
and its documentation on a sample basis;
