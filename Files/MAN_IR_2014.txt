REAFFIRMING OUR COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY,
SUSTAINABILITY, AND CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Overview

Dear Stakeholders,

For the first time, MAN is issuing a report in line with the new G4 version
of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines. By taking this step we
Portrait
are reaffirming our commitment to transparency, sustainability, and corporate responsibility.
Strategy
As part of the process of preparing this report and realigning our
Integration
CR strategy, in 2014 we analyzed sustainability issues to determine which
are most material for the MAN Group – evaluating global challenges such
People
as climate change, environmental pollution, resource scarcity, and urbanProduction
ization with regard to the opportunities and risks that they represent not
only for the environment and society, but also for our commercial sucProducts
cess. The result is MAN’s CR Strategy 2020+, which defines activities
Annex
and targets in the areas of People, Integration, Production, and Products. It goes without saying that the CR strategy remains an integral
part of the MAN corporate strategy.
		
In the past year, our ongoing initiatives led to
a number of significant achievements. We succeeded
in cutting CO₂ emissions at our production sites by
19 percent compared to 2008 levels. By installing
an on-site photovoltaic system, we were able to
present our first climate-neutral plant in
Pinetown, South Africa. And at the IAA Commercial Vehicles and SMM trade fairs, we
impressed visitors with our portfolio of efficient products and services. Our active commitment to environmental and climate protection has also been honored by the
renowned Carbon Disclosure Project organization,
which awarded MAN its highest rating.
Dr. Georg Pachta-Reyhofen
Foreword

Chief Executive Officer, MAN SE

Our employees have played a crucial part in these successes. MAN’s outstanding performance is built on their dedication. Our working relationship is firmly anchored in respect, integrity, opportunities for personal
and professional development, and a safe and healthy workplace. In 2014
the participation rate in our employee opinion survey, which measures
our employees’ satisfaction and identification with the company, rose
from 83 to 90 percent – and encouragingly, the responses were positive. At
the same time, our employees continue to give back to the community. In
2014 they contributed more than 600 volunteer hours to SOS Children’s
Villages projects, a significant increase over the previous year.
This GRI Report is one of several innovative formats in which we
present Corporate Responsibility at MAN in 2014. It includes all the facts
and figures on sustainable business practices at MAN, and is aimed not
only at sustainability analysts and investors, but also at our customers and
business partners. By outlining our activities in line with the UN Global
Compact’s ten principles for responsible business practices, it also represents our Communication on Progress, upholding our commitment to
the largest and most important international CR initiative. In the interest
of credibility, we have also had our strategy, management approach, and
key performance indicators verified by an independent firm of auditors.
Looking to the future, we aim to continue demonstrating our commitment to corporate responsibility and to maintain our dialog with you,
our readers. Let us live our responsibility – together!
Best regards,

Dr. Georg Pachta-Reyhofen
Chief Executive Officer, MAN SE

The MAN Group
The MAN Group is one of Europe’s leading commercial vehicle, engine,
and mechanical engineering companies. As a producer of trucks, buses,
diesel engines, turbomachinery, and special gear units, all our divisions
hold leading market positions. The Group is active in more than 180 countries.
Our primary objective – sustainable value creation
We have successfully placed our strategic focus on transportation and
energy in recent years. The fact that these are forward-looking and highgrowth sectors can be seen in challenges such as globalization and the
associated rise in international trade, population growth, urbanization,

and climate change. In its Commercial Vehicles und Power Engineering
business areas, MAN offers its customers tailored solutions specifically
designed to reduce emissions and fuel consumption. Our corporate strategy is built on our global presence and our broad-based portfolio of efficient products and services. They give us the stability we need to largely
absorb fluctuations in individual markets and to be prepared for increasing global competition. MAN prioritizes responding to customer needs,
with technology leadership and the continuous expansion of our aftersales business as further key factors in our success. This strategic approach
forms the cornerstone of the MAN Group’s primary objective – sustainable value creation.

Economic environment
In the year under review, global economic growth only slightly exceeded
the prior-year figure. In Western Europe, GDP growth recovered year-onyear, but the economy slowed over the course of the year. In addition, the
effects of the crisis in Ukraine and weaker demand in various emerging
markets led to a downturn in the capital goods sector. The MAN Group
generated sales revenue of €14.3 billion in 2014, down 10 percent year-onyear. Operating profit improved slightly compared to the previous year,
rising to €384 million. We paid out guaranteed dividends to our shareholders totaling €24 million in 2014, or €3.07 per share for the 2013 fiscal
year. The MAN Group’s operating return on sales increased from 1.9 percent in the previous year to 2.7 percent in 2014. Further information on
our financial performance is available in our 2014 Annual Report.
In the year under review, MAN paid income taxes amounting to
€708 million (€123 million). We do not take extensive measures to optimize our taxes.

Investment by Volkswagen AG in MAN SE
A domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (DPLTA) between
Truck & Bus GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of Volkswagen AG, and
MAN SE was entered into the commercial register on July 16, 2013, and has
been effective since that date. On December 31, 2014, Volkswagen AG held
75.28 percent of MAN SE’s voting rights and 74.04 percent of its share capital. On December 31, 2014, the free float for MAN’s common shares
amounted to 24.75 percent.
Capital expenditures
In the 2014 fiscal year, the MAN Group incurred capital expenditures totaling €610 million, after €562 million in the previous year. There was growth
in both payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment, and in capital expenditures on intangible assets. In view of the difficult economic situation, we are reviewing planned capital expenditures particularly critically, and are deliberately continuing the necessary capital expenditures
that will lead to long-term growth.

MAN’s future performance depends on understanding global challenges and recognizing the opportunities and
risks with regard not only to sustainable development, but also to our commercial success. These were the
factors that guided the realignment of our CR strategy, resulting in MAN’s CR Strategy 2020+. This is how we
live our responsibility – along our entire value chain.
Realignment of MAN’s Corporate Responsibility
Strategy
[G4-18] Since 2010 corporate responsibility (CR) has been an integral part
of MAN’s Corporate Strategy. In 2014 we undertook the strategic realignment of our CR strategy and its four fields of action, Integration, People,
Environment, and Economy.
As part of a multi-step materiality analysis, we identified CR issues
that are relevant to MAN. This included not only what our stakeholders
expect of the Company, but also MAN’s own objectives for sustainable
commercial success.
Evaluation by MAN CR Steering Committee
The MAN CR Steering Committee (, CR Governance) discussed and
ranked twelve global challenges, including climate change, population
growth, resource scarcity, poverty, and health. Using a scale of zero (low) to
ten (high), they evaluated the challenges with regard to business opportunities and risks for MAN (, graphic).

Assessment by stakeholders
[G4-24, G4-25, G4-26, G4-27] To supplement the materiality analysis performed by the MAN CR Steering Committee, we once again conducted a
stakeholder survey to assess our stakeholders’ expectations. This time we
elected to use an international, open, online questionnaire. With the aim
of including as many stakeholder interests as possible, we did not preselect target groups. Over a period of several months more than 1,700 people participated in the survey on the MAN corporate website. We were able
to analyze more than 150 of these data sets. Forty-two percent of the participants were employees; 20 percent were customers and business partners.

[G4-18] To identify the material global challenges facing MAN, we also
looked beyond the assessments of the MAN CR Steering Committee and
MAN stakeholders, conducting analyses of our competitors and consulting experts. As a result, we defined six material challenges as the basis of
our realigned CR strategy as well as our reporting in line with the G4 standard of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). These global challenges were
then assigned to the corresponding GRI Aspects (, table page 8) for which
MAN reports at least one performance indicator (, GRI Index page 59 et
seq.).
We performed this materiality analysis for the MAN Group as a
whole. To take account of potential regional variations, MAN Latin America conducted an additional, separate analysis, which confirmed the MAN
Group results to a very large extent. In this analysis, regionally relevant
issues such as access to water, biodiversity, and population growth were
ranked higher and are addressed accordingly by the subgroup’s CR activities.

Description

Relevance for MAN

The rise in global temperatures leads to natural disasters
such as severe storms and forest fires. In some areas this
causes secondary disasters, such as famine caused by loss
of harvests.

Against this backdrop, the transportation and logistics sector is called on to reduce its CO2 emissions.
Top priority is given to the development and use of
alternative drives and fuels as well as advancing the
development of decentralized energy supplies.

Energy
Emissions
Transportation

Resources include all raw materials and natural resources
such as water, energy, and land which are necessary for
life and economic activity. Overuse of these resources
leads to water shortages, desertification and erosion, and
rising prices for raw materials and building materials.

As a manufacturing company, resource scarcity
impacts on MAN and makes its supply of production materials less secure. In addition, the finite
nature of fossil fuel resources necessitates the rapid
development of alternative drive technologies.

Materials

The percentage of the total world population living in urban
areas is growing steadily. According to United Nations estimates, in 2030 sixty percent of all people will live in cities.

The quality of life and ecological sustainability of
large cities depends on efficient transportation and
energy solutions, as well as intelligent mobility.
MAN can make a material contribution in these
areas.

Energy
Transportation

Severe physical strain, lack of exercise, and psychological
issues such as stress, mental overload, and burnout are
the key challenges in the field of health and create a burden on social welfare and health insurance systems. In
addition, environmental pollution (see below) can lead to
health problems.

For MAN as a manufacturer of heavy industrial
machinery and commercial vehicles, the issue of
occupational health and safety has traditionally
played an important role. In addition to initiatives
targeting our production workers, the prevention of
office-related illnesses is assigned high priority.

Occupational health
and safety
Customer health
and safety

The increasing amounts of waste produced around the
world have far-reaching effects on plant, animal, and
human life. Millions of tons of plastic waste end up in the
oceans and contaminate the groundwater. In addition,
waste incineration plants cause air pollution.

MAN makes every possible effort to limit the negative environmental impacts of its production activities, focusing on the continuous reduction of volumes of waste and assessing the recyclability of
materials in product life cycle analyses.

The CR Strategy 2020+ is MAN’s response to the global challenges which
have been identified as having material significance for the Group. It
allows us to identify the risks and opportunities arising from these challenges at an early stage and react accordingly. This safeguards the future
success of our business and makes a contribution to sustainable development.
In 2014 we realigned our existing CR strategy and the fields of
action it defined. Our CR activities have been brought even more closely
into line with our value chain, specifically placing a sharper focus on the
use phase of MAN products. Accordingly, we have identified Products as a

new CR cornerstone and integrated the Product Responsibility field of
action into our CR strategy. MAN’s CR Strategy 2020+ thus comprises four
CR cornerstones: People, Integration, Production, and Products. Four
fields of action have been assigned to each cornerstone. We have set ourselves a strategic objective for each field of action.
We have assigned the five core initiatives of MAN’s Climate Strategy to the Integration, Production, and Products cornerstones of our CR
Strategy 2020+. It goes without saying that we will continue to pursue
these objectives and initiatives within the new framework.
MAN has systematically aligned its 2014 GRI Report with the CR
Strategy 2020+. The following chapters correspond to the four CR cornerstones, while their subsections are named after the fields of action.

At MAN, corporate responsibility is a top managerial function. The Corporate Responsibility Board, the highest CR governance body, is made up of
members of the boards of MAN SE and the subgroups. In 2014 the CR

Board consulted on the CR strategy and its realignment and implementation. The Chief Human Resources Officer and Director of Labor Relations
is ultimately responsible for CR at MAN. The MAN Group’s Corporate
Responsibility function reports to him and is responsible for applying

rate Responsibility function serves as the central point of contact for all CR
issues in the Company. It also coordinates the CR Steering Committee,
which met seven times in the 2014 fiscal year and whose members include
managers from the Production, Products, and Integration functions (e.g.
from Purchasing, the Group Works Council, and Human Resources) and
all subgroups. In addition to the continuous development of the CR strategy, the CR Steering Committee is responsible for integrating CR into our
operating processes and for systematic stakeholder dialog.

CR cockpit
To facilitate the management of the CR Strategy the Company has developed a CR cockpit which includes the defined KPIs for all fields of action.
This provides reliable information on current progress towards meeting
targets, making it possible to initiate remedial measures if deviations
from those targets are identified.
Cooperation with the Volkswagen Group
As a strong brand within the Volkswagen Group, we participate in the Corporate CSR & Sustainability and Environment & Energy Steering Groups
in order to play an active part in shaping the Volkswagen Group’s environmental and sustainability strategy.

INTEGRATION
Our business practices are shaped by corporate responsibility (CR). It is our aim to live our responsibility
every day. We continue to boost our competitive edge by anchoring CR firmly in the strategies of our divisions,
our operating processes, and our vocational training and continuing professional development. Responsible
corporate governance is the foundation on which we build. Systematic stakeholder dialog and open
communication with our customers help us integrate CR in our core business activities. Through our corporate
citizenship initiatives, we also make a lasting contribution to sustainable development.
Responsible corporate governance

Compliance program

Challenges and objectives
Our business success is achieved in compliance with the applicable laws
and regulations. In managing and providing oversight of the Company,
the aim is to ensure its continued performance and the sustained creation
of value in accordance with the principles of the social market economy.

Challenges and objectives
MAN does not tolerate illegal or irregular conduct. Managers have a particular responsibility to lead by example, follow rules, and comply with
the law.

Principles and guidelines
Our management complies with internationally and nationally recognized standards of good and responsible corporate governance. Important policies and guidelines include:
Corporate law and financial regulations
German Corporate Governance Code
UN Global Compact (UNGC)
Code of Conduct
Articles of Association and internal policies

Organization
The MAN Group Compliance function is currently staffed by 48 employees and headed up by the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO). At meetings of
the Compliance Board, the CCO informs MAN SE’s Executive Board and the
heads of other functions on the progress made in the implementation of
compliance activities and the introduction of new compliance measures.
In addition, further steps are agreed upon. The Compliance Board met
twice during the reporting period.
In addition to the Compliance function, MAN has a network of
some 100 Compliance Champions, managers who are not full-time Compliance employees but who have taken on special responsibility for the
topic. They support the Compliance organization in the implementation
of compliance measures at Group companies that do not have their own
local compliance managers in place.

Principles and guidelines
Our Code of Conduct outlines standards of behavior that are binding for
all our employees in their daily work. Our compliance policies also provide
concrete instructions for handling ambiguous situations. Relations with
our associates are regulated by our Code of Conduct for Suppliers and
Business Partners, which requires them to comply with basic principles of
corporate responsibility, transparency, fairness, and data protection.
Systems and instruments
Rolled out in 2010, the compliance program helps us detect non-compliance at an early stage and respond quickly, effectively, and consistently. In
addition to combating corruption, antitrust law, and data protection, a
fourth pillar has now been added to the compliance program: the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing.
The Disciplinary Sanction Committee is the body responsible for
imposing internal sanctions in the event of compliance violations. It meets
on an ad hoc basis and is made up of the Chief Executive Officer of the subgroup concerned, the Chief Human Resources Officer of MAN SE, the Chief
Compliance Officer, and the Compliance Officer of the subgroup in question.
The findings of misconduct investigations – as well as the results of regularly
conducted compliance risk assessments – are used to continuously improve
our compliance program and introduce selective compliance measures.
Memberships
MAN is a member of Transparency International, the World Economic
Forum (WEF) Partnering Against Corruption Initiative, and the German
Institute for Compliance (DICO). We are active in several different DICO
committees and working groups. In addition, we support the Alliance for
Integrity, an initiative of Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Federation of German Industry, and numerous German companies, which promotes integrity in business practices.

Risk Management
Challenges and objectives
Operating a business entails constant exposure to risks. With a view to
exploiting market opportunities, we consciously assume risk if we expect
it to contribute sufficiently to increasing the value of our enterprise. As a
basic principle, risk that could jeopardize the Group’s continued existence
may not be entered into; unavoidable risk must be minimized by taking
appropriate measures. Global challenges such as climate change, demographic change, globalization, population growth, and urbanization represent opportunities and risks for MAN, as does the internationalization of
our business activities.
Organization
Our Group-wide risk management system provides us with the necessary
information at an early stage, allowing us to contain risk and take advantage of opportunities. Comprising key elements such as corporate planning, risk and opportunity management, internal audit, and the compliance system, it forms an integral part of our corporate management and
business processes.
Instruments
The assessment of climate-related risks and opportunities is part of the
MAN Group’s overall risk management. To this end experts regularly
conduct risk analyses, which have concluded that MAN is indirectly
affected by climate change. One or more of the subgroups is subject to the
following risks:
Regulatory risks, particularly with regard to a CO₂ tax or emissions
trading in the logistics sector
Extreme weather events, such as severe storms, flooding, hail, or heavy
snowfall, which could interrupt production or affect suppliers

 isk of damage to reputation – because the use of our products generR
ates greenhouse gas emissions and MAN can only achieve long-term
market success if the Company invests in energy-efficient and low-carbon technologies
At the same time, the consistent continuation of the European climateprotection policy and the gradual implementation of similar policies in
the BRIC countries will also yield new growth opportunities for MAN.
These include:
Increasing market share through early compliance with regulatory
requirements
Strengthening ties to customers and suppliers through joint efforts to
cut CO₂ emissions
Increasing competitiveness due to greater immunity to energy price
fluctuations, resulting from increased reliance on internal energy
generation and renewables

Corporate citizenship
At MAN we see ourselves as part of society. Our goal is to be a good corporate citizen and promote sustainable development. We can make the most
valuable contributions to issues that relate to our core business areas. Our
activities focus on long-term and sustainable education projects for
children and young people.
With our attractive initiatives, we are aiming to make a contribution
to society and increase our employees’ identification with the Company.
For seven years now, we have enjoyed a strategic partnership with
SOS Children’s Villages. In cooperation with this non-profit organization,
we implement projects around the world – often with the help of volunteer work by our employees.
Policies
All donations and sponsoring activities must comply with our mandatory,
Group-wide policy. Permissible fields of activity for donations include education, academia, the arts, and community programs (social welfare organizations, charitable and humanitarian projects, and disaster relief efforts).
Instruments
Most of our sponsoring activities and donations are long standing and
closely related to our core business areas. We apply the internationally
recognized London Benchmarking Group (LBG) model to measure the
success of our community projects.

CR strategy realignment
The MAN CR Strategy (, page 9 et seq.) was revised in 2014 and is continuously updated to reflect global challenges and the changing
requirements of our stakeholders. This allows us to boost our competitive edge.
Integration in corporate divisions
The integration of CR in the strategies of the divisions, operating processes, and vocational training and continuing professional development activities is the most important factor in our success. Systematic
stakeholder dialog and open communication facilitate the integration of
CR in MAN’s core business activities. In 2014 we also continued anchoring
CR in the functional and cross-functional strategies at MAN Truck & Bus.
This process of integration will be further intensified at MAN Diesel &

Turbo in 2015. In the year under review, MAN Latin America not only rolled
out a CR committee, but also conducted a materiality analysis which specifically took regional factors into account.
Training courses for managers
Our employees live corporate responsibility in their day-to-day work and
act as ambassadors for our CR activities. Our “Manage responsibly” training course raises our managers’ CR awareness and teaches them how to
implement MAN’s CR and Climate Strategies within their spheres of
responsibility. In 2014 some 200 managers and multipliers – such as
trainers and works council members – from MAN Truck & Bus participated in more than 20 “Manage responsibly” training courses. Since the
program was initiated in 2012, a total of almost 600 participants have
attended 67 such courses.

the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (DCGK)
as amended on June 24, 2014. The most recent Declaration of Conformity
was issued in December 2014. MAN SE departed from the DCGK recommendations with regard to three points (, 2014 Annual Report, page 14 et
seq).
Business Partner Approval Tool
Our policy on engaging business partners regulates collaboration with
business partners who support our sales activities. The Business Partner
Approval Tool is used to check and approve their integrity. A list of all companies who we are not permitted to work with is updated on a monthly
basis and communicated within the Group.
In total, over 2,033 checks were conducted using this tool in the
2014 reporting period. As approvals are limited to two years, some of the
checks related to renewals of the approvals granted to individual business partners.
Compliance Helpdesk
All MAN employees can contact the Compliance Helpdesk by phone or
e-mail to obtain answers to compliance-related questions. In the reporting period, 527 questions were answered.
Compliance training
The Compliance function held compliance awareness training courses for
1,916 employees around the world in the year under review. These on-site
training courses focus on providing basic knowledge on combating corruption and antitrust law. We also conduct special training courses on

antitrust law and combating corruption for employees who are particularly exposed to risks in these areas. In 2014 these courses provided intensive training to 1,591 employees. Special classroom training courses were
also held for 155 procurement employees and business partners in the
reporting period.

course covers the fundamentals of combating corruption, antitrust law,
and data protection. In addition, 22,370 employees were trained in correct
conduct during searches, dealing with conflicts of interest, and preventing
money laundering using the second training module on the Code of Conduct, which was rolled out in 2014.

Compliance

Since 2013, employees who are exposed to an increased corruption risk
(e.g. in sales and purchasing) have participated in an in-depth web-based
training module on corruption prevention. In 2014, 3,989 employees completed the module.
Compliance Risk Assessment
A horizontal compliance risk assessment was conducted for the first time
in the year under review, in the course of which we specifically analyzed
the superordinate responsibility structures for compliance-relevant areas.
In the first phase, a total of 33 areas (e.g. employment law, tax compliance, environmental protection) were identified and compiled in a legal
compliance register. The responsibility structures within the MAN Group
were then evaluated with respect to all of these areas.
Preventive audits
The Compliance function again conducted three preventive compliance
audits at selected Group companies together with the Internal Audit function in the reporting period. The specific aim of these audits is to review
the local implementation status of the MAN compliance program, as well
as employee awareness of compliance issues in the company concerned.

Preventing money laundering
Both the German Money Laundering Act (GwG – Geldwäschegesetz) and
many laws in other jurisdictions require companies to introduce measures to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing. In the reporting period, communication measures targeted a total of more than 3,500
employees with information about the new money laundering policy
introduced in 2013 and the corresponding obligations.
Reporting compliance violations
The MAN “Speak up!” whistleblower portal again helped to uncover and
prevent risks in the year under review. “Speak up!” is used to accept and
analyze information relating to serious compliance violations, especially
in the areas of white-collar crime (e.g. corruption offenses and money
laundering), antitrust law, and data protection. MAN employees and third
parties can use “Speak up!” to report compliance violations at any time —
confidentially and regardless of time and location.
MAN does not tolerate compliance violations under any circumstances. Reports of possible violations are investigated in detail and violations are dealt with and punished according to the penalties permitted
under labor law. In addition, findings from the investigation of compliance violations are used to continuously improve the compliance system.
Data protection
MAN stands for effective data protection in compliance with legal regulations, applied worldwide based on the rigorous European standards. To
meet these stringent requirements, the MAN Group has a global network
of data protection officers and data protection coordinators. In Germany,
four data protection officers work to ensure that the personal data privacy
rights of employees, customers, and suppliers are respected. The network
also includes 75 coordinators in 44 nations outside of Germany who work
on data-protection issues in 89 companies.

CR and compliance risks can ensue from the acquisition or disposal of
equity investments. Since 2011 the Compliance function has been involved
in acquisition projects from the start to prevent such risks. The target
company must complete a due-diligence questionnaire that addresses
CR and compliance issues. It includes questions on human rights and

[G4-26] Dialog with policymakers
We are actively working to develop solutions for global challenges. To this
end, we also contribute our knowledge and expertise to the ongoing political debate. Our focus here is on topics relevant to our core business, such
as reducing worldwide CO₂ emissions caused by the transportation of
goods and passengers. We maintain an ongoing dialog with the responsible ministries at the national, EU, and international levels, as well as with
elected representatives and opinion leaders from the government and the
opposition.

Customer involvement and dialog
Dialog with our customers – one of the core initiatives of MAN’s Climate
Strategy – represents a valuable opportunity to discuss the reduction of
global CO₂ emissions. After all, many of our customers have already rolled
out their own CO₂ reduction targets. It is essential for MAN to understand
future customer needs; our customers benefit by flowing their requirements into the development of our products and services at an early stage.
At meetings of the customer advisory panel, first set up in 2009,
MAN Truck & Bus customers exchange ideas with MAN experts and the
board member responsible for sales. Up to twelve selected customers participate in each meeting of this discussion and feedback platform.
In 2014 we conducted customer dialog at the leading events for our
industry, the IAA Commercial Vehicles fair and the SMM maritime trade
fair. At its Eco Technology Lounge and the MAN PrimeServ Lounge at the
SMM, MAN Diesel & Turbo presented technological solutions for cutting
emissions and boosting fuel efficiency in new engines and through retrofitted equipment. Customers were able to learn more about dual-fuel
engines, for example, and exhaust gas treatment technologies.

Dialog event
As part of a stakeholder dialog event held at the MAN Museum in Augsburg, Germany, the 2013 CR Report was discussed with selected employees
and CR managers from the different Volkswagen Group brands. The conversation focused on topics such as the implementation of MAN’s Climate
Strategy and the local engagement of MAN and its employees.

Customer satisfaction
Along with our employees, customers are our most important stakeholders because they drive our business success. In order to maintain longterm relationships with our customers and to better understand their
needs, we conduct regular surveys in all our business areas to find out how
satisfied customers are with our products and services.

MAN is an active member of these associations and organizations, participating in working groups as well as management committees. This especially applies to committees which focus on the following issues:
Sustainable mobility
Fuel efficiency
CO₂, air pollutant, and noise emissions
Size and weight of commercial vehicles
Safety

Stakeholder & customer satisfaction

MAN Truck & Bus and MAN Latin America have been tracking customer
loyalty and customer satisfaction each year using the Customer Retention
Index (CRI) study. As part of the CRI study in 2014, we conducted telephone
surveys of some 24,000 customers for MAN Truck & Bus, 3,000 more than
in the previous year. Ninety percent gave MAN Truck & Bus a “good” rating or better, with some 60 percent responding with “very good.” We use
these results to check the effectiveness of our customer satisfaction
improvement measures and initiate follow-up activities.
Customer information
We provide our customers with comprehensive information and instructions for all our products. By optimizing the operation of our products,
our customers help not only to improve product safety, but also to con-

serve resources. We therefore inform them specifically about factors such
as rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag which influence vehicle emissions and fuel consumption. We present information on the CO₂ emissions generated by our vehicles in terms of the total lifetime mileage. The
calculations are performed using the Environmental Lifetime Emission
and Energy Consumption Calculator, which our customers can access at
www.manted.de.
We are working to raise our Sales employees’ awareness of CR,
safety, climate, and environmental issues and ensure they are informed
about our EfficientLine trucks and buses and our gas and hybrid drives. In
2014, more than 5,000 Sales employees successfully completed this training course. Of these, 2,000 participants focused specifically on efficiency
and environmental topics, and more than 1,300 on product safety issues.

Long-term partnership with SOS Children’s Villages
In 2013 we extended our long-term partnership with SOS Children’s Villages by an additional three years, pledging annual funding of €150,000.
MAN provides support to SOS Children’s Villages facilities in Germany and around the globe. For example, in 2014 we covered the costs for
five teachers at the SOS Herman Gmeiner School in Santo on the outskirts
of Port-au-Prince, the capital city of Haiti.
During the fiscal year, MAN donated €75,000 to SOS Children’s Villages to help cope with the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. We present
detailed information on our partnership with SOS Children’s Villages in
our online CR report (cr-bericht2014.man.eu).
Our decision to continue funding the SOS Vocational Training College in Kality, Ethiopia, was based on an analysis we conducted using the
London Benchmarking Group (LBG) model. MAN has contributed some
€600,000 since 2008, for instance for the construction of a new training
building, facility maintenance, the salaries of five teachers, and MAN
scholarships for young people.
The employee volunteering program encourages MAN employees
in Munich, Salzgitter, and Augsburg to donate their time to different charitable projects in SOS Children’s Villages facilities. The employees can use
some of their working hours for this volunteer work. In 2014 more than
100 MAN employees volunteered over 600 hours.
We present detailed information on our partnership with SOS Children’s Villages in our CR Online Journal (cr-bericht2014.man.eu).
Donations
In the year under review, our cash and non-cash donations totaled almost
€963,000. This increase – particularly in donations to science and academia – is primarily due to a single donation to the Future Initiative of the
Deutsches Museum.

MAN Diesel & Turbo continued its support for the Africa Mercy, the largest non-governmental hospital ship in the world, which travels along the
coast of Africa offering medical assistance to people who cannot afford it
themselves. In 2014 MAN Diesel & Turbo donated parts and services worth
more than €100,000 to keep the engines of the hospital ship in good
working order.
Scholarships
We are especially proud to be the primary funder of the Germany Scholarship at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). Since 2007 we have provided support to some 600 students, held lecture series, and provided
placements for project work. We work with a total of almost 100 technical
universities around the world.

Human resources management

MAN is one of Europe’s leading players in the commercial vehicle and
mechanical engineering sectors. To maintain this position going forward,
we need a first-class team which delivers outstanding performance. 55,903
individuals work at MAN. Only by promoting the professional growth of
all our employees – from vocational trainees to executives – can we ensure
that the Company will remain successful in the long term. This is why our
human resources (HR) strategy is built around outstanding performance,
the resultant success, and sharing in the benefits of that success. We also
live up to our responsibility to our employees by fostering health, skills,
and dedication. To attract and retain committed, responsible, and competent employees, we need responsible leadership and individualized HR
development and training opportunities.

Challenges and objectives
Our HR strategy addresses important challenges such as the health of our
employees, diversity and equal opportunity, and demographic change.
Based on these challenges, we have developed several key fields of action:
occupational health & safety, vocational training & continuing professional development, employer attractiveness & HR excellence, and promoting diversity. Concrete objectives have been defined for each field of
action and are reflected in our CR Roadmap. The long-term positioning of
MAN as a top employer has been anchored in the MAN Group’s corporate
strategy as a key objective since 2013.

Occupational health and safety management
Challenges and objectives
Shifting demographics and today’s changing working environments and
lifestyles bring significant challenges for occupational health and safety at
MAN. These factors affect our employees’ productivity and require holistic
approaches to maintain their health and physical ability. Only healthy,
motivated, and dedicated employees can achieve outstanding performance. With this in mind, we have traditionally placed a high priority on
ergonomics and preventive health and safety in the workplace.
Organization
The corporate health services function is responsible for our Companywide health management strategy and its implementation. The goal is to
define a coordinated strategic approach to health services worldwide by
developing principles which are applicable in every location. In addition,
the health services at our plants act independently to address specific concerns with appropriate measures.
Systems and instruments
At MAN, occupational health measures aim to strengthen our employees’
and managers’ health awareness and encourage them to take the initiative
in matters concerning their own health. To this end, we offer health counseling, training courses, therapeutic measures, and re-integration assistance.
Occupational safety includes all measures related to preventing
workplace accidents, work-related illnesses, and occupational diseases.
Our occupational safety management is part of our integrated management system (, page 37).

Certifying our sites under the OHSAS 18001 management system for occupational health and safety helps to continuously improve the safety and
health of our workforce.
Across the Group, we systematically evaluate workstation ergonomics and potential workplace hazards. We continue to place high priority on improving ergonomics in our production sites with the aim of keeping our employees healthy and physically fit throughout their working
lives. In addition, we conduct regular internal and external occupational
health and safety audits and inspections.

Employee structure
[G4-22] We have adapted our definition of headcount in line with
Volkswagen’s reporting practice. The headcount comprises active employees, employees in the passive phase of partial retirement, and vocational
trainees. It does not include subcontracted employees. The comparable
prior-year figures have been adjusted accordingly.
On December 31, 2014, the MAN Group employed 55,903 people.
This represents a decrease of 199 employees compared with the end of
2013. The ratio of employees in Germany to those in other countries
changed only slightly. Our non-German companies employed a total of
23,594 people. This represents a year-on-year decrease of 78. The number
of employees working in Germany fell by 121 compared with the previous
year to 32,309.
The number of employees on fixed-term contracts rose by 3 percent to 1,193 (previous year: 1,162). The number of subcontracted employees decreased by 448 to 879. In 2014, 373 subcontracted employees were
taken on as permanent staff. In the year under review, 631 women and 139
men held part-time contracts not related to parental leave.

In 2014 we also adapted our definition of employee turnover in line with

what percentage of employees left the company during a one-year period.
Employees on fixed-term contracts and employees starting retirement or
partial retirement are not included in the calculation of this indicator. The
relevant 2,043 departures in 2014 result in an employee turnover rate of
3.9 percent. This relatively low rate demonstrates the stability of labor
relations at MAN. In the year under review we hired a total of 4,845 people,
while 4,482 left our Company.

Vocational training and the dual model
Vocational training is the first step in the development of a top-performing team at MAN. Our dual model of vocational training ensures the development of the next generation of outstanding technical and commercial
employees. Over 800 young people started their careers in the fall of 2014,
for example in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Spain, France, and Turkey.
These secondary-school graduates entered 55 vocational training programs, 14 dual education programs, and eight integrated vocational training and degree programs covering a whole range of technical and commercial professions. In 2014, some 17 percent of our 3,312 vocational
trainees were women; seven percent of these were in technical professions.
Dual education programs in cooperation with various universities
are increasing in popularity among young people. At present, 205 students from cooperative dual education and combined degree programs
are completing the practical training portion of their studies at MAN in
Germany. It is encouraging to note that almost 24 percent of these students are women.
The four best MAN Group vocational trainees were honored with
the Volkswagen Group’s 2014 Best Apprentice Award. One of MAN Truck &
Bus’ prize-winning young talents from Munich is completing a degree
program at a technical university with the support of the Company. In the
year under review, a vocational trainee from MAN Diesel & Turbo was
honored as the best in Germany in his vocational field.
Continuing professional development and training
The continued success of the MAN Group as a leader in transportation and
energy relies on having exemplary, highly-qualified managers and specialists. Standardized across the Company, the MAN Academy’s targeted train-

ing program ensures that every employee worldwide – from vocational
trainees to managers – can build their skill sets and apply their knowledge
on the job.
Approximately 123,000 employees around the globe participated
in some 14,500 continuing professional development (CPD) and training
initiatives in 2014. Learning and teaching takes place in close cooperation
with internal experts. They pass their knowledge on to their colleagues
within the Berufsfamilien, which include all employees who have a common skill that they develop further. This training and knowledge transfer
takes place within the Berufsfamilien Academies.
The MAN Academy established a Berufsfamilien Academy for Production in 2014, focusing on the Assembly Berufsfamilie. Skills profiles
and corresponding training measures were developed and a training center was established to provide integrated training in basic assembly skills.
Based on this successful pilot project, further activities followed in the
Sales/After Sales and Engineering Berufsfamilien. The principle of the
Berufsfamilien Academies is being continuously expanded and broadened to guarantee uniform standards for quality and competencies
around the globe.
In 2014 each employee received an average of 18.1 CPD hours (previous year: 17.7).
New training programs were implemented to improve the leadership skills of group leaders (“Meister”) and support them in their day-today leadership roles. In addition, the program provides the opportunity
for group leaders to network within the Group and offers an associated
platform where they can exchange best practices. Overall, some 110 group
leaders were trained from the production, logistics, service operations,
and vocational training sectors.

Top employer
To secure a lasting position as a top employer, MAN has committed to the
following objectives: offering comprehensive onboarding programs to
integrate new employees as quickly as possible, providing topic-specific
and interdisciplinary training and CPD, facilitating the creation of professional and international networks, fostering cooperation across business
areas, and making MAN’s product range come alive. We believe that MAN
employees make the most convincing ambassadors for the Company’s
attractiveness as an employer.
Fostering young talent
We aim to attract and retain talent at an early stage. We offer internships,
scholarships, and career development programs to young people who are
attending or have recently graduated from universities and vocationaltechnical schools. In 2014 the MAN Group supported 20 PhD students and
gave some 3,000 students from colleges and schools around the world a
chance to gain first-hand practical experience working in the Company.
Also in 2014 MAN Latin America granted scholarships to 40 employees
and launched an additional scholarship program for language learners.
Our young talent programs target students at more than 100 technical colleges and universities. The MAN Group was represented at more
than 20 specialist and university career fairs in 2014. In addition, our
experts held numerous lectures around the world. For three years now
MAN has also supported teams from Munich Technical University, Munich
University of Applied Sciences, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and
RWTH Aachen in the Formula Student Germany race series. These activities focus on providing opportunities for face-to-face meetings and discussions with MAN employees

[G4-26] Employee opinion survey
In June 2014 we again conducted a survey of our employees. The employee
opinion survey (also known by its German name “Stimmungsbarometer”
or mood barometer) is a standardized, anonymous, voluntary survey of
the employees of all brands and companies in the Volkswagen Group.
By participating, employees play an active role in shaping events in the
Company. The survey measures employee satisfaction and identification
with MAN and is also used to gauge the success of MAN’s Top Employer
HR strategy.
In 2014, 90 percent of MAN Group employees participated in the
survey (previous year: 83 percent). The mood reflected is positive. Employees expressed their opinions on MAN’s image, communications, quality
and processes, teamwork with colleagues and supervisors, job satisfaction,
and workload. Their responses revealed both strengths and areas for
improvement. The survey results will be used as the basis for subsequent
improvement processes and follow-up activities. Specific measures will be
implemented in departments and teams before the next survey in 2015.
Retirement benefits
When their active working life comes to an end, employees in Germany
receive benefits from a modern and attractive occupational pension system that constitute a key element of MAN’s remuneration policy. These
benefits offer a reliable additional income on retirement and also provide
cover for the risk of permanent disability or death during their active
employment. Employees benefit from employer contributions that are
tied to their remuneration and can make additional provision through
deferred compensation — which is employer-subsidized for staff who are
covered by collective bargaining agreements.

For employees at sites outside Germany, depending on the usual practice
in each country we make market-based contributions to third-party pension plans or retirement investment funds. These also include defined
benefit pension plans, the majority of which are designed to provide lifelong annuities.

Employees covered by collective-bargaining agreements*

Job security
We are planning to bundle the production of urban buses at our plant in
Starachowice, Poland in the future. To this end MAN is investing approximately €40 million and hiring employees. In particular, the final assembly
of the buses will be moved from Poznań to Starachowice by the end of
2016. Although some 900 employees in Poznań will be affected by the
move, they will not lose their jobs, but have been guaranteed positions
within the Volkswagen Group – primarily in the new central bus production site in Starachowice and at the Volkswagen production sites in the
Poznań region. The responsible labor unions have agreed to the transfers.

Asia

Employee rights
The MAN Code of Conduct guides our daily behavior and activities. We
respect human rights, do not tolerate discrimination, and are committed
to transparency. In the reporting period, no cases of discrimination were
ascertained.
MAN recognizes the rights of workers to form and participate in
unions and to conduct collective bargaining. As of the year under review,
all permanent staff in Germany are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Companies without collective bargaining agreements were evaluated in cooperation with the Group Works Committee and customized
solutions are being drawn up.

Equal opportunity
MAN is committed to diversity and equal opportunity — respecting and
advancing employees regardless of age, sex, religion, ethnicity, and sexual
orientation.
To this end, we are working to promote equal opportunity for
women and men worldwide. Key aspects here are the creation of opportunities for women, in particular by establishing special company policies
and daycare facilities for children, offering training for employees on
parental leave, and organizing programs to recruit talented women and
foster their career development.
In 2014, we employed ten more women in management positions
than in the previous year. However, because of an increase in the overall
number of managers, the ratio of women managers decreased slightly to
8.7 percent, compared to 8.9 percent in 2013.

Our guidelines for management hiring specify that diversity and
the placement of qualified women in particular are to be given due consideration. In 2014 we promoted 28 women into or within management levels one to three. This represents 15 percent of our management promotions. There are currently no women on the Executive Board of the MAN
Group; two women sit on the MAN SE Supervisory Board.

Diversity
MAN supports and integrates people with disabilities into its operations.
The Company employed 1,577 people with severe disabilities in Germany
in the fiscal year. But outside Germany too we recognize the importance
of providing opportunities to disabled employees. Since 2011 MAN Latin
America’s “New Horizon” program has offered young people with disabilities the chance to work for the Company on an equal basis, to participate
in continuing professional development courses, and to receive a college
scholarship. In 2014, 44 young men and women took part in New Horizon.
Balancing work and family
MAN continues to work to help its employees achieve a better work-life balance. Measures include flexitime models, the opportunity to split a fulltime position into two part-time positions, and company daycare centers
at MAN’s Munich and Augsburg sites that care for 166 infants and toddlers.
Information sessions for pregnant employees and a seminar on re-entry
into the workforce after parental leave round off the resources available at
the Munich site. In addition, our employees in Bavaria can take advantage
of a caregiver placement service to help find appropriate care for children
and family members. An initiative of the Bavarian metal and electric industry, this program supports families during medical crises or in situations
where a family member suddenly becomes dependent on care. In Latin
America, we offer employees a six-month period of maternity leave.

Dilemma

Efficiency and flexibility
MAN has production facilities in 14 countries and is an important
employer in many locations. Because we make a point of hiring
employees and managers from the regions in which we operate, we
represent a stable source of income for local families. In addition,
whenever possible we support the local economy by purchasing
upstream products and services in the regions where our sites are
located. We value long-time employees and strive to retain skilled
workers.

At the same time, MAN aims to maintain its position as one of
Europe’s leading players in the commercial vehicle and mechanical
engineering sectors in the future. To remain competitive in the long
term, the Company must be agile and continuously improve its efficiency. This may also mean bundling capacity at certain sites and
consolidating production facilities (, page 32).
Here we must take due account of both our aim to be a top employer
– which includes offering job security – and the need to respond to
the demands of the market in order to meet our long-term business
objective. Whenever we transfer production to a different location,
we limit the impact on our employees, their families, and the region
wherever possible. We are often able to offer employees jobs at
other sites.

Preventive occupational safety
Across the Group we have continued with a variety of initiatives to cut
accident rates and prevent work-related illness. The success of these measures is demonstrated by the 14-percent decrease in lost-time injuries in
2014 compared to the previous year. As part of our “Workplace Optimization” initiative, we have systematically assessed the ergonomics of all
workstations in MAN Truck & Bus production sites. In 2014, MAN Truck &
Bus took the important step of establishing a Health and Safety Competence Forum which includes all its sites. Within the framework of the initiative, the forum aims to facilitate the exchange of information and the
strategic development of occupational health and safety in the coming
years. Its permanent members include representatives of the responsible
corporate functions, health and safety officers from the various sites, and
members of the works council. The evaluation of workstations for potential dangers was also systematized and standardized within the subgroup
with the aim of reducing workplace hazards to a minimum.

calculating the index is the number of workplace accidents multiplied by 1 million divided by hours worked.
3 The accident severity index indicates the severity of accidents by showing the sum of workdays missed due to injury in relation to the
number of hours worked. The formula for calculating the index is the number of workdays missed multiplied by 1 million divided by hours
worked x 10.

MAN Latin America has appointed workplace safety sponsors, who both
advise their colleagues on safety questions and report risks to their supervisors. In 2014, 371 suggestions for improving workplace safety were submitted by employees of the subgroup; 344 were implemented.
Behavior-based safety
The “Always Safe. Always Good” project at the MAN Truck & Bus production sites in Munich, Steyr, and Salzgitter aims to improve behavior-based
safety. Expansion of the program continued in 2014. A total of 94 managers and 240 employees in Munich and 54 managers in Salzgitter attended
the training workshops. The program was extended to all managers and
employees in Steyr as part of short-time work measures.
In 2014 MAN Diesel & Turbo placed particular emphasis on avoiding occupational accidents. Thanks to the MAN Diesel & Turbo Zero Accident Initiative, for the sixth year in a row there was a decrease in the severity as well as the overall number of workplace accidents within the
subgroup. Behavior-based safety programs were extended to five sites in
the UK, eight sites in the USA, and the Augsburg site in 2014. The programs
aim to increase awareness of hazardous situations, systematically remove
risks, and foster safe workplace habits. In addition, the “Safety First” campaign has made a valuable contribution to improving safety awareness
and occupational health and safety. The majority of MAN Diesel & Turbo’s
service engineers have also been trained and certified in line with the
Safety Certificate Contractors standard, which aims to sharpen safety
awareness on customer construction sites and in projects.
A number of important events took place in the year under review,
including a Safety Week in India and the presentation of several awards at
MAN Diesel & Turbo sites. These included a CSR award and the Safety Level
Certificate for the Changzhou plant, while MAN Diesel & Turbo Singapore
received the Singapore Health Award 2014 – Gold Award.

Certifications
In the reporting period, the MAN Truck & Bus production sites in Ankara,
Turkey, Krakow, Poland, and Nuremberg, Germany; the MAN Diesel &
Turbo production site in Velka Bites, Czech Republic; and the Renk production site in Winterthur, Switzerland received OHSAS 18001 certification for
the first time. This means that 17 of our sites are certified under the occupational health and safety management system – six more than in the
previous year.
Occupational health
MAN sees programs and assistance for employees re-integrating into the
workplace following a protracted illness or accident not only as a legal
obligation, but as an integral part of maintaining employees’ ability to
work and employability.

The “MAN Checkup” is a high-quality preventive health initiative aimed at
helping employees remain healthy and physically fit. In 2014 we began
rolling out the MAN Checkup in the Munich, Nuremberg, Salzgitter, Augsburg, Deggendorf, and Oberhausen sites. Attractive follow-up measures
and health campaigns are regularly added to the program. The aim is to
offer the Checkup to all employees within the next three years.
At MAN Truck & Bus, in the year under review absences due to illness averaged 13.7 days per employee.
At MAN Diesel & Turbo, the employee assistance program (EAP) is another
important pillar of occupational health management. An integral part of
our HR policy for many years, its services include counceling during crisis
situations and the development of concrete solutions.

PRODUCTION

Efficiency, resource conservation, and environmental protection are key pillars of our corporate responsibility
activities in the production sector, which also covers the fields of transportation, logistics, and purchasing. We
have set ourselves a clear goal: by 2020 we aim to reduce CO2 emissions at our production sites by
25 percent compared to 2008 levels.

Environmental Management
Challenges and goals
In the production sector, climate change, pollution, and resource scarcity
represent relevant global challenges to which the MAN Group is responding. Responsibility for the climate and the environment has traditionally
formed a core element of our corporate culture. We use our integrated
management systems and advanced technology to mitigate the negative
impacts of our activities. We take our responsibility seriously; in 2011 we
drew up a Group-wide climate strategy including the binding goal of
reducing CO₂ emissions at our production plants by 25 percent by 2020,
compared to a 2008 baseline.

environmental legislation and regulations, Transport

Organization
The highest decision-making body in strategic matters concerning the climate and the environment is the CR Board of the MAN Group (, page 11).
The members of the CR Board include the Chief Executive Officers and the
members of the board responsible for Production and Logistics and
Research and Development at MAN SE, MAN Truck & Bus, MAN Latin
America, and MAN Diesel & Turbo. A number of organizational units handle central steering, operational implementation, and the networking of
climate and environmental matters at the subgroups:
The central Environmental Protection and Occupational Safety functions of the divisions analyze normative requirements, implement and
steer the management systems, and drive them forward in close collaboration with the environmental management officers at the production sites.
The plant managers and heads of production are responsible for operational tasks related to environmental protection. At each site they are
supported by specialist officers responsible for e.g. waste or water protection.
The exchange of information between these officers across all central functions and sites is assured by regular meetings.

Production

Systems and instruments
The MAN Group operates management systems for environmental protection, occupational safety, and quality. At the production sites these systems are regularly verified by external experts or auditors as well as by
internal audits.
Other material systems and instruments for the implementation
of the climate strategy and environmental protection include:
at MAN Truck & Bus, environmental protection and energy policies
that specify the CR strategy and provide a frame of reference for the
activities of our employees
at MAN Diesel & Turbo the corporate policy providing a frame of reference for quality, occupational safety, and security management activities, as well as for environmental management; regulations and guidelines for the organization of environmental and security management.
Together with occupational safety, environmental protection is firmly
anchored in the vocational training and continuing professional development activities of our employees.

Transportation and Logistics Management
Principles and guidelines
Reduction of the negative environmental impacts of transportation and
logistics activities also forms part of our integrated environmental management system. At MAN Truck & Bus targets have been defined in this
respect, including the optimization of transportation structures and procedures. An appropriate tool for computing the CO₂ emissions from transportation activities has been put in place.

To reduce CO₂ emissions within our own transport chain, we supply our
regional freight forwarders via freight hubs, which consolidate shipments,
optimize vehicle capacity utilization, and avoid vehicles having to make
empty runs. As a commercial vehicle manufacturer, we expect our service
providers to use state-of-the-art trucks that comply with the latest emissions standards.
Rules governing travel by air, rental car, and train prescribe that
journeys should only be undertaken when unavoidable, and only after
first considering alternatives such as video or telephone conferencing.
Wherever economically feasible, the most environmentally friendly form
of transport should always be used.

Supplier Management
Challenges and goals
The MAN Group aims to reduce environmental and social risks in the supply chain while simultaneously optimizing material costs. The objective is
to increase procurement efficiency with regard to both sustainability and
cost-effectiveness.
MAN has adopted the core system of the Volkswagen Group’s “Sustainability in Supplier Relations” concept. Together with traditional priorities such as quality, price, and delivery times, the concept has been
thoroughly integrated in our procurement processes. To us, applying and
monitoring sustainability standards in the supply chain is above all a matter of minimizing risk – preventing potential supply shortages and damage to our reputation and ensuring that the quality of the procured supplies and services remains consistent. Both MAN and its suppliers profit
from the long-term supplier relationships which result.

Production

Concept and organization
The concept, which is based on three main pillars, aims to minimize or
prevent negative social, environmental, and financial impacts along our
supply chain:
An early warning system identifies risks along the supply chain.
Contractually mandated integration of the sustainability standards in
the procurement process ensures that these are acknowledged by all
suppliers before submitting a quotation on the Group Business Platform. Otherwise it is not possible to submit a quotation.
Supplier monitoring and development.
We regularly benchmark the effectiveness of our concept against other
companies and intensively analyze the results of sustainability ratings.
Principles and guidelines
Our supplier relations are based on the “Volkswagen Group requirements
regarding sustainability in its relationships with business partners (Code
of Conduct for Business Partners)” which apply across the Group. They formulate our expectations for our business partners’ conduct with regard to
central environmental and social standards. Among other things, they are
based on the principles of the UN Global Compact, the International
Chamber of Commerce’s Business Charter for Sustainable Development,
and the relevant conventions of the International Labour Organization.
These principles are supplemented by the Volkswagen Environmental Policy, the environment targets and regulations derived from it, the Group’s
Quality Policy, and the Volkswagen Declaration on Social Rights (, the
2014 Volkswagen Sustainability Report).

Before submitting a quotation, the supplier must acknowledge the sustainability requirements; this acknowledgement must be repeated every
12 months. Since January 1, 2015, these requirements have been contractually integrated for all suppliers to General Procurement. The requirements
apply to all outsourced goods and services worldwide. We also expect our
tier 1 suppliers to pass these requirements on to their own suppliers.
Systems and instruments
In the interests of continuing supplier development, in the course of our
business relations we make an electronic learning (E-Learning) module on
sustainability available to all suppliers in all of the languages of the defined
risk markets. After completing this task, the supplier has to perform a final
test.
The Volkswagen Group uses an internal system for sustainable supply chain management. It provides supplier-specific sustainability information, enabling the comprehensive analysis of suppliers. If there is reason to suspect that tier 1 suppliers or their suppliers are failing to comply
with our sustainability requirements, we ask the party concerned for a
written statement using a standardized report (6D Report). Based on the
six points in the report, they can describe the status quo and any remedial
measures. If the answers prove unsatisfactory, we take further appropriate
steps, such as the examination of documents, visits to the supplier’s premises, or other customized supplier development activities.
Through fair dialog in a spirit of partnership and through supplier
development we create sustainability in supplier relations. The focus
throughout all process steps and measures is on such fair dialog and on
the development of the supplier in the interests of long-term collaboration.

Scope of the indicators

Data management specifics

[G4-23] This chapter covers 34 production sites and production-related
sites in the MAN Truck & Bus, MAN Latin America, MAN Diesel &
Turbo, and Renk divisions. The one addition compared with last year is
the MAN Truck & Bus plant in St. Petersburg (Russia). Data from this
plant are included for the first time.

[G4-22] Back in 2013 we launched a process designed to improve the
accuracy and reliability of our environmental indicators. In 2014 we
managed to further improve the quality of these indicators, for example by reviewing – and where necessary adjusting – the data for 20082013. In addition, in 2014 we began drawing up the strategically relevant indicators on a quarterly basis.

CO2 emissions reported in the Progress Report on MAN’s Climate
Strategy relate solely to the 29 production sites that fall within the
scope of the Climate Strategy. This means that the nonproduction
sites – the spare parts warehouses in Dachau and Salzgitter (Germany), the Holeby facility (Denmark), as well as the St. Petersburg
(Russia) and Winterthur (Switzerland) sites are excluded.

In this context we adjusted the indicators for 2012 and 2013. As a
result, the indicators in this GRI Report in some cases deviate from the
data published in our 2013 CR Report.
Our reporting of the direct and indirect CO2 emissions is aligned with
the emission factors of the Association of the German Automotive
Industry (VDA). One exception here concerns the emissions from district heating: wherever possible we use site-specific emission factors
here, with the VDA factors being applied only where these are not
available.
Further information on our data management can be found in the
chapter on CR Strategy and Governance (, page 12 et seq.).

Energy consumption
Energy consumption at MAN was down 7 percent to 1.37 million megawatt-hours in the report year – a major step on the way to achieving our
2020 climate target of a 25 percent reduction in CO₂. Direct energy consumption fell by 8 percent in comparison with the previous year. Heating
oil consumption was down by around one-third, while natural gas use fell
12 percent and heat consumption 11 percent. These savings are due not
only to the mild temperatures over the winter of 2014 and lower production output, but also to the energy efficiency measures implemented as
part of MAN’s Climate Strategy.

Other primary energy sources, apart from gasoline, also include acetylene,
hydrogen, and propane, consumption of which rose by almost 30 percent in
2014. Greater volumes of this fuel gas were used in 2014 by MAN Diesel &
Turbo on test rigs in Augsburg and by MAN Truck & Bus for operating additional forklift trucks at the Starachowice site (Poland).

In 2014, energy consumption per vehicle produced rose by 9 percent over
the previous year to 8.1 MWh per unit. This is the result of the decline in
commercial vehicle output: Our plants have a certain base load when in
operation, so energy consumption does not decline proportionally to the
number of vehicles produced.
CO2 emissions
In 2014 we produced fewer vehicles, engines, and components than in the
previous year: Sales were down 10 percent and order intake down 5 percent. CO₂ emissions correspondingly fell by 6 percent. We achieved a
reduction of 7 percent in direct CO₂ emissions and of 5 percent in indirect
emissions over the reporting period. Successful implementation of the
measures in our climate strategy also helps to explain this downward
trend (, box page 43).

CO₂ reductions are evaluated on a cost-benefit basis to focus investment
on areas where CO₂ avoidance costs are low and the contribution to
achieving the target high. We therefore endeavor to identify potential savings of above 25 percent. As part of the Green Production initiative, MAN
Truck & Bus sites are developing measures relating to own energy generation, energy efficiency and renewable energies.

Truck & Bus made the largest savings of 24.6 percent. All sites have drawn
up plans for saving energy and CO₂. These often include:
optimizing lighting, insulation and ventilation
regular inspections to identify compressed air leaks
measures to reduce base load, such as switching off machinery at
weekends and during periods of closure

First carbon-neutral site
MAN Truck & Bus is operating its first carbon-neutral commercial vehicle plant at Pinetown in South Africa. The production plant is now completely
powered by renewables: a photovoltaic system covering 6,300 m2 and generating approximately 810,000 kWh of electricity annually has been
installed on the roofs of the production shops. As a result, the plant saves around 860 tons of greenhouse gases annually.

Dilemma

CO2 reduction
Back in 2011, MAN developed a climate strategy with the target of
cutting CO2 emissions at production sites by 25 percent by 2020
(baseline year 2008). However, it is MAN’s products which are its largest lever for reducing global CO2 emissions. Our research and development activities therefore focus on making our commercial vehicles,
engines and turbomachinery perform more efficiently, consume less
fuel and generate lower emissions.
In the course of developing more environmentally friendly products,
engines have to be subjected to repeated testing. This not only consumes liquid fuel or natural gas, but also causes CO2 emissions at the
sites. On the one hand, we want to pursue our target of reducing CO2
emissions from our production sites systematically, while on the other
hand we believe we have a responsibility to carry out further research
into boosting the efficiency of our products.

We are addressing this dilemma by implementing specific climate
protection measures on our sites (, above) and regularly measuring
and monitoring their effectiveness. For example, at the MAN Truck &
Bus plant in Nuremberg, we carry out “cold tests” on our engines,
thereby considerably reducing diesel fuel consumption. Even the
braking energy generated on the engine test rigs is fed back into the
internal power grid.
Since over 90 percent of the CO2 emissions from our products occur
in the use phase, our focus during product development is on boosting the efficiency of our engines while also researching alternative
powertrains and the use of alternative fuels (, Products chapter).
Since our products are often in service with our customers for several
decades, the effort involved in testing our engines to boost their efficiency is well worthwhile.

Emissions from transport and logistics
At 63 percent, truck traffic accounts for the largest proportion of CO₂ emissions in MAN Truck & Bus logistics. In the year under review, MAN Truck &
Bus caused the release of 71,422 tons of CO₂ for incoming supplies and
87,895 tons of CO₂ in delivering its products.
Employee mobility
In the report year, our employees caused 28,000 tons of CO₂ emissions by
business travel booked through the central travel service, around 55 percent of which was for flights.
In Germany, depending on the available infrastructure, we provide
subsidized tickets for employees’ journeys to and from work. At our sites
outside Germany we provide our employees with bus transfers, for example. At MAN Latin America’s Resende site in Brazil, around 80 percent of
employees make use of this service.

Certifications
All 34 MAN production and production-related sites are certified to a quality standard (the majority to ISO 9001). We have set ourselves the target of
also certifying these sites to the ISO 14001 environmental management
standard.
The Salzgitter spare parts warehouse (MAN Truck & Bus) went
through this certification process for the first time in 2014. This means
that eleven of the subgroup’s 15 production or production-related sites
now have a certified environmental management system to ISO 14001,
while five of them are also validated to the European Environmental Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) and regularly publish a site-related
environmental statement.
The production sites of MAN Diesel & Turbo, with the exception of
Aurangabad (India), are certified to ISO 14001. The foundry at the Augsburg site is additionally certified to the ISO 50001 energy management
system, which indicates possible ways of making energy savings and
boosting efficiency.
Consumption of resources and raw materials
MAN makes use of raw materials, auxiliaries and consumables which predominantly consist of steel, copper, aluminum and various plastics. Managing these resources economically is essential to our success, so saving
them is a Group-wide goal. Costs for raw materials, auxiliaries and consumables fell by 10 percent in 2014 in comparison with the previous year.

Recycling and waste
The products manufactured by MAN largely consist of materials which
can be readily recycled. We will record the exact proportions in the future
for product life cycle assessments (, page 53).
In order to save raw materials, we pay particular attention to reusing metals in our foundries. For instance, at our Augsburg plant we remelt
the chips produced when castings are machined. In 2014, we purchased
and reutilized around 20,500 tons of scrap from external recycling processes at the Augsburg and Nuremberg plants. In the year under review,
we also recycled over 12,000 tons of chips and scrap from our own production in the manufacturing process at the same plants.
Total waste volumes amounted to 120,691 tons in the year under
review, 92 percent of which were reutilized. These figures are in line with
the previous year’s levels. The sharp rise in total waste volumes for recycling was caused by construction activities at the MAN Truck & Bus site in
Munich and by the disposal of waste emulsions there after the in-house
demulsification plant failed.

Purchasing
MAN buys in around €8 billion worth of raw materials, goods and services
annually. The largest proportion is metals and plastics. Faced with a growing, increasingly global and more complex supply chain, the MAN Group
believes it has a responsibility to promote sustainability along the entire
value chain. The aim is to establish robust and efficient flows of goods and
supplies.

Growth potential arising from demand for goods and services by MAN has
a positive impact on infrastructure thanks to downstream effects: Jobs are
created and local incomes rise. Moreover, regional suppliers are also preferable from an environmental standpoint since transportation-related
emissions are lower.

Local suppliers
By purchasing raw materials, goods and services where we manufacture,
we contribute to local economic and social development. For example,
over 90 percent of suppliers to MAN Truck & Bus have their registered
offices in Europe, 70 percent in Germany.

PRODUCTS
MAN stands for efficient transportation and energy solutions. Our approach to product responsibility is broad
and comprehensive: Not only must our products offer maximum economic benefits for our customers and the

Comprehensive product responsibility
Challenges and goals
To meet the global challenges in the areas of health, resource scarcity,
urbanization and climate change, MAN takes a broad and comprehensive
approach to product responsibility. This focuses on everything from the
development of efficient and safe products and the implementation of
environmentally friendly, resource-efficient production processes to environmentally responsible after-sales activities and customer support. Consequently, product responsibility at MAN is based on four cornerstones –
environment, safety, health and social responsibility – and takes into
account the entire product life cycle, from raw materials extraction to endof-life disposal. This broad-based approach allows us to meet the increasing expectations of our stakeholders. As well as our customers, who base
their purchase decision on total cost of ownership and reliability, these
also include the Volkswagen Group, which is pursuing an environmental
strategy to which MAN aims to contribute, and policymakers around the
world, who are pressing ahead with ambitious environmental regulations.

Material GRI aspects covered in this chapter:

Products and Services (measures to reduce negative impacts) – Customer
Health and Safety

Principles and goals
We are committed to continuously improving the efficiency of our products. After all, in most cases our customers base their decision to buy a
product on total cost of ownership. In the freight transportation sector,
fuel costs account for approximately one-third of this sum, which is why
the quest for greater efficiency and low emissions is a key technology
driver. In pursuit of technology leadership, MAN focuses its research and
development activities not only on developing new products and enhancing existing ones but also on:
Reducing fuel consumption and emissions
Alternative drive concepts
Alternative fuels.
Systems and instruments
Future trends and scenarios are an important benchmark for MAN’s strategic product development process. MAN Truck & Bus therefore uses a
“Trend Radar” to assist in the early identification, evaluation and analysis
of relevant trends. The findings are then integrated into the Product Engineering Process.
To calculate the life cycle environmental impact of its products,
MAN Truck & Bus has adopted a two-step strategy. In addition to the Product Carbon Footprint (PCF), this will in future also include the Life Cycle
Assessment (LCA).

Product Engineering Process
On average, more than 90 percent of the total life cycle greenhouse gas
emissions of the products of both the Commercial Vehicles and Power
Engineering business areas are generated during the use phase of the
product (, page 53). Because most of our products have a very long service
life – and are used intensively – we implement a future-oriented product
development process to minimize environmental impacts as far as possible.
Our Product Engineering Process defines standard procedures for
product development. These procedures are geared particularly to ensuring the cost efficiency and reliability of our products, where we aim to continuously reduce fuel consumption – and therefore also emissions – while
also minimizing our consumption of materials.

In developing its commercial vehicles, MAN Truck & Bus also takes into
account the results of Life Cycle Assessments (, page 53) and options for
reducing total cost of ownership – for example by reducing maintenance
costs. In 2014, the subgroup took further steps to align its Product Engineering Process with standard procedures at Volkswagen. At MAN Truck &
Bus, environmental and health aspects of vehicle development, such as
measures to reduce pollutant emissions and noise, are regulated by the
Environmentally Compatible Product Development process guidelines.
Our aim is to continuously improve the efficiency of our products.
Although MAN Diesel & Turbo’s engines are today already capable of
achieving up to 50 percent efficiency, our work to reduce fuel consumption is ongoing.

Potential for reducing the life cycle CO2 emissions of our products
To identify the potential for reducing the life cycle CO₂ emissions of our
products, we calculate Product Carbon Footprints (PCF) for virtually all
product groups of the MAN Truck & Bus subgroup and for selected product groups of MAN Diesel & Turbo. The benchmark products for which calculations have been performed here included not only a dual-fuel engine,
but also a performance-enhancing system (turbocharger) and a Selective
Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system. The calculation methodology is based
on the requirements of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. The findings confirm that more than 90 percent of our products’ life cycle CO₂ emissions
are generated during the use phase.
In 2014, MAN Truck & Bus further refined its calculation model for
the PCF. One of the main changes is that the life cycle stages are now
defined in accordance with standard automotive industry practice. They
comprise:
1. Production
2. Use phase
3. End of life (recycling and waste processing)
Also in 2014, we began using more specific – and therefore more realistic
– calculation data for the PCF. For example we now use segment-specific
lifetime mileages, instead of an average for all trucks. To take a specific
example, over a total lifetime mileage of 1.8 million kilometers, a TGX
18.440 4x2 BLS Euro 5 semitrailer tractor produces total greenhouse gas
emissions of 1,746 tons of CO₂ equivalent, 98 percent of which is generated
in the use phase (, figure). In 2013 this truck topped the production charts
at MAN. The calculation was carried out in line with the requirements of
the GHG Protocol Product Accounting and Reporting Standard and was
verified in accordance with TÜV NORD standard TN-CC 020 and the international standard ISO 14064-3.

In future, MAN Truck & Bus also plans to perform Life Cycle Assessments

additional environmental impact categories not considered in the PCF. To
ensure that the LCA provides an even more accurate picture of our products, we are currently collating a database of the materials used in these
products.

Consistently Efficient product portfolio
Total cost of ownership is an important purchasing criterion for customers. In response, MAN offers a Consistently Efficient product portfolio in
all business areas.
Commercial Vehicles Cost-efficient and clean transport solutions from MAN
Truck & Bus include the new TGX EfficientLine 2, which incorporates a
whole series of new, fuel-saving technologies aimed at further reducing
total cost of ownership and CO₂ emissions. Standard specification includes
the EfficientCruise predictive cruise control system, the torque-enhancing
TopTorque system and the MAN TeleMatics system. The GPS-based EfficientCruise cruise control anticipates upcoming uphill and downhill
stretches and calculates the most fuel-efficient speed in advance. In this
way the vehicle’s momentum can be used to save fuel. These measures
result in fuel savings of up to 6 percent compared with the previous model.
The TGX EfficientLine is the most successful efficiency model on the market. Since market launch in 2010, almost 30,000 customers have already
opted for the extra-fuel-efficient EfficientLine models and packages.

The D38 engine, developed for use in the TGX series and presented at the
2014 IAA Commercial Vehicle Show, develops outputs in the 500-plus hp
range. This 15.2-liter six-cylinder engine is available in 520-, 560- and
640-hp-rated versions and combines effortless power and performance
with top-class efficiency.
The products of MAN Latin America combine enhanced customer
benefits with sustainability. The company offers a wide range of products,
tailored in accordance with the motto “Less you don’t want, more you
don’t need”. In addition, solutions for specific customers are customdeveloped and built at a special vehicle modification center.
Power Engineering The highly efficient gas engines and emissions control
systems offered by MAN Diesel & Turbo allow customers to comply with
both present and future emissions requirements. The technologies used
in new engines are also offered for retrofitting in engines already being
operated by customers. In its Power Plants strategic business unit, MAN
Diesel & Turbo offers one-stop power plant solutions that are optimized
to meet the requirements of the individual customer. Following the
launch of the 35/44G gas engine (electrical output 10,335 kW) on the power
generation market, the latest addition to the MAN Diesel & Turbo portfolio is the 51/60G gas engine, with an electrical output of 18,465 kW. This
engine too boasts very high efficiency.
From 2016, the IMO Tier III standard will come into force for ships
operating in the ports and coastal waters of North America, imposing substantially more stringent limits for nitrogen oxide emissions. MAN Diesel
& Turbo is the first company to successfully make four-stroke marine
engines IMO Tier III-compliant, based on a fully modular SCR system that
can be used across the entire MAN Diesel & Turbo four-stroke engine port-

Alternative drive technology
In MAN’s view, alternative drive technology will take on new importance
in the future. While hybrid drive, for example, has long been established in
the local mass transit sector, the challenge for the future will be to establish this technology in long-distance transport too.
The MAN Lion’s City Hybrid bus offers reductions of up to 30 percent in fuel consumption, which equates to a reduction in annual CO₂
emissions of 26 tons per bus. In 2014, MAN sold 75 of these vehicles, twice
as many as in the previous year.
At the 2014 IAA Commercial Vehicle Show, the company also presented the hybrid-powered TGX Hybrid concept model for long-distance
haulage. While the diesel engine provides the concept model’s main
source of motive power, the electric motor operates as a generator on the
overrun and during braking. Tests have showed that this solution can
bring a reduction in fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions of around 8 percent.
In February 2015, MAN Latin America was the first company in
South America to begin testing all-electric trucks. The project is focusing
initially on the VW Delivery 8.160, one of Brazil’s best-selling commercial
vehicles.
The new diesel/hydraulic hybrid drive system developed by MAN
Latin America for buses and Constellation trucks is already being tested by
customers. It offers greater energy efficiency at a lower cost than other

hybrid systems available on the Brazilian market. This technology is ideal
for vehicles in emerging markets that do a lot of stop-go driving, like
refuse collection trucks. City buses are a further possible application.
Alternative fuels
Commercial Vehicles When operated on biogas or e-gas, the MAN Lion’s City
GL CNG natural gas-powered city bus is almost carbon-neutral. In addition, life cycle maintenance and operating costs are cut by around 15 percent. This vehicle was voted “Bus of the Year 2015” by a jury of European
trade journalists, and was also presented with the Huss publishing group’s
“International busplaner Sustainability Award 2015”, in the line-service
category. 296 of the 5,025 buses supplied by MAN in 2014 were powered by
compressed natural gas.
Testing of sugar-cane diesel-powered Euro 5 trucks and buses by the MAN
Latin America subgroup revealed significant reductions in emissions:
Nitrogen oxides were reduced by up to 15 percent, soot emissions by 40
percent and particulate emissions by 77 percent. At the 2014 IAA Commercial Vehicle Show, MAN Latin America presented the Volksbus 18320 LowEntry powered by sugar-cane diesel.

manufacturer with the highest share of vehicles to pass the main TÜV
inspections free of faults. This makes MAN the most reliable brand for
trucks from 7.5 tons upward. The report found that one-, three-, four-, and
five-year-old vehicles from our TGL, TGM, TGS, and TGX series had the fewest faults. MAN even widened its lead in the one-year-old vehicle category,
with 83 percent of the trucks proving free of faults. For the twelfth time in
succession, MAN Latin America was the local market leader for trucks
from 5 tons upward.
Driver assistance systems
Based on many years of accident research, MAN Truck & Bus is working to
continuously improve the safety of its vehicles – for example with driver
assistance systems such as Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Emergency
Brake Assist (EBA) and Lane Guard System (LGS). Our engineers are currently developing systems that will act as an extended “electronic eye” and
will provide a view of areas not directly visible to drivers from the cab.

Safety training
When it comes to product safety, we depend on the support of all our
employees. It is essential to maintain high levels of safety awareness, along
with high standards of competence on the part of employees working in
critical areas such as explosion safety or machine safety. These priorities
form the basis for the ROST (Rollout Standardized Safety Training) project.
Launched in 2014, the ROST project is looking to expand the existing range
of continuing professional development programs on product safety in
order to ensure uniform standards throughout the company. In addition
to training our own employees, training for our customers is another
important focus.
For both customers and employees, MAN Diesel & Turbo’s
PrimeServ Academies offer technical training and customized product
training – which can be delivered directly on-site, even on board the customer’s ship or at the customer’s power station. Technical know-how
transfer mainly takes the form of hands-on product-based training. This is
supplemented by web-based training that combines practical elements
with e-learning. All PrimeServ Academies worldwide operate to the same
high quality standards. The PrimeServ Academies also provide a network
for promoting the exchange of knowledge between customers, suppliers
and employees in our research and development departments.

Traffic management systems
How can commercial vehicles operate safely and efficiently in an increasingly congested urban environment? These are the questions MAN engineers are tackling in the UR:BAN research project. The 31 project partners
include companies, universities, research institutes and cities. The project
is being subsidized by the German Federal Ministry for Economics and
Energy, and will be concluded in 2016.
The focus is on the development of new driver assistance and traffic management systems for trucks and buses. In this area, MAN is contributing to three subprojects: “Human Factors in Traffic”, where the aim is to
strip down information supplied by assistance systems to the essentials,
which are then presented in an intuitive way to drivers; “Networked Traffic
System”, where MAN is developing a green wave assistance system to
ensure fuel efficiency and time savings in urban driving by making optimal use of traffic light green phases; and “Cognitive Assistance”, which is
focused on improved 360º urban traffic monitoring for buses and trucks.
Long trucks
On certain routes, extra-long (up to 25.25 m) trucks have the potential to
help meet the forecast future growth in road freight traffic while at the
same time helping to curb greenhouse gas emissions. An MAN vehicle is
taking part in the German long-truck field trial, which will continue
through to the end of 2016. The trial vehicle is shuttling daily between the
Dachau parts depot and the Salzgitter plant. Further vehicles will also
operate between the Munich and Salzgitter plants. Findings derived from
the scientific monitoring of the field trial shows that on average one trip
by a long truck can replace 1.56 trips by a conventional standard truck,
reducing fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions by up to 25 percent. A decision on whether to grant general authorization for the use of long trucks
in Germany will not be taken until the field test has been completed and
the findings evaluated.

Connected mobility
Connected, automated driving offers a way to make optimal use of
vehicles, drivers and infrastructure. The biggest potential benefits,
as seen by transportation experts, industry and customers, are in
the areas of road safety and infrastructure utilization. Specifically,
this will be a step towards achieving the European Commission’s
goal of “zero traffic deaths by 2050”, as well as making better use
of the transportation infrastructure.
But connected mobility also has much wider implications for the
future of commercial vehicles. As well as improved safety, it also
offers improved fuel- and cost-efficiency. Connected vehicles provide a way of optimally controlling traffic flows so that vehicles can
avoid congestion and goods reach customers faster. Bearing in
mind that commercial vehicles typically cover over 130,000 km a
year, connectivity has the potential to greatly improve efficiency for
haulage companies, other road users and the business sector as a
whole.

To MAN SE, Munich
We have been engaged to perform a limited assurance engagement on the
description of the necessary materiality analysis for a sustainability report
and selected issues of the Corporate Responsibility Report 2014 of the
MAN SE, Munich, (hereinafter: the Company), for the business year from
January, 1st to December, 31st 2014.¹ The sustainability information, which
were selected by the Company and reviewed by us, are marked with the
following symbols
in the Sustainability Report.
Management’s Responsibility
The company’s Board of Managing Directors is responsible for the accurate preparation of the Sustainability Report in accordance with the criteria stated in the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 4 of the Global
Reporting Initiative (GRI).
This responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the Sustainability Report and the use of
assumptions and estimates for individual sustainability disclosures which
are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, the responsibility
includes designing, implementing and maintaining systems and processes relevant for the preparation of the report.
Our Independence and Quality Control
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements
of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA-Codex), which is
founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional
competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior.

The firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical
requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory
requirements.
Practitioner’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion based on our work performed
as to whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe
that:
the marked
description of the materiality analysis is necessary for a
sustainability report to determine its content and the boundaries of its
aspects is not in accordance with the criteria “Stakeholder Inclusiveness”, “Sustainability Context”, “Materiality” and “Completeness” of the
GRI’s Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 4 and that they were not
used during the Sustainability Report’s preparation,
the management approaches marked with
in the Sustainability
Report are not in accordance with the requirements of the standard
disclosures G4-DMA of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 4
and that

We also have been engaged to make recommendations for the further development of the sustainability management and the sustainability reporting based on the results of our assurance engagement.
We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000. This Standard requires that
we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the assurance
engagement, under consideration of materiality, in order to provide our
conclusion with limited assurance.
In a limited assurance engagement the evidence-gathering procedures are more limited than for a reasonable assurance engagement and
therefore less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance
engagement.

Information

[G4-24] Since 2011, each year we have provided our stakeholders with transparent and detailed information about our progress in implementing our
CR strategy. This year’s GRI Report is part of a multipronged reporting
approach aimed at the needs of our different target groups. Instead of
addressing all readers with a single publication, we decided to use a more
targeted reporting approach consisting of three different formats – all under
the heading of “Corporate Responsibility at MAN in 2014”:
In this MAN GRI Report, we provide a transparent account of what we
achieved in 2014 in the area of corporate responsibility and sustainability
and what we plan to accomplish in the future. Available exclusively
online as a PDF, it contains detailed information and KPIs for analysts,
investors, customers, and business partners.
 he MAN CR Online Journal presents the CR highlights of 2014, such as
T
the realignment of the CR strategy, our efficient products, and our partnership with SOS Children’s Villages. It also includes our Indicator Tool,
which allows readers to explore our KPIs for the last five years. The
microsite is aimed at employees, job applicants, customers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and members of the general public.
 he MAN CR Journal provides a clear summary of MAN’s CR activities in
T
2014. It is primarily intended to provide a quick overview for our
employees and customers around the world. This publication is available for download as a PDF and in print.
Report profile
This report complies with the standards of the new G4 version of the
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines. It was prepared in accordance
with the GRI G4 Core option. MAN’s CR reporting was preceded by a pro-

cess of materiality analysis which also took stakeholder views into account
– as described on pages five to eight. The GRI confirmed our selection of
material issues through its Materiality Disclosures Service. The GRI index
outlines our compliance with the relevant GRI indicators (, page 59) and
represents our UN Global Compact Communication on Progress.
We voluntarily submitted our 2014 GRI Report to a comprehensive
independent audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers which was conducted in
accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements
(ISAE) 3000 (, page 63 et seq.). In accordance with the GRI G4 reporting
standard, the focus of the audit was on the materiality process as well as
on selected management approaches and the corresponding indicators.
They are marked in the report with a
symbol.
Scope
[G4-17] The 2014 reporting period is identical with the 2014 fiscal year,
which runs from January 1 to December 31. The closing date for contributions was February 28, 2015. The next report should appear in the first half
of 2016.
Unless otherwise specified, the facts and figures published in this
report relate to the entire MAN Group (MAN SE including subsidiaries,
but excluding joint ventures, associated companies, and financial participations).
In the interests of readability we have not used the full legal names
of MAN SE and its subgroups.
Wherever relevant we have included cross-references to additional
information in the 2014 Annual Report or other MAN Group internet
pages. The GRI Report, the Journal, and the Online Journal appear in
German and English.
