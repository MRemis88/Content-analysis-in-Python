E X T E R N A L A F FA I R S

Welcome to our Better Holidays Better World
report 2016.
A couple of highlights from the second year
of reporting against our Better Holidays
Better World strategy really stand out for me.
The first is the feedback from our TUIgether
employee survey. This is - as you can imagine
- a complex exercise for a business with 67,000
employees, but the insights it gives us are so
valuable for understanding what motivates
and inspires our employees. In the survey we
included a question about TUI’s credentials as
an environmentally responsible company and
we were extremely pleased that this year’s
result puts us in the ‘high performer’ businesses
category. For me this really underscores how
Better Holidays Better World is bringing us
into line with the world’s best companies. Our
colleague engagement score, which measures
engagement with TUI as a company to work for,
also moved up 4 points in the past year, to 77,

2016 has been a successful year for TUI. Both
commercially and in the integration of the Better
Holidays, Better World strategy right across the
business we have worked hard to achieve our
2020 goals. But we also know we have to stretch
further and continue to find better ways of doing
things, and one example of this is the exciting
evolution of the TUI Care Foundation.
By the close of 2016, TUI funding for good
causes had reached €6.6 million and TUI
Care Foundation was launched as a groupwide umbrella for supporting these initiatives
going forward. Our recent research among
our holidaymakers suggests that customer
enthusiasm to see TUI maximise the positive
impacts of tourism is high and we believe that
the TUI Care Foundation does exactly that
- with a focus on promoting education and
opportunity for the next generation, protecting
the natural world, and supporting destination
communities to thrive.

which indicates to us that our drive to create an
environment in which our employees thrive is on
track.
The second was our performance in Investor
Indices: we were named industry leader by the
Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI). We also
made it onto the Climate A list of the Carbon
Disclosure Project and were ranked among
Europe’s most efficient airlines. There’s a lot
more we can do to meet sustainability challenges,
but receiving these honours is an important
benchmark that shows we’re on the right path.

In 2017 – marks the UN Year of Sustainable
Tourism. It’s an opportunity for the travel
industry to take stock, celebrate its achievements
and continue the push for more transparent and
responsible business. As a company committed
to ‘Lead the Way’, TUI will continue to be at the
forefront of that movement.

Fritz Joussen
TUI Group Chief Executive Officer

This report outlines our progress against our
Better Holidays Better World 2015-2020 strategy;
it also includes our report on progress as
signatories to the 10 principles of the UN Global
Compact and our first statement on Modern
Slavery, an important and challenging issue.

One area where we fell short this year was
our 2020 commitment to improve our carbon
efficiency by 10%. For the first time in eight
years our progress stalled, specifically in regard
to TUI Airlines where efficiency deteriorated
by 1.2% compared to the previous year.
There were a number of reasons, but a key
contributor was unexpected changes in airline
routings and occupancy levels due to shifts in
customer preferences away from East to West
Mediterranean destinations as a result
of geopolitical developments.
2016 has been a year of change around the world
and TUI is no exception. Having launched three
strategic focus areas in 2015 (Step Lightly, Make
a Difference, and Lead the Way), I am delighted
that we are now adding ‘Care More’ to that
strategic set. The focus will be on our employees
and how TUI aspires to be the best place to work
so they can go further in providing our customers
with truly unique and memorable holidays.

With 2016 chalking up 6.3 million ‘greener and
fairer’ holidays (customers selecting hotels that
have achieved sustainability certification) there
can be no doubt that the appeal of sustainable
holidays has gone mainstream. There is
still ground to cover to meet our 2020
commitments and we know the shared
global challenge of meeting the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) is immense, but we
are confident TUI has the right frameworks in
place to lead in making a difference.

ABOUT TUI
GROUP

TUI PROFILE

OUR VISION
Discovering the world’s diversity, exploring new horizons, experiencing
foreign countries and cultures: travel broadens people’s minds. At TUI
we create unforgettable moments for our customers across the world
and make their dreams come true. We are mindful of the importance of
travel and tourism for many countries in the world and the people living
there. We partner with these countries and help shape their future – in
a committed and sustainable manner. We, the 67,000 TUI employees.
Think Travel. Think TUI.
Our Strategy
In 2015 TUI Group launched it’s five year Better Holidays Better World
2015 – 2020 strategy. The strategy was built around the following three
core pillars:
1) Step Lightly, where we committed to operate the most
carbon-efficient airlines in Europe and cut the carbon intensity
of our operations by 10% by 2020.
2)	 Make a Difference, where we committed to deliver 10 million ‘greener
and fairer’ holidays per year by 2020, enabling more local people to
share in the benefits of tourism.
3) 	Lead the Way, where we committed to invest 10€ million per year by
2020, to support good causes and enhance the positive impacts of 		
tourism, using the TUI care Foundation to support this work.
In 2016 we have evolved the strategy to include:
4) 	Care More, where we have committed to achieve a 				
colleague engagement score of over 80 aligning us with
the top 25 global companies by 2020.

SUSTAINABILITY AT TUI
TUI Group has a committed and experienced team of sustainability
professionals, working in close collaboration with senior
management at Group and at divisional level to help ensure that
TUI’s business and sustainability strategies are aligned. Our
sustainability colleagues’ role is to drive uptake of more sustainable
business practices across the TUI Group and along its supply chain,
and to advise the TUI Care Foundation on destination project
proposals and implementation, with the aspiration of raising the
leadership bar across our industry sector.

As the Better Holidays Better World strategy embeds more widely
within the organisation, so the relevance and governance of
sustainability within the business has evolved. In addition to more
regular audiences with the most senior management teams in the
business, we work closely with our Group Risk, Marketing and
External Affairs colleagues - not just to identify and mitigate risk
but also to develop fresh opportunities for sustainability work at
TUI and in destinations. Having worked hard over the years to
develop more sustainable holiday offerings, our aspiration moving
forward is to bring the product advantages of sustainability more
to life for our customers, driving greater awareness and appreciation
of how sustainability enhances the authenticity and enjoyment of
their experience, whilst improving the benefits for host communities.

Director of Sustainable Development,

KEY THEMES FOR TUI AND
THE TOURISM SECTOR

SUSTAINABLE FUELS FOR AVIATION

From our engagement with stakeholders there are some important
recurring themes which we are often asked for a response to.
We have outlined those themes and our response below:

Supply, cost and distribution are among the
existing constraints on more widespread use
of sustainable fuels for aviation. Through
industry organisations, our collaborations with
other stakeholders and our own investment
(for example in algae-based products in Bonaire)
we are committed to development in this area.

ANIMAL WELFARE WITHIN TOURIST
ATTRACTIONS

MODERN SLAVERY AND WIDER
HUMAN RIGHTS REPORTING

EUROPEAN EMISSIONS DIRECTIVE
(EED 2012/27/EU)

Excursions that allow people to see and interact
with animals remain very popular with our
customers. We follow emerging research closely to
inform our understanding of what is acceptable and
considerate for the animals involved. On this basis
we have banned elephant riding and shows and
are working closely with travel trade associations
and industry peers to raise the industry bar. Our
suppliers are audited in line with the ABTA 2013
global animal welfare guidelines https://abta.com/
working-with-the-industry/animal-welfare

TUI welcomes the push for greater transparency in
global supply chains under the UK Modern Slavery
Act and we will publish our first statement in 2017.
As well as reporting on existing good practice, we
will discuss any challenges we face and our plans
moving forwards.

TUI Group is working to meet the EU Energy
Efficiency Directive (EED). Compliance has already
been met in the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Austria,
Spain and Belgium, and audits for other European
countries are taking place in 2017. We hope the
process will help in our drive to achieve further
energy reductions across TUI’s operations.

ECONOMIC BENEFIT FOR TOURIST
DESTINATIONS
Tourism can be a powerful force for good –
boosting economies, creating employment and
enhancing cultural understanding. Through the TUI
Care Foundation we focus on ‘thriving destinations’
to go beyond the impact our tour operations are
already bringing and find new and innovative ways
to help destination communities prosper.

WATER SCARCE DESTINATIONS
Water remains a key priority. Beyond measures to
control usage, hotels are finding innovative ways to
address supply problems. Desalination projects are
a key component of our work and have made a big
impact in destinations where they are in operation.

CO² EMISSIONS FROM AVIATION

EU CSR DIRECTIVE (2014/95/EU)
We welcome the move toward reporting on
a broader set of issues and with increasing
transparency. We are already adjusting our
reporting practices in readiness.

Our airlines rank amongst the most carbon
efficient in Europe and we welcome the
opportunity to work with the industry to create
a cleaner future, including meeting IATA’s goal
for carbon neutral growth from 2020. TUI is
broadly supportive of CORSIA, the ICAO’s
global carbon offsetting scheme, as a way to
create a fair solution, stopping competitive
distortion through EU ETS.

CO² EMISSIONS FROM CRUISE
SHIPS (DIRECTIVE 2015/757)
We support the drive for increased efficiency and
aim to use cutting-edge technology in new ships
and retrofit existing ships where feasible. We
monitor performance data from our ships and will
ensure we are compliant with the submission of a
verified emissions report in April 2019.

GENDER PAY
Reward and remuneration is part of our overall
approach to diversity and developing a more
diverse leadership team. Collecting broader data
sets to ensure we are compliant with the UK
Gender pay regulations coming into force in April
2017 will improve our understanding and inform
our human resources approach.

Involvement by TUI

TUI Group carried out a formal materiality assessment
as part of developing the Better Holidays Better World
2015-2020 strategy. Using qualitative and quantitative
methods, the business invited feedback from a wide
range of stakeholders on the issues shown in the matrix
alongside. In addition to detailed interviews with top-tier
stakeholders, the process included a shorter feedback
mechanism asking participants from five European
markets to prioritise from a list of 26 material issues.
The intention is to repeat this assessment process in
2017, the mid-point in our 2020 strategy.

Relevance for TUI

TUI alignment with UN Sustainable Development Goals:

UNITED NATIONS
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
GOALS AND MATERIALITY
Launched in 2015, the UN Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) are a helpful ‘big picture’ way to view the material
impact of our activities. In 2016, we reviewed our activities
against the goals and intend to use them as a benchmark in
future to assess the relevance of our initiatives. Sustainable
tourism is specifically mentioned in three of the goals—
SDG 8 on decent work and economic growth, SDG 12 on
sustainable consumption and production, and SDG 14 on
life below water. The SDGs were an important factor in the
development of the TUI Care Foundation—our primary
platform for funding detination initiatives—and will inform
our strategy going forwards.

PARTNERSHIPS
DRIVING PROGRESS

TUI collaborates with other organisations through the TUI Care Foundation and other
channels. The following partnerships in particular help shape our strategic thinking.

TUI and the German Agency for International
Development Cooperation (GIZ) are partnering
in destinations. i.e. the TUI Care Foundation and
GIZ provide placements in sustainable tourism
to smooth the transition of women into the job
market in Namibia.

TUI is a founding member of Futouris, the
sustainability initiative of the German tourism
sector. Its members are committed to working
together in order to improve living conditions,
preserve biodiversity, and promote environmental
and climate protection worldwide.

TUI is a key sponsor and Board Member of the
Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC) and
we promote GSTC’s standards to accommodation
suppliers and destinations. Jane Ashton, Director
of Sustainable Development was a keynote
speaker at their AGM in Korea in 2016.

TUI have worked with Plan Nederland over many
years on a range of destination project like the
TUI Academy in the Dominican Republic and
youth training in Brazil.

A TUI colleague represents the German
Industry Association DRV in the destination and
sustainability committee at ECTAA - the Group
of national travel agents’ and tour operators’
associations within the EU.

TUI is a long term member of Sustainable
Aviation in the UK and participates on a number
of the working groups and is the business lead
on the Waste working group.

TUI is part of the UNWTO’s sustainable tourism
task force for the UNEP 10 year framework for
sustainable consumption and production.

TUI were a founding partner when the Travel
Foundation was established in 2003 and since then
we have worked with them on joint initiatives to
build thriving destinations. The Travel Foundation
does invaluable work to ensure tourism benefits
people and the environment in destinations.

12

ADVOCACY
ACTIVITY IN
2016
A key component of TUI’s strategy
to ‘Lead the Way’ is to influence and
engage the wider industry on issues
that we know our stakeholders care
about and where collective progress
is needed. Over the past year, a large
number of senior personnel have
spoken at a range of forums about the
industry’s most material issues and
TUI’s response to them.

Our airlines will source food, beverages
and other supplies responsibly
The airlines are in the process of
completing a responsible sourcing review,
which will be used to set targets in 2017.

We will segregate cabin waste
and work with destination airports
to improve waste management
and recycling
Award-winning activity in Schiphol airport
in Amsterdam has generated
8.5 tonnes of segregated waste in 2016.

Our cruise operations will make
improvements in water consumption,
waste management, and sulphur and
nitrogen emissions
TUI Cruises reduced sulphur by 24.8%,
nitrogen by 20.1% and water by 2.4%
per guest night.

We will reduce carbon emissions
from our offices, retail shops and
brochures by 20%
Carbon emissions from 50 major
offices totalled 20,085 tonnes of CO2;
1,600 retail shops generated 9,676 tonnes
of CO2 and 5,984 tonnes of CO2 resulted
from brochure production. This is a 5.2%

More than 80% of TUI’s carbon footprint
is from our aircraft and so activity among
our airlines is a primary focus for our
‘Step Lightly’ activity. Following several
years of improved CO2 efficiency, 2016
saw the first year-on-year efficiency loss
in TUI airlines since 2008: an average of
66.8g CO2 per passenger kilometre in
2016 versus 66g CO2 per passenger
kilometre in 2015. There were a number of
reasons for this decline, including
significant and unexpected re-planning of
passenger routes away from Turkey and
Egypt to Western Mediterranean routes.
However, against the baseline year for our
Better Holidays, Better World strategy
2015-2020 our carbon efficiency
performance still showed an
improvement. TUI Airlines’ comparative
performance was recognised in November
2016 by the independent climate
protection organisation atmosfair, which
ranked TUI fly Germany and Thomson
Airways as the world’s most carbonefficient charter airlines.

TUI fly Germany and Thomson
Airways ranked #1 and #2 most
efficient charter airline in the
2016 global atmosfair index

STATE-OF-THE-ART AIRCRAFT
We operate a modern fleet with an
average age of less than eight years. In
September 2016, TUI committed to
buying 11 new aircraft to ensure our fleet
remains modern and efficient. This
includes 10 new Boeing 737 MAXs
incorporating the latest technology such
as CFM International LEAP-1B engines,
advanced technology winglets and other
improvements to deliver the highest
efficiency and reliability on the market.

TUI was also the first European airline to take receipt of the Boeing
787 Dreamliner back in 2011; we now have 14 B787s in the fleet and
will have 17 by 2019. The B787s are scheduled to deliver 20% lower
fuel use and emissions than the aircraft they replace.

Reducing waste from flights is currently limited by infrastructure
constraints. While airlines can collect and segregate waste on board
aircraft, without proper recycling facilities at source or destination
airports everything goes back into general waste. To tackle this, TUI
Netherlands has worked with Schiphol airport – one of Europe’s busiest
– and partners Suez and Kluh to build a waste facility. Completed in July
2015, the facility allows recyclable waste from TUI aircraft to be
segregated into four streams (paper, glass, cans and plastics). By July
2016, 8.5 tonnes of waste had been sorted at the facility. The TUI
Netherlands team is now looking to repeat this success at Eindhoven and
Brussels airports. There are even proposals to use products produced
from the ‘waste’ – such as fleece blankets – on board our flights.

Changing how we buy things and working with our suppliers to
improve sustainability practices is a powerful way for TUI to make a
real difference right along the value chain. A survey on responsible
sourcing was conducted in 2016 across all TUI airlines. A number of
locally-sourced products are already available – for example, honey
from a producer in Ostende is offered on TUI Benelux flights.
The aim of the survey was to see what is currently in place, set clear
guidance and targets on responsibly-sourced products, and more
accurately report back on performance. Our Group Environment and
Fuel Manager will be working further on this with a team of
international graduates and supplier management, procurement
and in-flight retail teams in 2017.

Many modern technologies can also be ‘retrofitted’ to existing aircraft
and we continue to make changes to our fleet, such as introducing
winglets where possible. At TUI fly Belgium we operate our own
design team of professionals, who are licensed by the airline
manufacturers to carry out changes to our aircraft. This means we
can make improvements faster: in the past year, for example,
TUI fly Belgium made modifications to the underside of Embraer
aircraft, applying air inlets and new wheel farings to make them
more aerodynamic.

ISO 14001 AND EMAS
In 2009, TUI fly Nordic was the first charter airline to achieve ISO
14001 certification, and now all five of our tour operator airlines have
been certified to the global environmental management standard. TUI
fly Germany has also aligned its 28 aircraft with the European EMAS
standard. EMAS involves rigorous measurement and evaluation of
environmental performance, requiring ongoing data collection
throughout the year as well as external publication of data.

I’m Polish but I have lived in the UK since 2005. Before my current
role, I worked at Thomson Airways for more than two years as the
Airline Environment Manager. I studied environmental protection
and environmental management in Poland and in the UK. Our
business took the decision in 2016 to create the One Aviation
platform with the vision that using a single platform would help our
four airlines achieve greater efficiencies and share best practice.
My role within One Aviation is developing strategic thinking on
fuel and environment across the airlines and keeping in touch with
industry developments and best practice in the field.

What are some of the most interesting things you
work on?
My role includes bringing people together internally to continually
improve our environmental performance. I also get to engage
with some of the key organisations shaping sustainable aviation,
including various airport authorities and aviation service providers.
For example, I lead the Waste & Recycling Working Group for UK
Aviation Industry’s Sustainable Aviation initiative and roles like this
help me continually push myself – and the business – further.

What sustainability initiative are you most proud of?
That’s hard to say! Working with Boeing on our ecoDemonstrator
initiative to test new aircraft technologies was exciting because you
get to look into the future and see the innovations that are coming.
But at the other end of the scale I’ve worked with engineering
colleagues at our Luton hangar on a waste segregation improvement
programme. That initiative has grown to sorting eight waste streams
from papers and plastics down to different metals and even nuts
and bolts. It shows what is possible in every area of our business.

TUI Group operates 14 cruise ships
across three brands – TUI Cruises,
Hapag-Lloyd Cruises and Thomson
Cruises. In the past year we have made
great strides with energy efficiency
across our cruise business, achieving
a 4.1% reduction in CO2 emissions per
passenger night. These savings are
thanks to a continuous programme
of refits to existing ships as well as
our investment in newer vessels with
the best available environmental
technologies.

LAUNCH OF MEIN SCHIFF 5
In July 2016, Mein Schiff 5 went into
service for TUI Cruises as one of the
most energy-efficient, low-emission
ships in the world. Three further vessels
are in the pipeline for launch in 2017,
2018 and 2019.

SCRUBBERS
One of the most significant environmental
technologies on board Mein Schiff 5 is
the exhaust gas treatment system, also
known as ‘scrubber technology’. The
hybrid scrubbers from TUI Cruises make
it possible to operate temporarily in a
completely closed-loop system with all
effluents and residues kept inside the
ship, meaning there is zero discharge.

In most areas, such as ports and coastal
and river zones, we are required to
operate closed loop, but TUI Cruises is
the only cruise company currently using
zero-discharge operating mode in areas
where this is not legally required. For
example, in the summer of 2016 we ran
closed-loop continuously for nearly three
months in the Baltic due to its sensitive
ecosystem, generating zero discharge
from the hybrid scrubber. Since 2014
with its first new build, TUI Cruises has
exceeded 2020 regulatory requirements,
making TUI Cruises among the cleanest
cruise fleet worldwide. By operating our
scrubbers around the clock, TUI Cruises
goes much further than the global sulphur
limit of 3.5% in fuel: emissions from our
new ships are below 0.1% sulphur. In 2020,
the global cap will fall to 0.5% sulphur –
still significantly higher than our newly
built ships are achieving today.

HAPAG-LLOYD CRUISES
ADD TO THEIR FLEET
Hapag-Lloyd Cruises has ordered two new ships
for 2019. These will be built between shipyards
in Norway and Romania and come equipped
with state-of-the-art environmental technology.
With PC6, the highest Polar Class designation
for passenger ships, they will be able to cruise in
polar regions in the Arctic and Antarctica, as well
as warm water destinations such as the Amazon.
Most onboard zodiacs are equipped with Torqeedo
electric motors to reduce air and noise emissions
while allowing landings in otherwise inaccessible
expedition areas.
In addition to benefiting from the new technology
that comes with modern vessels, Hapag-Lloyd
Cruises is upgrading its existing fleet. On MV
Bremen we have made improvements enabling
the bow thrusters and stabilisers to operate with
environmentally friendly bio-oil. A ballast water
treatment plant has been installed to prevent
harmful micro-organisms from being discharged
into the seawater. We have also started maintaining
propeller shafts using seawater as a lubricant rather
than oil, a practice unique in the cruise industry.

remote and dramatic landscapes in the world. Visiting
such locations carries particular responsibilities. In
the Arctic, Antarctic and Kamchatka we are using
diesel oil in place of heavy fuel oil and calculate our
itineraries based on speeds most likely to reduce
fuel consumption and emissions. Our excursions are
designed to respect local flora and fauna and draw
attention to their ongoing conservation. In addition,
our guests have the option of offsetting the CO2
emissions from their sea passage with Hapag-Lloyd
Cruises, in which case we cover 25% of the cost.

All five TUI Cruises vessels (Mein Schiff 1, 2, 3,
4 and 5) have ISO 14001 and 9001 certification.
Hapag-Lloyd Cruises engages Columbia Cruise
Services as its ship management contractor and
its ISO 14001 certification covers the fleet of four
Hapag-Lloyd vessels. All five Thomson cruise

TUI’s ground operations make up 9% of our total carbon
footprint and consist of major office premises, hotels, retail
shops and transport vehicles. We have about 50 major
offices (those containing 100 people or more) located across
Europe and beyond. Our retail portfolio consists of more
than 1,600 shops in 11 source markets. With more than 1,000
shops between them, the UK and Germany are our largest
source markets. Our ground transport operations sit within
the Destination Services division and in 2016 included four
companies – Ultramar (Spain), Tantur (Turkey), Aeolos (Cyprus)
and SMDTT (Morocco). Hotelbeds was sold in 2016 and so will
not be included in reporting going forward. As with aviation, the
knock-on effect of a mid-season shift in customer demand from

East to West Mediterranean destinations meant that emissions
efficiency from transport was adversely effected – 28.3g of CO2
per passenger kilometre, which was a 6.1% increase on 2015.

CARBON FOOTPRINT

SIMPLE STEPS
Sometimes the simplest operational practices can
have the biggest impact. For example, training of
colleagues driving our coaches includes instructions
to park vehicles facing into the sun rather than
side-on. As a result, the heat impact on the vehicle
is reduced by about 15-20%. In destinations where
the heat climbs to over 35°C, the maximum vehicle
standing running time is 30 minutes. These small
differences make our customers more comfortable
as well as reducing environmental impact.

All hotels in our tourism business
portfolio will subscribe to credible
sustainability certifications
We have delivered 6.3 million ‘greener and
fairer’ holidays and have the equivalent of
1,170 hotels certified to a Global Sustainable
Tourism Council standard. TUI has also
included a sustainability component in
contracts with all accommodation suppliers
outlining minimum expectations and the
requirement to work towards credible
sustainable certification.

We will develop and roll out the TUI
EcoResort standard to drive exemplary
sustainability performance
Our EcoResort hotels continue to be
leaders. Going forward will review the
programme and find fresh ways to evolve
the concept.

We will develop a support forum for
hotels to share sustainability learnings
and drive improvements
We continue with our programme of
road shows to help hotels approach the
certification process – in 2016 there were
three road shows. We also provide specific
consultancy support on certification to
hotels where appropriate.
Our online data collection from our owned
and concept hotels provides more detailed
feedback for hotels submitting data.

Our hotels will include innovative
environmental features, invest in
skills training for staff, develop local
skills and favour local sustainable
procurement
In 2016, 54% of employees in owned
and concept hotels were receiving
vocational training and there were 3,600
apprenticeships in place.
Also, in 2016 90% of employees were
nationals of the country and 79% of food
was from within the country.
Average carbon emissions per guest night
at TUI Hotels & Resorts and International
Concepts was 10.1kg of CO2, energy
consumption per guest night was 27.9 kWh
and fresh water use 478 litres per guest night.

We will communicate about
sustainability throughout the
customer journey

• TUI UK in consultation with the wider

TUI Group developed a Customer
Communications Toolkit to be rolled out
in 2017.
• TUI Netherlands launched a fresh and
well-received range of ‘in-room’ customer
communications.
• A customer-facing video on sustainability
at TUI was commissioned in 2016 for
launch in 2017.

• Customer research into sustainability

was carried out in 2016 and will provide
market-leading analysis on this theme.

Our colleagues will be ambassadors
of sustainability
In our TUIgether employee survey across
all TUI employees, a score of 75 against
benchmarks for colleagues view of TUI as an
environmentally responsible company puts
us in the ‘high performer’ category.

Our destination management
companies and excursions will meet
our sustainability standards
Our customers went on 846,000 TUI
Collection excursions in 2016, up 30%
on 2015. There are 170 TUI Collection
excursions in 41 destinations. These
excursions are selected against unique,
local and sustainability criteria.
TUI has also included a sustainability
component to our contract with all
destination management companies
outlining TUI’s minimum standards of
sustainability expected in relation to the
provision and operation of transportation,
excursions and destination handling
services for TUI’s customers and

Better understanding how we can better engage
people in sustainability is a priority for TUI and
will be key in our progress with Better Holidays,
Better World. This is the reason that in late 2016
TUI undertook its largest piece of research to
date on customer attitudes and interest relating
to sustainability.
More than 3,800 people in six countries took
part in a detailed survey of attitudes and
perceptions regarding sustainability, ‘green’
hotels, sustainability labelling and the TUI
Care Foundation. Notable feedback to emerge
included:
• desire for help in making sustainable choices
with better signposting at
point-of-booking
• a pronounced enthusiasm for the work of TUI
Care Foundation and strong confidence that the
funds are invested in worthwhile causes
• high expectations of TUI’sresponsibility to
drive global standards in animal welfare in
excursion venues.

The research will inform how we communicate
and engage with people on sustainability going
forward. We have also developed a ‘toolkit’ for
marketing colleagues with detailed guidance
on using sustainability in communications. To
engage better with people on sustainability we
want to make sure all communications maintain a
credible, relevant and authentic standard. During
2017 that toolkit will be adapted to ensure a local
fit in source markets.

BETTER WORLD DETECTIVES
Better World Detectives goes from strength
to strength, with more than 700 schools
downloading our materials in the past year. The
programme looks to engage 7-11 year olds in how
to live and travel in a sustainable way.
In addition to existing materials, 2017 will see
a new competition for children to produce
advertising materials on how adults should travel
more sustainably. TUI UK has committed to
showcase the winning work to customers and
runners up will have the opportunity to adopt
and follow a GPS-tagged turtle.

ACCESSIBILITY
As a business we want to make sure our
customers are able to make the most of the
facilities, excursions and experiences on offer. In
2016 we looked into how we could co-ordinate
and scale up activities and best practices from
our accessibility working groups across the Group.
To help us we engaged with Whizz Kids in the
UK, one of our 2017 charitable partners, who are
well-positioned to help us develop our practices in
this important area. Also in 2017 the decision was
taken to recruit a specialist to support the business
specifically on accessibility issues.

GREEN FRIDAY
Green Friday took place on 9th December 2016
and was an initiative designed to be transparent,
informative and to raise awareness. The idea is
to have a single day where the priority focus is
on ‘greener and fairer’ holiday options and how
customers can make more sustainable choices
when booking. For 24 hours, the Green Friday
campaign was showcased on the TUI Nordic page
in Denmark, Sweden and Norway with speciallydesigned infographics explaining how customer
choices make a difference and how to take the

more sustainable holiday option. For example,
icons were used to show if a hotel has sustainability
certification and during the campaign a couple
of hotels were profiled for their really innovative
approaches. At TUI Family Life Pascha Bay hotel,
for example, kitchen oil is used to power lawn
mowers to keep the grounds beautiful, while at
our TUI Family Life Aegean Park hotel in Greece
boreholes have been dug to raise cold groundwater
to the surface to keep buildings cool. Hourly
social media updates were also used to share
sustainability facts and highlights.
The Green Friday team was motivated by a desire
to make sustainable choices easier for customers.
Following the campaign’s success, Green Friday
will be repeated in 2017, with TUI inviting all tour
operators to join the initiative and help the industry
go further, faster, in guiding customers towards
sustainable choices.

the UK, has been partnering since 2010
with Disability Snowsport UK, the UK’s
leading charity providing access to adaptive
skiing and snowboarding for people with
disabilities. Since then we have fundraised
on their behalf with our customers and
colleagues, and in 2016 raised €68,500
to add to the £320,000 previously raised.
We have also provided support with TUI
employee volunteers accompanying their
disabled guests on ski trips to the French
Alps. One of these volunteers was Tom
Johnston, Sustainability Manager for
Products & Purchasing and he tells us below
a little more about the trip.

How long have you worked at TUI?
I have been at TUI for six years. I first joined
on the International Management graduate
programme.

What did you know about
Disability Snowsport before
volunteering?
I was aware of the long-standing
relationship between TUI’s Crystal Ski
business and DSUK and that about 30 TUI
employees supported that partnership each
year through volunteering. DSUK started
with activity weeks for individuals with
cerebral palsy and has grown to include
all disabilities and learning difficulties, as
well as feeder programmes for Paralympics
squads and snow sport development
programmes.

As part of the training, I was able to learn
more about the organisation and its
amazing ethos - as long as you can move
your head, you can ski down a mountain!
There are no age limits: anyone from age 5
to 90 is welcome.

What was the volunteering
experience like?
It was very rewarding but also challenging.
The individuals on the trip are from
different backgrounds and there is a wide
range of disabilities among those on the trip.
The day is set up so that helpers provide
support both on and off the mountain;
aiding the skier and the instructor during
tailored ski lessons and ensuring the safety,
welfare and enjoyment of skiers when back
in the hotel and around town. A typical day
would involve me waking up and ensuring
those skiing in the morning were awake,
dressed and prepared for skiing, had eaten
and taken any necessary medication, and
accompanying skiers to start their lessons.
We would all meet for lunch and dinner as
a group, which provided a great sense of
a group holiday and all skiers, instructors
and helpers had a fantastic week in Austria.
Volunteering with DSUK is something I’d do
again without hesitation, as I feel I helped
an amazing group of people make the most
of their week of skiing, while learning a lot
about myself personally and making great
friends in the process!

HOTELS
COMMITMENT BY 2020

We will work with hotel suppliers to increase
their positive impact on the local community
and to protect the environment

TUI Group owns/manages more than 300
hotels and partners closely with about
200 ‘concept’ hotels. Customers would
recognise these hotels as Sensatori,
Sensimar, TUI Blue, Robinson, RIU,
TUI Magic Life, and Family Life. We also
work with thousands of accommodation
suppliers in the 180 destinations to which
our 12 million tour operator customers
travel each year.

Hotels must be
taking action on:
Environmental
issues
Social
issues
to achieve certification

In 2016 the number of certified
establishments grew by 23% and now
stands at 1,170 hotels. The number of
‘greener and fairer’ holidays taken by
customers in 2016 climbed to 6.3 million –
an increase of 12.5% on last year (5.6m).

CERTIFICATION

With support from the Travelife team,
we continue to encourage more hotels
to move towards certification. In 2016,
there were three road shows (Limassol,
Paphos, and Montenegro) to help hotels

Certification is central to our
commitment to offer ‘greener and
fairer’ holidays. It is a credible way of
showing whether our hotels go further
than others when it comes to social and
environmental issues. We encourage
our hotels to aim for certification that
is GSTC (Global Sustainable Tourism
Council)-recognised or approved, and we
are strong supporters of the certification
programme Travelife.

In 2016 the
number of certified
accommodation
grew by 23% and
now stands at 1,170 hotels. The
number of ‘greener and fairer’
holidays taken by customers in
2016 climbed to 6.3 million

understand what certification entails
and how to meet the challenge.
TUI’s Product & Purchasing Team
also worked on a ‘Green Tracker’
programme, which supports hotels with
practical guidance through the Travelife
certification process. This online tool
was piloted at three hotels in 2016: one
achieved Travelife Gold immediately upon
audit completion and the remaining two
required minor improvements to achieve
Gold level. A full review of the pilot is
currently underway, taking in feedback
from hotels involved in the trial as well
as other stakeholders, with a view to
updating and amending the tool for wider
roll-out.
To read about the work of our
International Management graduates
on the commercial benefits of Travelife
certification to our hotels, refer to the

IN-HOUSE HOTEL SCHOOLS
For a number of years our Robinson Clubs have held in-house
apprenticeship programmes in Morocco, Turkey and Greece,
with training delivered by Robinson Managers. This is over and
above the apprentices we take from state-run initiatives in
those countries. In Greece, Robinson Club Daidalos in Kos is a
partner of the Mentoring Dual International (MENDI) project,
which provides high-quality apprenticeships for hotel clerks,
serving staff and chefs. Since 2013, more than 200 training
places have been offered and in 2016 a further 17 apprentices
joined that alumni group. Funding will continue in 2017. In
Robinson Club Agadir, 92 students were trained in 2016,
adding to the 600 who have been through the programme
since 2008. Across the five Robinson Club Hotels in Turkey,
a further 58 were in training in 2016. Since 2003, 363 local
alumni have successfully been employed as reception,
bar and chef staff.

TUI GOLD AWARDS AND UMWELT
CHAMPION PROGRAMME
Across our source markets there are a variety of ways in
which we seek to give profile to the hotels which are making
significant strides in sustainability. In Germany the longestablished Umwelt Champion programme recognised 202
hotels for achieving certification to a recognised sustainability
standard and meeting high customer satisfaction scores. And
each year TUI UK and TUI Nordic celebrate the work of its
hoteliers with its Annual Gold Awards. There are 18 categories
overall, including a category for sustainability. This year the
winning entry was Conca Park Hotel in Sorrento, which has a
range of sustainability initiatives largely focused on reducing
waste. By involving its producers, suppliers, staff and guests,
Conca Park has set an ambitious target to be waste-neutral
by 2020 and leads the way with its commitment to the highest
sustainability standards.

Every year since 1996, TUI Deutschland has been awarding
hotels that work particularly hard to protect the environment
and exercise their social responsibility. To participate, hotels
must hold a valid Sustainability Certificate recognised by the
Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC). The assessment
additionally takes account of what guests say about the hotel’s
environmental performance. 202 hotels were awarded
TUI Umwelt Champion status in 2016.

SUSTAINABILITY IN NEW-BUILD HOTELS
On the previously uninhabited island of Orivaru, 750 workers are
busy building the second Robinson Club in the Maldives. Energy
efficiency is a pivotal element of the design and the innovative
heat-recovery system and new air conditioning technology will
cut consumption as well as costs. Operational sustainability
will be enhanced by high-standard sewage treatment and an
in-house unit to turn seawater into drinking water. It is estimated
that the operational cost of running the hotel will be reduced by
35% thanks to the technologies being implemented.
In Europe a project got underway in 2016 to further
regenerate the historic Tuscan estate of Castelfalfi keeping as
much of the original architecture as possible while introducing
modern systems and technologies. The resort has installed a
biomass plant, which will consume about 3.5 tonnes of biomass
each year from the hotel and its grounds and is expected to
reduce fuel requirements by 95%, making the resort practically
self-sufficient with only a small reserve of fuel kept for
emergencies. The doors to Il Castelfalfi by TUI Blue
open in March 2017.

Biomass plant – Il Castelfalfi

Along with consultants MACE and the Travel Foundation, TUI’s
Product & Purchasing team also carried out a full review of
two reconstructed and refurbished units in Croatia. The aim
was to understand how environmental and social sustainability
considerations can be incorporated during planning, design,
build and launch phases of refurbishment and new-build
projects as well as ongoing operations. The work identified best
practices to share with other accommodation partners and
highlighted areas for improvement in all future new-build or
refurbishment projects. Work is ongoing to create a framework
around these considerations to guide our internal teams and
external partners in future builds.

Top 2 most significant food trends per market

At the heart of the Better Holidays, Better World strategy is
the desire to build thriving destinations. From the food our
customers eat to the excursions they take and the people who
serve them, we endeavour through our Destination Services
team to make the experience a sustainable one that allows
more local people to benefit from tourism. Research conducted
in the last quarter of 2016 showed that across all markets the
two strongest food trends among our guests were the desire
for authentic local food and food made with seasonal and
sustainable ingredients.

TUI COLLECTION EXCURSIONS
We know from our work with The Travel Foundation and PwC
in 2015 (http://www.thetravelfoundation.org.uk/casestudy/

really do help generate thriving destinations. In the
last year 846,000 customers chose TUI Collection
excursions.
This represents 20% of all excursions sold by
TUI Destination Services and a huge 30%
year-on-year growth in customers choosing
excursions with a sustainability component,
demonstrating a clear customer interest in
sustainability within destination communities.
TUI Collection excursions showcase the value of
activities that are local, responsible and unique.
A new addition to the programme in 2017 will
be the ‘Pirates of…’ programme, where children
have the opportunity to become a pirate at the
destination they are visiting and participate in
swashbuckling adventures and treasure hunting
activities which introduce themes of recycling,
clean oceans and biodiversity.

ANIMAL WELFARE
Excursions that allow people to see and experience
animals remain very popular with our customers.
Recent customer research we commissioned
showed that about 70% of customers wanted the
option of excursions to animal attractions. A further
60% said they would only feel that way if those
attractions met global animal welfare standards.
We follow closely the latest research and findings
on what is acceptable and comfortable for the
animals involved. As a result we have now stopped
all attractions involving elephant rides or shows.
We also work closely with our industry peers to
continually improve our insights and audit suppliers
against established sector guidelines agreed in 2013.
All suppliers of listed TUI excursions featuring
animals must comply with the ABTA guidelines
(Global Animal Welfare Guidance for Animals in
Tourism) and are audited against these. In 2016,
third party audits of 37 of animal attractions
featured by TUI were conducted by independent
auditors and we plan to review another 100 in 2017.

INSPIRING CHILDREN IN
DESTINATIONS
TUI Netherlands has traditionally engaged with
children in destination communities who have a
vested interest in the sustainable development of
those locales. With the support of partner Missing
Chapter Foundation, TUI NL established children’s

councils in Curaçao, engaging them and other local
stakeholders in making the destination a better
place to live. Based on that experience, TUI NL is
seeking to go further by introducing local children
to the children of our guests. We believe local
children are well placed to share the story of their
home region and advise other visiting children on
how best to spend their time there. This electronic
link between host and visiting children is under
development and, when established, will play a part
in growing knowledge and understanding across
cultural boundaries.
TUI has worked in close partnership with
the Travel Foundation since 2003 and values
the organisation’s unique ability to support
us on the ground and around the world as
we implement projects that drive thriving
destinations. Some of the initiatives we have
continued to work on together in 2016 are
outlined below.

Croatia
Mainstream tourism is growing rapidly in
Croatia, accounting for more than one-fifth
of annual GDP. To support the sustainable
growth of tourism in Croatia, TUI became
part of a local stakeholder project that
brings together the Travel Foundation,
local residents and industry partners
in Split-Dalmatia county, where two
refurbished four-star hotels have opened
for mainstream Western European tourists.
To address local stakeholder concerns about
the impact of redevelopment, a training
programme was run in 2016 to help 20 local
businesses benefit from the opportunity.
A Project Discovery volunteer participated
in this project and further opportunities
to align the hotels with local community
needs are being explored. We know that our
customers expect an authentic experience
in the place they are visiting and by
collaborating with people in destinations, we
work hard to ensure that expectation is met.

Jamaica
For destinations to thrive as a result of
tourism, it is important that visiting guests
venture beyond the hotel gate. Since
2012 we have partnered with the Travel
Foundation in Jamaica to better understand
why some guests resist going out. As well
as identifying tourist fear of ‘hassle and
hustle’ in Jamaica, we also found a lack
of information in hotels on what to see
and do and few quality local products and
crafts on offer. Building on a steady stream
of successful initiatives, a project outline
for future activities including training
programmes, development of marketing
materials and improved governance of local
tourism has been established – and funding
secured – for 2017.

Cape Verde
Employing 38% of the working population
and accounting for 40% of GDP, tourism
is extremely important to the emerging
economy of Cape Verde. With rapid growth,
however, comes a challenge to protect the
environment, ensure that local businesses
and communities can benefit from
tourism and help local entrepreneurs and
craftspeople to offer authentic excursions
and handicrafts to the influx of new guests.
As part of a Destination Council, TUI is
supporting specific projects relating to
water, waste, clean beaches and local crafts.

KPIs AND PROGRESS IN 2016
We will improve our understanding
of the impacts of holidays
In the year since the TIMM research
– to establish the commercial value of
sustainable certification – was published,
a group of TUI International Management
Graduates has taken the research
forward. In 2016 we have also undertaken
a risk profiling initiative to help forecast
sustainability risks and their impacts
as well as potential mitigation in
emerging destinations.

Our airlines, cruise operations and
hotels will pilot new technologies
and practices
A range of new technology initiatives is in
place across our business:

• a pilot for single-engine taxiing is
underway.

• closed-loop testing in our Mein Schiff
vessels is increasingly facilitating
operations with no disposal of waste
wash water except onshore.

• desalination projects in the Maldives

and Majorca are enabling both
locations to use desalinated purified
water in place of plastic water bottles,
eliminating on average 400,000 plastic
bottles per hotel.

Sign-off has been given to a research
centre costing €30,000 and providing 20
local jobs and will be built as part of our
AlgaePARC sustainable fuels initiative in
Bonaire.

We will invest in empowering

Based on analysis of TUI’s owned and controlled hotels in 2014/15,
Travelife certified hotels achieved substantial operational cost
savings compared to non-certified units

In 2015, TUI undertook a major project
in collaboration with PwC and
The Travel Foundation. The aim was to
determine the measurable impacts –
both positive and negative – of tourism
on a destination. The result was the
TIMM (total impact measurement and
management) project, a ground-breaking
step forward for the tourism sector.
In 2016 our work to assess the

commercial benefits of sustainability was
expanded with an investigation into the
commercial benefits of certifying hotels
to the Travelife sustainability standard.
Seven members of the TUI International
Management graduate cohort of 2016
set up a project to calculate the bottom
line benefits of Travelife certification to
TUI hotels which had volunteered for
audit and already submitted energy and
water data.
Through a detailed analysis of over
250 accommodations in more than
32

20 destinations, analysis suggests that a hotel with a Travelife
certification is more likely to achieve more efficient energy
consumption management than a non-certified hotel. Research
also showed that customer satisfaction scores for ‘Accommodation
Overall’ were higher for Travelife certified hotels than non-certified
hotels. As well as improvements in energy and water management
processes, the potential return is determined by seasonality,
occupancy management and general business improvement policies.
The process of certification is widely believed to tighten up
practices and this research confirms there are commercial benefits
and business efficiencies to be gained. The analysis will be rerun
this year on a wider set of hotels to grow the data set and include a
broader, more robust set of indicators such as repeat-booking data,
customer satisfaction scores and customer perception of Travelifecertified versus non-certified hotels.

ROBINSON HOTELS DESALINATION WORK
IN MALDIVES AND MAJORCA
Robinson Club Maldives is committed to sustainable water processing
and waste reduction. In 2013 it began producing its own sparkling
water. This has eliminated the need to manufacture, transport and
dispose of 400,000 plastic bottles a year. The process involves osmosis
to desalinate and purify seawater to make drinking water, which is
turned into sparkling water by adding minerals and carbonic acid. The
sparkling water is then decanted into 7,500 re-usable glass bottles that
can be cleaned and refilled onsite.

TUI is working with the specialist waste NGO, WRAP, to reduce the
environmental impact of solid waste generated through tourism
in Cape Verde, while maximising benefits to the local economy.
Tourism to Cape Verde is increasing by about 6% annually,
particularly to the islands of Sal and Boa Vista for which tourism
is the primary economic activity. According to research, hotels in
Sal contribute 60% of the total waste volume, which equals about
30 tonnes per day. Our collaboration with WRAP aims to decrease
the volume of solid waste going to landfill from the accommodation
sector, improve waste management practices and encourage the
public sector to adopt similar practices. We also aim to support
new and diversified local livelihood opportunities through waste
management and disposal initiatives.

SUSTAINABLE FUELS

BESTENZIRKEL DRIVING INNOVATION IN GERMANY

INNOVATING TO REDUCE FUEL USAGE

In 2016 TUI began developing a sustainable fuels strategy to identify
which options we should pursue to ensure high-option value at a
sensible cost. The opportunities from sustainable fuels will only be
realised if the airline industry joins governments, airport authorities
and fuel producers to address the key issue of commercial availability.
TUI wants to be part of that dialogue.

Since 2011, TUI Deutschland has hosted an annual TUI Best
Practice Sustainability Circle (called TUI Bestenzirkel) for TUI
hoteliers to extend their sustainability knowledge and expertise.
In the six years since launch we have had 87 participants
(57 hoteliers and 30 TUI reps) and 36 speakers. The network
brings together key TUI personnel with sustainability experts
from within the travel and tourism world. In 2016 year the focus
was ‘innovative water systems’, with companies presenting a
range of technologies, including water management systems to
allow waste water from bathrooms and kitchens to be diverted
to garden irrigation. While primarily a knowledge exchange,
Bestenzirkel leads to innovations finding their way into our hotels:
this year, for example, the Galo Resorts Hotel in Madeira adopted
a new water technology to protect against new deposits and
corrosion called Aqua 4D-system.

During 2016, Thomson Airways supported a project aimed at
reducing fuel costs as well as the airline’s carbon footprint.
Undertaken by Intercede Ventures Limited in collaboration
with the University of the West of England, the project used a
specially designed and patented prototype instrument called
IASA to collect thousands of surface condition measurements
from Thomson Airways aircraft to determine which areas, or
‘zones’, on the surface of an airplane are contributing to ‘drag’
and require cleaning.

• ENGAGEMENT
We participate in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group. As an
influential convenor within the sustainable fuels community, SAFUG
is an important information exchange and decision-making forum for
TUI.

• RESEARCH
Extension of the AlgaePARC project in Bonaire. Our aim is to develop
an environmentally-friendly technology for microalgae products that
also creates diversified economic activities for the island including
production of sustainable jet fuel. A research facility, located in
unused salt pans, will be built at a cost of €30,000, and employ up
to 20 local residents in the research and development sector. With
algae growing already underway, the facility will focus on finding
the optimum algae-growing environment. As algae can be grown in
ponds and tubes in the sea, it does not divert valuable arable land to
feedstock production for fuel.

SINGLE-ENGINE TAXIING SAVES FUELS

The trial demonstrated that IASA and zone cleaning can
significantly reduce annual fuel consumption and carbon
footprint. The next phase of development involves trials with a
new, easy-to-use version of the IASA instrument with stand-off/
laser technology. When the system is commercialised, airlines
can contract to have aircraft surface conditions monitored. The
system is paperless and data is automatically transmitted to
create monthly reports for the airline so it can plan zone cleaning
for cost savings and carbon footprint reductions.

NORDIC INITIATIVE (NISA)
In parallel with our internal work on sustainable fuels, TUI Nordic
has been involved in co-sponsoring a report on the development
process for sustainable jet fuel in the Nordic countries. The report
explored the potential of advanced sustainable jet fuel for GHG
reduction and mitigation and included recommendations on how
to make best use of available Nordic know-how, feedstocks and
production facilities.

SINGLE-ENGINE TAXIING TRIAL
On behalf of TUI Airlines, Thomson Airways trialled an
innovation in which planes only use a single engine to taxi to the
runway. TUI aircraft have for some time used only one engine
to taxi from the runway to the gate, but traditionally used two
engines from gate to runway. Though a simple concept, the singleengine taxiing practice completely alters the technical set up for
take-off, so a test programme was needed before roll-out. On a
Boeing 737 aircraft, the trial showed that adopting single-engine
taxiing saves about 40kg of fuel per take-off. Each airline is in the
process of reviewing the outputs from the trial and adapting to
their own practices.

Among its conclusions were that developing sustainable bio jet
fuels could yield multiple potential benefits including reduction of
GHG emissions and negative environmental impacts, development
of new technology, as well as economic growth and job creation.
Significant barriers to overcome include a high price gap between
fossil and sustainable jet fuels, lack of a shared definition of
what ‘sustainable’ actually means, absence of coherent crossgovernment policies and access to risk capital, as well as
competing uses for livestock feed.
The report recommendations will now be considered at national
policy-making level by Nordic nations and within businesses like ours.

TUI Better Holidays, Better World 2020
strategy. It benefits from the collective
expertise and resources of the entire TUI

Group while operating independently.
Within the past year TUI Care Foundation
has evolved its broader commitments and
collaborated with destinations in three
specific areas: education and training
initiatives for young people; protection of
the natural environment; and sustainable
livelihoods in thriving destinations where

local communities can benefit from
tourism.
In addition to these three focus areas,
TUI Care Foundation will allocate specific
funding for emergency relief as and when
required. In 2017 TUI Care Foundation
will evolve these focus areas further and
develop clear targets.

NEW HORIZONS

“

We are all well aware of the
travel industry’s power to create
change. Tourism is much more than simply
sun, sea and sand. For many people in
the world it is the key to a more secure
and prosperous life. We are also aware,
however, that tourism can bring challenges
for both man and nature. At TUI Care
Foundation we want to strengthen the
positives that tourism brings and find
solutions to the challenges.”
Thomas Ellerbeck, Chairman, TUI Care Foundation

“

From small beginnings back in
2011 the Foundation is evolving
into something with proven capacity to
change lives and livelihoods for the better.
The Advisory Committee is extremely
excited at the direction TUI Care
Foundation is taking and I am proud to be
leading it forward.”
Jane Ashton, Chairperson, TUI Care Foundation
Advisory Committee

EDUCATION AND SKILLS FOR THE NEXT
GENERATION
In the past year TUI Care Foundation has agreed funding for
education and skills for the next generation. Below is a sample of
the projects that will be funded.

Girl Centre in Windhoek
The TUI Care Foundation granted scholarships
for a hospitality education so that twenty
young women from the Girls Centre on the
grounds of the Namibia Football Association
(NFA) in Windhoek could train in tourism.
As a destination Namibia welcomes more
holidaymakers each year, which increases the
number of jobs available in the tourism sector. And with the
help of a hospitality education these young women have the
opportunity of developing a successful career. In 2016 a successful
introductory course in hospitality training for 20 which ran at the
NFA Girls Centre. As a result of this course, 12 of the participants
in 2016 are going forward to complete a full-year restaurant
management course in 2017.

Dominican Republic
The child protection organisation Plan has been active worldwide
for decades with a focus on the advancement of children –
especially girls. Opening up future opportunities for those not
able to benefit from a growing economy and improving living
conditions in the holiday region is what unites Plan and the TUI
Care Foundation.
Through the TUI Academy, 150 young women and men are
trained for roles in the tourism sector in the Dominican Republic.
As well as learning professional skills sought by the local
hospitality industry, participants learn to protect their interests,
look after their health and manage time and money so that they
can go on to become strong, independent career men and women.

Zanzibar
Founded in Zanzibar in 2010, the non-governmental Kawa Training
Centre has been certifying young people as tour guides since 2011. Young
Zanzibarians are trained as tour guides, which increases their chances
of gaining qualified jobs and helps the country to build a competitive
local tourism sector. With the help of the TUI Care Foundation, about 30
students have completed courses; 80% have gone on to find permanent
positions and the permanent employment rate among women students
is 100%. Students and teachers develop guided tours that are operated
by graduates and tour operators for a fee. In addition, Kawa earns
income from English and computer courses, giving it a valuable revenue
stream over and above charitable donations.

PROTECTING THE NATURAL WORLD
In the past year TUI Care Foundation has agreed funding
for protecting the natural world in Curaçao for example.

Curaçao
GreenKidz Curaçao teaches children about environmental
conservation and waste recycling. The team includes
environmental experts, multimedia specialists
and financial professionals. The charity’s aims
overlap with three key values of TUI Care
Foundation: education, environmental protection
and the long-term strengthening of the island as
a green and healthy destination.
GreenKidz Curaçao inspires primary school
children to conserve nature and helps them
identify small everyday steps that can make a
difference. Five schools participated in the 2015 pilot year, rising
to 15 schools in 2016 and 30 schools are anticipated for 2017. It
is anticipated that over the course of three years the initiative
will reach 8000 children. More and more volunteers are offering
to work as guest GreenKidz teachers. The children transfer their
knowledge and motivation to their families and are helping to
positively change attitudes towards environmental protection on
the island.

THRIVING DESTINATIONS
In the past year TUI Care Foundation has agreed funding for
thriving destinations. Below is an example of the
projects covered by that funding.

Lanzarote

Founded on Lanzarote in 2003, Grevislan is a
company that employs people with learning
disabilities who would otherwise have few
opportunities in the regular labour market.
As well as inclusive and diverse employment
benefits, Grevislan projects tend to promote
and enhance traditional agriculture in an
environmentally friendly way – such as drying local organic fruit
for commercial sale.
TUI Care Foundation has been funding the Grevislan initiative
for two years, during which time plant craters across some
122,000 square metres of land have been converted to organic
farming for the cultivation of grapes to then be produced into
local organic wine.

GOVERNANCE
The last year has been an exciting one for TUI Care
Foundation. From establishing itself as the independent
corporate foundation for TUI Group in 2015, it has gone
on to launch a website with an interactive portal through
which potential partners can approach the foundation,
welcomed Thomas Ellerbeck, Member of the TUI Group
Executive Committee as Chairman of the Board of
Trustees and set up an Advisory Committee.
The Board of Trustees is chaired by Thomas Ellerbeck
and includes among its membership:
Nicolaas Willem Visser – Counsellor for Agriculture
and Nature in North Africa
Frank Oostdam – Director and President of the
ANVR, the Dutch association for travel companies
Dagmar Wöhrl – Head of Economic Co-operation
in the Bundestag
Jeremy Ellis – TUI UK Director, Marketing & Customer
Experience
The Advisory Committee draws on personnel from
across the TUI Group from Sustainability,
Communications, Hotels & Resorts, Destination
Services and Product and Purchasing.

year. 80 or more is the ‘high-performing
company’ score that we are targeting.

The proportion of women in leadership
positions decreased slightly from 31.3%
to 29.4%. However, the percentage of
women on the Supervisory Board at
TUI AG stands at 35%. While the largest
group of employees is between the ages
of 21 and 30, more than 13.6% are over
50 years of age.

2,000 new apprentice positions by 2020
were announced at TUI UK & Ireland in
2016, in addition to the 569 positions
that exists in Germany. Also in 2016,
TUI launched the Global60 programme to
foster international career development
and fast-track culture spreading across
our business.

Following the 2015 TUIgether survey,
the Group Executive Committee (GEC)
is increasingly available to employees
through monthly video chats, ‘lunch

travel workshop work experience for
GEC members.

CARE MORE: THE MISSING PIECE OF THE JIGSAW

THE NEW TUI GROUP HR STRATEGY

The Better Holidays, Better World strategy, which was launched
in 2015, did not include an employee pillar. In the past year
that HR strategy has evolved and we are delighted to be
incorporating a fourth pillar, ‘Care More’, to our Better Holidays,
Better World strategy, which reflects the fundamental role of
TUI employees in living and breathing the strategy within our
business. We want to build the best place to work where people
are passionate about what they do. Therefore, our target is to
reach an engagement score of more than 80 by 2020.
To mark this important milestone for sustainable development
at TUI, we sat down with Dr. Elke Eller, TUI Group’s HR and
Labour Director who joined the TUI Group Executive Board in
2015 to lead Human Resources.

In 2016, the new Group HR Strategy was developed in order to ensure
lasting achievement of our goal to “create the best company to work
for”. Apart from further underlining our joint corporate values, the
focus is on five strategic areas including: Engagement, Leadership,
People Development, Organisational Effectiveness and HR Function
Development. The strategic areas outlined in the TUI Group HR
Strategy form the basis of our approach to ‘Care More’ in the context
of the Better Holidays, Better World sustainability strategy. For each
area, specific projects have been defined to support the cultural
transformation and the sustainable progression of the business.

WHAT ROLE DOES
SUSTAINABILITY HAVE IN
HOW YOU ENGAGE WITH AND
MANAGE TUI EMPLOYEES?
Our organisation is only sustainable if
we nurture the talent within the ranks
of our 67,000 employees. We want
employees at TUI to feel content in their
role and proud of the organisation they
work for. And our HR strategy is based
on this vision. So it was a logical step to
incorporate HR into TUI’s sustainability
strategy. The manifold sustainability
activities have a direct impact on how
TUI is perceived within the company.
We know from our annual TUIgether
employees survey that our environmental
performance interests and motivates our
employees. Our engagement score of 75
in this area exceeds the high-performing
company benchmark of 74. This is
something of which we are very proud.

WHAT ARE THE KEY
STRATEGIC THEMES FOR
HR AT TUI IN 2017?
Within our HR strategy we have defined
initiatives at TUI covering areas from how
we reward employees through to flexible
working, training and development
and beyond. These work streams
cluster into some key focus areas,
notably engagement, leadership, people
development, organisational effectiveness
and HR function development.

Think travel. Think TUI.

AREAS

PROJECTS

HOW DO YOU BRING “CARE
MORE” TO LIFE?
People engagement is the key. One of the
most inclusive ways in which we engage
with employees is through our TUIgether
employee survey. What is important to
me about the TUIgether process is that it
facilitates continuous dialogue between
employees and management. And we
know that it is working: from a score in
2014/15 of 73 we achieved a score of
77 in 2015/16, which is fantastic. We are
targeting a score of over 80 by 2020 to
ensure we are aligned with the best of the
high-performing companies but progress
to date has been really satisfying to see.
But beyond the survey I engage with
employees through a number of
channels, as do other members of the
Group Executive Committee. There are
video chats, lunch sessions at a range
of locations open to anyone who puts
themselves forward, employee days where
our CEO Fritz Joussen answers questions
in town hall style meetings and days spent
‘in-store’ with our store-based colleagues.
But this kind of engagement can not
only be found at the Group Executive
Committee. By making engagement an
integral element of our leadership model
for all managers throughout TUI, we bring
‘Care More’ to life.

WHY ARE GOOD PEOPLE
MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEE
SATISFACTION SO CRUCIAL TO
TUI?
It is our employees who create the
product. They are the ones in direct
contact with customers. Customers are
happy with their holiday if the people
who guide and accompany them are
fantastic. So TUI has a vested interest
in employees who feel good about the
company, engage and are prepared to
‘Care More’. But people will only engage
if they know why. They need to be aware
of the big picture and feel part of it.
Therefore, a common ground is crucial.

WITH OPERATIONS IN 180
DESTINATIONS IS IT POSSIBLE
TO UNITE ALL THE MANY
CULTURES WITHIN TUI GROUP?
You can’t measure everything by the
same yardstick. It makes more sense to
ask about our common DNA: What is
it and what would we like it to be? Our
corporate values, Trusted, Unique and
Inspiring, reflect the common ground
very nicely. They are so global that they
can be understood anywhere, regardless
of cultural or regional differences. TUI
Group is undergoing a wider ranging
process of transformation. That makes it
all the more important to define cultural
foundations for our partnerships and
convey them to our employees.

A cornerstone of ‘Care More’ is our employee survey TUIgether.
The annual survey is rolled out worldwide and findings from the
first survey (2014/15) provided input for the group-wide HR
strategy developed during 2016. TUIgether includes a range of
measures designed to strengthen the open feedback culture at
TUI and enhance employee engagement. The engagement index
climbed by four points from 73 to 77. This represents strong
progress towards the target of over 80. The response rate also
rose by 11 percentage points from 66% to 77%.
The wide-ranging set of questions included one asking if
employees believed TUI to be an environmentally responsible
organisation. The score was 75 on this question and rose by five
percentage points compared with last year. This exceeds the “high
performance” benchmark of 74.
As a result of our annual employee survey the Group Executive
Committee (GEC) has established ‘TUIgether Lunch, Chat, Talk
and Experience’. As part of this process the CEO and members of

the Group Executive Committee are open to employee questions
on a range of issues, making themselves available online via
monthly video chats, through lunch opportunities and employee
days, when they visit stores, or during twice yearly country visits.

INFORMATION AND CONSULTATION
A range of committees represent employees in the TUI Group, at
national and international level, both works-based and sectorbased. They range from local works councils at specific sites to
central company works councils and ultimately the corporate
works council for all employees of the Group in Germany. Based
on their statutory rights to participate in decision-making and
to propose measures, they ensure that employees’ interests are
taken into account in all matters.
At European level, the TUI Europa Forum promotes integration
across Europe for our international workforce by organising proper
information and consultation procedures in cross-border issues
affecting the interests of employees in two or more countries
within the European Economic Area.

LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT
Management responsibilities at
TUI call for continuing professional
development. Identifying and fostering
our leadership talent plays a key role in
securing the long-term success of our
company.
TUI runs three group-wide talent
programmes; Global High Performance
Leadership, Horizons and Perspectives.
‘Global High Performance Leadership’
is a format that builds key skills for the

top level of management, equipping
participants to lead successful and
profitable business areas. ‘Horizons’
is a development programme for
leaders identified as potential
successors for senior leadership
roles and ‘Perspectives’ is aimed at
young management talent. Almost 70
employees participated in one of
these programmes during 2016. In
addition to these programmes group
companies have established local
development programmes targeting
high-potential employees.

Our internal mentoring programme also
supports our managers and employees
through the creation of a platform for
knowledge transfer and exchange across
countries and functions. This initiative
was launched by TUI Nordic and
successfully rolled out to TUI Belgium
and TUI Netherlands under the theme
‘Leadership of multicultural teams in
times of change’.

SECURITY, HEALTH AND SAFETY

HUMAN RIGHTS

TUI faces a range of different threats with regard to security,
health and safety, including medical incidents and natural
disasters as well as crime and terrorist threats. As we become
more closely integrated, co-ordination of a Group-wide security,
health and safety network is therefore a priority for TUI.
Well-managed event and crisis management ensures the right
support is provided to our customers and employees when
needed, drawing on the full range of resources and experience
available across a global group. TUI has structures in place,
including crisis centres that can co-ordinate in the event of an
incident, care teams to support guests locally in emergencies or
crisis situations, as well as close contact with foreign offices in
source-markets and foreign ministries worldwide. We draw on
the experience of our employees in tourism crisis management to
ensure TUI Group’s integrated Group-wide safety management
concept is state-of-the-art.

TUI is committed to protect, respect and remedy human
rights throughout our worldwide operations, in line with
applicable laws, conventions and regulations.

The approach at TUI is preventative and so in existing
destinations and potential destinations we undertake longterm monitoring of social, natural and environmental indicators.
This helps us better forecast longer term requirements and
potential impacts from infrastructure to employee training.
TUI’s preventative approach also applies to employees to whom
we offer extensive occupational health opportunities through
our corporate sports programme, nutrition and psychological
counselling and flexible working models to help employees
balance work and family life. As signatories to the ‘Luxembourg
Declaration for Workplace Health Promotion in the European
Union’, we work collaboratively with organisations such as
European Network for Workplace Health Promotion (ENWHP) in
implementing these measures.

Human rights are a component of our Code of Conduct,
Supplier Code of Conduct, employee training programmes
and Travelife certification activity. We are also signatories to
the UN Global Compact and UN World Tourism Organisations
Global Code of Ethics and work continuously with stakeholders
to improve our responsiveness to human rights issues. To
support us with this work we recruited additional resource to
work with Sustainability and HR teams on human rights, and in
particular modern slavery. We have also established a working
group on human rights, drawing on senior management from
major departments across our business to help with the
continuous process of analysing potential human rights risks.
A key driver has been the requirement under UK law to publish
a modern slavery statement by April 2017. Our statement is
included on p. 51 of this report.
TUI signed up to Europe’s Diversity Charter in 2008 and made
a pledge to promote a versatile mix within the workforce.
67,000 TUI colleagues operate in about 180 destinations
worldwide. While the majority are based in Europe, nearly
11,000 are based beyond and with new destinations in Asia
driving growth, the diverse profile of the workforce is set to
evolve further still.
Women make up 56% of all employees at TUI and hold 29.4%
of all managerial positions. The proportion of women on our
German supervisory bodies continued to rise last year. On
30th September 2016, women accounted for around 38% of
members, up 8 percentage points year-on-year. In financial
year 2014/15 targets for women in managerial positions were
implemented in three major companies in Germany. Additional
measures were initiated to promote female executives and
we aspire to grow this number throughout the Group at
management level and are monitoring levels and setting
targets to drive improvement.

PEOPLE
DEVELOPMENT

TRAINING

To help employees embed sustainability
values, our Destination Services Team
has developed a digital game, featuring
chapters on Better Holidays, Better World
strategy, child protection, animal welfare
and sustainable excursion criteria

Training and development opportunities
are central to providing customers
with a unique holiday experience as
well as ensuring that we create skilled
and diverse leadership. In 2016, for
the second year running, the TUI
Hospitality Academy was named as ‘Best
intermediate vocational education of
the Netherlands in the category tourism
& recreation’ and trained a total of 171
students. Also in the Netherlands in 2016
TUI fly ran an internship programme for
110 Cabin Attendants in partnership with
11 regional training institutes.

In the last year, TUI UK announced a
target to introduce 2,000 new apprentice
opportunities before 2020. These

opportunities across engineering, IT and
retail build on the 5,500 apprenticeships
offered since 2000 in the UK alone. We
are also working with the UK Industry
Skills Board to recruit apprentice pilots
from a more diverse group of candidates.
In Germany, we currently employ 569
apprentices in 12 different occupations
and offer places as part of three
university ‘sandwich courses’. The
training rate in Germany is 5.7%. Of the
183 trainees in Germany who completed
their apprenticeships during 2016, more
than 70% were offered permanent
employment.
44

A FRESH LOOK AT SUSTAINABILITY TRAINING
We are always keen to find new ways to integrate sustainability
into employee training. For some years it has been part of our
induction training and a key component of our International
Management graduate programme. Last year, our Destination
Services Team also developed a digital game to help employees
embed sustainability values, featuring chapters on Better
Holidays, Better World, child protection, animal welfare and
sustainable excursion criteria. The game will be launched to
employees in Destination Services in early 2017 before rolling
out to other business areas.

More than 22,000 employees already use the system and our goal
is to provide access in a range of languages around the globe to
every company employee. The system consists of more than 300
e-learning modules with more than 160,000 courses in the fields
of Retail, Airline Academy, Finance Academy, Administration and
Destination Services.

We also have specific training for people in key roles and on core
issues, for example compliance, child protection, people trafficking
(airline employees) and modern slavery.

GLOBAL60
As the world’s leading tourism company, TUI Group needs its
leaders to reflect the global nature of the organization, across
cultures, businesses and borders. The Global 60 initiative
strives to further encourage our employees to think about an
international career that provides a unique experience. The goal is
to move 60 people who are at junior or middle management level
into an international role by the end of this financial year – and
for this initiative to become business as usual once this goal has
been reached.

BUILDING EXPERTISE IN OUR DESTINATIONS
GRADUATE TRAINEES AT TUI

TUI LEARNING SYSTEM

Through TUI Care Foundation we have also established the TUI
Academy, which has a focus on developing skills and education
in destinations that benefit from additional investment and
support. For example, working with Futouris on the ‘Sport for
Development’ programme of the German Federal Ministry for
Economic Cooperation and Development, the TUI Academy
supported an ‘introduction to hospitality’ initiative for 20 young
women at the National Football Association Girls Centre in
Windhoek, Namibia. Alongside football, these young women
were given an introduction to hospitality skills in the hope that
this provides them with employment in the growing tourism
sector in Namibia.

For all employees at TUI language training schemes, seminars
on intercultural understanding and specific technical training
programmes are offered. Our Learning Management System,
‘TUI Learning’, is designed to strengthen specialist and
management skills.

The first course was so successful that the TUI Care Foundation
has gone on to fund a year-long certificate in restaurant
management as a follow up. That course will commence in
February 2017.

TUI offers an international graduate leadership programme in
which 25 trainees from 15 different countries participate. They
take an 18-month journey through different departments of
the Group. Beyond commercial and operational placements,
trainees are set a specific sustainability project. They also work
as a holiday representative at a minimum of one destination and
are supported and mentored throughout the programme by an
experienced TUI leader.

Is it usual to train to be a pilot while working in another role?
Absolutely not, no! I am one of three trainees that TUI Belgium take onto this
scheme every year following an assessment centre recruitment process. They
have had this programme in place in Belgium for six years; I know that the UK
Thomson business is also considering it but it is really quite unique. I will be in
this role for four years, simultaneously working and training.

How do you think this professional opportunity
has benefited you?
In the same way that any person benefits from working in different parts of
a business. You learn to understand things from different perspectives and
appreciate the work that other people do within the organisation to make the
whole business work. It has also given me the opportunity to do two things that
I really enjoy: sustainability and flying planes!

Do you think this experience will influence the pilot that
you will become?
I hope so. The appreciation I have for sustainability and its importance
in business today – whatever business you are in – is something that has
influenced me a lot and I will take with me in my role as a pilot and outside of
work as well. But as a pilot the experience I have had will make me quick to
embrace new initiatives that have a sustainability benefit.

EMPLOYEE
VOLUNTEERING

Each of our 67,000 employees is part of a community and
employees find a range of ways to get involved locally. Here are
a few examples:

BEACH CLEAN UP
Our resorts offer guests pristine shorelines and glittering blue
seas, but public beaches in some destinations in which we
operate do not get the same care and attention. As participants
for the past three years in the ABTA-led ‘Make Holidays Greener’
campaign, we have deployed 1,300 TUI workers to clean up 56
beaches in 14 countries, successfully collecting 9,843kg of waste.

SUPPORTING REFUGEES IN GERMANY
Thirty colleagues from our HQ and TUI Deutschland offices in
Hannover volunteered time in 2016 to deliver language training
to refugees. In total, more than 1,000 lessons were taught to
more than 300 refugees. The TUI Group supports its employees’
engagement in this project with a flexitime working policy.

TUI FLY NETHERLANDS HELP ‘ON STOPOVER’
In November 2015, TUI fly Netherlands launched a project to
bring together air crew ‘on stopover’ with TUI Care Foundation
projects in Gambia and Sal, Cape Verde, where pilots and
stewards could roll up their sleeves and get involved. Working
closely with local partners, in 2016 more than 50 crew members

were skills-matched to volunteer on a range of initiatives that
met TUI Care Foundation criteria and offered no threat to local
employment. Projects have so far included helping with sports
and arts at a day care centre, visiting and helping local elderly
residents, contributing to the TUI Care Foundation sea turtles
protection initiative in Sal and working at a stray animal shelter.
The programme brings an extra pair of hands to important local
initiatives in these destinations and gives the TUI fly crew the
opportunity to get acquainted in a meaningful way with local
people and local cultures. Working with HR, TUI fly Netherlands
is now building the programme to become a broader engagement
and people development opportunity.

Since 2011, TUI UK has offered every
employee a Discovery Day, which
allows them to spend a day a year
with a charity of their choice

CELEBRATING 10 YEARS OF
PROJECT DISCOVERY!

BETTER WORLD CHAMPIONS BRING
ABOUT CHANGE
Our UK retail business mobilises volunteers through
its Better World Champions, who are responsible
for both sustainability and charitable activity. This
network of 24 people talks monthly and meets
annually to energise each other, share ideas and
drive change. Part of their role is to help their
location develop and achieve an annual fundraising
target. In 2016 Ambassadors exceeded £100,000
in fundraising, which was shared among selected
charities.
Since 2011, the UK business has offered every
employee a volunteering or Discovery Day each year,
linking them up to their preferred charities with
the help of our Better World Champions. The UK
has set a great example and other business areas
and markets are now developing similar networks.
The Ambassadors also work hard to grow customer
contributions to TUI Care Foundation.

THE TUI GAMES
The TUI UK head office is in Luton and in 2016
about 50 employees participated in the first ever
TUI Games.

The volunteers worked with six local sports clubs
and 14 young leaders from local secondary schools
to bring sports to children from four local primary
schools.
The programme is run by the charity Sportinspired
and is designed to help children become more
physically active and develop their confidence,
leadership and employability skills while bringing the
community closer together.
Providing extra inspiration at the event was
Commonwealth Games 100m silver medallist
Rechmial Miller. Children participated in a range
of activities including karate, gymnastics, Fit Ball,
athletics and rugby, and at the end of the day their
schools committed to integrate favourites into the
school curriculum for a term.
As a follow-up, the 14 young leaders from local
secondary schools were offered work experience
with TUI. 2016 was the first year TUI took part and
we have committed to get involved again in 2017.

An employee programme we’re particularly
proud of is Project Discovery. The project’s
goal since its launch 10 years ago has been
for volunteers to make a positive difference
and to stimulate sustainable tourism
initiatives within TUI’s operations. Now in
its 10th year, it has provided more than 100
employees the opportunity to work with
charities on TUI’s behalf, benefiting our
destination communities. Project Discovery
gives participants an exceptional experience
that a work or holiday trip alone could not
achieve – it also breathes fresh life into
corporate strategy and drives real change at
our destinations.

ABOUT TUI
GROUP

This statement is made pursuant to section 54 of the UK Modern
Slavery Act 2015. It sets out the steps TUI Group has taken to
prevent acts of modern slavery and human trafficking from occurring
in its business and supply chain up to and during the financial year
ending 30 September 2016.

About TUI Group and our supply chain

INTRODUCTION

In 2015/16 financial year the TUI Group with a headcount of 67,000 recorded turnover of €17.2
billion and an operating result of €1 billion. The TUI Group’s share is listed on the London Stock
Exchange in the FTSE index and in the regulated market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Our
extensive supply chain covers thousands of suppliers in more than 90 countries. The biggest
supplier category is our hotel partners, however our suppliers range from the manufacturers of
aircraft and cruise ships, through to the laundry and other services provided to our hotels, to
tourist guides and other services our customers use in destination.

TUI Group respects all internationally proclaimed human rights as specified in the International
Bill of Human Rights and expects the same of our suppliers and business partners.
Modern slavery and its components of forced labour and human trafficking are of particular
concern given their egregious nature and increasing prevalence. In this statement, we address
how we seek to identify, mitigate, and prevent cases of modern slavery in our operations and
our supply chain.
In accordance with applicable law, conventions and regulation TUI is committed to respecting
human rights throughout its worldwide operations. We have a number of policies and initiatives
in place to monitor, identify, mitigate and prevent human rights impacts in line with the
UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and will take remedial action where
necessary.

TUI Group is the world’s number one tourism business. The broad portfolio gathered under
the Group umbrella consists of strong tour operators, 1,600 travel agencies and leading online
portals, six airlines with around 150 aircraft, over 300 hotels with 214,000 beds, 14 cruise liners
and a significant number of destination management companies in holiday destinations around
the globe. This integrated offering enables us to provide our 20 million customers annually with
an unforgettable holiday experience in 180 destinations.

A key feature of our corporate culture is our global responsibility for economic, environmental
and social sustainability. This is reflected in more than 25 years of environmental reporting and
engagement with sustainable tourism.

POLICIES
We are working on an ongoing basis to improve and update our
policies.
The employee Code of Conduct commits us to respect and observe human rights. TUI Group
employees are also encouraged to report any wrongdoing to the ‘Speak Up’ Line. All employees
wherever they are in the world have access to a confidential reporting channel which allows
them to report concerns about illegal or unethical behaviour directly to a group function free
from reprisal. Employees are specifically encouraged to report concerns about, among other
things, potential human rights issues. Group Legal Compliance closely monitors the hotline and
ensures ongoing employee awareness through e-mails, newsletter updates, websites, e-learning
and posters in prominent areas.
Our Supplier Code of Conduct sets out the minimum standards that we expect from suppliers
and their employees, sub-contractors, agents and subsidiaries when working on our behalf.
Among other things the code includes guidance on human rights and labour laws, bribery and
corruption, environmental impacts and support for local communities. TUI was the first major
player in the Travel and Tourism sector to introduce supplier codes of conduct in order to
mandate standards and stipulate requirements of third party business partners, ensuring their
alignment to TUI’s expectations for responsible and ethical business practices.
 he TUI Supplier Code of Conduct prohibits the use of forced and involuntary labour and
T
requires that suppliers do not:
a.
employ anyone against their will;
b.
traffic in persons or use any form of slave, forced or bonded labour;
c.	require workers to surrender any government-issued identification,
passports, or work permits as a condition of employment; or
d.	require workers to undergo excessive indebted labour: that is, where
workers are required to pay a fee in connection with obtaining
employment, expenses associated with recruitment, processing, or
placement of both direct and contract workers, Suppliers shall be
responsible for payment of fees and expenses in excess of an affordable
portion of a worker’s salary (a guide being one month of the worker’s
anticipated net wages).
The Code also provides detail on the following areas; general rights of workers, child labour,
child protection from sexual exploitation, trafficking, anti-discrimination, working times and
remuneration.
As part of a process of continuous improvement both codes are currently under revision to
ensure better transparency and understanding amongst our employees and suppliers.

 ur TUI tour operating businesses have incorporated environmental and social requirements
O
into contracts for our biggest supplier group - accommodation partners - Sustainability
Requirements for Accommodation Suppliers. We have reviewed these requirements to make
sure that they adequately cover human rights, in particular forced labour and human trafficking.
These requirements are also outlined in our agreements with contracted Destination
Management Companies. We are currently in the process of adapting these requirements for
other areas of our procurement.
We also require our hotel suppliers to implement credible sustainability 3rd party certifications
recognised or approved by the Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC). Travelife is the
certification body we work most closely with and we were involved in developing new, stricter
criteria, which launched in 2014. One of the revisions has been the inclusion of the principles
of the Ethical Trading Base Code to strengthen the human rights components of the audit
process, including modern slavery aspects. In the financial year 2015/16 6.3 million TUI
holidaymakers (representing around 40% of our package holiday customers) stayed in
certified hotels, with 1170 of our hotels now certified with schemes recognised or approved
by the GSTC.

RISK ASSESSMENT
/ DUE DILIGENCE
During the financial year 2015/16 we began analysing our operations and supply chain to better
understand the areas of our operations most at risk of abuses relating to modern slavery.
We have established a working group consisting of senior management representing major
departments to analyse the business areas and potential modern slavery risks. We record
and prioritise these risks in our Human Rights Risk Register, which was developed with the
support of a specialist human rights consultancy. With reference to various indices and reports
on human rights, and taking into consideration TUI’s impact in destinations, we were able to
prioritise a number of areas, particularly long haul destinations, in which to focus our efforts.
TUI Group also continues to working closely with travel trade associations, sustainability
certification bodies and human rights groups to understand trends and risk areas.
 hen purchasing TUI branded supplies for use in destination, such as uniforms and branded
W
merchandise, we prefer to work with partners who are members of SEDEX, a not for profit
membership organisation dedicated to driving improvements in responsible and ethical
business practices in global supply chains.
TUI Group has a third party due diligence programme in place for new suppliers to ensure they
are reputable ethical business partners. During 2017, a programme is underway to enhance
this, and permit large-scale, automated screening of 1st tier third parties in the supply chain
covering aspects of human rights and modern slavery.

 adly, child sexual exploitation has become associated with tourism in various parts of the
S
world. We have a number of processes in place to ensure it does not happen in our operations,
and those of our business partners. We are also taking a number of steps to support
adolescents and young children who are at risk of trafficking and/or commercial
sexual exploitation including:
- TUI Care Foundation, the corporate foundation of TUI Group, has worked on a project in
Brazil and is initiating one in the Dominican Republic aiming to promote the social, economic
and personal empowerment of adolescents and youths at risk of commercial sexual
exploitation. We will continue to work together with the Foundation to identify and support
projects, which protect and empower the young generation in key destinations.
- Our businesses actively support several child protection projects and campaigns, and in 2015
TUI Group and RIU were named as Top Members of the Code of Conduct for the Protection
of Children from Sexual Exploitation in Travel & Tourism. In 2016, we joined the Board of the
Code as chairperson. We also sit on the UNWTO Child Protection task force.

TRAINING
We conduct regular child protection training for all colleagues working for TUI Destination
Services to ensure they understand child protection and how to react and proceed when an
incident occurs.
We are in the process of training specific groups of colleagues about human rights and modern
slavery, such as holiday representatives and purchasers working in high risk destinations.
 ll crew members of Thomson Airways participate in the Vulnerable Children & Trafficking
A
Training during their inductions, where they learn about how to spot trafficking and what to
do if identified so. TUI Group is planning to roll out this training to its other airlines.
What is more, for certain purchase categories several of our buyers undergo Chartered Institute
of Procurement and Supply (CIPS) training, which includes key guidance on modern slavery
issues in supply chains.
