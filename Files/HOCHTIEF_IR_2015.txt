Rick Morisson, project manager,
Flatiron “Ruskin Dam and
­Powerhouse”

Our latest project is absolutely exciting. While upgrading
and expanding the Ruskin Dam and hydro power station
located less than 60 kilometers from Vancouver, we discovered a light bulb in the powerhouse that had been installed more than 80 years earlier and was still glowing
strong! We interpreted this as a good sign.
After all, this facility will produce clean hydroelectric
power for 33,000 households in the future. Since embarking on the project in 2012, we have gained a wealth of
experience and huge respect for water as a force of nature. When, for instance, heavy rains dramatically raised
levels in the reservoir in fall 2014, we had to open the spill
gates to release enormous volumes of water—900 cubic
meters per second for a period of several weeks!
Before construction got underway, we devised an environmental management plan. And we have adhered to
it strictly ever since, especially as the 40-meter-high,
100-meter-long dam sits in a recreation area used by
many people. What’s more, the reservoir behind the dam
is not just a source of drinking water. Downstream thousands of salmon also come to spawn. This is why any
water we contaminate is collected and treated.

In the Canadian province of British Columbia, the
HOCHTIEF company Flatiron is upgrading Ruskin Dam
and powerhouse, work slated for completion by 2017.

26

Group Report 2015

The Ruskin Dam is being built to stand the test of time
as well as any potential earthquakes. So that 80 years
from now it will still be keeping the lights on.

Consolidated Balance Sheet

Strong and solid consolidated balance sheet
HOCHTIEF continued its charted course in 2015 to
strengthen the consolidated balance sheet and reduced balance sheet risk. Use was made of the good
available financial leeway, notably for debt reduction
and for the stock buyback program at HOCHTIEF

HOCHTIEF Group’s total assets, which stood at EUR
13.3 billion as of the December 31, 2015 reporting

istration and other services, as well as notably rental and
lease revenue. Other operating expenses amounted to
EUR 93 million and thus remained around the previous
year’s level of EUR 94 million. They mainly consist of guarantee, rental and lease expenses, additions to provisions,
and consulting fees. Net income from financial assets
is primarily determined by income from profit/loss transfer agreements and expenses from transfer of losses.
The figure for 2015 came to EUR 313 million, EUR 37
million above the prior-year comparative figure (EUR
276 million). This improvement was mainly due to higher
profit/loss transfers from HOCHTIEF Insurance Broking
and Risk Management GmbH and HOCHTIEF Americas
GmbH which amounted to EUR 202 million. In total,
HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft generated income of
EUR 382 million from profit/loss transfer agreements
(2014: EUR 283 million). Expenses from transfer of losses
came to EUR 71 million, compared with EUR 9 million
in the prior year. Despite a reduction in bank interest
expense, net interest income was further into negative
figures, with a loss of EUR 93 million versus EUR 82 million in the prior year. The main factor here was a marked

Michael Deane, Chief
Sustainability Officer,
Turner Construction

An integrated approach to construction projects using
sustainable products and services pays off. When you
look at building use and long-term operation, the advantages of environmentally friendly construction are clear.
Turner is the market leader for green buildings which has
given us a clear understanding of the vital importance
not just of green materials but also the responsible use
of energy and resources in every phase of construction
and operation of a building.
We work to recognized benchmarks, chiefly the U.S. Green
Building Council’s LEED standard, and have completed
508 LEED-certified structures. We share our clients’ commitment to this concept and trust in our expertise.
At Turner, minimizing the impact on the environment and
neighboring communities is among our top priorities. To
help us achieve these goals, we harness technologies
such as Building Information Modeling (BIM). This computer-aided design and construction method helps us
maximize our efficiency. BIM and other lean processes
have resulted in improved outcomes including reductions
in schedule and project cost, and increases in overall
client satisfaction.

New York is a dazzling city with a unique energy. Turner
has been instrumental in shaping its modern face by
adding numerous structures—the majority of which
qualify as green buildings.

Group Management Report

Dr. Alexandra ­A lbrecht-Baba
Head of Corporate Compliance
HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft

Whether in the world’s financial capitals, on construction sites or in offices—wherever people come together
to work and do business, clear rules are indispensable.
That’s why we at HOCHTIEF have drawn up a Code of
Conduct that provides all employees with a set of binding rules and clear guidance on appropriate behavior.
HOCHTIEF expects everyone in its employ to adhere to
these rules—no ifs or buts. To ensure our external partners are also on the same page, we have additionally
formulated a Code of Conduct for Business Partners.
It is a matter of great importance to me that the compliance system itself is credible and consistent. Staff
should be in a position to evaluate the advice Compliance provides. Not just because they know and understand the rules, but also because they can count on
similar matters being handled in the same way. For this
reason, training is also an essential part of our job.
Over the course of many years, HOCHTIEF and its subsidiaries have earned an excellent reputation around
the world—chiefly for our strong sense of tradition and
steadfast resolve but also for our outstanding products
and services as well as our reliability. Safeguarding this
reputation is the key task of every HOCHTIEF employee.

Frankfurt am Main is a major financial, trade show, and
service-provider center. HOCHTIEF buildings feature
prominently in its look—including the Trade Fair Tower
and exhibition hall 3.

International Labor Organization (ILO) standards
As early as 2000, HOCHTIEF
became the first construction
company in the world to sign
on to the standards of the UN
agency International Labor Organization (ILO). The ILO focuses
on enabling women and men
the world over to work in conditions of freedom, equity, security,
and human dignity. HOCHTIEF
is also fundamentally committed to the ILO conventions and
the UN conventions—see glossary on page 260.

Overall assessment of future developments
In 2016, HOCHTIEF will continue to focus on implementing its strategy throughout the Group and systematically
press ahead with related initiatives. In the process, operational earnings and profit margins are expected to
further improve across all divisions. HOCHTIEF’s profit
before tax, EBIT, and consolidated net profit will consequently see sustained growth, with levels well above the
prior year. Alongside the anticipated gain in profitability,
the strategic focus on cash generation will also maintain
a clearly positive effect on Group cash flow and net cash
development. This ongoing optimization of HOCHTIEF’s
financial strength means we will remain exceedingly well
placed in future years to invest on a sustained basis and

Sustainability at HOCHTIEF

Building bridges—that means overcoming limitations,
gathering new experiences, and bringing people together.
In November, I took part in just such an enriching encounter: Nine colleagues from Germany and other countries,
the organization Bridges to Prosperity (B2P), and local
helpers all joined forces to build a footbridge in Rwanda.
Residents of the nearby villages were desperately in need
of the bridge because the stream swells during the rainy
season and creates an insurmountable barrier, cutting
them off from schools, markets, and doctors.
Getting to know new cultures and mentalities in a foreign
country was fascinating. I was especially thrilled to see
how well the international team pulled together. We all
learned from one another in the process and ultimately
completed a 70-meter bridge—with huge benefits for
everyone involved.

Sustainability at HOCHTIEF
Group company CIMIC

At CIMIC, we aim to provide a healthy working environment where all our employees can feel at home. The fact
that we are considered one of Australia’s preferred employers is evident in the ranking we received from professional networking platform LinkedIn in 2015. Our companies CPB Contractors and Thiess both made it into
the country’s top ten Most inDemand Employers.

Consolidated Financial Statements

And for good reason. CPB Contractors offers a broad
spectrum of job opportunities on construction projects
that help people navigate public life—roads, bridges,
and tunnels allowing commuters to get where they’re
going quickly and safely, hospitals that save lives, and
wind power facilities that generate green electricity.
Like CPB Contractors, Thiess also invests in its employees,
providing a variety of ways to take their personal development to the next level. These run the gamut from student scholarships and traineeships, through technical
and functional management programs, to coaching for
executives.

The companies making up the HOCHTIEF Group company CIMIC have shaped the Sydney skyline with their
numerous building construction and infrastructure projects, including the office block currently being erected
at 177 Pacific Highway.

Group Report 2015

We are proud that CIMIC is recognized as an attractive
employer. Since we are headquartered in Sydney, we
have a special relationship with this metropolis. Many
sustainable buildings and extensive portions of the infrastructure bear our signature and lend Sydney the
high quality of life it has to offer.

Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

Note 25

Notes to the consolidated financial
statements
Accounting policies
General information
The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) as adopted by the EU and with supplementary provisions of German commercial law applicable under Section 315a (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). The same accounting policies applied in the prior year.
Alongside the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the
Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Consolidated Financial Statements also include a Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. Segment reporting is provided in these Notes.
For purposes of clarity, a number of items are combined in the Balance Sheet and in the Statement of Earnings.
These items are broken down into their constituents and commented on elsewhere in these Notes. The Statement
of Earnings is presented using the nature of expense method of analysis.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in euros.
As an independent listed group, HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen, Germany, publishes its own consolidated
financial statements, which are also included in the consolidated financial statements of ACS Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A., Madrid, Spain (ACS).
The Consolidated Financial Statements relate to the year 2015, comprising the reporting period from January 1 to
December 31, 2015.
The Executive Board of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft released the financial statements for publication on February 19, 2016. They will be approved at the Supervisory Board meeting on February 24, 2016.
Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements generally include HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft as well as all domestic
and foreign subsidiaries in which it directly or indirectly holds the majority of voting rights. This generally goes hand
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

in hand with a majority shareholding. Two companies are consolidated by virtue of contractual arrangements. Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Companies in which HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft holds a majority of voting rights but over which it exercises joint control by contractual arrangement with
other owners are likewise accounted for using the equity method unless classified as joint operations.
Holdings in subsidiaries or associated companies or joint ventures deemed to be of minor overall significance from
a Group perspective are not consolidated and are accounted for in accordance with IAS 39.
A number of the subsidiaries included in the Consolidated Financial Statements make partial use of the exempting
provisions in either Section 264 (3) or Section 264b of the German Commercial Code. A list of the companies that
make use of these exemptions is included on page 248 and 249.

174

Group Report 2015

The Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2015 include HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and a total
of 58 German and 397 foreign consolidated companies as well as four special-purpose investment funds (Spezialfonds). The number of consolidated companies decreased by 15 and the number of special-purpose funds by one
compared with the previous year. A total of four German and 28 foreign companies were consolidated for the first
time in the reporting year. The additions were in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division (17), the HOCHTIEF Europe division (11), and the HOCHTIEF Americas division (4). The majority are project companies. A total of four domestic
and 43 foreign companies were removed from the consolidated group. Most of the companies removed from the
consolidated group were in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division (28) and the HOCHTIEF Europe division (18). An
entity is generally added to or removed from the consolidated group at the time the equity stake in the entity is
acquired or disposed of.
Fifty-two affiliated companies of minor overall significance to the Group’s financial position and results of operations were not consolidated. Their combined sales represented less than 1% of consolidated sales.
Sixteen domestic and 166 foreign associates were accounted for using the equity method. This number declined by
a total of 11 companies, with 14 companies added and 25 removed. Most of the additions were in the HOCHTIEF
Asia Pacific division (7) and the HOCHTIEF Americas division (5). The removals related to the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific
division (16) and the HOCHTIEF Europe division (9). Due to their minor overall significance, a further 19 companies
were not accounted for using the equity method.
A total of 59 joint operations from the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division are included in the Consolidated Financial
Statements on a proportionate basis. In the year under review, ten entities were added and seven removed.
Consolidation policies
The financial statements of domestic and international companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements
are prepared in accordance with uniform Group accounting principles. All business combinations (acquisitions) are
accounted for using the acquisition method. Business combinations are measured at the acquisition date by allocating the consideration given to the acquired subsidiary’s net assets measured at fair value. Transaction costs arising
in connection with such acquisitions are recognized directly as expense. All assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities of an acquired subsidiary that satisfy the recognition criteria are measured at full fair value regardless of any
minority interest. Intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill if they are separable from the accounting entity or arise from contractual or other legal rights. Any goodwill then left is recognized as an asset. Goodwill
is not amortized, but is tested instead for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 on an annual basis and whenever
there are indications that it may be impaired. Negative goodwill arising on initial measurement is recognized immeConsolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

diately in income. On divestment, a pro rata share of the divesting division’s goodwill is taken into account when
measuring disposal proceeds.
Goodwill increased by EUR 40,494 thousand in the year under review, from EUR 666,677 thousand to EUR
707,171 thousand.

Group Report 2015

175

Income, expenses, receivables, and liabilities between consolidated companies are eliminated. Unrealized intercompany profits and losses are eliminated unless they are of minor significance. Any impairment losses recognized for consolidated companies in their separate financial statements are reversed.
The same policies apply to equity-method investments. These include the Group’s associates and joint ventures.
Any goodwill increases the carrying amount of an investment. Like other goodwill, goodwill on equity-method investments is not amortized. Reductions in carrying amount due to impairment are reported in the share of profits
and losses of equity-method associates and joint ventures. The financial statements of all equity-method investments are prepared in accordance with uniform Group accounting policies.
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations
Non-current assets held for sale (disposal group)
In view of the intention to sell, mining assets of PT Thiess Contractors Indonesia (HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division)
are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 as assets held for sale. Further negotiations were conducted during
the 2015 reporting year and an agreement for the sale of the assets was signed in January 2016. Property, plant and
equipment, inventories, and lease liabilities were consequently reclassified, the reclassification having no impact on
the Statement of Earnings.
The remaining assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale and presented separately in the balance sheet.
The table below shows the major classes of assets and liabilities held for sale. No amount is additionally recognized in other comprehensive income.

Discontinued operations
In accordance with its strategic alignment, HOCHTIEF Group Company CIMIC Holdings entered into binding agreements for the sale of the John Holland Group as well as Thiess Services and Leighton Contractors Services in
December 2014. CIMIC’s entire stake in its subsidiary John Holland Group (Melbourne, Australia) was consequently
sold to CCCC International Holding Limited (Beijing, China). CIMIC brought 50% of its activities in Thiess Services
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

(Brisbane, Australia) and Leighton Contractors Services (Sydney, Australia) under a joint venture established with
subsidiaries of Apollo Global Management, LLC.
The prior-year Statement of Earnings for the HOCHTIEF Group showed EUR 537,564 thousand in profit after tax
from discontinued operations. No divestments meeting the criteria of discontinued operations were made in 2015.
It was therefore not necessary to report profit after tax from discontinued operations in 2015.

Annual average

In their separate financial statements, Group companies disclose transactions denominated in foreign currency using
the average exchange rate on the day of recording the transaction. Exchange gains or losses up to the reporting date
on the measurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets or liabilities are included in other operating
income or other operating expenses at the average exchange rate on the reporting date. Currency translation differences relating to a net investment in a foreign company are accounted for in accumulated other comprehensive
income until the company is sold. This includes foreign currency receivables from fully consolidated Group companies
for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future and which therefore resemble
equity.

Group Report 2015

177

Financial statements of foreign companies are translated by applying the functional currency approach. As all companies outside the euro area operate autonomously in their own national currencies, their balance sheet items are
translated into euros using the average exchange rate prevailing on the reporting date in accordance with official
requirements. The same method is used to translate the shareholders’ equity of equity-method foreign associates
following equity-method adjustment. Differences from the previous year’s translated amount are recognized in other
comprehensive income and are reversed to income or expense on sale of the equity interest. Goodwill of commercially independent foreign Group entities is translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the reporting date. Income
and expense items are translated into euros using the annual average exchange rate.
Accounting policies
Intangible assets are reported at amortized cost. All intangible assets have a finite useful life with the exception of
company names recognized as assets on initial consolidation and of goodwill. Intangible assets include concessions
and other licenses with useful lives of up to 30 years. These are amortized according to the pattern of consumption
of economic benefits. They also include future earnings from additions to the order backlog arising from business
acquisitions; these are amortized over the period in which the corresponding work is billed. Intangible assets further
encompass software for commercial and engineering applications, which is amortized on a straight-line basis over
three to five years, and entitlements to various financing arrangements with banks amortized over a maximum of
10 years in accordance with the term of the arrangement. Estimated useful lives and amortization methods are
reviewed annually.
Company names and goodwill are not amortized. They are tested instead for impairment in accordance with IAS
36 on an annual basis and whenever there are indications that they may be impaired. The companies recognized
in the HOCHTIEF Americas and HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific divisions were classified as intangible assets with an indefi­
nite useful life as they do not have a product life cycle and are not subject to technical, technological, or commercial depletion or any other restriction.
Capitalized development costs are reported in intangible assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over
three to five years.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at depreciated cost. Only amounts directly attributable to an item of
property, plant or equipment are included in its cost. Borrowing costs are included in cost in the case of qualifying
assets. Property, plant and equipment is normally depreciated on a straight-line basis, except in the contract mining business where depreciation is mostly recognized on an activity basis.
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

Items of property, plant, machinery and equipment typically encountered in the HOCHTIEF Group are depreciated
on a straight-line basis over the following uniform useful lives:
No. of years
Buildings and investment properties
Technical equipment and machinery; ­transportation equipment
Other equipment and office equipment

Estimated useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed annually.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Items of property, plant and equipment on finance leases are recognized at fair value or the present value of the
minimum lease payments, whichever is lower, and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated
useful life or over a shorter contract term if applicable.
Investment properties are stated at amortized cost. Transaction costs are included on initial measurement. The
fair values of investment properties are disclosed in the Notes. They are assessed using internationally accepted
valuation methods, such as taking comparable properties as a guide to current market prices or by applying the
discounted cash flow method. Like property, plant and equipment, investment properties are normally depreciated
using the straight-line method.
Impairment losses are recognized for intangible assets (including goodwill), property, plant and equipment, or
investment properties if their recoverable amount falls below their carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an
asset or cash-generating unit is normally defined as fair value less costs to sell or value in use, whichever is higher.
Impairment testing may require assets and, in some cases, liabilities to be grouped into cash-generating units. For
goodwill, impairment testing is performed on cash-generating units corresponding to the HOCHTIEF divisions that
feature in segmental reporting. For any asset that is part of an independent cash-generating unit, impairment is
determined with reference to the recoverable amount of the unit. If the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit
falls below its carrying amount, the resulting impairment loss is allocated first to any goodwill belonging to the unit
and then to the unit’s other assets, normally pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset. Except in
the case of goodwill, impairment charges are reversed (up to a maximum of amortized cost) when the impairment
ceases to exist.
A joint arrangement is an arrangement in which two or more parties have joint control. The parties to a joint arrangement classify it as a joint operation or a joint venture depending on their respective rights and obligations. In a joint
operation, the parties have direct rights to the assets and direct obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. Each party recognizes assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, together with its share of such items held
or incurred jointly, relative to the HOCHTIEF Group’s rights and obligations. In a joint venture, where the parties have
rights to the net assets arising from the arrangement, the parties each account for their interests in the joint venture
using the equity method.
Equity-method investments are stated at cost, comprising the acquired equity interest in an associate or joint
ventures plus any goodwill. The carrying amount is increased or decreased annually to recognize the Group’s share
of after-tax profits or losses, any dividends, and other changes in equity. The full carrying amount is tested for
impairment in accordance with IAS 36 whenever there are indications that it may be impaired. If the recoverable
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

amount of an equity-method investment is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the
difference. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss.

Group Report 2015

179

All other financial assets, comprising interests in non-consolidated subsidiaries, other participating interests, and
non-current securities, are classed as held for sale and are measured at fair value where a fair value can be reliably
estimated. In the case of publicly listed financial assets, fair value is determined as the market price. If there is no
active market, fair value is calculated using the most recent market transactions or a valuation method such as the
discounted cash flow method. In cases where fair value cannot be measured reliably, financial assets are reported
at cost (less any impairments). Initial measurement is performed as of the settlement date. Unrealized gains or losses
are accounted for, after adjusting for deferred taxation, in other comprehensive income and are reversed to income
or expense on disposal of the asset. If there is objective evidence of impairment, the carrying amount of an asset
is reduced and the impairment loss recognized as an expense. Such evidence includes a significant or prolonged
decline in fair value below cost.
Receivables and other assets are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method (accounting for factors such as premiums and discounts). An impairment loss is recognized if there is any objective material
evidence that a financial asset may be impaired. Objective evidence for impairment includes, for example, downgrading of a debtor’s credit rating and related interruptions in payment or potential insolvency. Impairment losses
are recognized according to actual credit risk. “Receivables” comprise financial receivables, trade receivables, and
other receivables. Sales are shown net of VAT and other taxes and expected reductions such as trade discounts
and rebates. Sales of goods are recognized when:
• The significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer
• The HOCHTIEF Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with
ownership nor effective control over the goods sold
• The amount of revenue and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured
reliably
• It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the HOCHTIEF Group.
Revenue from transactions involving the rendering of services is recognized by reference to the stage of completion.
Revenue under construction contracts is recognized as described below.
Long-term loans are stated at amortized cost. Loans yielding interest at normal market rates are reported at face
value, and non-interest-bearing and low-interest-bearing loans are discounted to present value. Discounting is always
done using a risk-adjusted discount rate.
*See glossary on page 260.

Construction contracts are reported using the percentage of completion* (POC) method. Cumulative work done
to date, including the Group’s share of net profit, is reported under sales on a pro rata basis according to the per-

Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

centage completed. The percentage of completion is measured by reference to the stage of completion; that is, as
the ratio of performance delivered up to the end of the reporting period to total contract performance. Construction contracts are reported in trade receivables and trade payables, as “Gross amount due from/to customers for/
from contract work (POC).” If cumulative work done to date (contract costs plus contract net profit) of contracts in
progress exceeds progress payments received, the difference is recognized as an asset and included in amounts
due from customers for contract work. If the net amount after deduction of progress payments received is negative,
the difference is recognized as a liability and included in amounts due to customers from contract work. Anticipated

180

Group Report 2015

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

losses on specific contracts are accounted for on the basis of the identifiable risks. Construction contracts handled
by construction joint ventures are also accounted for using the POC method. Trade receivables from construction
joint ventures include pro rata entitlements to contract net profit. Anticipated losses are immediately recognized in
full in contract net profit. Contract income on construction contracts undertaken by the Group independently or in
construction joint ventures is recognized in accordance with IAS 11 as the income stipulated in the contract plus
any claims and variation orders. Construction contract receivables are realized as part of the HOCHTIEF Group’s
operating cycle. In accordance with IAS 1, they are therefore included in current assets even though they are not
expected to be realized within twelve months of the balance sheet date.
The POC method is used primarily in the mainstream construction business, construction management, and contract mining.
Deferred taxes arising from temporary differences between the IFRS accounts and tax base of individual Group
companies or as a result of consolidation are recognized as separate assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are
also recognized for tax refund entitlements resulting from the anticipated use of existing tax loss carryforwards in
subsequent years provided it is sufficiently certain that they will be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
offset within each company or group. Deferred taxes are measured on the basis of tax rates applying or expected
to apply in each country when they are realized. For domestic operations, as in the prior year, a tax rate of 31.5% is
assumed, taking account of corporate income tax plus the German “solidarity surcharge” and the average rate of
municipal trade tax faced by Group companies. For all other purposes, deferred taxes are measured on the basis
of the tax regulations in force or enacted at the reporting date.
Inventories are initially stated at cost of purchase or production. Production cost includes costs directly related to
the units of production plus an appropriate allocation of materials and production overhead, including productionrelated depreciation charges. Borrowing costs for inventories that are qualifying assets are capitalized as part of cost.
Most materials and supplies are measured on a FIFO or moving-average basis. Inventories are written down to net
realizable value if their recoverable amount is less than their carrying amount at the reporting date. If the recoverable
amount of inventories subsequently increases, the resulting gain must be recognized. This is done by reducing
materials expense.
All marketable securities are classed as held for sale and measured at fair value. They mainly comprise securities
held in special-purpose and investment funds as well as fixed-income securities with a residual term of more than
three months at the time of acquisition and where there is no intention to hold the securities to maturity. Initial meas­
urement is performed as of the settlement date and includes any transaction costs directly attributable to the
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

acquisition of the securities. Unrealized gains or losses are reported in other comprehensive income and are reversed to income or expense on disposal. If there is objective evidence of impairment, the carrying amount of an
asset is reduced and the impairment loss recognized as an expense. Such evidence includes a significant or prolonged decline in fair value below cost.
Cash and cash equivalents consist of petty cash, cash balances at banks, and marketable securities with
maturities of no more than three months at the time of acquisition that are subject to insignificant fluctuations in
value only.

Group Report 2015

181

Discontinued operations along with non-current assets held for sale and associated liabilities are meas­
ured in accordance with IFRS 5 and presented separately in the current section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
To be classed as assets held for sale, assets must be available for immediate sale and their sale must be highly probable. Assets held for sale can be individual non-current assets, groups of assets held for sale (disposal groups), or
discontinued operations. A component of an entity is a discontinued operation if it represents a separate major line
of business or geographical area of operations and is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a major line of
business or geographical area of operations, or if it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Liabilities
disposed of with assets in a single transaction are part of a disposal group or discontinued operation. Non-current
assets held for sale cease to be depreciated or amortized, and are measured at their carrying amount or at fair value
less costs to sell, whichever is lower. Gains or losses arising on the measurement of individual assets held for sale
or of disposal groups are reported in the Statement of Earnings under earnings from continuing operations until
their ultimate disposal. Conversely, gains or losses arising on the measurement of discontinued operations at fair
value less costs to sell, profits or losses of discontinued operations, and gains or losses on their disposal are presented separately in the Statement of Earnings under earnings from discontinued operations.
Share-based payment transactions are measured in accordance with IFRS 2. Stock option plans are accounted
for Group-wide as cash-settled share-based payment transactions. Provisions for obligations under the Long-term
Incentive Plans and the Top Executive Retention Plans are recognized in the amount of the expected expense that is
or was spread over the stipulated waiting period. The fair value of stock options is measured using generally accepted
financial models, the value of the plans being determined with the Black/Scholes option pricing model. The specific
problem of valuing the plans in question is solved using binomial tree methods. The computations are performed
by an outside appraiser.
Provisions for pensions and similar obligations are recognized for current and future benefit payments to
active and former employees and their surviving dependants. The obligations primarily relate to pension benefits,
partly for basic pensions and partly for optional supplementary pensions. The individual benefit obligations vary
from one country to another and are determined for the most part by length of service and pay scales. The Turner
Group’s obligations to meet healthcare costs for retired staff are likewise included in pension provisions due to their
pension-like nature.
Provisions for pensions and similar obligations are computed by the projected unit credit method. This determines
the present value of future entitlements, taking into account current and future benefits already known at the reporting date plus anticipated future increases in salaries and pensions and, for the Turner Group, in healthcare costs.
The computation is based on actuarial appraisals using biometric accounting principles. Plan assets as defined in
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

IAS 19 are shown separately as deductions from pension obligations. Plan assets comprise assets transferred to
pension funds to meet pension obligations, shares in investment funds purchased under deferred compensation
arrangements, and qualifying insurance policies in the form of pension liability insurance. If the fair value of plan
assets is greater than the present value of employee benefits, the difference is reported—subject to the limit in IAS
19—under other non-current assets.

182

Group Report 2015

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Amounts ensuing from the remeasurement of defined benefit plans are recognized directly in equity in the period
during which they arise. The current service cost is reported under personnel costs. The net interest component,
comprising the interest element of the increase in pension obligations less the anticipated returns on plan assets
(each calculated using the discount factor for the pension obligations), is reported in net investment and interest
income.
Tax provisions comprise current tax obligations. Income tax provisions are offset against tax refund entitlements
if they relate to the same tax jurisdiction and are congruent in nature and reporting period.
Other provisions account for all identifiable obligations as of the reporting date that result from past business
transactions or events but are uncertain in their amount and/or settlement date. Provisions are stated at the estimated settlement amount, i.e. after making allowance for price and cost increases, and are not offset against any
rights to reimbursement. For obligations with a settlement probability exceeding 50%, the amount set aside is
calculated on the basis of the most likely settlement outcome. A provision can only be recognized on the basis
of a legal or constructive obligation toward third parties. Non-current provisions are stated at the present value of
the estimated settlement amount as of the reporting date and reported under non-current liabilities.
Liabilities are reported at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method (accounting for factors such as
premiums and discounts). Finance lease liabilities are initially recognized at fair value at the inception of the
lease or the present value of the minimum lease payments, whichever is lower.
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value regardless of their purpose and reported under other
receivables and other assets or other liabilities. Initial measurement is as of the settlement date. All derivative financial instruments are measured on the basis of current market rates as of the balance sheet date. The recognition
of changes in fair value depends on the purpose for which a derivative is held. Derivatives are only ever used in the
HOCHTIEF Group for hedging purposes. Hedges are structured for maximum effectiveness. A cash flow hedge is
a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows from a hedged item, as with the hedging of variable rate loans
to counter variations in payment amounts due to interest rate changes. Unrealized gains and losses are initially recognized in equity, taking account of deferred taxes. The portion of the changes in value initially recognized in equity is
reclassified to income or expense as soon as the hedged item is recognized in income or expense. If a hedged
planned transaction subsequently results in recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, gains or losses
recognized in equity in the meantime are reclassified to income or expense in the period when the financial asset
or financial liability affects income. If a hedged planned transaction subsequently results in recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, gains or losses recognized in equity in the meantime are taken out of equity and subtracted
Consolidated Financial Statements

from or added to the initial cost of the asset or liability. In the cases described, only the portion of changes in value
that are determined to be effective for hedging purposes are recognized in equity. The ineffective portion is recognized directly as income or expense. In the HOCHTIEF Group, only cash flow hedges are currently recognized.
Derivatives are also used for economic hedging purposes where no hedge accounting is applied. In such cases,
changes in fair value are recognized in income or expense.

Contingencies, commitments, and other obligations are possible or current obligations, based on past transactions, that are unlikely to lead to an outflow of resources. These are disclosed separately and not included in the
Balance Sheet unless assumed in the course of a business combination. The amounts stated for contingent liabilities reflect the extent of the liabilities as of the reporting date.
Judgments made by management in applying the accounting policies primarily relate to the following issues:
• Leases must be assessed to determine whether the substantial risks and rewards of beneficial ownership transfer
to the lessee.
• Securities may be grouped in different categories.
• Assets earmarked for sale must be assessed to confirm that they are available for immediate sale and their sale
is highly probable. If the result of this assessment is positive, those assets and any liabilities to be disposed of in
the same transaction must be reported and accounted for as assets held for sale and liabilities associated with
assets held for sale.
• It is necessary to determine whether construction revenue is accounted for under IAS 11 or IAS 18.
The decision made by the HOCHTIEF Group for general application in each instance is set out under Accounting
Policies in these Notes.
Preparation of the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements requires Group management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and disclosures of
contingencies, commitments, and other obligations. The main estimates and assumptions relate to the following:
• Assessing projects on a percentage of completion basis, in particular with regard to accounting for change orders,
the timing of profit recognition, and the amount of profit recognized.
• Estimating the economic life of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and of investment properties.
• Accounting for provisions.
• Testing goodwill and other assets for impairment.
• Testing deferred tax assets for impairment.
All estimates and assumptions are based on current circumstances and appraisals. Forward-looking estimates
and assumptions made as of the balance sheet date with a view to future business performance take account of
circumstances prevailing on preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and future trends considered
realistic for the global and industry environment. Actual amounts can vary from the estimated amounts due to changes
in the operating environment that are at variance with the assumptions and lie beyond management control. If
such changes occur, the assumptions and, if necessary, the carrying amounts of affected assets and liabilities are
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

revised accordingly.

Group Report 2015

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

New accounting pronouncements
Adoption by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) of
new and revised IFRS and IFRIC pronouncements has resulted in changes to accounting policies in those
instances where the pronouncements have been adopted by the EU and their application is mandatory for the
reporting period from January 1 to December 31, 2015.
Changes in IFRS and IFRIC affecting the HOCHTIEF Group are as follows:
• Annual Improvements Cycle 2011–2013 and
• IFRIC 21 Levies
The IFRS pronouncements applicable in the reporting year had no material impact on the HOCHTIEF Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Other new accounting pronouncements issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the
IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) take the form of standards and interpretations that affect the HOCHTIEF
Consolidated Financial Statements but do not have to be applied for the 2015 year and in some cases have not yet
been endorsed by the EU:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: After publishing the three phases of the new standard over the last few years, the
IASB published the final version of IFRS 9 in July 2014. The new standard notably introduces major changes relating
to the classification and measurement of financial assets, with classification to be based on the type of business
model and on contractual cash flows. In the same connection, impairment assessment is extended from an incurred
loss model to an expected loss model. A new hedge accounting model is also introduced that aims to bring hedge
accounting more closely into line with the risk management activities of the entity.
The complete overhaul of IAS 39 with the publication of IFRS 9 results in additional disclosures.
The standard is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Initial application is retrospective,
although transitional provisions apply. Earlier application is permitted. EU endorsement is still pending. On current
assessment, the new standard will result in a reclassification of financial assets in the HOCHTIEF Group. The new
rules on financial liabilities will probably have no material effect on the HOCHTIEF Group. Further implications of
IFRS 9 and its additional provisions cannot be assessed until final endorsement by the EU.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: The IASB issued this new standard in May 2014 with the
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

objective of bringing together in one standard the rules on revenue recognition previously contained in various different standards and interpretations. IFRS 15 applies across all sectors to revenue from all contracts with customers
except those that are within the scope of other IFRSs, such as leases, insurance contracts, and financial instruments.
Revenue recognition is carried out with regard to both timing and amount by applying the following five steps:
(1) Identify the contracts with a customer
(2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract
(3) Determine the transaction price
(4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
(5) Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.

Group Report 2015

185

Alongside this five-step model, IFRS 15 includes an array of further provisions, such as on contract modifications
and additional notes disclosures. Due to postponement of the date of initial application in September 2015, the
revised IFRS 15 applies for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018; earlier application is permitted.
EU endorsement is still pending. With regard to the HOCHTIEF Consolidated Financial Statements, it is assumed
on current assessment that the new standard will lead to changes in revenue recognition. However, it will still be
possible to recognize revenue over time. Otherwise, the main changes relate to additional requirements for notes
disclosures. The effects of IFRS 15 cannot be finally assessed until final endorsement by the EU.
IFRS 16 Leases: The standard announced by the IASB in January 2016 mainly introduces new rules for the classification of leases by lessees. The previous risk-and-rewards approach is abandoned in favor of recognizing a rightof-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all leases. Exceptions from this rule only exist for leases with
lease terms of less than twelve months and leases where the underlying asset has a low value. Lessors, on the other
hand, continue to classify leases as operating or financing leases according to whether substantially all the risks
and rewards are transferred. The new IFRS 16 applies for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January
1, 2019. Earlier application is permitted if IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers has also been applied.
EU endorsement is still pending. The potential impact for the HOCHTIEF Group is currently under assessment.
Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and
Joint Ventures: In “Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture” published
in September 2014, the IASB clarifies that recognition of a gain or loss on the sale or contribution of assets depends
on whether the assets constitute a business as defined in IFRS 3. When a transaction involves a business, the
investor recognizes a full gain or loss. When a transaction involves the sale of assets that do not constitute a business, a partial gain or loss is recognized. The amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 apply for annual periods beginning
on or after January 1, 2016; earlier application is permitted. EU endorsement is still pending. On current assessment,
the amendments will have no material impact on the HOCHTIEF Consolidated Financial Statements.
Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: In “Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations”
published in May 2014, the IASB clarifies that the acquisition of an initial or additional interest in a joint operation
when the operation constitutes a business as defined in IFRS 3 should be accounted for using the principles related to business combinations in IFRS 3 and other applicable standards with the exception of those principles that
conflict with the guidance in IFRS 11. On the acquisition of additional interests in a joint operation, previously held
interests are not remeasured. The amendments to IFRS 11 do not apply if the parties sharing joint control are under
the common control of the same ultimate controlling party. The amendments apply for annual periods beginning
on or after January 1, 2016. Earlier application is permitted. The amendments were endorsed by the EU in NovemConsolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

ber 2015. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the HOCHTIEF Consolidated Financial
Statements.

186

Group Report 2015

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

As part of its annual improvements process, the IASB published an omnibus standard in December 2013 (Annual
Improvements Cycle 2010–2012) and another in September 2014 (Annual Improvements Cycle 2012–2014). This
involved minor but necessary changes to various standards. The Annual Improvements Cycle 2010–2012 applies
for annual periods beginning on or after February 1, 2015, and the Annual Improvements Cycle 2012–2014 for
annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016. The EU has already endorsed both of those omnibus standards.
On current assessment, the changes are not expected to have a material impact on the presentation of the financial position or financial performance of the HOCHTIEF Group.
The remaining IFRS pronouncements issued by the IASB have no major relevance to the HOCHTIEF Group and
are therefore not expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements or their potential
impact is currently under assessment:
• Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other
Entities and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception
• Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Disclosure Initiative
• Amendments to IAS 7 Cash Flow Statements: Disclosure Initiative
• Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses
• A mendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 Intangible Assets: Clarification of

testing is performed in accordance with IAS 36 as described below for goodwill. As in the prior year, no impairment
was identified in the year under review.
Goodwill recognized for consolidated companies on initial consolidation is allocated to cash-generating units at
segment level for the purposes of impairment testing as described in the following. The cash-generating units cor­
respond to the divisions used in segment reporting.
Annual impairment testing of goodwill at segment (division) level is performed at HOCHTIEF in the fourth quarter of
each year. In impairment testing, the recoverable amount of a division is compared with its carrying amount.
The recoverable amount for the HOCHTIEF Americas and HOCHTIEF Europe cash-generating units is measured
separately for each unit as value in use. Value in use is the present value of future cash flows expected to arise from a
cash-generating unit. It is determined from an internal Group perspective using the discounted cash flow method.
This is carried out on the basis of cash flow budgets derived from the three-year budget for the detailed planning
horizon as approved by the Executive Board and current at the time of impairment testing. The forecasts incorpo­
rate past experience and expected future market developments. Cash flows are assumed to remain constant in sub­
sequent years. Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is used for cost of capital data. Value in use is first meas­
ured on an after-tax basis by discounting the cash flows with an after-tax WACC determined separately for each
cash-generating unit. The pretax discount rate is then found by iteration for the purposes of the Notes disclosures.
The discount rates used for cash-generating units in impairment testing are between 10.40% and 10.84% before
tax (2014: between 10.40% and 12.20%).
The recoverable amount for the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific cash-generating unit is measured at fair value based on
CIMIC’s stock market valuation.
As in the prior year, comparison of the divisions’ recoverable amounts with their carrying amounts has not revealed
any impairment of goodwill.

There is adequate assurance that the tax loss carryforwards will be realized. German tax loss carryforwards for
which no deferred tax assets have been recognized amount to EUR 486,865 thousand (2014: EUR 696,944 thou­
sand) in respect of corporate income tax and EUR 828,148 thousand (2014: EUR 914,280 thousand) in respect of
German municipal trade tax. The change in the tax loss carryforward figures mainly relates to adjustments made
on the basis of tax audits and subsequent changes that followed as a result.
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

No deferred tax assets have been recognized in relation to interest expense carryforwards in the amount of EUR
373,807 thousand (2014: EUR 321,106 thousand). The change in the interest expense carryforward figures relates
to adjustments made on the basis of tax audits and ongoing changes.
Deferred tax assets are normally recognized for tax-deductible temporary differences if it is probable that taxable
profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilized.
Group companies that generated losses in the past year or previous years have EUR 41,636 thousand (2014: Euro
68,124 thousand) in deferred tax assets resulting from temporary differences or tax loss carryforwards found not
to be impaired.
Deferred tax liabilities totaling a gross amount of EUR 671,082 thousand (2014: EUR 574,836 thousand) are entirely
due to taxable temporary differences, mostly from adjustments to ensure uniform Group-wide compliance with
IFRS valuation principles.

The figure of EUR 1,989,255 thousand (2014: EUR 2,353,481 thousand), representing the gross amount due from
customers for contract work (POC) less progress payments received, relates to construction contracts where con­
tract costs incurred (including shares of contract net profit) exceed progress payments received from customers.
The combined total of POC contract costs (including net profit shares) reported under trade receivables and trade
payables is EUR 5,119,984 thousand (2014: EUR 5,201,642 thousand). The combined total of progress payments
received and offset against the gross amounts due to and from customers for contract work (POC) in the year under
review stands at EUR 3,839,359 thousand (2014: EUR 3,661,481 thousand).
Various fully consolidated companies in the HOCHTIEF Group have been granted service concession or similar
arrangements. These arrangements are mostly accounted for as financial assets and reported as part of gross
amount due from customers for contract work (POC). The service concession arrangements, which are in the social
infrastructure/Europe segment, are agreements to build and modernize, operate, and maintain schools and other

public buildings. Construction work and improvements are on schedule. These activities broke even with sales of
EUR 34,289 thousand (2014: EUR 14,604 thousand). Accordingly, the HOCHTIEF Group companies concerned are
required to perform their obligations under the service concession arrangements and are granted the rights nec­
essary to do so in each case. At the end of the period of a service concession arrangement, the infrastructure to
which the arrangement relates is returned to the public-sector client. The assets associated with a service conces­
sion arrangement generally remain public property for the entire duration of the arrangement. The sole termination
option provided for in the service concession arrangements relates to termination for cause. Some arrangements
have renewal options.
Trade receivables include EUR 606,312 thousand (2014: EUR 532,773 thousand) in contractual retention amounts.
Trade receivables also include properties under development that are subject to restrictions in the amount of EUR

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

By resolution of the Annual General Meeting of May 6, 2015, the Executive Board is authorized, subject to Supervisory
Board approval, in the event of a sale of treasury shares effected by way of an offer to all shareholders, to issue
subscription rights to the shares to holders of warrant-linked and/or convertible bonds issued by the Company or
by any subordinate Group company. Subject to Supervisory Board approval, the Executive Board is also author­
ized to sell treasury shares other than through the stock exchange and other than by way of an offer to all share­
holders, provided that the shares are sold for cash at a price not substantially below the current stock market price
for Company shares of the same class at the time of sale.
The HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft Executive Board is also authorized, subject to Supervisory Board approval and
the conditions set out in the following, to offer and transfer treasury shares to third parties other than through the
stock exchange and other than by way of an offer to all shareholders. Such transactions may take place in the course
of acquisitions of business enterprises in whole or in part and in the course of mergers. They are also permitted for
the purpose of obtaining a listing for the Company’s shares on foreign stock exchanges where it is not yet listed. In
addition, the shares may be offered for purchase by employees or former employees of the Company or its affiliates.
Holders of bonds which the Company or a Group company subordinate to it issues or has issued under the authori­
zation granted at the Annual General Meeting of May 12, 2011 (agenda item 8) may also be issued with the shares
upon exercising the option and/or conversion rights and/or obligations attached to the bonds.
On condition that they be held for at least two years after transfer, the shares may also be transferred to (current or
past) members of the Executive Board of the Company and to (current or past) members of the executive boards
and general management of companies under its control within the meaning of Section 17 of the German Stock Cor­
porations Act (AktG), as well as to current or past employees of the Company or of a company under its control
within the meaning of Section 17 AktG. Such transfers are only permitted for the purpose of settling the transferees’
variable compensation entitlements in place of cash settlement. Further conditions of transfer are detailed in the
resolution. Where shares are issued to members of the Executive Board of the Company, the decision to issue the
shares is taken solely by the Supervisory Board.
Shareholders’ statutory subscription rights to such shares are barred pursuant to Sections 71 (1) 8 and 186 (3) and
(4) of the German Stock Corporations Act (AktG) to the extent that the shares are used in exercise of the authoriza­
tions set out above.
Subject to Supervisory Board approval, the Executive Board is additionally authorized to retire treasury stock with­
out a further resolution of the Annual General Meeting being required for the share retirement itself or its execution.
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

The conditions governing awards of subscription rights and the sale, transfer, and retirement of treasury stock are
set forth in detail in the Annual General Meeting resolution.
By a further resolution of the Annual General Meeting of May 6, 2015, the Company is authorized to acquire treasury
shares in accordance with Section 71 (1) 8 AktG using equity derivatives as well as to exclude shareholders’ rights
to sell shares and subscription rights. This is not intended to increase the volume of shares that may be purchased;
instead, it merely opens the way for other alternatives to purchase treasury shares within and against the upper limit
set in the aforementioned authorization to acquire treasury shares. The Executive Board has been authorized to
acquire options which, when exercised, entitle the Company to acquire shares of the Company (call options). The
Executive Board has been further authorized to sell options which, when exercised by their holders, require the
Company to acquire shares of the Company (put options). Additionally, the shares can be acquired using a combi­
nation of call and put options or forward purchase agreements. The conditions governing the use of equity deriva­
tives to acquire treasury shares and the exclusion of shareholders’ rights to sell shares and subscription rights are
set forth in detail in the Annual General Meeting resolution.

26. Share-based payment
The following Group-wide share-based payment systems were in force for managerial staff of HOCHTIEF Aktien­
gesellschaft and its affiliates in 2015:
Top Executive Retention Plan 2008
The Executive Board resolved in June 2008 to launch a Top Executive Retention Plan 2008 (TERP 2008) for selected
managerial employees.
This plan is based on stock awards and consists of three tranches. The first tranche was granted in July 2008, the
second in July 2009, and the third in July 2010.
The total term of the plan is ten years. The waiting period after the granting of each tranche is three years. The
exercise period is between five and seven years, depending on the tranche.
The conditions stipulate that, after the waiting period, entitled individuals receive for each stock award either a
HOCHTIEF share or, at HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft’s discretion, a compensatory cash amount equal to the
closing price of HOCHTIEF stock on the last stock market trading day before the exercise date. The gain is capped
for each year of the exercise period. The cap rises annually up to a maximum gain at the end of the term. The maxi­
mum gain is set to EUR 160 per stock award for the first tranche, EUR 81.65 for the second tranche, and EUR
166.27 for the third tranche.
The first tranche was exercised in full in 2015.
Long-term Incentive Plan 2010
The Long-term Incentive Plan 2010 (LTIP 2010) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2010 and
is open to Executive Board members and upper managerial employees of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and its
affiliates. Alongside grants of stock appreciation rights (SARs), LTIP 2010 also provided for grants of stock awards.
The SARs can only be exercised if, for at least ten consecutive stock market trading days before the exercise date,
the ten-day average (arithmetic mean) stock market closing price of HOCHTIEF stock is higher relative to the issue
price compared with the ten-day average closing level of the MDAX index relative to the index base (rela­tive perform­
ance threshold) and, additionally, return on net assets (RONA) in the then most recently approved set of consolidated
financial statements is at least 10% (absolute performance threshold). The relative performance threshold is waived
if the average stock market price of HOCHTIEF stock exceeds the issue price by at least 10% on ten consecutive
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

stock market trading days after the end of the waiting period.
Provided that the targets are met, the SARs can be exercised at any time after a four-year waiting period except
during a short period before publication of any business results. When SARs are exercised, the issuing entity pays
out the difference between the then current stock price and the issue price. The gain is limited to EUR 27.28 per SAR.
The LTIP conditions for stock awards stipulated that for each stock award exercised within a two-year exercise period
following a three-year waiting period, entitled individuals received at HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft’s discre­tion either
a HOCHTIEF share or a compensatory cash amount equal to the closing price of HOCHTIEF stock on the last stock
market trading day before the exercise date. The maximum gain was set to EUR 81.83 per stock award.
The plan for the stock awards ended in 2015.

208

Group Report 2015

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Long-term Incentive Plan 2011
The Long-term Incentive Plan 2011 (LTIP 2011) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2011 and is
open to Executive Board members and upper managerial employees of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and its
affili­ates. The conditions do not differ in any material respect from those of LTIP 2010. The gain is limited to EUR
32.67 per SAR and EUR 98.01 per stock award.
Long-term Incentive Plan 2012
The Long-term Incentive Plan 2012 (LTIP 2012) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2012 and is
open to Executive Board members and upper managerial employees of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and its affili­
ates. The plan conditions differ from those of LTIP 2011 in two points:
1. Return on net assets (RONA) as per the most recently approved Consolidated Financial Statements must be at
least 15%.
2. The waiting time for stock awards was extended from three to four years and the total term of the plan accord­
ingly from five to six years.
The gain is limited to EUR 25.27 per SAR and EUR 75.81 per stock award.
Long-term Incentive Plan 2013
The Long-term Incentive Plan 2013 (LTIP 2013) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2013 and is
open to Executive Board members. The plan conditions differ from those of LTIP 2012 in only one point:
The performance target for RONA was replaced with a performance target for adjusted free cash flow. The number
of SARs that can be exercised depends on attainment of the planned value range for adjusted free cash flow. This
value range is set in the business plan for each exercise year.
The gain is limited to EUR 24.61 per SAR and EUR 73.83 per stock award.
Long-term Incentive Plan 2014
The Long-term Incentive Plan 2014 (LTIP 2014) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2014 and is
open to Executive Board members. The plan conditions do not differ in any material respect from those of LTIP 2013.

Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

The gain is limited to EUR 30.98 per SAR and EUR 92.93 per stock award.
Long-term Incentive Plan 2015
The Long-term Incentive Plan 2015 (LTIP 2015) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2015 and is
open to Executive Board members. The plan conditions do not differ in any material respect from those of LTIP 2014.
The gain is limited to EUR 31.68 per SAR and EUR 95.04 per stock award.
Other information
Return on net assets (RONA)
Return on net assets (RONA) indicates how well HOCHTIEF’s assets are performing as an investment and thus
measures the profitability of the HOCHTIEF Group. RONA measures return as a percentage of net assets. For this
purpose, return is defined as operational earnings (EBIT, shown in the Operational Statement of Earnings) plus in­
terest income from the Group’s financial assets. The net assets figure reflects the total capital commitment from
which returns are to be generated.

Group Report 2015

209

The HOCHTIEF Group generated a return on net assets (RONA) of 13.2% in 2015 (2014: 20.3%). RONA thus
­decreased by 7.1 percentage points compared with the prior year.
The conditions of all plans stipulate that on the exercise of SARs or stock awards—and the fulfillment of all other
requisite criteria—HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft normally has the option of delivering HOCHTIEF shares instead of
paying out the gain in cash. Where the entitled individuals are not employees of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, the
expense incurred on exercise of SARs or stock awards is met by the affiliated company concerned.
The quantities of SARs and stock awards granted, expired, and exercised under the plans are as follows:

27. Provisions for pensions and similar obligations
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

Defined benefit plans
Under defined benefit plans, the Company’s obligation is to provide agreed benefits to current and former employees.
The main pension obligations in Germany consist of direct commitments under the current 2000+ pension plan
and deferred compensation plans. The 2000+ plan in force since January 1, 2000 takes the form of a modular
defined contribution plan. The size of the annual pension component depends on employee income and age
(resulting in an annuity conversion factor) and a general pension contribution reviewed by HOCHTIEF Aktiengesell­
schaft every three years and adjusted as necessary. The future pension amount is the sum total of the pension
components earned each year. In isolated instances, length-of-service and final salary pension arrangements are
in existence for executive staff, although except at Executive Board level such arrangements have no longer been
offered since 1995. Benefits comprise an old-age pension, an invalidity pension, and a surviving dependants’
pension, and in almost all cases are granted as a lifelong annuity.

Group Report 2015

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Up to December 31, 2013, employees in Germany additionally had the option of deferred compensation in a com­
pany pension plan. The deferred compensation was invested in selected investment funds. The pension amount is
based on the present value of acquired fund units at retirement, subject to a minimum of the deferred compensation
amount plus an increment that is guaranteed by HOCHTIEF and ranges from 3.50% down to 1.75% p.a. There is a
choice at retirement between a lump sum payment and an annuity for five or six years.
Outside of Germany, there are defined benefit plans at Turner in the USA and HOCHTIEF UK in the United Kingdom.
The plan at Turner was frozen as of December 31, 2003, and no new entitlements can be earned under it. Benefits
comprise an old-age pension, an invalidity pension, and a surviving dependants’ pension. There is a choice at retire­
ment between a lifelong annuity and a lump sum payment. Commitments at Turner also include post-employment
benefits in the form of medical care for pensioners. HOCHTIEF UK has a length-of-service, final salary pension plan.
For each year of service, 1/75th of the eligible final salary is granted as a monthly pension. Benefits comprise an
old-age pension, an invalidity pension, and a surviving dependants’ pension.

Plan assets
There are no statutory or regulatory minimum funding requirements for pension plans in Germany. Domestic pension
obligations are fully funded. The funded plans take the form of a contractual trust arrangement (CTA). The trans­
ferred assets have been administered since January 1, 2015 by an external trustee and serve exclusively to fund
domestic pension obligations. To ensure that final investment decisions continue to be made in-house as in past
years, HOCHTIEF Pension Trust e.V. has set up what is known as the Investment Committee as a new decisionmaking body within the Trust, which is a registered association under German law. The core function of the Invest­
ment Committee is to collectively represent the interests of the trustors vis-à-vis an external trustee with regard to
the administration and investment of their trust assets. The transferred cash is invested in the capital market in
accordance with investment principles set out in the trust agreement and the investment guidelines. The investment
guidelines and decisions are based on the findings of an asset liability matching (ALM) study compiled by outside
specialists at regular intervals of three to five years. This uses Monte Carlo simulation to model the development of
the pension liabilities and other key economic factors over a very long forward horizon and in numerous combina­
tions. Based on the ALM study, a range of criteria are then applied to determine the optimum asset allocation in order
to ensure that pension liabilities can be met in the long term. To assure an optimum conservative risk structure, we
have also established risk overlay management using the services of an external overlay manager who is given a
fixed annual risk budget and works fully autonomously in a clearly structured risk overlay management process.
HOCHTIEF aims to ensure full funding of pension obligations and to fund new vested benefits on the basis of current
service cost annually or at least on a timely basis. The companies pay in additional amounts from time to time in
the event of any shortfall. Pension commitments in Germany in excess of the contribution assessment ceiling applied
in the statutory pension insurance scheme are additionally covered using pension liability insurance. Pension liabilities
from deferred employee compensation are funded by the purchase of retail fund units. Funding of the obligations
served by HOCHTIEF Pension Trust e.V. as of December 31, 2015 is about 61% (2014: 60%); the figure for Germany
as a whole is about 67% (2014: 64%). It should be noted in this connection that the size of pension obligations has
increased significantly in recent years due to the low level of market interest rates and that the funding ratio will sig­
nificantly increase again when interest rates recover.
The frozen defined benefit obligations in the Turner Group are likewise managed in a pension fund. Plan assets are
administered in trust by BNY Mellon and serve exclusively to fund the plan. The trust’s independence is reviewed
annually and attested to by auditors. Investment decisions are not made by the trust but by a special committee.
The investment of plan assets is based on a regularly compiled ALM study. The investment objectives are to maxi­
mize the funding ratio and reduce volatility in the funding ratio. With the pension obligations fully funded, high-risk
investments in equities are to be reduced in favor of fixed-interest bonds. These ideally perform in line with plan
liabilities, thus ensuring full funding. There is no statutory minimum funding requirement, but low funding levels

result in higher contributions to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, and limits to lump-sum payments,
hence maximum funding is aimed for. The funding of obligations covered by plan assets at Turner as of December
31, 2015 is about 87% (2014: 91%); funding at Turner overall is about 71% (2014: 75%). Funding of plan assets at

HOCHTIEF UK is likewise on a trust basis. Statutory minimum funding requirements apply. If funding is insufficient
to make up a funding shortfall, an additional restructuring plan is drawn up. Plan funding is reviewed at least once
every three years. Funding of pension obligations at HOCHTIEF UK is about 81% (2014: 81%).

Actuarial assumptions
The size of pension provisions is determined on an actuarial basis. This necessarily involves estimates. Specifically,
the actuarial assumptions used are as follows:

The discount factors are derived from the Mercer Pension Discount Yield Curve (MPDYC) model, taking into account
the company-specific duration of pension liabilities. Salary and pension increases ceased to be taken into account
in the USA (Turner Group) in 2004 due to the changeover in pension arrangements. Mortality assumptions are based
on published country-specific statistics and experience. Domestically, they are determined using the Prof. Dr. Klaus
Heubeck 2005 G tables. Turner uses the RP 2014 separate annuitant/non-annuitant no collar tables with genera­
tional improvement using scale MP-2014 as published by the Society of Actuaries (SOA); HOCHTIEF UK uses the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

In addition to the expenses recognized in profit or loss, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income
includes EUR 28,516 thousand in actuarial gains recognized in 2015 before deferred taxes and after consolidation
changes and exchange rate adjustments (2014: EUR 157,772 thousand actuarial losses). Before deferred taxes,
the cumulative amount is actuarial losses of EUR 443,071 thousand (2014: EUR 471,587 thousand).
The Turner Group’s obligations to meet healthcare costs for retired staff are included in pension provisions due to
their pension-like nature. The defined benefit obligation as of December 31, 2015 came to EUR 54,350 thousand
(2014: EUR 48,827 thousand). Healthcare costs accounted for EUR 1,785 thousand (2014: EUR 1,416 thousand) of
the current service cost and EUR 2,223 thousand (2014: EUR 2,004 thousand) of the interest expense.
Sensitivity analysis
Pension obligations in the HOCHTIEF Group are subject to various risks. The main risks result from general changes
in interest and inflation rates; there is no unusual risk inherent in the pension obligations.
One major risk is interest rate risk. For defined benefit plans, (notional) contributions are translated into benefits using
a table of fixed interest rates, independent of the current market interest rate. HOCHTIEF thus bears the risk of
general capital market interest rate changes with regard to the determination of benefits. Pension obligations have
increased significantly in recent years due to the generally low level of capital market interest rates. The correspond­
ingly large impact is due to the relatively long term of the obligations.
There is also inflation risk. By law, company pensions in Germany must be raised level with the inflation rate at
least every three years. German company pensions under the 2000+ plan rise at a fixed 1% p.a., hence there is
only minor inflation risk in the pension phase. Turner plans are free from inflation risk as the main defined benefit
plan was frozen and no more adjustments to the company pension are made.
In addition, there is longevity risk. The granting of lifelong pensions means that HOCHTIEF bears the risk of pen­
sioners living longer than actuarial calculations predict. This risk normally cancels out collectively across all pension
plan members and only comes into play if general longevity is longer than expected.
The impact of the stated risks on the defined benefit obligations under a corresponding change in actuarial
assump­tions is shown in the sensitivity analysis that follows.

Defined contribution plans
Under defined contribution plans, the Company pays into a state or private pension fund voluntarily or in accordance
with statutory or contractual stipulations. It has no obligation to pay further contributions.
There are defined contribution plans at Turner, Flatiron, and E.E. Cruz in the USA as well as at CIMIC in Australia.
Depending on length of service and salary level, Turner pays between 3% and 6% of an employee’s salary into an
external fund. In addition, Turner employees have an option to pay up to 25% of their salaries into an investment
fund as part of a 401 (k) plan. Turner matches the first 5% of the deferred compensation by up to 100% depending
on length of service. All employees can join the plan immediately, and are vested in the company’s contributions
after three years’ service. Tax relief is granted on payments into the fund; the investment risk is borne by employees.
The defined contribution plans at Flatiron and E.E. Cruz are likewise 401 (k) plans. All non-union employees are
entitled. Flatiron pays a contribution in the amount of 6.0% of the wage or salary, while E.E. Cruz doubles one-third
of employee contributions, in each case up to the statutory maximum. In Australia, since July 1, 2014 CIMIC has
paid 9.50% (previously 9.25%) of the wage and salary total into the statutory pension (superannuation) scheme. The
contribution rate is expected to rise incrementally up to 12.0% by 2025. Employees have a choice of investment
funds and bear the investment risk. They are able to pay top-up contributions on a voluntary basis. Tax relief is

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

The decline in tax provisions to EUR 89,089 thousand (2014: EUR 437,113 thousand) is mainly due to payments to
the tax authorities in connection with the sale of John Holland and of the services business at CIMIC Group com­
panies Thiess and Leighton Contractors in 2014.
Personnel-related provisions primarily comprise provisions for stock option schemes, long-service awards, leave
entitlements, termination benefits, and early retirement arrangements.
The size of provisions for insurance claims is computed annually by an external actuary.
Items covered by sundry other provisions include contract administration, contract costs incurred subsequent to
invoicing, investment risk, preparation of annual financial statements, payments for damages, and other uncertain
liabilities.

In June 2015, CIMIC repaid a principal amount of USD 298.7 million on the bearer bond issued in November 2012
ahead of schedule as part of a bond buyback program.
Amounts due to banks include a EUR 50,000 thousand portion of a bilateral promissory note loan taken out by
HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft on December 13, 2012. The loan has an initial term of four years and has a fixed
interest rate. Repayment of a promissory note loan issue placed in the market in 2008 with an initial term of seven
years and a nominal amount of EUR 39,000 thousand was completed on schedule at the end of its term on July 4,
2015.
An international banking syndicate provided HOCHTIEF with a credit facility on market terms with a term to April
30, 2019 comprising a EUR 1.5 billion guarantee tranche and a EUR 500,000 thousand cash tranche. As in the
prior year, there are no drawings on the cash tranche as of December 31, 2015.
The sum of EUR 34,914 thousand (2014: EUR 946,146 thousand) of amounts due to banks concerns borrowings

Amounts due to banks at the balance sheet date comprise EUR 111,392 thousand (2014: EUR 1,018,922 thousand)
subject to variable rates of interest and EUR 59,035 thousand (2014: EUR 125,503 thousand) subject to fixed rates
of interest. The average interest rate on the variable-interest portion stood at 2.42% (2014: 2.31%) and the average
interest rate on the fixed-interest portion was 3.84% (2014: 3.72%). The average term was one year (2014: 1.5 years).
Financial liabilities due to companies accounted for using the equity method were EUR 1,000 thousand (2014: EUR
23,307 thousand).
The EUR 171,621 thousand (2014: EUR 198,288 thousand) in lease liabilities mainly relates to plant and equipment
under finance leases at CIMIC.

33. Undiluted and diluted earnings per share
Undiluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the consolidated net profit attributable to the Company’s
stock by the average number of shares in circulation. This indicator can become diluted as a result of potential
shares (mainly stock options and convertible bonds). HOCHTIEF’s share-based payment arrangements do not
have a dilutive effect on earnings. Consequently, diluted and undiluted earnings per share are identical.

of January 1, 2015 (January 1, 2014: 69,309 thousand).
34. Reporting on financial instruments
Financial instruments include financial assets and liabilities as well as contractual claims and obligations relating to
exchanges and transfers of financial assets. Financial instruments can be derivative or non-derivative.
Non-derivative financial assets mostly comprise cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, receivables, and
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

other financial assets. Marketable securities are carried at fair value. The fair values of available-for-sale financial
assets are established with reference to market prices or, in the absence of such prices, determined using accepted
valuation methods.
Non-derivative financial liabilities are mostly current liabilities measured at amortized cost.
According to their fair value, derivative financial instruments are reported either in other receivables and other as­
sets or in other liabilities. Derivatives are used in the HOCHTIEF Group exclusively for hedging existing transactions
and in asset management.

222

Group Report 2015

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Holdings of non-derivative and derivative financial instruments are carried on the balance sheet; the maximum risk
of loss or default is equal to total financial assets. Any such risk identified in respect of financial assets is accounted
for with an impairment loss.
Risk management
All financial activities in the HOCHTIEF Group are conducted on the basis of a Group-wide financial framework
directive. This is fleshed out by individual, function-specific operating directives on issues such as currency and
collateral management. These lay down principles for dealing with the various classes of financial risk.
Trading, control, and settlement activities are divided within Corporate Finance between front, middle, and back
offices. This ensures effective operational risk management in that monitoring and settlement of front office exter­
nal trading activities are performed by a separate and independent back office. All external trading actions are also
subject to at least dual control. Internal authorizations to give instructions are strictly limited in number and mon­
etary amount, and are reassessed at least once a year and adjusted as necessary.
Management of liquidity risk
HOCHTIEF uses predominantly centralized liquidity structures—in particular cash pooling—to pool liquidity at Group
level, among other things to avoid liquidity bottlenecks at the level of individual entities. The central liquidity position is
calculated at regular monthly intervals and budgeted in a bottom-up process over a rolling 18-month period. Liquidity
budgets are supplemented with monthly stress testing. HOCHTIEF uses liquidity budgets in active management of
the securities portfolio and loans portfolio.
The tables below show maximum payments. The tables show the worst-case scenario for HOCHTIEF, i.e. the earliest
possible contractual payment date in each case. Creditors’ rights of termination are taken into account. Foreign
currency items are translated using the closing rate as of the balance sheet date. Interest payments on variable rate
items are translated uniformly using the last interest rate fixed prior to the balance sheet date. Both primary and
derivative financial instruments (for example, forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps) are taken into
account. Credit facilities granted but not yet drawn in their full amount are also included, as are financial guaran­
tees given by the Group.
The maximum payments shown in the following tables (worst case scenario) are offset by contractually fixed receipts
in the same periods that are not shown here (for example, from trade receivables). These cover most of the cash
outflows shown.

The revolving credit facilities include a credit facility tranche with a facility amount of EUR 500,000 thousand under
the syndicated guarantee and credit facility that was extended ahead of term in April 2014 to April 30, 2019. As in
the prior year, the credit facility was undrawn as of December 31, 2015. HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft also has
short-term, bilateral, revolving money market facilities with a total facility amount of EUR 239,000 thousand (2014:
EUR 259,349 thousand); as in the prior year, these are undrawn as of the balance sheet date. Some of the facilities
are subject to creditors’ rights of termination in connection with a financial covenant, which is continuously monitored
as part of corporate planning. In light of the broad international syndication in each instance and the successful
extension of the credit and guarantee facilities in April 2014, there is no refinancing risk with regard to long-term
guarantee and credit facilities. As a further precautionary measure, there is appropriate scope for raising additional
capital under resolutions adopted at the 2011 Annual General Meeting.
HOCHTIEF also has sufficient revolving guarantee facilities, which play an important role for the Group. The guarantee facilities have a total size of EUR 13.96 billion (2014: EUR 12.90 billion) and are 75% drawn (2014: 66%).
Under a legally binding arrangement with banks, financial assets in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division in the amount
of EUR 856,688 thousand (2014: EUR 1,065,540 thousand) and financial liabilities in the amount of EUR 407,601
thousand (2014: EUR 600,576 thousand) are offset and presented in the balance sheet with their net amount of
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

EUR 449,087 thousand (2014: EUR 464,964 thousand).
Management of currency risk
HOCHTIEF is exposed to currency risk (in the form of transaction risk) from receivables, liabilities, cash and cash
equivalents, securities, and pending transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the Group company concerned in each case. Currency derivatives, mainly forward exchange contracts, are used to hedge against
fluctuations in these payments or items caused by exchange rates. HOCHTIEF normally hedges all currency risk.

224

Group Report 2015

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Hedges for Group companies—with the exception of hedges in the CIMIC Group—are mainly administered via
HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. Binding guidelines clarify their use as well as separate controls and responsibilities
for all Group companies. Currency derivatives are normally only used to hedge risk. Any form of speculation is
ruled out under a binding, Group-wide risk directive. The counterparties for derivatives entered into externally are
banks with a top credit rating.
The following table shows the fair values of currency derivatives:

The maximum residual term of currency derivatives in cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2015 is 19 months
(2014: 13 months). As of December 31, 2015, the maximum residual term of currency derivatives for which hedge
accounting is not applied is eleven months (2014: 25 months).
Where hedge accounting is used, unrealized gains and losses on hedges are initially recognized in other compre­
hensive income, taking into account deferred tax. Gains and losses are not realized until a hedged item affects
income. Derivatives are measured on the basis of current market rates as of the balance sheet date. When inter­
preting positive or negative fair value changes relating to derivatives, it is important to remember that they balance
hedged items whose values move in the opposite direction. A net EUR 2,167 thousand was credited to equity in
2015 (2014: EUR 5,019 thousand charged to equity) for market value changes on the above derivatives in cash flow
hedges. Where hedge accounting is not applied, all unrealized gains and losses on the hedged item are recog­
nized immediately in profit or loss; in 2015 this related to a net loss of EUR 2,800 thousand (2014: EUR 1,511 thou­
sand).
The following sensitivity analyses demonstrate the impact on HOCHTIEF Group equity and profit that would result

from a 10% fluctuation in foreign currencies relative to each Group company’s functional currency. The analysis is
based on holdings as of the balance sheet date.

Management of interest rate risk
HOCHTIEF is exposed to interest rate risk through financial items primarily consisting of interest-bearing marketable
securities on the assets side and financial liabilities on the liabilities side of the balance sheet. Two approaches are
used to minimize this risk. Firstly, the Company uses natural hedging, meaning that it eliminates contrary interest
rate risk from primary financial instruments on the asset and liabilities side. The second method is to use interest rate
derivatives. These generally take the form of interest rate swaps used in accordance with the Group annual financ­
ing strategy to manage cash flow risk from changes in interest rates for variable-rate financial items.
As with currency derivatives, hedges for Group companies—with the exception of hedges in the CIMIC Group—
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

are mainly administered via HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. There are also parallel regulations and guidelines, and
derivatives are used solely for hedging (i.e. not speculatively) as a matter of principle. The counterparties for deriva­
tives entered into externally are banks with a top credit rating.

The maximum residual term of interest rate swaps both in cash flow hedges and otherwise in the prior year was 31
months. As of December 31, 2015, the interest rate futures have a maximum residual term of 363 months (2014:
363 months).
An amount of EUR 450 thousand was credited to equity in 2015 (2014: EUR 10,327 thousand) for market value
changes on interest rate derivatives in cash flow hedges. An amount of EUR 595 thousand was reclassified to profit
or loss (2014: EUR 1,190 thousand). There was no hedge ineffectiveness. A net EUR 2,438 thousand was recog­
nized in profit or loss (2014: EUR 2,432 thousand) for market value changes on the remaining interest rate deriva­
tives.
The following sensitivity analyses demonstrate the impact that a one percentage point change in the respective
market interest rate would have had on equity and profit. The analysis is based on holdings as of the balance sheet
date.

Management of other price risk
At HOCHTIEF, other price risk results through investing in current and non-current non-interest-bearing securities,
chiefly shares and funds, that are classified as available for sale and therefore measured at fair value through equity.
Other price risk stems from participating interests that are classified as available for sale to the extent that they are
measured at fair value. Such items are shown in the following table. Participating interests measured at amortized
cost because their fair value cannot be reliably measured are not included.

HOCHTIEF actively manages price risk. Continuous monitoring and analysis of the markets make it possible to
marshal investments at short notice. This allows the Company to detect negative developments on the capital
market at an early stage and take appropriate action. Derivatives are only used to control price risk in exceptional
instances.
To hedge our share-based compensation plans, stock-based derivatives were entered into with a maximum residual
term of 39 months as of December 31, 2015 (2014: 51 months). They are not subject to hedge accounting, but are
deployed as a natural hedge. Gains and losses in the fair value of these derivatives are contained in personnel
costs.
The following table shows the fair values of equity options, stock forward contracts, and index-based options:

charged to profit or loss) for market value changes on equity options, stock forward contracts, index-based options
not in hedges, and on the written options.

Management of credit risk
The HOCHTIEF Group is exposed to credit risk from operations and from certain financing activities.
HOCHTIEF performs risk management for operations by continuously monitoring trade receivables at divisional
level. If a specific credit risk is detected, it is countered by recognizing an individual impairment.
The HOCHTIEF Group has given third parties financial guarantees and loan commitments in respect of Group
companies. Financial guarantees and loan guarantees are only given in respect of companies with top credit

Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

standing, restricting to a minimum the probability of the guarantees being drawn upon.

Group Report 2015

229

The maximum credit risk exposure of financial assets is equivalent to their carrying amounts in the balance sheet.
However, the actual credit risk exposure is lower due to collateral given in favor of the HOCHTIEF Group. The maxi­
mum risk exposure on financial guarantees given by HOCHTIEF is the maximum amount to be paid by HOCHTIEF.
The maximum credit risk for loan commitments is the amount of the commitment. As of December 31, 2015, the
maximum credit risk from financial guarantees and loan commitments amounted to EUR 144,414 thousand (2014:
EUR 193,657 thousand). As of the reporting date, the probability of the financial guarantees and loan commitments
being drawn upon is very small.
HOCHTIEF accepts collateral to secure contract performance by subcontractors, subcontractors’ warranty obli­
gations, and claims to remuneration. Such collateral includes guarantees relating to warranty obligations, contract
performance, advance payments, and receivables. Acceptance of collateral is governed by a HOCHTIEF directive.
Among other aspects, this covers the contractual drafting, implementation, and management of all agreements.
The detailed rules vary according to factors such as the country jurisdiction and applicable case law. In the case of
credit risk, HOCHTIEF examines the credit rating of the party providing the collateral for all guarantees accepted.
HOCHTIEF uses external specialists (for example, rating agencies) to assess credit ratings where possible. The fair
values of accepted collateral are not disclosed as they often cannot be measured reliably.

The age structure of financial assets that are past due is shaped by industry-specific factors. Receipt of payment
depends on acceptance (inspection) and invoice checking, which can often take a relatively long time, especially
for large-scale projects. Most of the unimpaired financial assets that are past due are from public-sector clients

and industrial companies with top credit ratings.

Capital risk management
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

The HOCHTIEF Group manages capital with the aim of ensuring that all Group companies can continue to operate
as a going concern. The Group keeps the cost of capital as low as possible by optimizing the balance between
equity and debt as the need arises. These measures primarily serve to secure the best possible credit standing as
well as to maximize shareholder earnings.
The Group’s capital structure consists of the balance sheet items comprising net debt (current and non-current
liabilities less cash and cash equivalents) and shareholders’ equity. The Risk Reporting Committee assesses and
examines the Group’s capital structure at regular intervals, taking into account the risk-adjusted cost of capital.
In 2015, the overall capital risk management strategy did not change compared with the prior year.

As current financial instruments have short residual terms and are measured at market value, their carrying amounts
correspond to market value as of the balance sheet date. Non-current securities in the available-for-sale category
are measured at fair value through equity and, as such, their carrying amounts also correspond to fair value.
Shares in non-consolidated subsidiaries and other participating interests are measured at fair value if fair value can
be reliably determined. Otherwise, such items are measured at cost in the available-for-sale category.
In the disclosures on the fair value hierarchy for financial instruments measured at fair value, fair value is defined as
the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., the exit price). For non-financial assets,
fair value is measured assuming the highest and best use of the asset by market participants. A three-level hierarchy
is applied that reflects the observability of the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; e.g. quoted securities.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices); e.g. interest rate swaps and forward exchange con­
tracts.
Level 3: No relevant observable inputs available, hence unobservable inputs are determined as an exit price from
the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability; e.g. investments measured at fair
value determined by business valuation.

There were no transfers of assets measured at fair value between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy in
the year under review. This means that there were likewise no changes in Level 3.
The fair value of investments in unlisted entities and of debt instruments not traded in an active market is measured
using the discounted cash flow method. Any discounting is done using current market interest rates.

Of this figure, EUR 158 thousand (2014: EUR 24 thousand) relates to the carrying amounts of non-consolidated
subsidiaries and other participating interests measured at cost where a fair value is not available. In the prior year,
an additional EUR 68 thousand related to the carrying amounts of non-consolidated subsidiaries and other partici­
pating interests measured at fair value. Impairments of EUR 10,864 thousand (2014: EUR 3,490 thousand) were
recorded on non-current financial receivables in 2015. Impairments of EUR 57 thousand (2014: EUR 6,866 thousand)
were recognized for current financial receivables and impairments of EUR 9,127 thousand (2014: EUR 99,526 thou­
sand) were recognized for trade receivables. In the prior year, additional impairments of EUR 457 thousand were

These commitments and potential obligations primarily serve as security for bank loans, contract performance,
warranty obligations, and advance payments. Most guarantees as of the reporting date related to participating
interests and construction joint ventures. HOCHTIEF is also jointly and severally liable for all construction joint ven­
tures in which it has an interest in Germany.
The syndicated credit and guarantee facility for EUR 2 billion taken out in December 2011 and extended ahead of
term in April 2014 continues to be a central long-term financing instrument for HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. The
syndicated facility has a guarantee tranche with a facility amount of EUR 1.5 billion, drawings on which amounted
to EUR 857,719 thousand as of December 31, 2015 (2014: EUR 946,578 thousand), and a EUR 500,000 thousand
cash tranche, which, as in the prior year, is undrawn as of December 31, 2015. The facility permits the furnishing of
guarantees for ordinary activities, mainly of the HOCHTIEF Europe division. The credit and guarantee facility had
an initial term of five years and was extended in April 2014 to April 30, 2019.
In addition, the HOCHTIEF Group has available a further EUR 5.76 billion (2014: EUR 6.05 billion) in guarantee facilities
provided by insurance companies and banks. This includes a three-year syndicated guarantee facility with a total
principal amount of AUD 1 billion (EUR 704,840 thousand) negotiated by CIMIC in May 2013. The facility’s maturity
date was extended in December 2014 by 18 months from initially June 2016 to December 2017. The facility was
undrawn as of December 31, 2015 (2014: drawn by AUD 600,000 thousand/EUR 402,766 thousand).
HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft has provided an unlimited bonding guarantee in favor of U.S. insurance companies
in respect of obligations of the Turner Group and the Flatiron Group. Bonding is a statutory form of security used in
the U.S. to guarantee performance of public projects. It is also used with other selected customers. The total bonding
amount was increased to USD 7,300 million in 2015. An amount of USD 6,491 million was utilized in the year under
review (2014: USD 5,032 million). No recourse has ever been made to this guarantee provided by HOCHTIEF, and
none is currently anticipated for the future. There is also a CAD 350 million syndicated credit facility in favor of Flat­
iron (2014: CAD 240 million) that matures in December 2018, which was drawn down by CAD 147.4 million as of
December 31, 2015 (2014: CAD 74.5 million). This facility is also backed by a Group guarantee from HOCHTIEF
Aktiengesellschaft.

The obligations from operating leases mainly relate to technical equipment and machinery leased by the CIMIC Group.
Lease payments under operating leases came to EUR 280,026 thousand in 2015 (2014: EUR 318,512 thousand).
Several companies in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division have a number of leasing arrangements. The companies
concerned are financed by third parties and HOCHTIEF itself holds neither interests in their equity nor assets such
as loans or receivables. Relevant activities are managed by third parties under contractual agreement, as a result
of which they are not consolidated. The minimum lease payments under operating leases come to EUR 143,184
thousand (2014: EUR 244,789 thousand).
Amounts due under long-term tenancies are EUR 176,665 thousand (2014: EUR 194,499 thousand). The term for
which such tenancies cannot be terminated is between two and twelve years (2014: two and 13 years). The amounts
due under tenancies are partly offset by anticipated rental income of EUR 65,786 thousand (2014: EUR 90,046
thousand).
Other financial obligations include EUR 103,307 thousand (2014: EUR 116,453 thousand) in commitments relating
to shareholder loans and under long-term contracts for the supply of goods and services.

Explanatory notes to the segmental data
Intersegment sales represent revenue generated between divisions. They are transacted on an arm’s length basis.
External sales mainly comprise revenue recognized using the percentage-of-completion method in the mainstream
construction business, construction management, and contract mining, in the amount of EUR 17,965,879 thousand
(2014: EUR 18,448,153 thousand). The sum of external sales and intersegment sales gives total sales revenue for
each division.
The share of profits and losses of equity-method associates and joint ventures comprises income and expenses,
including impairment losses relating to companies accounted for using the equity method.
Depreciation and amortization relate to intangible assets with finite useful lives, property, plant and equipment, and
investment properties.
The impairment losses relate to intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment properties, and financial
assets.
Purchases comprise additions to intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment properties, equitymethod investments (excluding equity-method adjustments), subsidiaries, and other participating interests.
Total assets are equivalent to the divisions’ totals in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Gross debt equals total assets
minus consolidated shareholders’ equity.
Operational earnings (EBIT) are derived from profit from operating activities as follows:

Operational earnings (EBIT)

The method used to calculate EBIT was standardized across the Group in 2015 and the prior-year figures were
restated accordingly. The net income from participating interests included in EBIT now consists exclusively of
earnings from joint ventures. Non-recurring items comprise income and expenses deemed exceptional for busi­
ness management purposes, or resulting from exceptional transactions, or not attributable to the operating busi­
ness. Non-recurring items are mainly attributable to restructuring expenses, exchange rate gains or losses, as well

as income or expenses from asset disposals or arising on deconsolidation. In the previous year, the non-recur­
ring items item was also impacted by an accounting provision to cover default risk on project receivables in the
HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

37. Notes to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows classifies cash flows into operating, investing, and financing activities.
Exchange rate effects are eliminated and their influence on the cash position is disclosed separately. Changes in
cash and cash equivalents due to acquisitions and disposals of consolidated companies are shown separately under
cash used in or provided by investing activities. As in the prior year, the EUR 465,847 thousand decrease (2014:
EUR 309,079 thousand) in cash and cash equivalents due to consolidation changes consists in its entirety of cash
and cash equivalents disposed of in divestments.
The EUR 2,808,707 thousand (2014: EUR 2,585,359 thousand) year-end total for cash and cash equivalents shown
on the cash flow statement matches the cash and cash equivalents item on the balance sheet. The total comprises
EUR 913 thousand (2014: EUR 1,574 thousand) in petty cash, EUR 2,243,934 thousand (2014: EUR 2,316,922
thousand) in cash balances at banks, and EUR 563,860 thousand (2014: EUR 266,863 thousand) in marketable
securities with maturities of no more than three months at the time of acquisition. Cash and cash equivalents to
the value of EUR 110,963 thousand are subject to restrictions (2014: EUR 26,518 thousand).
Cash flow from operations represented a cash inflow of EUR 1,135,206 thousand. The balance of cash flows relating
to capital expenditure and asset disposals/divestments resulted in a EUR 962,907 thousand net cash inflow in cash
flow from investing activities. This reflects the sale of John Holland as well as the Thiess and Leighton Contractors
service business at CIMIC in late 2014, which led to a cash inflow in 2015. The net cash outflow of EUR 2,008,798
thousand in cash flow from financing activities was largely attributable to extensive debt repayment. Including ex­
change rate changes, cash and cash equivalents increased overall by EUR 223,348 thousand.
All non-cash income and expense and all income from asset disposals or arising on deconsolidation is eliminated
in cash flow from operations.
Cash flow from operations included:
• Interest income of EUR 61,736 thousand (2014: EUR 57,272 thousand),
• Interest expenses of EUR 240,247 thousand (2014: EUR 284,606 thousand),
• Income tax paid amounting to EUR 428,899 thousand (2014: EUR 81,792 thousand).
After deducting the non-cash component of income from equity-accounted interests, net income received (as divi­
dends) from such interests was EUR 116,703 thousand (2014: EUR 106,844 thousand).
Divestments relate to the deconsolidation of fully consolidated subsidiaries. This reduced non-current assets by EUR
Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes

832 thousand (2014: EUR 342,708 thousand) and current assets by EUR 548,510 thousand (2014: EUR 1,665,507
thousand). Non-current liabilities decreased by EUR 3 thousand (2014: EUR 60,192 thousand) and current liabilities
by EUR 81,648 thousand (2014: EUR 1,352,758 thousand). As of the balance sheet date, the sale proceeds of EUR
494,008 thousand (2014: EUR 1,067,124 thousand) were settled in full (2014: in the amount of EUR 145,350 thou­
sand) in the form of cash and cash equivalents.
Dividends of EUR 128,926 thousand (2014: EUR 103,964 thousand) were paid to HOCHTIEF’s shareholders in the
year under review. Dividends paid to minority shareholders totaled EUR 107,294 thousand (2014: EUR 108,120
thousand), of which EUR 79,017 thousand (2014: EUR 96,891 thousand) relates to the CIMIC Group.

Net financial assets

The method and criteria used to calculate net financial assets was standardized across the HOCHTIEF Group in the
current year. This mainly affects current financial receivables as well as financial liabilities to associates and sundry
other financial liabilities, which are now included in net financial assets. The prior-year figures were restated accord­
ingly.
In the prior year, the total financial assets of EUR 4,519,595 thousand included, under receivables from the sale of
discontinued operations, proceeds of EUR 1,108,112 thousand from the sale of John Holland and of the services
business at Thiess and Leighton Contractors.
Financial assets are subject to certain restrictions on their use. Other than by financial liabilities, net financial assets
are offset by advance payments from clients, cash call commitments on financial assets, and order exposure from
awarded capital expenditure projects. Advance payments from clients came to EUR 708,630 thousand (2014: EUR
813,320 thousand) and serve to fund contract costs. Cash call commitments on financial assets total EUR 4,209
thousand (2014: EUR 6,009 thousand) and relate to joint ventures in the HOCHTIEF Europe division. The prior-year
figure also included cash call commitments for PPP project companies in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division in the
amount of EUR 13,059 thousand. Group order exposure from awarded capital expenditure projects is EUR 2,468

Executive Board compensation in relation to offices held at Group companies
Peter Sassenfeld received pension awards under Australian law for the services on the CIMIC Board in the amount
of EUR 1 thousand*.

*The euro amount depends on
the exchange rate.

For his services in Australia as CEO of CIMIC, Mr. Fernández Verdes received an expense allowance of EUR 340
thousand* and fringe benefits in the amount of EUR 24 thousand* for 2015. The conditions for exercising the stock
appreciation rights (SARs) granted by CIMIC in 2014 were modified in 2015. Following the waiting period, up to
40% of the SARs—as previously—may be exercised per annum in the first two years of the exercise period. How­
ever, all remaining unexercised SARs may be exercised in the third year of the exercise period. The sole effect of
this amendment to the conditions was the increase of the fair value as of the grant date by EUR 2.1 million*. Neither
the basis of calculation nor the maximum value of the SARs was altered as a result of the amendment.
Further compensation for the holding of office on the boards of other companies in which HOCHTIEF has a direct
or indirect interest are either not paid out to the Executive Board members or are set off against their Executive

Independent Auditors’ Report
We have audited the consolidated financial statements—comprising Group statement of earnings, consolidated
statement of comprehensive income, Group balance sheet, statement of cash flows, statement of changes in equity,
and notes to the consolidated financial statements, prepared by HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen/Germany,
as well as the group management report, which has been combined with the parent company’s management
­report for the financial year from January 1, to December 31, 2015. The preparation of the consolidated financial
statements and the group management report in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS), as applicable in the EU, and the regulations under German commercial law as complementarily applicable
under § 315a (1) German Commercial Code (HGB) is the responsibility of the Company’s Executive Board. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the group management report
based on our audit.
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with § 317 German Commercial
Code (HGB) in compliance with German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promul­
gated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit such that misstatements materially affecting the presentation of the net assets, finan­
cial position and results of operations in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with applicable ac­
counting regulations and in the group management report are detected with reasonable assurance. Knowledge of
the business activities and the economic and legal environment of the Group and evaluations of possible misstate­
ments are taken into account in the determination of audit procedures. The effectiveness of the accounting-related
internal control system and the evidence supporting the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and
the group management report are examined primarily on a test basis within the framework of the audit. The audit
includes assessing the annual financial statements of the companies included in consolidation, the determination
of the companies to be included in consolidation, the accounting and consolidation principles used and significant
estimates made by the Executive Board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial
statements and the group management report. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Our audit has not led to any reservations.
In our opinion, which is based on the results of our audit, the consolidated financial statements of HOCHTIEF
Aktiengesellschaft, Essen/Germany, comply with the IFRS, as applicable in the EU, and the regulations under Ger­

man commercial law as complementarily applicable under § 315a (1) German Commercial Code (HGB) and con­

these regulations. The group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, conveys,
in the aggregate, a true and fair view of the Company’s and Group’s position and suitably presents the risks and
opportunities of future development.

Focus Area:
Resource Protection

In my world,
the environment
stays intact.
Craig Tucker
Group Environment Manager,
CPB Contractors (CIMIC)

In all of our projects, we work to protect the environ­
ment. And the railway upgrades between Kingsgrove
and Revesby in Sydney were no exception. Among other
things, this involved expanding the section to four tracks
and constructing a number of rail bridges. As the prin­
cipal contractor representing a consortium, CPB Con­
tractors assumed responsibility for all aspects of the
project including safety, environmental protection, and
community consultation—all while trains continued to run.
The consortium worked closely with the planning author­
ities, putting in place compensatory measures to main­
tain biodiversity. In the process, we ensured that our
bridge work didn’t impact the protected mangroves at
Salt Pan Creek. What’s more, right from the earliest
stages of the project, we consulted with industry ex­
perts about initiatives to conserve resources. That cre­
ated a wealth of ideas, most of which were ultimately
implemented. For instance, our team installed solar
panels on the temporary noise barriers to generate green
electricity.

CIMIC Group company CPB Contractors (formerly Leighton
Contractors) formed part of an alliance that successfully
expanded the railway line between Kingsgrove and Revesby
in Sydney, including building a bridge over Salt Pan Creek.

Further Information

This project was the first in Australia where we built a
bridge incrementally, meaning that we were able to leave
the sensitive nearby waterway virtually untouched. When
the 165-meter-long bridge was completed, the creek was
returned to its original state—as nature intended.

Independent Assurance Report
To HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen
Our Engagement
We have been engaged to perform a limited review of the materiality analysis, management approaches and quantitative and qualitative information in the chapter “Sustainability at HOCHTIEF” in the Group Report (hereinafter: the
report) of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen (hereinafter: HOCHTIEF), for the business year starting January 1,
2015, to December 31, 2015. It was not part of our engagement to review any product or service related statements,
any links to external sources, future-looking statements or statements from external experts.
Management’s Responsibility
The Company’s Executive Board is responsible for the accurate preparation of the report in accordance with the
criteria stated in the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines G4 of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).
This responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the report as well as the
usage of reasonable assumptions and estimates for individual sustainability disclosures. Furthermore, the responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining systems and processes relevant for the preparation of
the report in a way that it is free of – intended or unintended – material misstatements.
Our Independence and Quality Control
We have met the requirements regarding independence along with the additional requirements relating to professional conduct of the IESBA Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, which is based on the fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional conduct worthy
of the profession.
The quality assurance system of Deloitte & Touche GmbH is based on the International Standard on Quality Control 1 “Quality Control for Audit, Assurance and Related Service Practices” (ISQC 1) and, in addition on national
statutory requirements and professional standards, especially the Professional Code for Certified Accountants as
well as the joint statement of WPK (Chamber of Public Accountants) and IDW (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany): Requirements for quality assurance in the auditing practice (VO 1/2006).
Practitioner’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion based on our work performed and the evidences obtained on the
above mentioned information of the report.
Procedures and extend of the assurance engagement
We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000
(Revised): “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information”. This standard
requires that we comply with our professional duties and give an attestation, based on the results of our work, as
to whether any matters have come to our knowledge that could give rise to the assumption that the sustainability
information as stated in the Group Report 2015 does not comply, in all material respects, with the above mentioned
criteria of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines G4 of the GRI. In a limited assurance engagement the evidence
gathering procedures are more limited than in a reasonable assurance engagement. Hence, the scope of a limited
review is less comprehensive and may not reasonably assure all material facts as could a reasonable assurance.
The selection of audit activities is subject to the auditor’s own judgement. This includes the assessment of the risk

Further Information

of material misstatement in the report under consideration of the GRI reporting criteria.

256

Group Report 2015

Within the scope of our work, we performed amongst others the following procedures when conducting the limited
assurance engagement:
• Interviewing employees at group level in order to gain an understanding of the process for determining material
sustainability topics and the stakeholder engagement process of HOCHTIEF
• Interviews with relevant staff at group level responsible for providing the data and information, carrying out internal
control procedures and consolidating the data and information, including the explanatory notes
• Analytical procedures on relevant data
• Comparison of selected data with corresponding data in the HOCHTIEF consolidated financial statement and
management report
• Evaluation of information on selected sustainability performance measurements
Our Conclusion
Based on our limited review, nothing has come to our knowledge that could give rise to the assumption that the infor­
mation of the materiality analysis, management approaches and quantitative and qualitative sustainability information
as stated in the Group Report for the business year starting January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2015 of HOCHTIEF,
Essen, does not comply with the criteria of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines G4 of the GRI.
Recommendations
Without qualifying our conclusion above, we make the following recommendations for the further development of
the company‘s sustainability management and sustainability reporting:
• Continuing cross-functional data gathering within the entire group using a centralized software system
• Focusing on performance relevant KPI systems
• Further linking of financial and non-financial performance indicators
This assurance report is issued based on an assurance engagement agreed upon with HOCHTIEF. The assurance
engagement to obtain limited assurance is issued for the purposes of HOCHTIEF and the report is intended solely
to inform HOCHTIEF of the results of the assurance engagement. This assurance report is not intended as a basis
for (financial) decision-making by third parties of any kind. We have responsibility only towards HOCHTIEF. We do not
assume any responsibilities for third parties.

Forward-looking statements
This Group Report contains forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the current views, expectations and assumptions of the Executive Board of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft concerning
future events and developments relating to HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and/or the HOCHTIEF Group and are based on information currently available to the Executive Board of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties and do not guarantee future results (such as profit before tax or consolidated net profit) or developments (such as with regard to possible ­future divestments, general business activities or business strategy). Actual results (such as profit before tax or consolidated net profit), dividends and other developments (such as with regard to possible ­future divestments, general business activities or business strategy) relating to HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and the HOCHTIEF Group may therefore differ materially from the expectations and assumptions described or
implied in such statements due to, among other things, changes in the general economic, sectoral and competitive environment, capital market developments, currency exchange rate fluctua­tions, changes
in international and national laws and regulations, in particular with respect to tax laws and regulations, the conduct of other shareholders, and other factors. Any information provided on dividends is additionally subject to the recognition of a corresponding unappropriated net profit in the published separate financial statements of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft for the fiscal year concerned and the adoption by the competent decision-making bodies of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft of appropriate resolutions taking into account the prevailing situation of the Company. Aside from statutory publication
obligations, HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft does not assume any obligations to update any forward-looking statements.
