Foreword by the executive Board

Executive Board (from left): Julio Tellechea, Christian Flach, Claus-Georg Nette

Dear readers,
The alignment of our business activities with our corporate philosophy – independent, sound,
individual – proved itself as a guarantor for a successful performance again during the past year. In a

G4-1,
G4-2

year full of moving events, economic uncertainty, and political and humanitarian crises, it paid to act
with a sense of proportion true to this philosophy, and to continue on our course of controlled growth.
To continue to stay abreast of our internal growth and the changing external market requirements,
at the turn of the year 2014/2015 we carried out a reorganization. In combination with our proven
business model and solid financial resources, we can continue to ensure a high degree of stability as
an employer for our staff and as a market participant for our business partners and customers.
Our successful strategy of controlled growth has also been borne out by energy sector forecasts,
which cause us to keep our business on a broad basis with oil, gas, coal and renewable energies. We
have integrated sustainability into our strategic approach and put this value into practice in the form
of policies and programs that are part of our sustainability management. As a family-owned business,
we feel a special responsibility towards our colleagues and the local communities near our facilities.

05

Our core business of handling and trading valuable, mostly fossil resources, also requires a special
sense of responsibility towards the environment. We have committed to using energy and raw materials
efficiently, to avoiding environmental pollution, and thereby to limit negative impacts as far as
possible.
2014 marked the end of the United Nations “Decade of Education for Sustainable Development,”
which aimed to anchor the guiding principle of sustainable development in all areas of education. In
2014, we continued to pursue our goal of improving education and training opportunities by doubling
our trainee places, especially at Oiltanking in India. We were also able to achieve last year’s goal of
increasing our employees’ and contractors’ safety awareness with the introduction of our comprehensive contractor safety program. Beyond this, as planned, we further analyzed our value chain and
advanced our stakeholder management with the implementation of a global stakeholder survey on
sustainability issues. The results are published in this report and are used for the further development
of our sustainability strategy.
We wish you an enjoyable read!
Hamburg, August 2015

Aviation Fuelling >> Skytanking
Skytanking is one of the few international companies that cover the entire range of fuelling services

G4-8

at airports. The company is now the largest independent supplier of aviation fuelling services in
Europe. Beyond Europe, Skytanking was present at airports in India and South Africa as of
31 December 2014, and employed an average of 1,154 people (2013: 1,387). Following a thorough
analysis, Skytanking withdrew from the U.S. market at the beginning of 2014 for strategic reasons.

Into-plane Services
Skytanking continued to expand in 2014. In addition to the acquisition of all shares in the Munich
and Vienna sites, which were previously operated as joint ventures, three new locations were added:
Klagenfurt, Linz and Hamburg. The strongest growth in terms of volume was achieved in India, where
Skytanking is now active in Mumbai, the country’s second largest airport, as well. At year-end 2014,
this gave Skytanking a presence at 42 airports in ten countries, where it fuelled more than 1.2 million
aircraft. Throughput rose to around 13.2 billion liters.

Aviation Fuel Storage & Hydrant Management
Besides aviation fuelling, Skytanking operates and maintains airport fuel storage and hydrant systems,
both its own and those owned by third parties.

Dry Bulk Handling >> UBT
G4-8

UBT specializes in the storage and handling of bulk materials like coal and pet coke and currently
operates two facilities in the United States. The facility at Davant, Louisiana, is the largest export
terminals for coal and pet coke at the U.S. Gulf Coast. The facility in Corpus Christi, Texas, handles pet
coke for refineries and sulfur. At year-end, UBT had a total storage capacity of 4.0 million tons and had
transshipped a total of 9.3 million tons. UBT has been a wholly owned Marquard & Bahls subsidiary
since December 2014.

Upstream Services >> Newsco
Newsco, in which Marquard & Bahls holds the majority of shares since September 2014, offers
directional drilling services and measurement while drilling (MWD). Its service spectrum also includes
the development of measurement sensors and special software, as well as the construction of drilling
motors. Beyond the drilling equipment, Newsco also provides its clients with the staff required to
operate it. In addition to the company headquarters in Houston, Newsco operates three other sites in
North America – in Conroe, Casper and Calgary. Newsco has realized projects in numerous countries
in Asia, South America, the Middle East and Europe. Currently the company has international operation centers in Peru and India.

Renewable Energies >> Mabagas
Mabagas was founded in late 2008 to realize biogas projects in the German and international markets.
These projects generate energy from organic residuals and waste to avoid competing with food
production. In 2014, the company employed an average of 49 employees in Germany and India.

Biogas Plants
The services offered by Mabagas range from project planning, financing and construction to
the operation of plants. The biogas plant in Bardowick, Germany, acquired by Mabagas in 2012,
specializes in recycling organic waste according to the German regulation for organic waste
(BioAbfV). The biogas plant in Namakkal, India, which went into operation at the end of 2012, uses
only organic waste in the form of poultry manure and residues from the sugar industry.

Bio-CNG
Mabagas currently sells compressed biomethane (CNG – compressed natural gas) at eleven service
stations. Against the backdrop of climate change, Bio-CNG is not only a particularly cost-effective,
but also an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional fuels.

Carbon Trading >> Carbonbay
The carbon offset project portfolio developed as part of emissions trading was pooled in the newly

G4-8

founded company Carbonbay at the end of 2013. Since then, the company’s focus has been on
realigning the existing portfolio for the voluntary emissions market and developing a new sales
strategy for the climate protection projects. The portfolio, which also includes the IOT Mabagas biogas
plant in Namakkal, India, currently comprises 19 programs with 49 individual projects in ten countries
around the world, including Honduras, Peru, Brazil, Costa Rica, Tanzania, India and Vietnam.

Fuel Analysis >> GMA
The quality of its products and services is of crucial importance for Marquard & Bahls. Therefore,
the company is involved in fuel analysis and quality management through its subsidiary, GMA. GMA’s
services include the analysis of fossil and biogenic fuels as well as technical support. In addition, the
company is involved in the development of product standards. GMA has its own DAkkS (German
Accreditation Service) accredited laboratory. Its services also include consultation on fuel additives
and the development of customized solutions related to additives.

Gas Supply >> natGAS
To meet the growing demand for gas supply, in 2000 Marquard & Bahls became the second-largest
founding shareholder in natGAS, a gas supplier based in Potsdam, Germany. natGAS has expanded
its market position through long-term agreements for gas supply and by gaining new customers, and
today is one of the leading independent market participants in Germany. In addition to gas and electricity supply, the company focuses on offering custom solutions for cost-effective energy supply for
major customers such as industrial companies, public utilities and power plant operators. natGAS is
expanding its business internationally, mainly in Belgium, France, Switzerland and Austria.

chain, namely trading, transport, storage, handling and retail. We are involved in the upstream sector
only through our subsidiary Newsco, which offers horizontal directional drilling and develops drilling
technology. Our subsidiaries are neither active in extraction nor in refining.

The repercussions of our activities can have environmental as well as social

relevance. We take this fact into account by focusing on the goals of sustainable
development in our activities.

We have formally anchored the topic of sustainability in our values at the holding company level
and have integrated it into our strategic approach.

Strategic Approach
G4-56

In the past years, Marquard & Bahls has seen rapid growth. Not only has its portfolio changed and
expanded significantly, the market environment has also changed dramatically. Due to these developments we revised our business strategy two years ago. Our Vision & Mission determines the longterm policy for Marquard & Bahls. Together with our philosophy, priorities and values they form our
strategic approach, which applies for the entire group. Due to its comprehensive significance our
Vision & Mission has been included in our revised Code of Conduct.

employee workshops to further illustrate our values and bring them to life using examples from the
daily business.

Organizational Structure
Marquard & Bahls is governed by an Executive Board, which is supported by a Supervisory Board as
an advisory and monitoring body. The Executive Board determines the company’s strategy and regularly updates the Supervisory Board on the company’s situation and performance. A lively, consultative

G4-6,
G4-7,
G4-13,
G4-34

exchange on all the major matters at hand takes place between the two bodies. The Supervisory
Board also approves key corporate decisions, such as major investments. The Group Management
Committee (GMC) is a further body that supports the Executive Board in an advisory capacity in
selected areas. Besides the Executive Board the Managing Directors of Oiltanking, the Directors of the
three Mabanaft Divisions and Managing Directors of Skytanking, UBT and Newsco sit on the GMC, as
do the heads of important central departments at Marquard & Bahls.
To do justice to the increasing number of business divisions, the more complex market environment,
and future growth, a new organizational structure was introduced in 2014. A second management
tier was set up across the Group, which enables Marquard & Bahls to more effectively put its strategy
into practice, as well as flexibly and quickly integrate new business activities. This allows the Executive
Board, consisting of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO – Christian Flach), the Chief Financial Officer
(CFO – Claus-Georg Nette) and the new position of Chief Operating Officer (COO – Julio Tellechea),
to concentrate on strategic issues and important business decisions. The new structure creates
commercially oriented business units of a manageable size, with expanded entrepreneurial
decision-making powers.
Oiltanking is jointly managed by two Managing Directors who are each responsible for different
geographic areas. The trading organization Mabanaft is structured into three business units –
Mabanaft Trading, Mabanaft Retail and Mabanaft Bunkering – each headed by the respective Directors. UBT, with its U.S. sites in Davant and Corpus Christi, and Newsco are independent divisions
directly under Marquard & Bahls. There were neither changes to the organizational structure at the
Skytanking division nor at GMA, Mabagas, Carbonbay or natGAS.

Responsible Leadership
G4-DMA

Good corporate governance has a direct influence on our reputation. Safeguarding it is a high priority
for us, so we have developed various guidelines and procedures to preserve it and prevent noncompliant actions. They include our Code of Conduct and the group-wide internal whistleblowing
system, along with a Compliance team and procurement guidelines.

Code of Conduct
Our Code of Conduct is based on 16 topics, which are divided into four chapters:

Code of Conduct
Business & Finance

Safeguards

Integrity

People

Legal Compliance

Health, Safety, Security &
Environment

Corruption & Bribery

Discrimination

Fair Competition

Product Responsibility

Gifts & Entertainment

Equal Opportunity

Accounting & Financial
Reporting

Use of
Corporate Resources

Conflicts of Interest

Social Responsibility

Intellectual Property

Confidentiality

Political Activities

Labor Standards

Fig. 3: The 16 topics of the Code of Conduct

The principles of the Code of Conduct provide a uniform set of values, along with guidance for
how individuals are expected to behave in the context of the Marquard & Bahls philosophy.
In 2014, the Code of Conduct was amended to include the strategic approach of Marquard &
Bahls, and made accessible to all employees worldwide. It can be downloaded from our website
(www.marquard-bahls.com) in 20 languages.
Our group-wide internal whistleblowing system with a Compliance team intervenes in cases of
non-compliance with the code. This central system gives all employees worldwide a tool for reporting violations of the Code of Conduct, while allowing them to remain anonymous if they wish. Every
reported incident is investigated thoroughly. The Executive Board is informed of the nature of
reported incidents and the status of the investigation, but is not given any information regarding

22

Marquard & Bahls

Sustainability Report 2014

personal details. In 2014, two whistleblowing cases were reported that involved criticism of the leadership style of executives, and turned out to be unjustified. In the third reported case it was alleged

G4-LA16,
G4-SO5

that an employee was receiving personal benefits from procurement processes. An internal audit was
able to rebut the facts of the case.

Behavioral Guidelines
In addition to the Code of Conduct, there are other specific guidelines. For instance, our social
media guideline helps employees to communicate on social media effectively and in line with legal
requirements.
We want to ensure fair competition, even in very competitive markets, by defining basic values,
codes of behavior and responsibilities. Procurement plays an important role especially at
Oiltanking and Skytanking, where materials are needed for the construction or expansion of
terminals as well as for technical equipment. In accordance with our formal procurement guidelines, staff is obliged to promote fair and transparent competition, avoid any kind of personal
obligations to vendors, act honestly and report all forms of malpractice to their supervisors and/
or the company management. Our standards are asserted by imposing sanctions on suppliers
who violate our Code of Conduct. As a further tool to ensure fair competition, an international
procurement and contracting training program has been carried out with the relevant employees
for many years.

Legal Compliance
We see compliance with the law as a matter of course. Both national and international laws and
regulations are important in this connection. Legal developments are monitored and reviewed
for their relevance for Marquard & Bahls. One important indicator of regulatory compliance is the
number of fines and penalties, with fines over 1,000 euros defined as material. In 2014 we were fined

G4-DMA,
G4-EN29,
G4-EN34,
G4-SO8,
G4-PR9

a worldwide total of 308,906 euros (2013: 13,976 euros) for non-compliance with laws and regulations. Four cases, which accounted for 3 percent of the fines, were in connection with environmental
infringements, such as fines for minor product releases. 97 percent were incurred as part of a fine –
for non-compliance with laws and regulations as part of an audit by the Dutch authorities – imposed
on our tank terminal in Amsterdam (BRZO – Besluit Risico’s Zware Ongevallen 1999). Because of this,
in 2014 we did not achieve our sub-goal of reducing our fines compared to the base year of 2011
(18,100 euros). Our target for the year ahead is to achieve a ten-percent reduction in fines compared
to the base year of 2011.

Strategy & Sustainability

23

The products traded, transported, handled, and stored by our group are subject to national and
international i.e. European legislation, and must therefore comply with hazard communication provisions, including accurate product labeling and the provision of safety data sheets at Mabanaft. Most
of the products traded by Mabanaft are classified as hazardous and are therefore subject to strict
product information requirements. In addition, Oiltanking maintains a central database for product
information, which now contains data for more than 1,000 products.

Anti-Corruption
G4-DMA,
G4-SO3,
G4-SO4

Marquard & Bahls does not tolerate corruption and bribery. In our Code of Conduct, we inform
employees about our principles in this matter and call on them to report specific cases of or concerns
about possible corruption to our Compliance team. To further increase our employees’ awareness of
corruption, we have carried out customized training programs for years.
To preclude corruption from the outset, we subject our sites to an annual risk analysis in accordance
with the classifications of the Transparency International Corruption Perception Index. In countries
with a high risk of corruption, we are stepping up our activities, although our revenues are largely
generated in low-risk countries.

Highly Corrupt

No Data

Transparency
The comprehensive disclosure of relevant information to our employees and other stakeholders
is a high priority. At group level, this task is the responsibility of our HSSE & Corporate Communication Department, in close coordination with the Executive Board and the respective Directors or
Managing Directors. New developments and important company information are regularly communicated through the “Logbook,” a monthly newsletter for employees, emailings and notices posted
on our bulletin boards. Beyond this, we communicate with our employees through in-house
magazines like COMPASS (Marquard & Bahls), connections (Oiltanking), Skytanking Life (Skytanking), and
OIL! INSIDE (OIL! Tankstellen), and on digital employee portals. Press releases and other publications
can be found on the company websites that are also accessible to external users.
Another important area where transparency represents a basic principle is privacy and data protection. At Marquard & Bahls, this topic is the responsibility of the HSSE & Corporate Communication
Department. Important measures in Germany in this area include providing an extensive Data
Protection Manual, and carrying out staff training, topical consultation and audits. In addition, the
latest legislative initiatives are continually monitored in order to ensure present and future
compliance with data protection laws.
At an international level, the data protection laws of all countries where Marquard & Bahls is active are
analyzed. Extensive IT security systems ensure high-grade protection of employee, customer, supplier,
and other business data.

Sustainability Management
In defining our strategy, sustainability was deliberately anchored as a binding value for our company.
We are aware of the potential impact of our business activities on people and the environment, and

G4-34,
G4-DMA

therefore try to integrate the principle of sustainable development in all our activities and to promote
the welfare of our employees, the environment, and the surrounding communities.
In accordance with our core business, our sustainability management focuses on the areas of Health,
Safety, Security & Environment (HSSE), and is therefore based on the activities coordinated by the
HSSE & Corporate Communication Department. All of the larger Marquard & Bahls companies,
especially Oiltanking and Skytanking, have a designated local HSSE manager to supervise all HSSErelated topics and questions. There is a separate Sustainability team within the HSSE & Corporate
Communication Department. It pools all related activities and further develops them in close coordination with local HSSE managers.

Sustainability issues are reported directly to the CEO and GMC via the Head of the HSSE & Corporate

Fig. 5: Integration of sustainability in the management approach

Our long-term goal is to more firmly mainstream our centrally defined sustainability management
worldwide, and to lend a greater impact to sustainability activities developed at local level. In the
regions Asia Pacific and Latin America we have already appointed Corporate Responsibility (CR)
coordinators to advance the issue locally. We will successively transfer this model to other regions.

Our Stakeholders
We have identified our most important stakeholders through internal discussions, workshops,
external analyses, and industry comparisons. Depending on the stakeholder both the frequency of
contact with stakeholders and the relevant issues vary. While contact with employees, shareholders,

customers or business partners usually takes place on a daily or weekly basis, with other stakeholders
it is less frequent.

Our internal Stakeholder Management Guideline serves to make our stakeholder dialog more
systematic. A web-based stakeholder survey was drawn up in 2014 and carried out in the first quarter of 2015. The survey is designed to complement the dialogs that have been conducted at holding
company and local level since 2011. The results have been incorporated into the compilation of this
report, and will be taken into account as we pursue our goal of further developing the CR strategy.

Materiality Analysis
G4-18,
G4-27

To identify the issues that are relevant for our sustainability efforts, we monitor changes in legal
requirements and relevant standards, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). In addition,
we survey our stakeholders about what issues are important to them. In a materiality analysis, we
periodically evaluate the significance of the aspects identified with our own assessment of their importance, in order to determine the issues we focus on. Apart from identifying significant expectations
and requirements, the future opportunities and risks for our business and the affected stakeholders
are an important focus.

138 of our 320 randomly selected stakeholders participated in the anonymous online survey, representing a response rate of 43 percent. Stakeholders of Oiltanking, Mabanaft and Marquard & Bahls
were most strongly represented, with close to 30 percent each. Most of the participants came from

G4-18,
G4-26,
G4-27

Germany and Europe, followed by Asia Pacific with nearly 17 percent and Latin America with just over
7 percent. Over half of the respondents were employees, followed by business partners at around
19 percent, and customers at just under 14 percent. Other stakeholders were only represented to a
very minor extent.
Environmental protection was rated as exceedingly material, followed by social responsibility and
community involvement – often in conjunction with local activities. Our stakeholders feel that it is
increasingly important to assume responsibility across the supply chain. In open response fields,
topics such as good corporate governance in connection with corporate values in action, transparency, and the development of new lines of business in the renewable energy sector were mentioned
in particular.
Respondents saw opportunities for the company in the action areas above, especially in a commitment to renewable energy. Risks were mentioned especially in the area of HSSE, which was assessed
as highly relevant. Some of the potential repercussions of the action areas classified as material are in
the workplace, such as with the issue of corporate social responsibility, and some are predominantly
external, as with the topics of community involvement and environmental protection. Figure 7 illustrates the topics assessed as especially important.
The survey results will be incorporated into our ongoing strategy process. Our materiality analysis,
which has been updated based on the evaluation, will be supplemented in the year ahead with more
findings from qualitative research.
In a next step, we checked the topics we had identified against the GRI G4 aspects, and created a
selection of the indicators that are material for us and thus to be included in the reporting. Unlike last
year, immaterial aspects, such as materials in the “ecological” category or child labor in the “human
rights” category, are no longer reported in this edition.

Sustainability Issues
G4-19

As a business that operates in the fields of energy supply, trading and logistics, the following strategic
core issues determine our success:


Ensuring health and safety at work



Spill prevention



Climate protection



Education and training



Welfare of the communities we operate in or near to

Using the process described above, we have broken the core issues out into other, more detailed
sustainability topics. Together they form our “Temple of Corporate Responsibility,” which is shown in
figure 8.

So our corporate responsibility efforts can be divided into four areas that cover the full spectrum of
topics we see as our sustainability priorities. The following chapters of this Sustainability Report are
structured according to these areas. The temple should be regarded as a dynamically developing
structure, since we keep examining the relevance of existing and new issues as part of our sustainability management. As part of such a review, we have now redefined the area of corporate governance
as the foundation of the temple – rather than as a column – since good governance is the foundation
of our sustainability management.

Other INSTRUMENTS & Measures
We use various instruments and measures to anchor the aforementioned key strategic issues

G4-14

(ensuring health and safety at work, spill prevention, climate protection, education and training and
welfare of the communities we operate in or near to) in our global activities.

HSSE Policy:
To firmly establish responsibility for environmental and social concerns at the highest level, the
relevant principles are reflected in our HSSE Policy, which was ratified by the Marquard & Bahls
Executive Board. The managements of all subsidiaries worldwide have also signed corresponding
corporate HSSE policies and displayed them on the premises.

Guidelines and Standards:
We develop our internal policies and standards based on internationally recognized principles of
responsible entrepreneurship. The basis for this is our binding Code of Conduct for all employees.
Furthermore, we respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the eight core labor
standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO). We will further embed the ten principles
of the UN Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises as well as the principles of the German Corporate Governance Code in our processes, even if we are not yet an active
signatory. We have set ourselves the target of signing the compliance statement of the German
Sustainability Code in 2015.

Audits:
We use internal HSSE audits to continually improve our performance and review our progress in
the areas of Health, Safety, Security & Environment. On behalf of the Executive Board, the HSSE &
Corporate Communication Department monitors Oiltanking , Skytanking and UBT locations worldwide for their compliance with company standards. In 2014, Oiltanking, Skytanking, Petronord,
and OIL! underwent a total of 181 internal and Oiltanking and Skytanking 254 external audits – the
latter included audits by authorities, customers, and insurance companies.

Strategy & Sustainability

31

Key Performance Indicators:
Key performance indicators (KPIs) are another tool used to audit and improve the system. Detailed
HSSE statistics with “leading” (forward-looking) and “lagging” (retrospective) indicators are prepared
for the group and for many units. Furthermore, indicators such as near misses, accident rate, and
product spills are a bonus-related element of management remuneration at Oiltanking.

Certified Management Systems:
In 2014, a total of 43 of the 75 operative Oiltanking locations worldwide (57 percent) have
been certified for quality management (ISO 9001), 25 locations (33 percent) for environmental
management (ISO 14001) and 21 locations (28 percent) for health and safety management (OHSAS
18001). In total 21 locations have triple certification. The remaining locations have not had any
of their quality, environmental or occupational health and safety management systems certified.
At Skytanking too, ten of the 44 locations have now been certified in accordance with ISO 9001
(23 percent); eight of these (18 percent) have also had their environmental management systems
certified to ISO 14001. These management systems have been developed to continuously increase
the effectiveness and efficiency of the business processes. Several other Marquard & Bahls companies have organized their management processes in a very similar way.

Involvement in Associations & Politics
G4-16

In the work done by our Hamburg-based Public Affairs Department, we use existing networks to
campaign e.g for the development and implementation of industry-wide sustainability standards in
various national and international associations and organizations. They include the following:

The Public Affairs Department therefore focuses on association work and energy policy. In this

G4-16

connection, we actively participate in debates with decision makers, and work closely with the relevant
associations. Furthermore, the department communicates the role of oil as an energy source, and the
position of small and medium-sized oil companies to the outside. There is a particularly great need
for information on oil logistics, which is met among other things by organizing visits to tank terminals
for representatives from government and ministries. The implementation of the EU Energy Efficiency
Directive into German law – and the resulting obligations for our company to establish management
systems for energy efficiency or carry out audits – was an important topic in 2014. In addition to the
office in Hamburg, Marquard & Bahls maintains a liaison office in Berlin.

Sustainability Targets
To better assess current and future challenges and risks and identify opportunities, the process of
analyzing our value chain was continued in 2014. After having analyzed the Oiltanking subsidiary’s
value chain for sustainability-related issues in detail in 2013, our goal was to map the entire value
chain of Marquard & Bahls. We achieved this goal in 2014. We will continue to pursue the sub-goal
of analyzing our entire value chain for sustainability-related risks and opportunities, and taking the
results into account in the further development of our sustainability strategy. The following table
gives a detailed overview of our targets for the strategic issues in our sustainability activities, including
information about the current level of target achievement.

Management for Long-term Success
To achieve long-term success and controlled growth, we rely on a healthy mix of

risk between the divisions. While they act as independent business units, they are
strategically linked.

G4-DMA

We publish our key financials in our Annual Report, which is available in both German and
English. By additionally publishing economic indicators in accordance with GRI requirements in this
document, we present a comprehensive picture of Marquard & Bahls’ contribution to the
sustainability of a larger economic system. We pay taxes, create jobs, and invest in infrastructure
in Hamburg and many other places around the world.

Financial Performance
Marquard & Bahls looks back on an extraordinary year characterized and influenced by a positive
business performance and extraordinary events. It resulted in consolidated revenues of 15.3 billion
euros (incl. energy taxes) and marked a continuation of the company’s successful development. The
crucial parameters for our long-term business success – stable income, strong liquidity resources and
a solid equity basis – were all met again in 2014 and even significantly increased.
Thanks to high throughputs and almost fully rented tank capacity, the tank storage logistics division
(Oiltanking) once again achieved a very good overall operating result. By contrast, the EPC sector
in India was once again unable to match the good results it achieved until 2012; therefore it has
undergone a strong value adjustment and a complete realignment.
The trading division (Mabanaft) continued its positive trend in 2014 and improved its operating
result (before extraordinary expenses) year-on-year. Its main focus was on the development of risk
management and a deliberate concentration on physical trading.
The aviation fuelling division (Skytanking) ended 2014 with a positive operating result above the
previous year. The company sold its U.S. subsidiary, but countered this by expanding in Europe and
India. Throughput volumes increased further at existing and new locations and amounted to some
13 billion liters of jet fuel.
In 2014, UBT suffered from the continued slump in coal exports from the U.S. and its value was therefore adjusted in some parts. UBT’s primary objective is to operate its existing assets profitably in a
challenging environment. At the same time the company is focusing on further expanding its existing
sites, including with a view to further improving environmental standards.

Risk Management
G4-2

One of the greatest challenges as we pursue our strategy of controlled, long-term growth is to limit
the manifold financial, operational and HSSE risks. That is why we work based on a permanent and
thorough risk management scheme that individually rates all risks and defines tailor-made mandates,
tasks, and responsibilities. To further ensure a healthy mix of risk, all risks – including social and
environmental ones – are evaluated in the context of the entire group of companies. We take a
decentralized approach in which risks are broken out to the individual companies and responsibility
is assigned at divisional level. The principal risks that may affect future business performance include:


Currency turbulences



Another international financial crisis flare-up and/or sustained economic downturn



Political conflict in oil-producing countries and the resultant tensions in oil



Rising prices for natural resources and purchased energy



Significantly reduced use of oil for heat generation



Environmental and natural disasters as well as effects of the climate change



Higher risks in countries we are active in



Substantially stricter environmental laws and regulations

Trading Risks
For Mabanaft, the relevant trading risks are those caused by the high level of volatility in commodity
prices, currency exchange rates, and interest rates. These risks are hedged by the systematic use of
financial instruments such as derivatives and forward transactions. Mabanaft protects itself against
bad debt through credit insurance, banking securities, and the settlement of commodity futures
transactions via segregated brokerage accounts. Our controlling ensures that the rules laid down are
adhered to.
Two incidents in Singapore and Gibraltar required the closing out of positions that were outside
the trading mandates and impacted the overall result. Both incidents led to an immediate further
tightening of risk management for all Mabanaft trading companies. All risk management processes
and systems in trading were subjected to a complete review during the course of this, and
improvement measures initiated. For instance, it was analyzed how the independence of the Risk
Management Department could be further increased in relation to the trading desk.

HSSE-Risks
The main risks to which the storage logistics and aviation fuelling businesses as well as the
service station and end-consumer businesses are exposed stand in connection with the handling
of flammable, environmentally hazardous and sometimes toxic products. Prevention of any risks
resulting from this, such as accident, leakage and fire hazards, is therefore a special focus of risk

40

Marquard & Bahls

Sustainability Report 2014

management at Marquard & Bahls. This falls within the remit of the HSSE & Corporate Communication Department. Based on detailed regulations, site-specific operating instructions for which
regular training is carried out, clear communications, and detailed reporting, the HSSE teams
ensure a proactive safety culture to avoid HSSE risks. The central HSSE team therefore works
closely with the local HSSE managers.

Synergies
Good cooperation – especially between the individual companies – and the leveraging of synergies
are very important for our business success. The combination of its different lines of business
makes Marquard & Bahls what it is – more than the sum of its divisions. This aspect is one of five
priorities in our business strategy. The Corporate Development Department substantially carries
out the strategic planning process, leverages synergies and provides soundly researched support
to the Executive Board in making decisions about new business opportunities.

Supplier Relations
We treat our suppliers with respect, maintain an honest relationship with everyone involved in the
business processes, and strive to establish a long-term cooperative partnership. For us, this means
not only acting responsibly on our own premises, but along the entire supply chain. The diversity of
our businesses is reflected in the spectrum of our suppliers, which range from vendors of technical
equipment for our tank terminals to office equipment suppliers. If a supplier violates our Code of
Conduct or HSSE standards or does not meet our quality requirements, we will terminate the business
relationship. Internal supplier lists increase transparency regarding the quality and performance of
our business partners, with the ultimate goal of giving our customers excellent services and products.
At our sites we also place great importance on safe working procedures for employees from thirdparty contractors. Measures currently employed range from HSSE guidelines and detailed work
instructions to safety briefings at our sites. An integrated contractor management program was
developed for Oiltanking in 2014, which is described in detail in the “Health & Safety” section.

Customer Satisfaction
Building long-term cooperative partnerships with our customers is one of our key strategic priorities.
Our employees play a central role in ensuring the satisfaction of our customers. Responsible and
dedicated teams guarantee excellent services, which in turn lead to customer loyalty. We therefore
feel it is important that our employees can make decisions autonomously, enabling them to respond
flexibly to customer requests. This belief is deeply rooted in our philosophy.

Management for Environmental Protection
Our activities impact the environment both directly and indirectly. Our sites use
energy, water, various raw materials and building materials, and generate airborne

emissions, waste and wastewater. In addition, the storage and transportation of
petroleum products and chemicals carries a risk of spillage.
G4-2,
G4-14,
G4-DMA

We are committed to minimizing our environmental footprint. Environmental issues are therefore
an integral part of the HSSE management system across Marquard & Bahls. According to the HSSE
Policy signed by the Marquard & Bahls Executive Board and the management of all subsidiaries
worldwide, we are committed to making efficient use of energy and resources, avoiding pollution,
and promoting the environmental awareness of employees in order to minimize harmful effects. By
increasingthe number of staff at the corporate HSSE Department, the number of internal HSSE audits
has been increased worldwide. This permits a faster implementation of company standards, which
in many areas are well above statutory requirements, at new sites as well. At Oiltanking, we have for
many years recorded the amount of energy and water used, the frequency of product releases and
their volume, as well as the waste produced, and have established appropriate indicators for each of
these. In recent years, we have included these indicators in our other subsidiaries’ reporting as well.

Spill Prevention
Spills
G4-EN24

Preventing spills is a challenge for any company that handles petroleum, gas and chemical products.
Modern facilities and efficient workflows, combined with preventive maintenance programs, serve to
minimize the risk of spills. In 2014, the number of incidents involving more than 100 liters of product
released per million tons of throughput was 0.20, a 26 percent reduction compared to the previous
year (2013: 0.27). Across the group, despite all our efforts, there were 44 – mostly minor – product
releases of more than 100 liters.

The total volume of product released on our collective premises slightly increased from 218 m³ in

G4-EN24

2013 to 229 m³. The releases mainly involved petroleum products (83 percent). Overall, 65 m³ of
product could not be recovered. The contaminated soil was excavated and disposed of as hazardous
waste or cleaned up. In 2014, we already achieved our goal for 2015 of reducing product releases of
over 100 liters at Marquard & Bahls in proportion to the throughput by 10 percent. We are therefore
setting a new target of reducing product releases by another 10 percent in 2015.

Precautions in Case of Spills in Water
To ensure professional support in the event of major oil spills, Marquard & Bahls is a shareholder

G4-15

in Oil Spill Response Limited, the world’s largest oil spill response company. Oil Spill Response
Limited was founded in 1984 and is wholly owned by international oil companies. At Oiltanking,
scenario-specific contingency plans were developed for all relevant sites, and practical training and
drills were carried out. Marquard & Bahls is also an active member of the Oil Companies International Marine Forum (OCIMF), a voluntary association of oil companies that works to ensure a safe
and ecologically responsible operation of oil tankers and tank terminals.

Ecological Responsibility

45

Ship Charter Policy
To avoid petroleum products being transported by ships that do not meet our standards, Mabanaft
has a Ship Charter Policy that defines detailed minimum requirements for the clearance of chartered
or accepted ships (C-term purchases). Its overriding goal is to ensure safe transport of the products
at all times, and strict adherence to the changing requirements and rules of international tanker
shipping – e.g. the requirements of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The policy
contains, amongst others, evaluations of the flag state organizations. To enable a quick and up-to-date
assessment of ships in accordance with this policy, we have commissioned a customized web-based
information system which has already been used for many years.

Energy Saving & Climate Protection
Energy Consumption
G4-EN3,
G4-EN5,
G4-EN6,
G4-EN7

Marquard & Bahls uses direct and indirect energy sources to operate its facilities, sites, and vehicles.
In 2014, direct energy consumption totaled 1,379,712 gigajoules (GJ). This includes natural gas,
heating oil and fuel for the operation of our pumps, boilers, owned bunker ships, operational vehicles,
and road tankers (2013: 1,560,487 GJ). Indirect energy – mainly electricity – is used among other things
for product pumps and lighting at our tank terminals and for the hydrant systems at our aviation
fuelling sites. The computers in our offices are also constant consumers of energy. Other indirect
sources of energy that we use include district heating and, to a lesser extent, imported steam. In
2014, indirect energy consumption totaled 853,199 GJ (2013: 850,637 GJ), bringing the total amount
of direct and indirect energy to 2,232,911 GJ (2013: 2,411,124 GJ). The decrease in Scope 1 and slight
increase in Scope 2 emissions are mainly due to a slight increase in electricity consumption in the tank
storage sector, combined with a simultaneous decline in fuel consumption. Due to the diversity of our
group, our consumption figures are only partly comparable with those of other companies. Because
of this, for purposes of comparison we show the figures of our tank storage activities as consumption per 1 million tons of throughput. Figure 12 shows that the required megajoules (MJ) remained
unchanged compared to last year at 9.2 MJ. As a result, in 2014 we did not yet achieve our goal of
reducing relative energy consumption in our tank storage activities by a further 10 percent by
year-end 2015, and will continue to pursue this objective.

Fig. 12: Energy consumption in tank storage activities
per throughput (MJ/t), by type

To date, only a small number of our sites buy green electricity: eight Oiltanking sites, four Skytanking
sites and 21 OIL! service stations reported a proportion of more than 20 percent of green energy in
their energy mix. This means that the share at Oiltanking and Skytanking has increased slightly compared to 2013. On-site power generation takes place only in a few cases, e.g. at our tank terminal in
Colombia, where the loading rack for road tankers was equipped with solar panels, as well as at the
Mabagas biogas plants. The biogas plants in Bardowick near Lüneburg and Namakkal, India, have a
total electrical output of about 4.5 megawatts (MWel), which is fed into the grid.
The total energy consumption contains the consumptions of all Marquard & Bahls subsidiaries with
the exception of natGAS and twelve tank terminals in India, where Oiltanking is responsible for their
operation and maintenance, but only has a limited influence on the infrastructure and processes.
Furthermore, 219 automated service stations of Petronord subsidiaries and 19 Skytanking locations
in U.K. are not or only partially included because in most cases, their energy consumption cannot
be measured separately as they share sites with other owners, or the energy costs are covered in
the rental agreement. In case of missing information on energy consumption, these are included
as estimates. In order to show a complete picture, we have also included all of our joint ventures.
Outside the organization, fuel is mainly used for product transports. Usually, we don’t get absolute

G4-EN4

consumption figures from external service providers, but calculate the CO2 emissions as stated in
the “product transport emissions” section, based on the quantities and distances transported.

Ecological Responsibility

47

Reducing Energy Consumption
G4-DMA,
G4-EN6,
G4-EN7,
G4-EN27

The most energy-consuming activity at Marquard & Bahls is the pumping that takes place at the
Oiltanking tank terminals. To detect potential savings and take measures to improve energy efficiency,
locations can refer to a detailed Energy Saving Guideline with background information and practical recommendations. While putting it into action at various sites, further potential for savings was
identified and general recommendations were derived also in 2014. We want to continue advancing our goal of taking advantage of internal synergies and using knowledge transfer to improve our
consumption profile. For instance, in 2014 Oiltanking Malta used electrical vehicles for the first time
for errands outside of the terminal and achieved savings in fuel consumption. In addition, the site
replaced bulbs with LEDs in some terminal areas. Oiltanking Bulgaria was able to save approximately
19,000 kWh of electricity by installing a frequency converter on a ship’s unloading pump. Replacing
bulbs with LEDs in outdoor areas of the tank terminal led to an additional saving of 14,000 kWh.
Switching off the engines of fuelling vehicles during aviation fuelling and other measures saved
more than 21,000 liters of fuel at Skytanking’s Italian sites in 2014. We will continue to document our
energy-saving measures and support our subsidiaries in establishing energy-saving programs.

Carbon Footprint and Emissions
Climate change is one of the greatest environmental challenges we face as a society. Companies
contribute to climate change by emitting greenhouse gases. In order to evaluate our own impact on
climate change, we have calculated the carbon dioxide (CO2) footprint for the entire group.
In accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol), we define our carbon footprint
as the total amount of the six greenhouse gases listed in the Kyoto Protocol, measured in tons of
CO2 equivalent (CO2e), caused directly or indirectly by our company. The relevant greenhouse gases
resulting from our operations are CO2, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Other air pollutants
such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2) emitted by third-party shipping, or volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) from our tank terminals, are gathered separately.

Direct and Indirect Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Since 2010, we have calculated our corporate carbon footprint according to the GHG Protocol, by first
determining reporting scopes for each company. To get a complete picture, we decided to include
100 percent of emissions from all subsidiaries and joint ventures, only excluding those sites already
mentioned in the section “Reducing Energy Consumption”.

the construction of facilities, or the energy required for waste disposal (see figure 13), as these should
be reported by the respective suppliers and service providers.

The greenhouse gas emissions were calculated using the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) emission factors and the GHG Protocol. In the case of emission factors for electricity,
the energy mix of various countries was also taken into consideration. As the data collection and
calculation of emissions from product transports turned out to be the most difficult part, we address
this topic in a separate section.
In 2014, direct and indirect CO2e emissions amounted to 384,305 tons (2013: 448,927 tons),
representing a decrease of 14 percent. Above all, the Scope 3 emissions decreased due to a decline
of commissioned transport in the trading sector. Our goal – against the background of the company’s
growth – is to reduce our emissions as far as possible.

Emissions Related to Product Transport
Marquard & Bahls subsidiaries use tank trucks, rail cars, barges and seagoing vessels to transport

G4-DMA

their products. We try to identify and use the types of transport with the least impact on the climate
and continue to place a strong focus on the transportation by water, since this is the most efficient
way. We calculate emissions from our own fleet of ships and road tankers under Scope 1, and emissions from service providers who transport our products under Scope 3. To reduce emissions from
our own road-tanker fleets at Petronord subsidiaries and Thomas Silvey, our logistics policy is to
invest in latest-model vehicles with energy-efficient engines and to carry out training programs for
fuel-efficient driving. At OIL! Tankstellen, road tankers from reputable third-party companies with
fuel-efficient fleets are contracted to deliver fuel to the service stations in Germany, Austria and
Switzerland.

With regard to marine transport at Mabanaft, we have included emissions from chartered
vessels, but not from vessels that were chartered by third parties, as these are beyond our scope of
influence. In 2014, Mabanaft chartered 59 seagoing vessels (2013: 271), 1,462 barges (2013: 1,427),
9,034 tank trucks (2013: 5.075), and 230 rail cars (2013: 217). When chartering seagoing vessels,
the energy efficiency of the ships is taken into account.

Abb. 17: Transport-related CO 2e emissions by mode of transport
(2014)

The annual CO2e emissions arising from the transport of our products are shown in figure 17. To
calculate the CO2e emissions, emission factors were used wherever data on total consumption
was available. For transport using third parties, we chose the Ecological Transport Information Tool
(EcoTransIT) as the most informative and detailed procedure. The tool allows for quick calculation
based on the cargo volume and the loading and unloading ports. EcoTransIT was developed by the
Institute for Energy and Environmental Research (IFEU) in Heidelberg, the Öko-Institut (Institute for
Applied Ecology) in Berlin, and the Ingenieurgesellschaft für Verkehr und Eisenbahntechnik (IVE mbH,
a consulting company for traffic and railway engineering) in Hannover.

Emissions from Business Travel
Due to the international nature of our business, many of our employees travel by air. Our goal is to
plan the safest and fastest possible routes and to keep air travel to a minimum. In 2014, employees of
Marquard & Bahls and its subsidiaries ﬂew 15,122 routes (2013: 18,291 routes), circumnavigating the
G4-EN19

52

world 892 times in the process (37,469,766 kilometers covered).

Marquard & Bahls

Sustainability Report 2014

CO2 emissions from air travel were calculated by Atmosfair gGmbH based on data provided by
Marquard & Bahls. This comprehensive method takes into account the effects of different air
pollutants at high altitudes, as well as the aircraft, engine types, and booking class. In 2014, group-

G4-33,
G4-EN13,
G4-EN30

wide emissions from air travel amounted to 10,958 tons of CO2e (12,589 in 2013). This is a reduction
of 13 percent compared to 2013 (12,589 tons).
We have not generally included company cars in our calculations, as they are mainly used privately.
Only the company cars used by OIL! Tankstellen field staff are included in Scope 1, as these are used
primarily for business purposes. The vast majority of our employees use public transport or private
cars for their commute. Another measure to reduce travel-related CO2e emissions is the increased
use of video-conferencing systems. This is being taken into account in the construction of the new
Marquard & Bahls headquarters.

Other Emissions
Aside from volatile organic compounds (VOCs), our activities do not cause significant emissions of
nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides or ozone-depleting substances, which are mainly emitted during cooling
or flaring processes.
VOCs at our tank terminals are mainly produced through evaporations from tanks (tank breathing)
and during loading and unloading. VOC emissions should be minimized because of their adverse
effects on health and the environment.
For this reason, internal floating roofs have been installed on the vast majority of tanks containing
volatile products. The floating roofs prevent evaporation by covering the surface of the liquid. Other
techniques used by Oiltanking to reduce emissions are vapor balancing, vapor treatment, and vapor
recovery systems, which have been installed at many sites.
The emission of VOCs is currently calculated at 22 Oiltanking sites and in 2014 showed a year-

G4-EN20

on-year increase to a total of 2,074 tons (2013: 1,027 tons). This is due to the fact that VOCs are now
recorded at a large additional site. The data is based on complex calculations, as the emissions are
highly dependent on various factors such as the vapor pressure of the product, the size, paint, and
insulation of tanks, the average ambient temperature, and the efficiency of the vapor recovery system.
In 2014, measurements were carried out at four sites using a special infrared gas detection camera,
which makes it possible to detect any escaping VOCs. In this way, even the smallest gas leaks can be
identified and rectified so as to further minimize emissions.

Ecological Responsibility

53

G4-EN21

Ships are the most environmentally friendly mode of transport. Nevertheless, since ships often use
sulfurous bunker fuel, transport generates significant volumes of nitrogen oxides (NOX) and sulfur
oxides (SOX). NOX and SOX can significantly contribute to environmental problems such as acidification, eutrophication (nutrient enrichment) and summer smog, and are among the substances that
are toxic for humans. In 2014, the ships we chartered emitted 1,618 tons of nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
(2013: 2,113 tons) and 891 tons of Sulphur dioxide (SO2) (2013: 1,223 tons). In addition, 190 tons of
non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) (2013: 88 tons) and 82 tons of particulate matter (PM) (2013:
137 tons) were emitted during the marine transport of products. These figures are based on the
IFEU Ecotransit method, which was also used to calculate the CO2e emissions caused by third-party
transport.

Climate Initiatives
B.W.O.C.
G4-EN27

We are aware that petroleum products can have a negative impact on the environment, and
therefore work to develop alternatives and to improve energy efficiency. We have introduced an
option for customers who are willing to contribute to the protection of the environment through
carbon capture. Our subsidiary B.W.O.C. has set up a program that offers customers with a fuel card
the ability to capture emissions from fuels they have purchased by making a contribution to reforestation projects. In any case, 10 percent of the emissions bought with a B.W.O.C. fuel card are captured
in carbon capture projects, paid for by B.W.O.C. Customers can decide whether they want to pay extra
to capture an additional 40 percent or 90 percent of the CO2.
In January 2014, B.W.O.C. celebrated the completion of its seventh reforestation project. Since 2010,
B.W.O.C. has planted a total of 200,000 trees, reforesting 155 hectares in Great Britain. This will eventually capture 43,000 tons of CO2.

Initiative Pro Klima
In 2008, Mabanaft, Petronord, and OIL! Tankstellen launched the Initiative Pro Klima. Its efforts focus

G4-EN27

on three areas: offering energy-efficient products; providing consultation on environmental and
energy issues; and promoting projects to protect the climate. Its projects concentrate on two activities – climate research and reforestation. In collaboration with the Schleswig-Holstein State Forestry
and the Schutzgemeinschaft Deutscher Wald e. V. (German Forest Protection Association) more than
142,000 trees have already been planted in recent years. Besides producing oxygen and capturing
CO2, forests improve the water storage capacity of the soil, prevent erosion, and are home to a great
diversity of plants and animals. The sustainable cultivation of the areas is ensured by the German
Federal Forest Act and by participation in the leading forest certification systems of the Program for
Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes (PEFC) and the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). Further
information about our reforestation projects can be found in the chapter on “Corporate Citizenship”.

Renewable Energy
Biogas
Mabagas’ business objective is to realize biogas projects to produce energy from organic waste
and residual substances, in the German and international markets. The Mabagas biogas plant in
Bardowick specializes in recycling organic waste according to the German regulation for organic
waste (BioAbfV). The delivered waste is separated from extraneous material, and the organic matter is
fermented. The biogas plant in Namakkal, India, only uses organic waste material such as dry poultry
manure and agricultural waste. The fermentation residues produced in the process are separated,
sun-dried and then used as fertilizer on the surrounding farmland.

Biofuels
In Germany, the introduction of compressed biomethane (Bio-CNG) is being advanced at selected
service stations. The Bio-CNG is made from 100 percent residual and waste materials and was
available at ten OIL! service stations in 2014. Besides this, Oiltanking is the first service-station
operator in Germany to offer biofuel with an 85-percent ethanol content. It has done so – in cooperation with CropEnergies AG – since 2006.

Ecological Responsibility

55

Wood Pellets
Since early 2011, the Mabanaft Deutschland portfolio has included wood pellets. Burning wood for
energy is CO2-neutral and therefore has less impact on climate change than fossil fuels as it only emits
the CO2 that was previously stored in the tree. Also, small amounts of emissions are caused by its
production and transport. Mabanaft primarily offers premium wood pellets, but also other solid
biofuels under the name celsico®. The products meet the highest quality standards of their respective
sales markets, such as DINplus/ENplus certification for celsico®premium pellets.

Carbon Trading
Mabanaft’s portfolio of carbon-offsetting projects, developed as part of emissions trading, was pooled
in the newly founded Carbonbay at the end of 2013. The portfolio currently includes 19 programs with
49 individual projects in ten countries around the world, including Honduras, Peru, Brazil, Costa Rica,
Tanzania, India and Vietnam.

Conservation of natural Resources
G4-EN8

Water is a precious resource. Essentially, our activities do not require a high level of water consumption.
At our tank terminals, we use fresh water for cleaning tanks, hydrostatic tank testing, heating products,
and the sanitary facilities in the offices. In 2014, the group’s water consumption totaled 788,649 m³
(2013: 748,524 m³), mainly drinking water and industrial water.

Fig. 18: Water consumption per storage capacity (l/m3) for

In 2014, relative water consumption in our tank storage activities per m³ of storage capacity (see

G4-DMA

figure 18) fell by 2.3 percent year-on-year to 16.9 l/m³ compared to the previous year (17.3 l/m³).
The share of drinking water could be even reduced by 6 percent in comparison to the previous year.
This continues the steady reduction in relative water consumption seen over the past few years. We
maintain in the future to our goal of reducing water consumption. We have integrated water
management into Oiltanking’s Energy Saving Program. Areas where water consumption can be
minimized include tank cleaning, vapor production in boiler operations, and sanitary facilities. We are
also examining the possibility of replacing the drinking water currently used for industrial activities
with rainwater, and recycling our cleaning or cooling water. At OIL! Tankstellen, older carwashes –
usually owned by the station operator – are successively being replaced by water-saving models. The
following section on “Waste & Wastewater Management” contains information about the disposal of
wastewater.

Waste & Wastewater Management
We encourage our employees around the world to produce as little waste and wastewater as possible. Our basic principle of waste and wastewater management is based on the “4 Rs”: reduce, reuse,
recycle and recover.

Waste Production
In 2014 the total waste generated by the group came to 39,462 tons. Compared to the previous

G4-EN23

year (2013: 36,779 tons), this is a 7.3-percent increase (see figure 19). A large part of this overall waste increase resulted from a significant increase in tank cleaning, which our tank storage
customers often demand and which is therefore difficult to plan for. The increase in industrial
waste is mainly due to waste, incurred as part of tank terminal construction in line with the
extension of our tank terminal in Terneuzen and was disposed of in 2014.

hazardous waste. Most of the industrial waste was recycled.

An increase was also seen in the ratio of hazardous waste in relation to total storage capacity in
our tank storage activities, from 2013 (0.53 kg/m³) to 2014 (0.69 kg/m³). This increase is explained
by the fact that the tank cleaning described above primarily affects the amount of hazardous waste
generated.

Handling and Disposal of Waste
We record industrial waste (e.g. metals, packaging) as well as hazardous waste (e.g. product remnants,
separator residues), which requires special treatment and must be disposed of separately. Most of
the hazardous waste at our plants consists of contaminated water from oil-water separators, and
residues from tank cleaning. It is collected and processed by us or by licensed contractors. The
proportion of office waste is comparatively low and is therefore not recorded globally.
Our Mabagas biogas plant in Bardowick was fitted with a hammer mill and an additional unpacking
machine in 2014. This made it possible to lower the levels of glass, metal, and plastic food packaging
in the substrate to just 0.5 percent, and to recycle the separated material.

Wastewater Production
G4-EN22

The total amount of industrial wastewater discharged in 2014 was 474,022 m³ (2013: 719,134 m³).
This figure includes the rainwater collected from the tank pits, so there are meteorological fluctuations. Residues from wastewater processing are classified as hazardous waste, and are pumped
out by vacuum trucks, treated by external companies, and usually recycled.

Marquard & Bahls

Sustainability Report 2014

At our dry bulk terminal in Davant, where coal and petroleum coke is stored, large quantities
of rainwater are collected and discharged into public drainage channels after their pH is automatically monitored, and improved as needed. These quantities of water are not included in our
statistics. In March 2014, three local environmental organizations filed a complaint against UBT
about coal and petcoke dust entering the Mississippi during loading and unloading. Since it was
bought in May 2012, UBT has invested over 64 million euros to further improve the facility and
minimize the input of coal and petcoke dust.

Wastewater Treatment and Disposal
All of our service stations and approx. 75 percent of our tank terminals use oil-water separators

G4-DMA

or complex wastewater treatment systems to process wastewater. Samples are regularly taken to
monitor the functioning of the wastewater systems and to ensure that safety values are adhered
to. At some tank terminals, gravity oil-water separators are combined with coalescing filters, skimmers, activated charcoal filters, or strippers to fulfill all requirements. After treatment, the water at
Oiltanking is mostly disposed of in the surface water, and discharged into the public sewerage system
at OIL! Tankstellen.

Biodiversity
Biodiversity – or biological diversity – encompasses the diversity of species as well as genetic
diversity and the diversity of ecosystems. Humankind threatens biodiversity in a variety of ways.

G4-DMA,
G4-EN11

Habitat destruction, over-exploitation, introduction of alien species, and climate change are just some
of the reasons for the decline in the diversity of species and genes. Industrial usage can also inﬂuence
or diminish biodiversity in many ways. In our core business, we potentially impact it mainly through
the construction of new tank terminals.
Our HSSE management system requires a site-specific environmental assessment before the start
of construction of new tank terminals or major expansions. The environmental impact assessments,
which are required by law in most countries, include a thorough assessment of the direct and indirect
impact on biodiversity. As a preventive measure, the groundwater is checked monthly with corresponding measurement technology at all relevant Oiltanking tank terminals. The data obtained in this
way is analyzed centrally by environmental experts.
We currently have no operations in regions designated as protected areas by the International Union
for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

Management for Satisfied Employees
Taking responsibility for what we do, and for the people who work for us, is

especially important to us as a family-owned business. Our employees are the
foundation of our success and our corporate culture. We want to offer them a
working environment in which they feel valued, supported and fairly treated.
G4-10,
G4-DMA

On the one hand, our social responsibility includes the careful selection of suitable candidates and the
systematic development and training of our employees and managers. We do this partly to encourage
employees to stay with the company long-term. On the other hand, the psychological and physical
wellbeing of our employees and contractors is a top priority. We address these topic in the “Health &
Safety” section.
Given our company’s strong growth in recent years, forward-looking, active human resources (HR)
work plays an important role. Ten years ago Marquard & Bahls employed about 1,500 employees
worldwide; in 2014, it employed more than 8,500 people. This exponential growth in headcount has
made processes more complex.
The overarching goal of the HR Department is to partner with the operating companies as well
as the departments of our holding company to deliver efficient solutions that give our employees
the framework for best contributing to the success of the company. Roles and responsibilities are
divided between the regional and the three central HR teams. In 2014, for instance, the HR
Processes & Systems team began with the introduction of a global Talent Management System
(peopleWeb). This was first made available to the major sites and departments and will be continuously rolled out further. The system allows for a more effective and efficient production of complex
analyses of the global workforce, which among other things serve as a decision-making tool for
strategic development.

Headcount
In 2014 – including employees from all non-consolidated and affiliated companies – Marquard & Bahls
employed 8,809 people at year-end, and 8,703 employees on average (2013: 9,247). At the moment,
8,573 employees work for Marquard & Bahls. For the first time in five years, Marquard & Bahls recorded
a decline in the size of its workforce in 2014. The development is mainly due to the sale of Skytanking
USA and the Oiltanking terminals in Houston, Beaumont and Merak.

Employee Turnover
G4-LA1

In accordance with the requirements of the GRI, we define the turnover rate as the number of
employees who left the company voluntarily, were dismissed, or retired, in proportion to the average
number of employees during the reporting period.
Employee turnover needs to be seen in context. In view of retirement or other changes in employees’
personal lives, it is easy to see fluctuation as a natural process to a certain extent. The key is to
achieve a balance of continuity and change. As a tradition-conscious family-owned business we greatly
value continuity and long-term relationships. This fact is also reflected in our efforts to retain our
employees long-term whenever possible. Continuous education and training has therefore been an
integral part of our HR work for many years. We use various HR management tools for this. The growth
of recent years and natural fluctuations also require a systematic recruitment of new employees from
the labor market.
In 2014, 1,359 employees left the company, representing a turnover rate of 15.6 percent (2013:
19.3 percent). 1,549 employees were hired during 2014. Broken down by company (see figure 22),
in 2014 the highest turnover was seen at Newsco (36.5 percent), which is due to the closing of a
Russian site. In accordance with GRI, reductions in headcount due to the Oiltanking sites in Houston,
Beaumont, and Merak (Indonesia), as well as Skytanking’s U.S. sites were not included. The drop in
turnover to 4.5 percent at Skytanking results from the above-mentioned sale of the U.S. sites, which

Absentee Rate
The absentee rate reflects the days of absence in proportion to the absolute number of days staff

should have worked. For 2014, the overall absentee rate was 1.9 percent (2013: 3.0 percent), a
considerable decrease vs. 2013. Since we regard this value as an indicator of our employees’ health
and satisfaction, we will continue to monitor it closely and derive measures, if necessary. Employee
satisfaction is regularly checked at the local level in performance appraisals or employee surveys.

Education & Taining
G4-2,
G4-DMA,
G4-LA10

Education and training is an important pillar of our success. Due to demographic change and our
company’s rapid growth, it is becoming more and more challenging to find qualified staff. To ensure
that the right people are available at the right places at the right time, promoting the expertise and
talent of our employees is a high priority. Therefore our aim is to further expand and systematize our
advanced training programs.

Staff Development
We see it as our responsibility to support and advise our employees in their development, and
address their individual needs with coaching, on-the-job training, and external training. Our supervisors are offered group-wide management development programs. Here, cooperation and networking at group level as well as change management are priorities. One-on-one interviews with senior
executives in 2014, followed by detailed feedback, formed the basis for designing new leadership
programs. In 2014, two new programs were conceived, one for the top management team and one for
newly promoted executives (First Line Leaders). The latter is intended as a cross-divisional program to
optimally support managers at the beginning of their career.

Young Talent
Our international trainee program is a vital element in our company’s efforts to attract and develop
young talent. The Marquard & Bahls trainee program offers the opportunity to get to know all facets
of our company and to understand our values and our culture. In particular, the focus is on the longterm development of university graduates.
In 2014, we globally rolled out a revised, centrally coordinated training program under the name
FUEL – my FUture in Energy & Logistics. All our divisions can be integrated into the FUEL program,
across departmental and national boundaries. The first eleven participants started the two-year
program in July 2014, five of them in Germany.
In Germany we also offer a dual degree program in Business Administration and Industrial
Engineering in cooperation with the Nordakademie in Elmshorn and, since 2014, with the Hamburg
School of Business Administration (HSBA) as well. Students receive a sound education in alternating
theoretical and practical phases. Another important component in the development of young talent is
the in-house vocational training we offer at individual subsidiaries. Likewise, interns in different areas
have the opportunity to experience working life in our group and gain insights into our company.
Because we would like to offer all of our in-house graduates a position in our company, we train them
in accordance with our own personnel requirements. During 2014, in addition to the eleven FUEL
trainees, at Marquard & Bahls there were eleven Nordakademie students, one HSBA student and

66

Marquard & Bahls

Sustainability Report 2014

twelve apprentices training in Germany, another 138 trainees at subsidiaries, 101 of which were on a

G4-LA10

local trainee program (2013: 13 Nordakademie students, 67 trainees and twelve apprentices).

Career-long Learnings
In addition to these bespoke programs and training opportunities, we also support the professional
and personal development and continuous learning of our employees by offering training in the
form of in-house and external seminars and conferences. These range from specialist topics, to IT
seminars and language lessons, to workshops on subjects such as intercultural communication and
time management

Labor Standards
We abide by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations (UN) protocols,
protecting human rights within our sphere of influence. Compliance with the standards of the

G4-11,
G4-DMA

International Labor Organization (ILO) is laid down in our Code of Conduct. We respect employee
rights and ensure our employees both freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining.
Our employees are organized in trade unions in various countries, including Argentina, Belgium,
France, the Netherlands, and Malta. In the event of changes in our operations, we work closely with
the relevant social partners.

Working Hours
As an international company, our working hours reflect local requirements and best practices. Most of
our employees have permanent working contracts.

Remuneration Policy
As employing the best people is one of our most fundamental interests, Marquard & Bahls pays its
staff fair remuneration as a matter of course. This remuneration practice applies to all employees,
whether they are employed full-time or on a temporary basis. We also operate in low-wage countries
such as China or India. As in other countries, we do not set any rules for minimum wages at regional
level, but our salaries are generally higher than the industry average.
We pay competitive salaries combining fixed and variable components. The Marquard & Bahls Code
of Conduct specifies that salaries shall be regulated based solely on qualifications, performance, and
other work-related factors such as responsibility, skill, and experience. Factors such as gender, age,
race, religion, marital status, or disability have no influence on salaries. In addition to the base salary,
we voluntarily offer comprehensive supplementary benefits, which are calculated on the basis of

Social Responsibility

67

the basic salary. These supplementary benefits are partly dependent on performance. Employees
of various subsidiaries participate directly in the company’s success through individual, performance-based bonus payments.

Pension Schemes
The state pension is one of the main pillars of people’s retirement arrangements, but it rarely fully
covers their financial needs in old age at this point. Our employees’ future is very important to us; so
at many subsidiaries and in many countries where, we offer a voluntary, additional employer-financed
company pension.

Equal Opportunity
We see diversity as a key to success, both in our lines of business and among our employees. We aim
to further increase diversity within our company by employing both male and female employees from
G4-DMA,
G4-LA12,
G4-HR3

many different cultures. Employees from 60 nations work for us around the world – as in the previous
year, 1.8 percent of them live with disabilities.
The oil and energy sector is still largely dominated by men, though more and more women are
choosing careers in our industry. In 2014, the proportion of female employees was 14.2 percent,
which represents an increase compared to the previous year (2013: 13.2 percent). More men than
women still apply for technical positions. When recruiting junior employees, the Human Resources
Department tries to maintain a balance between male and female candidates.
All employees can anonymously report cases of discrimination, harassment or other violations of the

Work-Life Balance
We are convinced that a good work-life balance contributes to the wellbeing and performance of our
employees. We are aware of the fact that this balance can sometimes be difficult to achieve.

Working-time Models
To make work arrangements more flexible and promote a healthy work-life balance, in some coun-

G4-LA3

tries various models such as part-time, working-time accounts and trust-based working time are
used in conjunction with an individual, case-by-case assessment. For example in Germany, part-time
contracts accounted for 15 percent of all working time in 2014 (2013: 12 percent). There are also
working-time models to encourage employees to return to work after parental leave. On average,
a total of 40 employees at the German sites were on parental or maternity leave in 2014 (2013: 37);
50 percent of them were men.

Employee Assistance Program
As part of our commitment to offer employees support in different life situations, Marquard &
Bahls has contracted the services of an external Employee Assistance Program (EAP). This program
support has been provided to employees and their family members in Germany on a wide range
of issues – from work-related and emotional problems to practical and legal issues. All matters are
treated with strict adherence to privacy protection regulations.
Overall, at 7.7 percent, utilization of the employee assistance program increased compared to
2013 (6.9 percent), and is still slightly higher than the national average of clients. The proportion of
work-related topics was 14 percent (2013: 28 percent); the remaining requests related to personal
matters. The rate of emotional topics among the work-related questions is slightly higher than
the national average of clients. We will consider this information when planning measures for our
employees. In our view the continued good response to this offer confirms the usefulness of this
support measure.

Health & Safety
G4-14,
G4-DMA

Health and safety are important values at our company. We continually optimize all of our subsidiaries’
activities with a view to technical, organizational and behavioral safety, and promote a proactive safety
culture. One important measure is the creation of comprehensive HSSE manuals that are specifically
tailored to the respective divisions – and based on which the sites develop appropriate local
management systems. An important tool for learning from incidents is our global incident database.
To prevent incidents and their reoccurrence, all accidents, incidents, near misses and unsafe acts and
conditions are carefully analyzed. If necessary, this results in HSSE alerts being distributed worldwide
and discussed with employees. To monitor compliance with our internal standards, we regularly perform internal HSSE audits, especially at Oiltanking, Skytanking and UBT. Detailed HSSE statistics with
“leading” (forward-looking) and “lagging” (retrospective) KPIs are also prepared for each Oiltanking
and Skytanking site. To promote a constructive HSSE discourse, once a year HSSE managers from
Oiltanking locations worldwide convene for a week to discuss current matters, exchange ideas and
experiences, and create synergies. Skytanking also holds international HSSE meetings as part of its
annual global management-meetings.
An HSSE award has been given out at Oiltanking since 2008 to honor our staff’s efforts to work in
a safe and environmentally friendly way. The indicators taken into account are accidents, fires &
explosions, product spills, product contaminations, material damages and reporting (quality,
timeliness, and near misses). Each year, one profit center receives an award for “Best HSSE
Performance,” and another is presented with the “Best HSSE Improvement” award. In 2014, the Golden
Lighthouse for Best Performance went to Oiltanking Sonmarin in Kotka, Finland, while the White
Lighthouse for Best Improvement was won by Oiltanking Antwerp, Belgium. Skytanking, too, has
presented HSSE awards for Best Performance and Best Improvement since 2012. In 2014, the
awards went to Skytanking Brussels and Ostend, Belgium, as well as Skytanking Zurich, Switzerland,
respectively.

HSSE-Training
Our company HSSE Policy requires that all employees receive job-related training and tutorials. This
includes tutorials on the risks inherent in dealing with the products that are stored and handled at
our sites. New employees as well as contractors are instructed in matters of HSSE before taking up
their work. Any persons who have to perform potentially dangerous tasks receive specific training.
OIL! Tankstellen has produced a comprehensive training video that covers all aspects of HSSE at
service stations and provides practical guidelines for meeting the requirements. The video was made
available to all service station partners.

Sustainability Report 2014

At Oiltanking and Skytanking, a total of 230,880 HSSE training hours were completed in 2014 (2013:
250,102 hours). For example, at Oiltanking in 2014, each employee on the operations side received an
average of 63 hours of HSSE training (2013: 67 hours).

Workplace Accidents
In 2014, across the group there were 68 accidents resulting in lost workdays that involved our own

G4-LA6

employees (2013: 53). These accidents resulted in a total of 1,699 lost workdays (2013: 1,025).
Absences due to commuting accidents or non-work-related illnesses are not included in these figures.
Another 35 accidents involved employees of contracted external companies (2013: 29). Tragically, two
of these accidents led to the deaths of five contractors. In January 2014, a contractor’s worker fell to
his death at a construction site of IOT’s EPC division in Sasan, India. In December of the same year,
another accident occurred on an EPC construction site in Dibrugarh, India, where, during inspection
work before the commissioning of a spherical gas tank, an operating error by the plant operator
resulted in four workers being killed. Marquard & Bahls deeply regrets these tragic incidents. As a

consequence from these events, the IOT EPC division’s HSSE management is being restructured. To
increase safety, especially on building sites, Oiltanking imposes strict requirements on contractors
during the selection process. In addition, a new contractor management database has been rolled

Fig. 24: Number of accidents resulting in lost workdays that involved our own
employees, per 1 million hours worked at Marquard & Bahls (total)

The relative frequency of accidents that resulted in days lost could not be further reduced last year
as in previous years, and came to a global average of 3.3 hours per 1 million hours worked. This
represents a 21-percent increase compared to last year (2013: 2.6, see figure 24) and is especially
due to trip accidents in aviation fuelling and tank storage. Due to accidents reported after the editorial
deadline of the Annual Report, the communicated trend had to be amended in this document. We will
therefore once again set the goal of reducing, by year-end 2015, the relative frequency of accidents
that result in absences by 10 percent compared to 2013.
We define the severity of accidents based on the average number of lost workdays per incident.
Across the group, the average severity of accidents in 2014 was 25 lost workdays per accident
(2013: 19.3). The increase of the average lost workdays is mainly due to accidents in the field of
Mabanaft Bunkering, which led to many lost workdays.

Marquard & Bahls

Sustainability Report 2014

Fire & Explosions
Past incidents in our industry have shown that technical measures, organizational processes, and
rules of conduct are not always sufficient to prevent fires. Oiltanking has prepared a mandatory
Fire Protection Standard consisting of 72 specifications that often go beyond legal requirements, to
ensure adequate protection against fire and its escalation.
In 2014 there were 23 small fires but no explosions nor deflagrations (2013: 24 fires, four deflagrations). In most cases, the fires were associated with contractors’ equipment and non-operational
activities at our tank terminals. Although almost all of these were very small-scale fires that were
quickly extinguished, this means we have only partially achieved our goal of preventing fires and
explosions. It goes without saying that we will continue to pursue this goal in the years ahead.
Altogether these incidents resulted in 10,240 euros of damage (2013: 1.2 million euros).

Noise
Noise can have a negative impact on the working environment, local residents, and wildlife, so our
goal is to minimize noise production wherever possible. Potential sources of noise are pumps,
generators, and industrial vehicles. We reduce noise through better maintenance and shielding,
but also by replacing aging equipment. Apart from this, noise protection is part of the mandatory
personal protective equipment in the event that speciﬁed noise limits are exceeded.

Safety on Business Trips
Many of our employees travel frequently as part of their work for Marquard & Bahls. Travel safety is
therefore an important issue on our HSSE agenda. In order to provide the best medical advice and
services for employees on their travels, as well as for expats, Marquard & Bahls has signed a service
contract with International SOS, the leading provider of medical assistance, international healthcare,
and security services.
To support our employees in planning international business trips, there is also a group-wide manual
on travel safety and a web-based airline-vetting database, which is updated daily.

In 2014 altogether 480,465 euros were donated (2013: 598,172 euros). The reason for the decrease
compared to 2013 is a change in the method of calculation. In the past, for example, sponsorship
of the Initiative Pro Climate, which spans three years, was only attributed to the year in which expenditure took place, which resulted in an increase in last year’s total.

In a breakdown by companies, Oiltanking was again the biggest donor in the group in 2014. At group
level, Marquard & Bahls’s corporate citizenship activities can be broken out into five fields: environment, education, health, culture & sports and humanitarian aid projects. The former category of
“Research” will be classified more as a method than a topic from now on and is omitted as a result.
Instead, research projects will be thematically allocated to the various fields of engagement, such as
the environment, education, etc.

Oiltanking Vitória in Brazil celebrates World Water Day with an
environmental canoe trip
To mark this year’s World Water Day on 23 March 2014, Oiltanking Terminais in Vitória, Brazil,
sponsored the 25th environmental canoeing trip on the Jucu River. The initiative focused on
protecting the river, which supplies the entire Vitória metropolitan area with water, including Vila
Velha, where the Oiltanking terminal is situated. Siltation, untreated sewage, and the erosion of the
riverbank leading to deforestation threaten the Jucu, which not only provides a habitat for many
animal and plant species, but is also of great importance to the neighboring communities due to
its use in power generation and water supply. For instance, 60 percent of the population of the metropolitan area of Vitória – more than a million people – obtain their water supply from the river.
The important traditional event was sponsored by the municipalities, the regional government, and
the private sector, including Oiltanking Terminais, whose employees are passionately committed to
the preservation of the Jucu. Oiltanking wasn’t just involved as a financial sponsor, but this year also
sent four colleagues to help with the logistics of the 20-km tour, which went from the city of Viana to
the mouth of Jucu in Vila Velha.

B.W.O.C. binds large quantities of CO 2 through tree plantings
Since 2010, B.W.O.C. has offered its customers a fuel card where the company offsets 10 percent
of the emissions resulting from the purchased fuel in carbon capture projects. Customers are
also given the option of offsetting 100 percent of their fuel emissions for a surcharge. In 2014,
tree plantings along the Scottish border produced a double benefit: The saplings not only help to

78

Marquard & Bahls

Sustainability Report 2014

absorb CO2, but also to regulate the flow of water into a flood-risk area of 14 major rivers and bodies
of water. This prevents bank erosion and flooding and also creates new habitat for wildlife. Another
B.W.O.C. project in 2014 involved tree-plantings in Haywood, Dorset, with the aim of restoring a forest
that was cleared in the 17th century, as well as protecting the local ecosystem. Overall, B.W.O.C.
absorbed 7,379 tons of CO2 emissions in 2014 by planting 27,050 trees. At the end of 2014, the British
government’s Forestry Commission recognized B.W.O.C.’s transparent and tireless reforestation work
in a case study published on its website.

Employees participate in cleanup actions
Inspired by employees at another site, the staff at Oiltanking in Port Neches initiated a long-term effort
to clean up the tank terminal surroundings. As part of the Adopt-a-Highway program, a cooperation
agreement was signed with the state authority, committing to at least four cleanups per year. In
return, the state authorities pick up the collected trash after each day of action, and provide
occupational health and safety information and equipment for all participants. In 2014, its second
year of participating, ten Oiltanking Port Neches employees lent a hand and collected a total of
49 garbage sacks. As the tank terminal is on the edge of town near municipal facilities and residential
buildings, their efforts also benefitted local residents.

such as here at Oiltanking Port Neches, USA

At least 16 sites participated in days of action of World Environment Day and World Water Day
in 2014 with tree-planting and trash collection campaigns. For instance, Oiltanking employees at
the Texas City site helped clean a beach, and Oiltanking employees in Cartagena, Colombia not only
organized informative events at two local primary schools on topics such as resource conservation,
but also planted saplings in Bellavista Park and cleaned it up with the school’s more than 200 pupils.

Another aspect of our non-profit environmental efforts is our support for the Pro Klima Initiative
research project co-financed by the OIL! KlimaCard. The aim of this research project is to better
understand the impact of climate change, and derive conclusions for environmentally friendly
action. As part of the climate protection project, the OceanRAIN project (Ocean Rain And Ice-phase
precipitation measurement network for surface validation) is sponsored at the University of
Hamburg’s CliSAP. The idea is to investigate the relationship between climate change and precipitation by taking long-term measurements of precipitation on the world’s oceans. To collect the data, a
total of nine research vessels from various countries are equipped with precipitation gauges called
disdrometers. Disdrometers optically record each individual drop of rain or each snowflake and from
this separately calculate the amount of rain or snowfall per square meter. In 2014, some further milestones were achieved in the research project. For example, the disdrometer has now carried out more
than two million measurements on the icebreaker “Polarstern” between June 2010 and May 2015.
Moreover, another research vessel – the “Meteor” – was integrated into the measuring operation in
March 2014 through an expanded cooperation with the German Meteorological Service. Equipped
with a disdrometer in August 2014, the “Meteor” mainly operates in the tropical and subtropical
Atlantic and has supplied over 500,000 measurements to date.

Help for children and young people in Bulgaria
In keeping with a cherished tradition, Marquard & Bahls again supported an international aid project

G4-15

with a year-end corporate donation of 100,000 euros. In 2014, this secured the annual funding of a
SOS Children’s Village in Bulgaria, where we are represented by an Oiltanking tank terminal in Varna.
The SOS Children’s Village in Tryavna in central Bulgaria was built in 1993 and can accommodate
72 children. Often these children come to the SOS Children’s Village with health and mental problems.
With the loving care of their new SOS family and educational support they can overcome traumatic
experiences, improve motor deficiencies and develop in a way that is appropriate for their age. Extra
lessons and special support help the children in attending school and to discover their strengths and
talents. Young people who have outgrown the SOS Children’s Village can move into two supervised
residential communities of the SOS Youth program during their training or studies in Veliko Tarnovo,
30 km from Tryavna. As many as 40 young people live and learn together at these establishments.
The adolescents attend their last two years of high school, do apprenticeships, and prepare for an
independent life, step by step. Experienced teachers help and support them not only with careers
guidance, but also with many issues related to growing up. The young people usually stay in close
contact with their SOS families and, if possible, relatives too. In this social network young people are
educated and then receive support in searching for jobs.

UBT Davant awards scholarships for the 15 th year in a row
In the summer of 1990, UBT Davant in Louisiana, USA, initiated a scholarship with the aim of giving
students in the local area around the tank terminal the opportunity to attend college. It has since led
to a permanent partnership with the local High School in Phoenix, which has a comprehensive school
approach catering for children and teens from first grade through high school graduation under
one roof. Each year, a scholarship candidate is proposed from the senior-year class, which averages
ten to 15 graduates. They are selected according to criteria such as grades and charitable activities,
as well as leadership aspects. Each scholarship recipient has a free choice of the university they
attend and what they study, and it is requested that the field of study be either business, education
or engineering. The scholarship grant provided for a period of eight semesters should cover the cost
of tuition fees and learning materials.

Oiltanking Malta sponsors experimental kitchen at a school
St. Benedict College elementary school in Birzebbugia has always promoted a healthy lifestyle. In
this connection, the idea was born of creating a dedicated space for cooking and experimenting
to provide the children with a healthy diet. Thanks to financial and other support from Oiltanking
Malta, the school received a fully equipped kitchen, which was inaugurated in March 2014. Like previous donations to St. Benedict College to equip two school libraries, this donation was also part of
Oiltanking Malta’s corporate responsibility program. Because a healthy diet begins at home, the next
step will be to recruit the parents as partners, so the school hosted a workshop to explain the importance of a healthy breakfast. A well-known TV cook who once worked as a rector and home economics
teacher gave a presentation in the school auditorium with practical tips for making a wholesome
lunch. In addition, the school supports a government initiative that empowers students to actively
promote environmental issues in their schools and communities. Last year the school received
the Ministry of Education and Employment’s Healthy Lifestyle Award from the Committee on Healthy
Nutrition and Life Planning.

Oiltanking Cartagena renovates restrooms for schools
In 2014 the Oiltanking tank terminal in Cartagena, Colombia, organized the renovation of restrooms
at two local elementary schools, one of which is a school for children with learning disabilities. Both
facilities lacked the resources to replace their bathroom fittings, a repair that had become urgently
needed for hygiene reasons. After an initial inspection, Oiltanking paid a company to do the work
professionally. The objective here was to protect children from disease and thereby contribute to the
welfare of local communities. A total of 400 children from needy families will benefit from the nine
separate children’s washrooms that were created as a result. Six Oiltanking Cartagena employees
supervised the project during its planning and implementation. An inauguration ceremony in late
March 2014 was attended by all the children and representatives of the two supported institutions,
and the Oiltanking employees were delighted to be presented with painted pictures and letters of
thanks from the children on the occasion.

Neighborly help for children with cancer
In 2014 Oiltanking employees demonstrated double commitment to children with cancer at two
local hospitals in Cartagena, Colombia. To ensure sufficient blood reserves, blood banks regularly
conduct information campaigns and recruit donors. In October 2014, 15 employees and contractors participated in an initiative by the local Hemocaribe blood bank, each donating 300 ml of blood.
The drive was carried out in the tank terminal office building, and the donors were able to take a
rest afterwards. Moreover, a large gift-collection campaign for children with cancer was held in
December. Nearly 50 employees contributed toys chosen according to age and gender. Oiltanking
complemented the gifts with healthy snacks recommended by doctors, so that they did not have to go
without the obligatory Christmas sweets despite their illness. To top off the distribution of presents,
the tank terminal organized an event with entertainment for children for the gift-giving. Incidentally,
the givers enjoyed this as much as the recipients.

Oiltanking Bulgaria supports residents after severe floods
In June 2014, the Bulgarian city of Varna was hit by unexpectedly heavy rainstorms, leading to catastrophic floods that not only flooded houses and streets but also destroyed important amenities. At
least twelve people were killed in the floods. To provide short-term assistance, Oiltanking Bulgaria
gave leave to eight employees who went to the affected areas. Equipped with personal protective
equipment, they cleaned up mud, filth and stagnant water from houses and streets. In addition, shovels, trash bags, buckets, work gloves, plastic boots and cooking facilities for emergency care were
donated to the Red Cross.

Joyful march for children’s rights
In April 2014, some 100 Oiltanking Colombia employees and family members marched through the
streets of Cartagena, from the historic city walls to the town hall, to stand up for children’s rights.
Various local and regional authorities had organized the event to raise public awareness of the violation of children’s rights in Colombia based on current statistics. The march, which was accompanied
by colorful actions, took four hours. In addition to participation by its own staff, Oiltanking made a
donation towards the organization of the event. In all, 4,000 people attended, including many children,
who created a carefree atmosphere together with clowns, musicians and other artists.
