Independent Assurance
Report
To REWE-ZENTRALFINANZ eG, Köln
We have been engaged to perform a limited assurance engagement on the
description of the necessary materiality analysis and selected sustainability
information of the Sustainability Report 2013/2104 of REWE-ZENTRALFINANZ
eG, Köln, (hereinafter: “the Company”), for the business years from 1 January
2013 to 31 December 2014. 1 The sustainability information, which was
selected by the Company and reviewed by us, is marked with the symbol ()
in the Sustainability Report.

Management’s Responsibility
The Company’s Board of Managing Directors is responsible for the accurate preparation of the
Sustainability Report in accordance with the criteria stated in the Sustainability Reporting
Guidelines G4 of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).
This responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the
Sustainability Report and the use of assumptions and estimates for individual sustainability
disclosures which are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, the responsibility includes
designing, implementing and maintaining systems and processes relevant for the preparation of
the report.

Our Independence and Quality Control
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics
for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants
(IESBA-Codex), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional
competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior.
The firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a
comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures
regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and
regulatory requirements.

Practitioner’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion based on our work performed as to whether
anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that:


the description of the materiality analysis marked with the symbol () as required for a
sustainability report to determine its content and the boundaries of its aspects is not in
accordance with the criteria "Stakeholder Inclusiveness", "Sustainability Context", "Materiality”
and "Completeness" of the GRI’s Sustainability Reporting Guidelines G 4 or that they were not
used during the Sustainability Report’s preparation,



the management approaches marked with the symbol () in the Sustainability Report are not
in accordance with the requirements of the standard disclosures G4-DMA of the Sustainability
Reporting Guidelines G 4 or



the quantitative information marked with the symbol () in the Company’s Sustainability
Report for the business years 2013/2014 is in material aspects not in accordance with the
criteria „Completeness“, „Comparability“, „Accuracy”, “Clarity”, “Timeliness” and “Reliability”
of the GRI’s Sustainability Reporting Guidelines G 4.

It was not part of our engagement to review product or services related information, references
to external information sources, expert opinions and future-related statements in the
Sustainability Report.
We also have been engaged to make recommendations for the further development of the
sustainability management and the sustainability reporting based on the results of our assurance
engagement.
We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance
Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised). This Standard requires that we comply with ethical
requirements and plan and perform the assurance engagement, under consideration of
materiality, in order to provide our conclusion with limited assurance.
In a limited assurance engagement the evidence-gathering procedures are more limited than for
a reasonable assurance engagement and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a
reasonable assurance engagement.
The procedures selected depend on the practitioner's judgment.
Within the scope of our work we performed amongst others the following procedures concerning
the materiality analysis, management approaches and key data – for the aspects that are
marked with the symbol ():


Inspection of the documents describing the CR-Strategy and CR-Management as well as
obtaining an understanding of the organizational structure of CR;








Inquiries of personnel responsible for the preparation of the report as well as inquiries of
coordinators of three lines of sustainability “Green Product”, “Energy, Climate and
Environment” and “People” regarding the process to prepare the reporting of sustainability
information;
Recording the systems and processes for collection of sustainability data, inspection of their
documentation and validation on a sample basis;
Analytical procedures on relevant data;
Gaining further evidence for selected data of the report through inspection of internal
documents, contracts and invoices by external service providers.

Conclusion
Based on our limited assurance engagement, nothing has come to our attention that causes us
to believe that


the description of the materiality analysis marked with the symbol () as required for a
sustainability report to determine its content and the boundaries of its aspects is not in
accordance with the criteria "Stakeholder Inclusiveness", "Sustainability Context", "Materiality”
and "Completeness" of the GRI’s Sustainability Reporting Guidelines G 4 or that they were not
used during the Sustainability Report’s preparation,



the management approaches marked with the symbol () in the Sustainability Report are not
in accordance with the requirements of the standard disclosures G4-DMA of the Sustainability
Reporting Guidelines G 4 or



the quantitative information marked with the symbol () in the Company’s Sustainability
Report for the business years 2013/2014 is in material aspects not in accordance with the
criteria „Completeness“, „Comparability“, „Accuracy”, “Clarity”, “Timeliness” and “Reliability”
of the GRI’s Sustainability Reporting Guidelines G 4.

Emphasis of Matter - Recommendations
Without qualifying our conclusion above, we make the following recommendations for the further
development of the Company's sustainability management and sustainability reporting:





To formalize the various internal sustainability reporting requirements and to summarize it in
a Group Guideline;
To strengthen the descriptions of the management approaches;
To integrate all consolidated companies into the sustainability reporting and to report
annually.

Key impacts, risks, and opportunities concerning sustainability
Overcoming the challenges created by global and partially complex value chains is one of the
biggest jobs facing REWE Group. The key tasks in this process are to identify relevant problems,
develop solutions and ﬁnd the right partners in order to gain inﬂuence. REWE Group has direct
inﬂuence on the product conditions and quality of the store brands sold by its sales lines. But the
company has no direct inﬂuence on the makers of brand name products. The key here is to focus
on maintaining a trusting working relationship. Here is one example of this effort. As part of their
annual Sustainability Weeks, the sales lines of REWE Group work with their industry partners to
present more environmentally and socially acceptable brand products that have successfully
completed a testing process performed by the Centre on Sustainable Consumption and Production
(CSCP).
As a way of moving sustainability from its niche existence and into the volume market, REWE Group
is raising the awareness level of a broad segment of the general public about this issue. It provides
comprehensive information to customers, partners, employees and stakeholders, and conducts
transparent and credible communications. Awareness about sustainable consumption and interest
about more sustainable products and services may indeed be rising – and creating an undeniable
opportunity for REWE Group in the process. But, for most customers, the key criterion for
purchasing decisions remains the price. In spite of the cost pressure being exerted by such factors
as rising purchasing prices, personnel costs and environmental investments, REWE Group has no
intention of veering from its chosen path: It is determined to be a sustainability pacesetter in the
retail industry.

G4-3 | Organisational Profile | Strategy and Analysis

Name of the organization
The cooperative REWE Group is a leading trade and tourism group in Germany and Europe. Its
business activities are bundled in two combines: REWE-ZENTRALFINANZ eG, Cologne (RZF), and
REWE-Zentral-Aktiengesellschaft, Cologne (RZAG).
The deﬁning characteristic of REWE Group is its cooperative structure. Principles like decentral
organisation, diversiﬁcation, independence and the individual responsibility of business units and
independent retailers have many strengths. At the same time, they also require REWE Group to
weigh a large number of different interests in its sustainability strategy. For this reason, the aim is
to implement joint standards and to raise awareness levels of all groups about sustainable
business policies that will secure both the future of the environment and society as well as our own
existence.

G4-4 | Organisational Profile | Strategy and Analysis

Primary brands, products, and services

CENTER, REWE CITY and BILLA, the discounter PENNY as well as the DIY stores of toom Baumarkt
and B1 Discount Baumarkt. The company also operates organic supermarkets (TEMMA), innovative
convenience stores (REWE To Go), the gastronomic concept "Oh Angie!" and the e-commerce
activities REWE delivery service, Zooroyal and Weinfreunde.
The product range includes such well-known store brands as REWE Beste Wahl, REWE Bio, REWE
Regional, REWE Feine Welt, ja!, VIVESS, TEMMA, PENNY, today, BILLA, Ja! Natürlich, clever, LOOK BY
BIPA, iQ COSMETICS, MY, toom and b1. The company's own production operations the bakery
Glocken Bäckerei and the quality butcher Wilhelm Brandenburg also provide excellent store brand
products.
Since April 2013, the former Travel and Tourism Division of REWE Group has been operating
internationally under the "DER Touristik" umbrella brand. The brand comprises the tour operators
ITS, Jahn Reisen and Travelix as well as DERTOUR, MEIER’S WELTREISEN and ADAC Reisen along

Description of the supply chain
As a retailer of food and non-food products, REWE Group employs far-reaching supply chains. The
values contained in the code of conduct (see G4-56) and in the Guidelines for Sustainable
Business Practices (see G4-14) also apply to business relationships. Should a contract partner
intentionally or wantonly ignore these rules, REWE Group reserves the right to impose penalties. The
objective is for REWE Group to work with its contract suppliers and apply the company principle
"We recognise our responsibilities and act sustainably" to the entire supply chain.
In the following reports, REWE Group provides insights into the supply chains of selected food and
non-food products that represent the key challenges encountered in the supply chains of various
products contained in the range of REWE Group: see supply chain.

G4-13 | Organisational Profile | Strategy and Analysis

Signiﬁcant changes during the reporting period
The stores of the consumer electronics division that operated under the ProMarkt brand name were
sold or closed in 2013. In 2014, a decision was taken to pull out of the full-range store business in
Italy and to sell the business unit BILLA Italy. In December 2014, all shares of Kressner GmbH & Co.
KG, Wissen, and the clothing store Kressner GmbH, Dillenburg, were sold and transferred (see page
54 of the Annual Report).

G4-14 | Organisational Profile | Strategy and Analysis

Implementation of the precautionary principle
REWE Group strives to create a balance among the economic, environmental and social impacts of
its business operations wherever possible. In this process, it continuously measures its own
performance and progress. When different goals come into conﬂict with one another, the company
calls on experts from its own ranks and from external stakeholder groups. Using this approach, the
company then ﬁne-tunes its sustainability strategy and simultaneously generates momentum for
new industry solutions.
Guidelines for Sustainable Business Practices
The principle of sustainability is ﬁrmly anchored in the vision and values of REWE Group. In January
2010, this principle took concrete form as the company's Guidelines for Sustainable Business
Practices. The guidelines are broken down into three main segments: Responsible Action, Labour
and Social Standards, and the Environment and Animal Protection. 16 subsections focus on
speciﬁc issues, including the general ban on corruption; fairness in competition; the prohibition of
forced and child labour; prohibitions of discrimination; occupational health and safety; climate,
resource and animal protection; a commitment to endangered species and biodiversity; and
responsibility regarding consumer interests.
The values apply to all employees of REWE Group as well as to the Management Board and the
Supervisory Board. The guidelines are based on the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the
conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the U.N. Global Compact and the
objectives of the U.N. Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).
Risk Management
As an international trade, travel and tourism company, REWE Group faces a number of risks related
to its business activities. These risks include logistics risks, price trends, amended laws and
regulations that occasionally may have short reaction times. Uniform group-wide risk management
successfully addresses these risks and ensures long-range opportunities. The company's
management and supervisory bodies are informed every six months about the current risk situation
in a standardised report. To that end, risk managers send risk reports that contain inventories of
relevant individual risks from the risk areas as of a given closing date. Risks with similar content
and causes are subsequently aggregated at the combine level into risk categories and classiﬁed as
high, medium or low with regard to their relevance to the combine based on the threat potential to
the company's business activities, ﬁnancial position, results of operations, cash ﬂows and image.

External initiatives that the organization endorses
In 2008, REWE Group joined the Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI), an alliance of
companies that are committed to improving labour and social standards in risk countries. The
BSCI's Code of Conduct is based on the conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO)
and the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Its requirements include a renunciation of
exploitative child and forced labour as well as compliance with statutory pay and work schedules.
REWE Group is also a partner in the initiative Cotton made in Africa organised by the Aid by Trade
Foundation. The initiative strives to improve quality of life and environmental protection in
developing countries. As a result of its determination to promote sustainability and end its niche
existence, REWE Group supports many initiatives that promote sustainable actions, animal welfare,
environmental protection, conscious diets and much more: See partners and memberships at
REWE Group Sustainability.

Entities included in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
The report covers REWE combine companies for Germany and Austria.
The sustainability work undertaken by independent retailers is addressed and presented only in
individual cases as a result of the wide number of their activities and their entrepreneurial
autonomy. This approach has also been taken to locations outside Germany and Austria.
Nonetheless, more than 50 per cent of REWE Group's employees have been covered.
In reporting the data, a clear distinction is made in those places where detection limits deviate. For
instance, the data for the pillar of Energy, Climate and the Environment occasionally include
independent retailers and locations outside Germany.

Process for deﬁning the report content
A representative cross-section of relevant stakeholders (see G4-24) was surveyed at the end of
2014 in personal interviews about their needs, views and strategic recommendations for the
purpose of modifying the materiality matrix. In addition, an online questionnaire was ﬁlled out by
115 participants.

The survey results were used to develop a ranking of 25 top-priority issues and 13 less critical
issues. The latter group included various employee issues, topics of social involvement, transparent
marketing, certiﬁcation and labels, waste management, sustainable packaging and biodiversity.
These issues were intensely discussed in REWE Group project groups. It was concluded that all
issues are critical to the combine's continued involvement and to reporting. The only exception is
biodiversity: It is not a top priority within the conﬁnes of the company's business operations. But the
issue is important in the supply chain. As a result, it will be monitored in this context and reported

G4-18 | Organisational Profile | Strategy and Analysis

on.
In March 2015, the PRO PLANET Board of Advisers, in which many stakeholder groups are
represented, reviewed and approved the ﬁndings. Afterwards, the materiality analysis was
discussed and approved by REWE Group's Sustainability Strategy Committee chaired by Manfred
Esser. A classiﬁcation of the indicators to be reported on was done for REWE Group's Sustainability
Report 2013/2014.

Identiﬁcation and selection of Stakeholders
The stakeholder groups that are relevant to REWE Group were determined as part of the
sustainability strategy developed in 2008. The list is constantly modiﬁed on the basis of intense
discussions in such places as the REWE Dialogue Forums (see G4-27), the Sustainability Weeks,
the PRO PLANET Board of Advisers (see G4-27) and stakeholder surveys.

G4-26 | Stakeholder Engagement | Strategy and Analysis

Approach to the stakeholder engagement and frequency
As a trade, travel and tourism company that has millions of customer contacts each day, REWE
Group has both a special opportunity and an obligation to lead sustainability out of its niche
existence. Important momentum is provided by the direct and personal dialogue that the company
conducts with various stakeholder groups. The holding assumes responsibility for the
institutionalised dialogue with stakeholder groups and communications with major and trade
media. It creates umbrella brand campaigns and measures, including the company's own
sustainability label PRO PLANET.
The strategic business units communicate with customers by taking such steps as handing out
ﬂyers about sustainability each week or as part of Sustainability Weeks. These weeks are held
annually and raise consumers' awareness levels about more environmentally and socially
acceptable products and services by taking individual steps.
In addition, all employees are informed, stimulated and energised about the issue. And there is a
clear reason for this: Employees serve as the interface with customers and suppliers. As a result,
they play the role of sustainability ambassador and become a key competitive factor.
See G4-18 and G4-24.

Key topics and concerns raised through stakeholder
engagement and response
In 2010, REWE Group began to hold dialogue forums where it can have a personal, candid and
intense discussion with stakeholder groups. These forums also consider how trade and industry
can encourage customers to become more sustainable consumers. In 2013 and 2014, about 900
people took part in four dialogue forums. These participants included representatives from politics,
NGOs, the academic community and industry as well as employees and customers of REWE Group.
They discussed the issues of conservation of resources, protection of animals and plants, social
responsibility and the future of sustainable consumption. The stakeholders' central concerns were
discussed on site. They will shape the reﬁnement of REWE Group's sustainability strategy.
One key organisational unit of the stakeholder dialogue is the PRO PLANET Board of Advisers. This
board serves as a professional and technical adviser who supports the activities of REWE Group
and is consulted about communications issues. The Board of Advisers has ﬁve members. The
chairman is Bernward Geier. The agricultural and environmental journalist and adviser is a long-time
sustainability expert. Barbara Studeny of GLOBAL 2000 and Florian Schöne of the German
environmental Naturschutzbund Deutschland e.V. (NABU) represent the issue of the environment.
Consumer issues are addressed by Georg Abel, Managing Director of the consumer group
VERBRAUCHER INITIATIVE e.V. Friedel Hütz-Adams of the SÜDWIND-Institut is the board member
who covers social affairs. In addition, the board brings in outside advisers to address speciﬁc
issues.

Governance structure, incl. committees of the highest
governance body
The corporate governance of REWE Group is a commitment to a cooperative -structure. It centres
on commercial self-responsibility, free entrepreneurship and the collective power of plurality. The
cooperative philosophy serves as an essential element of the company's management culture and
its long-range strategy.
Drawing on these fundamental principles and the German Corporate Governance Code, REWE
Group has created a four-pillar structure for its corporate governance activities:
1. Transparency and Stability of the Ownership Structure
REWE Group has committed itself to providing clear information about the ownership of the lead
companies. The majority favouring independent retailers and cooperatives is explicit and
transparent.
2. Composition of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board of REWE Group consists primarily of retailers and employee representatives.
This approach assures professional expertise, employee input and sustainability. It also fulﬁls the
spirit of European corporate governance.
3. Consistency and Sustainability in Articles of Association and Company Policies
Corporate governance at REWE Group is based on a combination of coherent Articles of
Association and company policies that meets the latest legal and subject-matter requirements.
4. Clear Rules Governing Information and Communication Between the Supervisory and
Management Boards
The greatest possible entrepreneurial freedom granted to the Management Board is the essential
pre-condition for and the guarantee of the combine's success. For this reason, the continuous and
institutionalised dialogue between the Management Board and the Supervisory Board becomes all
the more important. This relationship then enables the Management Board to carry out the
responsibilities to which it has been assigned. See also Corporate Governance.

Process for delegating authority for economic, environmental
and social topics
As CEO, Alain Caparros is responsible for the entire sustainability strategy of REWE Group. In this
role, he draws on the support of sustainability strategy committees and the Department of
Corporate Responsibility, which plays a coordinating role in the entire combine. Two strategic
committees manage the company's sustainability activities:
Sustainability Strategy Committees
The chief strategy committee that meets a number of times during the year deﬁnes the company's
broad strategy and continuously modiﬁes it. The committee identiﬁes and evaluates sustainabilityrelevant opportunities and risks. As part of its work, it draws on the support of internal risk
monitoring and external sustainability monitoring. It also evaluates key performance indicators
(KPIs), sets annual objectives and oversees company-wide sustainability projects. The committee
is composed of members of the Management Board, all fully authorised representatives of REWE
Group, many managers from all strategic business units and holding organisations, the chairman of
the Central Works Council and a representative of independent retailers. As a result, sustainability
has been made a top priority at the company. All decisions are directly related to the work of the
Management Board and the Supervisory Board. The chairman of the approximately 40-member
chief strategy committee, which also has an average of eight female members, is Manfred Esser,
the Management Board member who oversees purchasing at REWE Group. In 2013, the chief
strategy committee met seven times. It held three meetings in 2014. The Secondary Sustainability
Strategy Committee was set up in 2014. It acts as both a decision-making and working group. It is
supported by CEO Alain Caparros and Manfred Esser, the Management Board member who
oversees purchasing at REWE Group. The secondary strategy committee meets six times a year. In
2014, two of these meetings were not held.
Project groups
Since 2008, pilot groups have been assigned to all four pillars of sustainability – Green Products;
Energy, Climate and the Environment; Employees; and Social Involvement. The various strategic
business units and the responsible holding areas of REWE Group are represented on them. During
the reporting period, project group employees were included in regular HR meetings.
The integration of independent retailers was intensiﬁed during the reporting period. A retailer for
sustainability has been elected for each region. This group of sustainability ofﬁcers has been
tasked with the job of promoting the issue and integrating it into their respective region. A chairman
was also selected by the group. This individual will represent the retailers at meetings of the
strategy committee and propose issues and ideas that were discussed beforehand. Retailers also
play an active role in REWE Group's dialogue forums by performing such tasks as leading
workshops. This enables the ideas and experience of independent retailers regarding the
development of sustainability activities at REWE Group to be considered in all relevant decisions.

Highest governance body’s role concerning the effectiveness of
the risk management
The company's management and supervisory bodies are informed every six months about the
combine's current risk situation in a standardised report. To that end, the risk managers send risk
reports to the combines. These reports contain inventories of relevant individual risks from the risk
areas as of a given closing date. Risks with similar content and causes are subsequently
aggregated at the combine level into risk categories and classiﬁed as high, medium or low with
regard to their relevance to the combine based on the threat potential to the company's business
activities, ﬁnancial position, results of operations, cash ﬂows and image.
In addition, binding provisions were made under which newly identiﬁed, signiﬁcant risks or existing
risks with material changes in their development in the risk areas must be reported directly to our
management bodies.

The consolidated salaries of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board are presented in
the Annual Report of REWE Group. Employee representatives elected to the Supervisory Board of
RZAG continue to receive the salary stipulated in their employment contracts.
Members of the Management Board are entitled to a short-term and long-term performance-based
proﬁt-sharing and bonus programme. Since 2013, binding sustainability objectives have been
included in the individual target agreements of the highest-level executives at REWE Group. In areas
where sustainability plays a major role, this approach is also taken for the department head and
purchasing level.

human resources costs. To ensure this in terms of widely accepted negotiated working conditions
as well, REWE Group works to promote the fundamental modernisation of collective-bargaining
structures in its role as a core member of the German Business Alliance of Innovative CollectiveBargaining Policies and in negotiated policies supported by trade associations. To REWE Group,

Values, principles, standards and norms of behavior
With the goal of "The Best Performance – for Customers, Retailers and Employees", the
fundamental values of REWE Group were formulated in the Mission Statement drawn up in 2008:
!

We act independently according to the ideas of community!

!

We work for the customer. We are at the heart of the market!

!

We welcome new directions. Standing still means going backwards!

!

We act with integrity and treat one another with respect! We keep our word!

!

We strive to ﬁnd the best solution, make considered decisions and act consistently!

!

We are aware of our responsibility and act sustainably!

Rules governing the upstanding behaviour of all employees and managers including the
Management Board and the Supervisory Boards are speciﬁed and bindingly formulated in REWE
Group's code of conduct. The code is also designed to serve as a guide to those who work with
REWE Group.
The basis of sustainable action at REWE Group is the "Guidelines for Sustainable Business
Practices". These guidelines give concrete form to the fundamental value "We are aware of our
responsibility and act sustainably!" As a result, it provides binding orientation for employees,
managers, business partners and suppliers.

G4-57 | Ethics and Integrity | Governance

Mechanisms for seeking advice on ethical and lawful behavior
After introducing a professional anti-corruption system in 2007, REWE Group decided in 2010 to set
up an autonomous, decentral compliance organisation: The Corporate Department of Governance &
Compliance bundles and coordinates all compliance-relevant activities in REWE Group. A
compliance ofﬁcer serves as an expert contact partner in each business unit and country company.
The aim of REWE Group's Compliance Management System (CMS) is to prevent violations of laws
and internal company rules and, thus, to preclude damage to the company and personal liability of
the company's bodies and employees. To achieve this objective, a compliance programme has
been developed. This programme comprises a number of preventative measures, including risk
assessments, training and consulting.

G4-58 | Ethics and Integrity | Governance

Mechanisms for reporting concerns about unethical or unlawful
behavior
Violations of legal regulations or internal rules, particularly regarding corruption, can be reported to
compliance ofﬁcers using a combine-wide whistleblower system or an external ombudsman. These
individuals receive tips provided by all employees of REWE Group or third parties who have reason
to think that such violations have occurred.

G4-DMA | Aspect: Economic Performance | Economic

Aspect: Economic Performance
Management approach: The long-term business success of REWE Group is based on a cooperative
structure that has given life to such company values as solidarity, unity and sustainability. The
cooperative philosophy, the management culture that has arisen from it and the related long-term,
cross-generational direction of the company create security and stability for all stakeholders,
extending from members and employees to customers, suppliers and the entire socio-economic
environment. For this reason, the Supervisory Board, shareholders, retailers and the Management
Board of REWE Group consider the long-range cooperative structure to be a guarantee of
independence and self-determination.
REWE Group is determined to generate long-term business success and to conduct its business
activities in an environmentally and social conscious manner. This commitment is spelled out in the
Guidelines for Sustainable Business Practices that apply to all employees and contract partners of
REWE Group. In the guidelines, the company expresses its determination to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions generated by business processes, use renewable energy sources and conserve natural
resources, among other actions. By developing socially and environmentally acceptable products
and services as well as expanding its more sustainable product range, the company is also helping
to minimise the negative impacts created by its business operations.

Financial implications and other risks and opportunities due to
climate change
The business operations of REWE Group are affected to different degrees by climate change. The
impact of climate change, including high rainfall totals or powerful storms, could affect the stores
of REWE Group. In addition, climate change and extreme weather events affect the products and
services of REWE Group:
Travel and Tourism: No other industry focuses its business so closely on experiencing intact natural
environments with broad levels of biodiversity as Travel and Tourism does. Over the long term,
climate change could pose a threat to entire holiday destinations. In particular, these areas include
islands, coastal regions and ski resorts. Other risks are being created by the rising number of
extreme weather events. In response, DER Touristik has created a crisis information system that
can immediately inform affected customers and employees about potential threats and provide
them with recommended courses of action.
On occasion, these new conditions have promoted a change of customer behaviour. Such
customers now book their trips on short notice and avoid certain regions (i.e., areas with poor snow
coverage).
Food Retail Sector: REWE Group's business operations depend on reliable, long-term product
availability. Extreme weather events and changing climate conditions can threaten the cultivation
and harvest of raw materials, a development that could drive up prices.
Against the backdrop of climate change and the altered business conditions related to it in such
areas as energy supplies, REWE Group feels afﬁrmed in its decision to be the sustainability
pacesetter in the retail sector. The company sees opportunity in efforts to systematically cut energy
usage and to prevent climate-damaging emissions – also in light of rising energy prices. It will
achieve these goals by increasing energy efﬁciency, using certiﬁed green power, raising its use of
natural refrigerants, employing smart logistics and expanding its utilisation of alternative energy
sources. By hiring energy managers, working with industry partners, conducting research projects
and supporting the combine's own energy service provider EHA (Energie-Handels-Gesellschaft),
REWE Group is creating more environmentally conscious business practices and strategically
addressing the impact of climate change.

G4-EC3 | Aspect: Economic Performance | Economic

Coverage of beneﬁt plan obligations
As a result of demographic change, retirement planning is becoming increasingly important. REWE
Group understands this need and provides its employees with a company pension scheme
designed especially with the needs of retail employees in mind.
The scheme offers life-long pension payments, a disability living allowance and survivors beneﬁts.
The coverage can be continued when an employee moves to another employer. In addition, REWE
Group assumes liability for the funds paid into the system and supports employees' supplemental
pension scheme with a ﬁxed payment of up to 300 euros each year. The company provides a
supplement of up to 15 per cent to employees' own contributions. REWE International AG offers a
similar programme in Austria.
The beneﬁts of the German basic pension scheme are limited to the so-called pension contribution
assessment ceiling. The need to have a supplementary retirement plan is particularly high for
employees with incomes that exceed this ceiling because the difference between their ﬁnal salary
and the highest basic pension entitlement can be very high. To address the needs of this target
group, REWE Group offers its own retirement plan model called "REWE Group Voluntary Pension
Beneﬁts". The beneﬁt of this model is its tax-free contributions, which can include large amounts,
for programme participants. Some retirement schemes are also offered outside Germany because
national social-insurance and tax laws set the conditions for company pension plans.
In 2014, the cash value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation (DBO) for the entire REWE Group was 632.4
million euros (in addition to 243.0 million euros of pension-like obligations, 2013: 505.2 million
euros and 209.2 million euros, respectively). Additional information is available on pages 104-114
of the Annual Report.

Financial assistance received from government
With its approximately 15,000 stores and travel agencies in Europe, REWE Group makes a major
contribution to the development and advancement of the regions where it does business.
It creates new jobs, pays taxes and fees and plays an active role in cultural and social projects. In
its work, the company also receives government funding on occasion. One example of this is the
logistics centre in Oranienburg. In a project that has breathed new life into the local economy, REWE
Group received government ﬁnancial support. Some of these funds were also used in the reporting
period. In addition, the company took part in funded research projects and pilot programmes in
such areas as urban logistics.
No total sum of these funds is available because they were not reported centrally.

G4-DMA | Aspect: Indirect Economic Impacts | Economic

Aspect: Indirect Economic Impacts
Management approach: REWE Group considers itself to be a good corporate citizen – this means
that it assumes responsibility in the places where it does business. This applies to the locations of
its stores and administration operations as well as to indirect impacts related to suppliers, farming
regions and travel destinations. REWE Group has deﬁned four areas of activity for the focal points
of its social involvement, including support of non-proﬁt organisations and projects, and the
promotion of education and personal growth of children and adolescents (See the section on
„Strategy“.)
REWE Group strives to have a positive impact on economic conditions in the supply chain. As part
of this commitment, it works in a number of industry initiatives, including ones designed to improve
economic conditions in countries of raw material production and manufacturing as well as to
minimise the negative environmental and social impacts in its supply chain (see the section on PRO
PLANET).

G4-EC7 | Aspect: Indirect Economic Impacts | Economic

Infrastructure investments and services provided
REWE Group invests in the infrastructure and services of its business locations, travel destinations
and countries where special support is critically needed. In one aspect of this support, REWE Group
partnered with the children's charitable group Kindernothilfe to build a school in Haiti during the
reporting period. In 2014, DER Touristik helped to build and expand 12 schools in 10 countries
where access to education is not always readily available. The company also joined with partners
like NGOs to provide a total of 1,900 children with the opportunity to attend school in 2014.
Furthermore, DER Touristik created the non-proﬁt organisation DER Touristik Foundation e.V. during
the year. The foundation transfers all donations to relief projects. Partnerships that have been
forged with organisations like the foundation Reiner Meutsch Stiftung FLY & HELP ensure that the
work has a long-term impact.
On the national level in Germany, REWE Group also works on behalf of society. In one aspect of
these activities, the company has been a main sponsor of more than 900 Tafeln food banks and the
food bank's umbrella organisation, the Bundesverband Deutsche Tafel e.V., for more than 18 years.
Such support is provided to similar organisations in other countries, including the Vienna Tafeln
food bank in Austria.
toom Baumarkt DIY stores are also establishing long-range partnerships with Lebenshilfe, an
organisation that helps people with disabilities, across Germany. This work includes joint projects
conducted by toom employees and people with disabilities as well as trainee days for handicapped
employees of Lebenshilfe workshops. In this effort, toom Baumarkt DIY stores are encouraging
interaction and removing barriers. At the same time, the projects enable people with disabilities to
play an even more active role in the daily work world. More than 20 toom Baumarkt DIY stores
across Germany have initiated partnerships with the organisations of Lebenshilfe.

G4-EC8 | Aspect: Indirect Economic Impacts | Economic

Indirect economic impacts
With its approximately 15,000 stores and travel agencies, REWE Group has created about 330,000
jobs in many communities both inside and outside Germany. When new stores are opened,
communities beneﬁt from infrastructure investments, taxes and fees as well as from a broad range
of social activities undertaken by employees, store managers and independent retailers. In doing
so, REWE Group generates important momentum for the development and growth of the regions
where its stores do business.
REWE Group is also a charter member of the animal welfare organisation Initiative Tierwohl. The
more than 5,500 REWE and PENNY stores operated by the company work on the group's behalf. The
organisation strives to further increase the standards that apply to poultry and pork farming across
Germany on a step-by-step basis. Ultimately, these standards should exceed legal regulations. To
support this effort, REWE Group began on 1 January 2015 to contribute four cents of every kilogram
of pork it sells into an animal welfare fund it has set up. Over the next three years, all companies
that are part of this alliance will pay about 255 million euros into this voluntary industry-wide
programme.
REWE Group is also a partner in the initiative Cotton made in Africa (CmiA). This organisation
strives to enable cotton farmers to have a secure, independent existence. As part of this
programme, farmers learn about efﬁcient, environmentally conscious farming methods. In addition,
the initiative's partners support the marketing of the cotton grown by these farmers.
In the case of the critical raw material cocoa, REWE Group acted as a driving force behind the
establishment of the German Initiative on Sustainable Cocoa (GISCO). One focus of the initiative's
work is aimed at fuelling the sectoral use of more sustainable cocoa. Starting in 2015, this forum
joined forces with other partners to introduce a training concept for approximately 20,000 cocoa
farmers in Ivory Coast that is designed to create the conditions needed for more sustainable cocoa
cultivation practices in the world's largest farming country.
REWE Group is also the initiative partner of the Forum for Sustainable Palm Oil (FONAP). The
initiative's aim is to promote the use of certiﬁed palm oil and a complete conversion of the sector.
As part of this effort, members of the forum pledged to use only sustainably produced palm oil by
the end of 2014. This objective was further strengthened at the end of 2014 with the passage of a
new pledge.

Aspect: Procurement Practices
Management approach: REWE Group stands for fresh, high-quality food. Local and regional
producers play a particularly important role in the company's business. To consumers, this group of
suppliers also represents freshness, short transport distances, trustworthy production and support
of local economies. REWE Group is responding to their desire by planning to increase the share of
products delivered by local and regional suppliers in its range. To achieve this goal, the company is
working to establish long-term relationships with local and regional suppliers and to underscore the
special quality of these products for consumers in a transparent, eye-catching manner.
The company has also created the REWE Regional brand name across Germany to clearly identify
these products. As another way of promoting regional products, REWE Group is a charter member
of the Trägerverein Regionalfenster e.V., which was established in 2012. Following a test phase in
February 2013, REWE Group began to apply the group's regional window concept in 2014 in PENNY
and REWE stores. The label provides consumers with veriﬁed information about the origin of
ingredients and the place of processing. In this manner, the regional window creates transparency
for customers that complements store-brand-speciﬁc information.
A total of six locality ofﬁcers at the company establish contacts between REWE stores and local
producers and suppliers. These ofﬁcers perform such jobs as attending locality conferences where
suppliers can present their goods.

G4-EC9 | Aspect: Procurement Practices | Economic

Proportion of spending on local suppliers
REWE Group deﬁnes regional suppliers as those individuals who are included in one of various
regional concepts. Regions can be a German state (like North Rhine-Westphalia), a traditional
region (like the Franconia region in northern Bavaria) or topographical region (like Lake Constance).
At PENNY, regional fruit and vegetables are identiﬁed by the German state or the agricultural or
"pleasure region" like the Oldenburger Münsterland area of northwestern Germany.
The REWE Regional label is used in REWE stores across Germany (see table).

Locality refers to suppliers who are usually small or to direct sellers of agricultural products who
come from the immediate area of a store. One successful example of the promotion of local
suppliers is the REWE Landmarkt (country store) concept in the Region Middle. Farmers in the
central German organisation Vereinigung der Hessischen Direktvermarkter e.V. (VHD) sell their
products under this name. The number of stores that sell more than 2,800 Landmarkt products rose
constantly between 2010 and 2014. In 2010, 86 stores were part of the programme. The number
had risen to 136 by 2012. The ﬁgure had risen even farther, to 214, by the end of 2014. Another
locality concept is called Aus Liebe zur Heimat (For the Love of Home). More than 1,000 products
from local suppliers are marketed under this name. In addition, some retailers have created their
own regional product ranges. In the 13 REWE Richrath stores in the Cologne area, consumers ﬁnd a
large number of products that bear the label "Wir aus der Region" (We from the Region).
In Austria, an array of regional concepts is also being employed. In 2010, the A+A label began to be
used. It identiﬁes products that are entirely produced and processed in Austria and that use only
ingredients from Austria (a deviation of 2 per cent is permitted to address such issues as the use of
spices). A+A is used in BILLA and PENNY stores in Austria.

Since September 2014, another regional concept for fruit and vegetables has been used in the
stores of BILLA, MERKUR and ADEG. It is called 'Da komm ich her' (I'm from Here). The 80 fruit and
vegetable products offered in this programme are sold on a seasonal and regional basis. In 2014,
1,615 stores were part of the programme, and the products generated more than 14 million
customer contacts.
Under the PENNY store brand 'Ich bin Österreich' (I'm Austria), products that are made according to
typical Austrian recipes and containing only Austrian ingredients are sold. At the end of 2014, the
range had 258 products. The total was 203 in 2012 and 2013. The number of PENNY stores that
sell these products totalled 279 in 2012, 282 in 2013 and 286 in 2014. The products generate more
than 17 million customer contacts a year. The company is currently considering an expansion of the
store brand to dairy products.

G4-DMA | Aspect: Materials | Environmental

Aspect: Materials
Management approach: In its Guidelines for Sustainable Business Practices, REWE Group had
committed itself to the efﬁcient use of the natural resources soil, air and water as well as of raw
materials and fuels. A signiﬁcant amount of resources used by the company is consumed during
the production and utilisation of the products sold by the company. In this area, REWE Group takes
steps related to products and raw materials, including efforts conducted as part of PRO PLANET
projects (see aspect Procurement Practices).
The pillars of sustainability Energy, Climate and the Environment focus in essence on
environmentally relevant activities that lie in their individual areas of responsibility. These include:
the construction and operation of stores, warehouses, administration ofﬁces, production sites,
logistics operations, resources and materials needed for the company's business needs. In these
areas, REWE Group strives to sparingly use resources and to increase the amount of recycled and
sustainable materials it employs. This effort includes activities to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, energy-efﬁciency programmes and water-saving equipment in stores as well as waste
and recycling management. In its logistics operations, the company uses reusable containers to
prevent waste from being created in the ﬁrst place. Rubbish that is produced is systematically
recycled with the help of disposal partners. With its Green Building stores built according to the
DGNB standard, REWE Group has developed a comprehensive concept covering the use of
resources. This concept requires that environmentally conscious, durable and easily recyclable
building materials be used. As part of this sustainability strategy, the company is making a
transition to more environmentally conscious paper.
For information about management, see the management approach under the aspect "Energy".

Materials used by weight or volume
As a trade and tourism company, REWE Group uses resources like energy, water and wood to make
products, advertise them and offer them to customers. REWE Group sells both brand name and
store brand products that are largely made by external companies. No comprehensive information
is compiled about the amounts of raw materials, packaging materials and process energy that are
used in these companies' production operations.
In the phases of the value chain that lie in its own area of responsibilities, the company focuses in
particular on using and promoting recycling materials and more sustainable construction materials
in addition to energy-efﬁciency management. Paper is a key resource for a trade and tourism
company, one that plays a major role particularly in product advertising. Total paper consumption
by REWE Group rose from about 131,000 tonnes in 2012 to nearly 144,000 tonnes in 2014. About 85
per cent of paper consumption, or around 122,000 tonnes, is attributed to the production of ﬂyers.
The primary reason for the rise in paper consumption was increased advertising conducted in the
competition for customers. This increase was reﬂected in the higher print runs of products like
ﬂyers, catalogues and company publications.

Percentage of materials used that are recycled input materials
Paper is a key resource that all business ﬁelds of REWE Group use in large amounts. In response,
REWE Group encourages the use of recycled paper, which is utilised in particular for ﬂiers and other
printed matter as well as in its administration work. In 2009, the company began to make a
transition to more environmentally conscious paper, a key component of its sustainability strategy.
This effort focuses on using recycled paper (with or without the German environmental seal Blauer
Engel) and paper from sustainable forestry that has been certiﬁed by the Forest Stewardship
Council® (FSC®) or the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certiﬁcation Schemes (PEFC™).
REWE Group increased the share of more environmentally conscious paper in its total paper usage
from 92.5 per cent in 2012 to 95.8 per cent in 2014. Compared with 2008, the total has risen by 67
percentage points (from 29 per cent to 95.8 per cent). The share of recycled paper among
environmentally conscious paper totals 80 per cent.
The job of recycling plastic creates a major challenge. REWE Group promotes recycling of plastics
by separating packaging waste in stores and warehouses and by using recycled plastics. Working
with its suppliers and other partners, toom Baumarkt DIY stores have developed packaging made of
nearly 100 per cent recycled plastic. As a member of the Recyclat Initiative, REWE Group and other
partners won the ECR Award in 2014 for using plastic waste collected from private households in
Germany to produce containers for washing-up liquid.

Aspect: Energy
Management approach: REWE Group has set the goal of continuously reducing its energy
consumption per square metre of sales area. The foundation of REWE Group's systematic energyefﬁciency activities is the group-wide energy management system that the company has been
applying since 2008 in conjunction with Energie-Handels-Gesellschaft (EHA) of Hamburg. In
addition, energy managers in the strategic business units analyse energy consumption and develop
measures to lower it. During the reporting period, this systematic approach was intensiﬁed with the
addition of 10 new energy managers. REWE Group has deﬁned the following KPI for electricity
consumption:
!

lowering electricity usage per square metre of sales area (as measured in kWh/m 2 ) by 7.5 per
cent between 2012 and 2022.

In the ﬁrst stage of this effort, the company lowered this speciﬁc energy consumption level in
Germany and Austria by 4 per cent between 2012 and 2014. For other goals and management
actions, see the management approach under the aspect "Emissions".

G4-EN3 | Aspect: Energy | Environmental

Energy consumption within the organization
Energy consumption involves electricity, especially the power used for refrigeration and lighting
purposes, and the fuel consumed to transport products from warehouses to stores. This part of
logistics is a category that the company can inﬂuence directly. As a result, consumption by the
group's own vehicles as well as those of external service providers in Germany and Austria is
addressed here.
Energy usage by REWE Group fell by about 6 per cent between 2012 and 2014. The largest amount
of consumption was attributed to electricity at about 62 per cent. It was followed by natural gas (17
per cent) and fuel for cars and trucks (15 per cent). The decline in electricity consumption largely
resulted from optimising refrigeration, climate and lighting systems. The use of heat energy was
lowered by using more efﬁcient heating systems in stores. The mild winters in 2013 and 2014
played a role in this reduction as well (see G4-EN6).

Reduction of energy consumption
To systematically save electricity and reduce emissions, the company monitors electricity and gas
consumption in its stores with the help of Hamburger Energie-Handels-Gesellschaft (EHA). Among
other steps, the monitoring platform FRIGODATA ONLINE is used in more than 3,000 stores of
REWE Group. With its help, the company can check stores' temperature and energy data in real time
as part of a process that makes their consumption more transparent and comparable. On the basis
of the data, the energy managers of REWE Group examine current and planned consumption levels
and then propose optimisation recommendations. Such recommendations include improving
refrigerating units, reducing cooling losses, using energy efﬁcient lighting or replacing pumps and
the control systems used in heating units.
Another step being taken to reduce energy consumption is the Mobility Budget that replaced the
Company Car Policy in 2014. Employees entitled to company cars can now ﬂexibly use their budget
and individually design it by doing such things as selecting a smaller model and investing the
remaining budget in various other components. Users of electric vehicles receive a monthly bonus
of 150 euros for their Mobility Budget. For initiatives in the area of product usage, transport and
logistics, see G4-EN7 and G4-EN30.

Reductions in energy requirements of products and services
With its large number of sustainably designed stores, REWE Group has set the pace in energy
efﬁciency. The ﬁrst REWE Green Building in Germany was opened in 2009 in Berlin. It was the ﬁrst
supermarket in the country to be honoured by the German Sustainable Building Council. Thanks to
such steps as daylight architecture, energy-saving building techniques and the best insulation, a
Green Building uses up to 40 per cent less energy than a standard supermarket does. By the end of
2014, about 30 REWE stores, four toom Baumarkt DIY stores, a warehouse and a PENNY store in
Offenbach had been built with the Green Building concept. More than 60 others are being planned.
In addition, REWE Group is helping to protect the climate by selling energy efﬁcient products in its
DIY stores. The company's Travel and Tourism Division is also committed to offering the most
sustainable trips possible to its customers. To raise hotel partners' awareness levels about the
issue, DER Touristik has developed guidelines on sustainable business management practices that
focus on energy and conservation of resources. The tour operators of DER Touristik help their
environmentally conscious customers to plan their trips by highlighting sustainably managed hotels
with selected, externally issued sustainability seals in their catalogues.

Total water withdrawal by source
REWE Group uses water in its stores, production sites, warehouses and administration locations.
Water-saving equipment is employed to keep the use of potable water as low as possible.
Almost all water used by the company is obtained from public waterworks – with the exception of
the rainwater used by some Green Buildings. Absolute water usage rose slightly from about 5.98
million cubic metres (m 3 ) in 2012 to 6.1 million m 3 in 2014. Speciﬁc water consumption per square
metre of sales area was nearly unchanged at 0.56 m 3 /m 2 compared with 2012 (0,55 m 3 /m 2 ).
A bigger role is played by water withdrawal and disposal in the production of more sustainable
products. In this area, REWE Group conducts product-related projects in its supply chain.
DER Touristik examines the occasionally high water consumption of hotels in the environment
brochure "Das Ferienhotel – mit ökologischer und sozialer Verantwortung zum Erfolg" (The Holiday
Hotel – Achieving Success Through Environmental and Social Responsibility). Contract partners
learn about responsible approaches to water and receive practical tips about lowering usage.
Issues addressed include technical conservation steps as well as the use of process water and
rainwater.

G4-EN9 | Aspect: Water | Environmental

Water resources signiﬁcantly affected
REWE Group obtains its water exclusively from public waterworks. At its Green Building locations,
the company actively recovers and reuses water. In addition, the increased use of rainwater storage
areas (swales) or of partially sealed parking places facilitates the inﬁltration of rainwater and thus
the return of the water to natural cycle of circulation.

G4-EN10 | Aspect: Water | Environmental

Water recycled and reused
The recovery and recycling of water do not play an important role in the business activities of REWE
Group. Recycled water is not permitted to be used in the preparation of foods, for instance. In
consideration of the relatively small amounts of water used by administration ofﬁces, stores,
logistics warehouses and production sites, operating the company's own water processing system
would make little sense from an environmental or efﬁciency point of view.

G4-DMA | Aspects: Emissions | Environmental

Aspects: Emissions
Management approach: REWE Group understands its responsibility for the climate: A large portion
of global CO2 emissions is created during the production and consumption of products as well as
the provision of services. For this reason, REWE Group has made energy conservation and the
avoidance of climatically harmful emissions a high priority. And this issue will become even more
important as energy prices rise. Key challenges to be faced by REWE Group in future include cutting
energy consumption while addressing rising needs in the areas of freshness and convenience, work
that will require increased transports and refrigeration.
The strategic goal will be to make an active contribution to climate and resource protection or, at
the very least, to keep impacts on the climate and environment to a minimum. This commitment is
clearly spelled out in the Guidelines for Sustainable Business Practices of REWE Group. In 2009,
REWE Group set the goal of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions per square metre of sales area
by 30 per cent by 2015 compared with the base year 2006. As a result of the strides made in this
effort, the company modiﬁed the goal before it reached the target date. In the summer of 2013, it
set a more demanding climate goal of cutting speciﬁc greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2022
compared with the basis year 2006.
In addition to setting the overarching climate goal, REWE Group has deﬁned two KPIs that will be
used to monitor measures to achieve energy efﬁciency and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions:
!

!

Lowering electricity usage per square metre of sales area (as measured in kWh/m 2 ) by 7.5 per
cent between 2012 and 2022 and
Reducing refrigerant-related greenhouse gas emissions per square metre of sales area (in
kilograms of CO2 equivalent/m 2 ) by 35 per cent between 2012 and 2022

The KPIs focus on activities in energy, climate and the environment. These are areas where
signiﬁcant levels of consumption occur and where REWE Group can have a direct impact by taking
its own measures: energy efﬁciency (lighting and refrigeration) and refrigerant-related greenhouse
gas emissions.
Each strategic business unit and holding area in Germany and Austria have been given a speciﬁc
and binding target to reach. The investments that must be made in new technologies and
processes to achieve this goal are determined by the strategic business units and the holding areas
themselves. On the basis of this work, steps for future reporting periods are coordinated. The
progress made towards reaching the goals and the impact of the measures are reviewed annually.
The management of all areas of activity is conducted by the project group Energy, Climate and the
Environment. All strategic business units and relevant holding areas are represented in the group.
To document the progress being made in climate protection and to facilitate the monitoring of the

G4-DMA | Aspects: Emissions | Environmental

emission-reducing steps, REWE Group has hired independent experts to prepare an annual carbon
footprint report 1 since 2009. During the reporting period, this report was prepared by INFRAS AG
and the Österreichische Umweltbundesamt GmbH.

1
New public emission factors were added during the reporting period. As a result, the data in the carbon footprint report have changed in
comparison to previous years. In 2013, emission factors for electricity in Germany for 2011 and 2012 were modiﬁed. This resulted in a retroactive
adjustment in the amount of greenhouse gas emissions and an upward revision of them. In addition, new emission factors for paper were issued in
2013. These factors are up to 50 per cent higher than the ones applied in the past.

As in previous years, the IT tools GEMIS (Global Emissions Model for Integrated Systems) and TREMOD-Transport Emission Model were used to
determine the CO2 equivalent emission factors.
CO2 emissions were calculated in accordance with the GHG Protocol whereby the Scope 2 Guidance GHG Protocol hasn’t yet been applied.

Direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
At the beginning of 2008, REWE Group started to use only certiﬁed green power. New renewable
production systems play a particularly important role in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
For its electricity products, REWE Group takes steps to ensure that 25 per cent of the units are less
than three years old. In addition, it has added an obligation in contracts that is designed to ensure
that the expansion of new renewable energy units moves forward.
In determining its carbon footprint, REWE Group consciously decided to take a conservative
approach: Only the 25 per cent of green power from the new units was used as a minimising factor
in the carbon footprint. The other 75 per cent was included in the Germany-wide electricity mix.

Reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
REWE Group has launched a variety of electricity-saving initiatives designed to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions (see G4-EN6). As a result of these efforts, about 11,400 tonnes of CO2 equivalents
were saved in 2013 and 11,800 tonnes were saved in 2014. The reduction involved direct and
indirect energy-related emissions as well as other indirect emissions (Scopes 1, 2 and 3).

Emissions of ozone-depleting substances (ODS)
In recent years, REWE Group has systematically cut back on its use of ozone-depleting substances
– since 2006 by about 80 per cent. The chief reason for this decline was the legally mandated
replacement of the refrigerant R22 with such non-ozone-depleting refrigerants as R404A, R134a
and NH3. In 2012, the total amount of emissions of ozone-depleting substances from reﬁlled
refrigerants was 443 kilograms of CFC 11 equivalents and 348 kilograms in 2013. By 2014, the total
had been cut to 80 kilograms of CFC 11 equivalents.

NOx, SOx and other signiﬁcant air emissions
The airborne pollutants associated with the business activities of REWE Group are primarily caused
by the upstream combustion and production processes used to produce electricity, heat and paper.
In addition, emissions generated by refrigerants, logistics and business trips have an impact on air
quality.
With the exception of particulate matter, REWE Group slightly decreased signiﬁcant air emissions
from 2012 to 2014. The chief reasons for this decline were energy efﬁciency programmes, the
upgrading of the vehicle ﬂeet used in logistics and reduced use of heat in 2014.

Abwassereinleitung nach Qualität und Einleitungsort
REWE Group obtains its water exclusively from public waterworks. The company does not
introduce its wastewater directly into any body of water. Instead, its business locations direct it into
normal public and private wastewater treatment systems. A bigger role is played by water
withdrawal and disposal in the production of products. In this area, REWE Group conducts productrelated projects in its supply chain (see G4-EN8).

G4-EN23 | Aspect: Effluents and Waste | Environmental

Total weight of waste by type and disposal method
REWE Group systematically pursues a programme of recycling with its disposal partners. In
particular, this commitment is seen in the percentage of material and thermal reutilisation of nonhazardous waste. In 2008, this rate was more than 90 per cent. Since 2012, it has remained
relatively constant at more than 95 per cent. Nearly all paper, cardboard and boxes are recycled.
This group makes up the largest share of all waste at 44.2 per cent. A large amount of plastics,
metals, glass, construction waste and store rubbish is recycled as well. Organic waste produced in
food stores is transported to biogas units, where it is converted into electricity and heat.
The amount of non-hazardous waste in the company group in Germany and Austria totalled slightly
more than 600,000 tonnes in 2014. Hazardous waste, in particular certain types of used electric
equipment, oils, vehicle batteries and ﬂuorescent lamps, made up only a small portion of overall
waste during the reporting period with an absolute total of 1,300 tonnes to 1,700 tonnes. Compared
with non-hazardous waste, the amount of hazardous waste totalled signiﬁcantly less than 1 per
cent.

Aspect: Products and Services
Management approach: REWE Group plans to continuously expand its range of more sustainable
products and services, and create a place for them in the mass market. As part of this effort, the
company has developed the PRO PLANET process, a concept that was developed for foods, nearand non-food products as well as travel and tourism services. A modiﬁed process was developed in
2014 for products that toom Baumarkt DIY stores sell under the PRO PLANET name. This process
addresses the needs of the complex value chains of DIY store products. In the PRO PLANET
process, hot spot analysis is used to identify the adverse environmental and social impacts in the
life cycle. On the basis of these ﬁndings, measures are selected, examined during a feasibility study
and then implemented. Products that already have received established labels can also be given
the PRO PLANET label. Here, additional steps that extend beyond co-labelling are frequently taken.
The entire process is supported by an independent group: The PRO PLANET Board of Advisers
consists of ﬁve autonomous NGO experts who contribute their expert knowledge and approve the
issuance of the PRO PLANET label. The label informs customers about the particular feature that
was improved for each product. Additional information can be obtained at PRO PLANET by using a
code number
Another strategic goal is to increase the range of organic products. With the Guideline for
Ecological Products issued in 2014, REWE Group formulated a comprehensive list of requirements
related to organic store brands for supplies and companies to meet as well as created procedures
to monitor products and processes (see guideline). In places where it is feasible, the criteria of the
environmental agriculture association Naturland are applied to the organic products of REWE
Group. Products with this seal meet stricter requirements than those that apply to such seals as the
EU organic farming logo.
In the area of product packaging, REWE Group plans to promote recycling and the reuse of products
and packaging. In a dialogue with stakeholders and during internal workshops at REWE Group,
improvement potential was identiﬁed and recommendations were drawn up. These ideas were then
used in the preparation of a strategic packaging guideline.
As a member of the Recyclat Initiative, REWE Group and other partners won the ECR Award in 2014
for using plastic waste collected from private households in Germany to produce containers for
washing-up liquid.

For this ﬁgure, an adjustment has been made since the previous Sustainability Report on the basis of current data.

In recent years, REWE Group has made strides in its effort to increase the percentage of recycled
plastics. The toom Baumarkt DIY store sales line has continued to focus on paint. In 2011, for
instance, the DIY stores began to sell their white store brand paint in containers made completely
from recycled plastic. This range was expanded during the reporting period. As a result, 30
products were offered in paint containers made of recycled plastic (Procyclen®) in 2014. Beginning
in January 2015, the ﬁrst products made from this material were developed. REWE Group has also
increased the share of recycled plastic used in the containers of washing-up liquid for the store
brands sold by REWE and PENNY. In 2014, the BIPA sales line in Austria introduced a new line of
cosmetics called bi:good whose packaging is made of recycled plastic and recycled cardboard.

G4-EN28 | Aspect: Products and Services | Environmental

Reclaimed products and packaging
When it comes to packaging returned to stores, trade companies have limited capacities as a result
of hygienic regulations. Customers are indeed able to return outer packaging directly to the store.
But the direct return of sales packaging can be done only with beverage containers. This service
applies to returnable containers, something that REWE Group has offered for years. REWE Group
also sells beverages in non-returnable containers. By doing so, it not only addresses customer
needs, but also takes advantage of savings potential related to transport and handling.
In Germany, REWE Group accepts several 10,000 tonnes of returnable containers each year. These
containers can be completely recycled as a result of their sorted condition.
Since 2012, consumers have also had the opportunity to return energy-saving lamps to toom
Baumarkt DIY stores. Furthermore, REWE Group licenses its store brand products in Germany's dual
system of collection and recycling. By taking this step, REWE Group ensures that packaging is
collected near households and is then recycled. The recycling quota achieved with this dual system
regularly exceeds the legal requirements contained in the German Packaging Ordinance.

G4-DMA | Aspect: Compliance | Environmental

Aspect: Compliance
Management approach: At REWE Group, environmental laws and regulations play a particularly
important role in the construction and operation of stores and warehouse facilities. The company
carries out these activities in accordance with legal standards. In addition, REWE Group is
committed to its Guidelines for Sustainable Business Practices regarding environmental and
resource protection and to a far-sighted analysis of environmental risks. Risk assessment and
observance of laws are part of the compliance organisation (see G4-57 and the aspect “Anticorruption”).

Units that are no longer part of REWE Group were factored out to enhance comparability. As a result, the levels of

trafﬁc-related greenhouse gas emissions for 2012 have changed since the previous report.
Area of application: The indicator was applied to the entire REWE Group Germany and Austria, including partners. The
units of consumer electronics and Kressner were not included because they are no longer part of REWE Group.

G4-DMA | Aspect: Supplier Environmental Assessment | Environmental

Aspect: Supplier Environmental Assessment
Management approach: As an international trade company, REWE Group obtains a large variety of
products and product ingredients from countries outside the European Union. In their purchasing
activities, all sales lines must obtain products at favourable terms while also ensuring that
production is done in a socially and environmentally conscious manner.
The basic values contained in the the Guidelines for Sustainable Business Practices also apply to
the business partners and suppliers of REWE Group. REWE Group reserves the right to apply
sanctions when the values contained in the guidelines are deliberately and ﬂagrantly breached.
REWE Group strives to make its very complex global supply chain more sustainable in cooperation
with its suppliers. This is achieved in part by playing an active role in product and industry initiatives
like the Social Business Compliance Initiative (BSCI), the cross-industry guidelines for raw materials
and the PRO PLANET sustainability label.

G4-EN32 | Aspect: Supplier Environmental Assessment | Environmental

Percentage of new suppliers that were screened using
environmental criteria
The Guidelines for Sustainable Business Practices of REWE Group have one objective: to work
with business partners and implement binding standards that apply to their joint supply chain. In
2013/2014, a working group developed a supplier questionnaire that addresses all 16 factors of the
guidelines.
With the help of a specially developed algorithm, these factors are measured using new indicators
(the public, goals, measures, measurability, area of responsibility, supply chain, certiﬁcation, selfevaluation and risk assessment). The extent of sustainability for individual companies and value
chain steps is then described. The validation of this approach was conducted during a pilot phase
carried out in the second quarter of 2015 with 48 suppliers (food/non-food). The roll-out for other
store brand suppliers is planned to start in the fourth quarter of 2015.

G4-EN33 | Aspect: Supplier Environmental Assessment | Environmental

Signiﬁcant environmental impacts in the supply chain
Based on the questionnaire concept described in EN32, REWE Group will be able to measure the
degree to which the indicators have been achieved. In an additional step, plans have been made to
audit 1 per cent to 2 per cent of suppliers and to validate the results. The evaluation scheme makes
it possible to identify signiﬁcant deviations and expresses the degree of achievement as a
percentage. Steps are taken if signiﬁcant deviations are found. Under initial plans, the contract
partners will be informed about the corresponding issues. If necessary, steps like certiﬁcation
measures (including BSCI membership or participation in the GRASP module) or training will be
recommended. A development plan will then be worked out with the contract partner. The objective
is to jointly work on improvements and to support the suppliers' capacity-building processes.

G4-DMA | Aspect: Employment | Labor Practices and Decent Work

Aspect: Employment
Management approach: Satisﬁed, hard-working employees form the foundation of REWE Group's
long-term business success. Understanding this, the company offers attractive and fair working
conditions to its employees. These conditions include fair pay, additional company beneﬁts that
extend beyond the level of negotiated wages, ﬂexible working models that can be adjusted to meet
individual employees' needs and tailored jobs that facilitate a work-live balance.
The Employee Project Group in which all of our strategic business units are represented oversees
sustainability management for the "employee" pillar. The group meets four times a year as part of a
human resources conference. In addition, project-group work is also coordinated. The company's
Mission Statement and its Guidelines for Sustainable Business Practices, a set of principles
based on the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the conventions of the International
Labour Association (ILO), serve as the basis of REWE Group's actions. In 2008, the company also
created the International Working Group of REWE Group Works Councils (IARB, since 2015
European Works Council), in which Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia are
represented. During the reporting period, the working group focused on such issues as
standardising activities aimed at preventing assaults and robberies as well as promoting and
introducing a dual studies programme like the one used by Germany in the food retail sector in
Central and Eastern Europe at PENNY. In addition, all employees are subject to the code of conduct
at REWE Group.
In 2014, REWE Group welcomes the statutory minimum wage approved by the German government.
In its work with contractors, REWE Group focuses on compliance with minimum social standards.
In 2011, REWE Group introduced the "Guideline on Minimum Standards for the Use of Contractor
Employees" on the national level. The guideline applies to the use of both temporary employment
agencies and to work and service agreements. The company will work with only those contract
partners who pledge to apply minimum social standards and to pay any minimum negotiated
wages as well as the statutory minimum wage for their employees. To ensure that the contract
partners comply with the standards, REWE Group has worked with TÜV Rheinland, a leading
international technical service provider in Germany, to develop an auditing process. The audits are
conducted in the areas of product replenishment, picking and cleaning personnel.
Regular employee surveys help REWE Group to assess the satisfaction level of employees and
identify areas that need to be addressed. As a family friendly company, REWE Group has been
certiﬁed by berufundfamilie GmbH, a work-life balance initiative of the non-proﬁt Herti Foundation,
in accordance with the "audit berufundfamilie" since 2009. A large number of REWE stores,
administration sites and logistics locations have already been certiﬁed. Until mid-2015, an
additional 2,400 REWE stores will undergo the "audit berufundfamilie" process. As a result, more
than 80,000 employees of REWE stores across Germany are being reached and can proﬁt from
more ﬂexible working models or family- and life-phase-focused shift planning (see
berufundfamilie).

New employee hires and employee turnover
For years now, the employee turnover rate at REWE Group has been relatively stable: It fell from 16.3
per cent (2012) to 14.7 per cent in 2014. During the same period, the hiring rate of new employees
dropped from 17.2 per cent (2012) to 14.6 per cent in 2014. The increased number of new hirings in
2014 by National Specialist Stores resulted from the bankruptcy of Praktiker, a development that led
to the acquisition of 16 stores.

Beneﬁts provided to full-time employees
In addition to negotiated wages, REWE Group offers excellent company beneﬁts. These beneﬁts will
be granted to all employees in varying degrees. The company offers no beneﬁts that are available
only to full-time employees.

G4-LA3 | Aspect: Employment | Labor Practices and Decent Work

Return to work and retention rates after parental leave
REWE Group is an advocate of work-life balance and makes it as easy as possible for employees to
return to their jobs following parental leave. In 2014, 7,805 employees in Germany and Austria took
parental leave. The group consisted of 401 male workers and 7,404 female employees. During the
previous year, 7,211 employees went on parental leave. This group consisted of 6,959 female
employees and 252 male workers. The right to parental leave is legally regulated in Germany and
Austria. REWE Group has developed a number of measures designed to ensure that it remains in
contact with employees taking parental leave. In one such programme, the REWE headquarters of
National Full-Range Stores assigns an individual to each person on parental leave. This individual
will inform the employee about such activities as invitations to town hall meetings and other
internal company events.
Employees also receive information from the REWE headquarters organisation brochure and the
Works Council newsletter. Each year, the Works Council also holds an information day for
employees on parental leave. In addition, employees on parental leave are invited to town hall
meetings, Christmas parties and carnival festivities.

Aspect: Labor/Management Relations
Management approach: Statutory, collective-bargaining and company rules are implemented in a
trusting relationship with employee representatives. In addition, the combine-wide Guidelines for
Sustainable Business Practices are applied. These guidelines are based on the U.N. Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and the conventions of the International Labour Association (ILO). The
Guidelines say: "We respect the right of employees to form independent and free worker
organisations and to conduct free negotiations regarding employees’ wages and rights." The
company's working relationship with the Works Council is conducted among equals and involves
cooperative discussions.

G4-LA4 | Aspect: Labor/Management Relations | Labor Practices and Decent Work

Minimum notice period(s) regarding operational changes
In its role as elected employee representatives or through representatives on the Supervisory Board,
the Works Council plays a role in nearly all decisions taken by REWE Group. In observance of codetermination and other participation rights, employee committees are provided with information in
a timely manner, their views on issues are heard and agreements are reached with them. REWE
Group maintains a dynamic, intense and trusting relationship with Works Councils. Their
representatives are members of a large number of company bodies, including the IT and logistics
committees. Company-related changes are jointly discussed at an early stage. This was particularly
the case in 2013 when REWE Group closed its consumer electronics division, ProMarkt.

G4-DMA | Aspect: Occupational Health and Safety | Labor Practices and Decent Work

Aspect: Occupational Health and Safety
Management approach: Combine-wide health management at REWE Group is assigned to the
holding area Human Resources Combine. It coordinates concepts for occupational health
management, occupational safety and occupational medicine. It provides the strategic business
units with services in these areas as well as with assistance with occupational safety, preparation
of screening issues, Fit.Netz activities and help with projects. REWE Markt GmbH has selected its
own occupational safety specialists and is not supported by the holding. In REWE supermarkets,
trained employees are responsible for occupational health and safety. At REWE International AG,
full-time specialists in occupational safety and external occupational medicine provide support to
the work sites of trade and headquarters companies in accordance with the German Occupational
Safety Act (Arbeitnehmerschutzgesetz).
In compliance with governmental and employers' liability insurance association regulations, work
sites are regularly inspected, systematic analysis of accidents is conducted, evaluations of
occupational safety reports by government ofﬁcials, trade supervisory centres, the German
Occupational Safety Agency and an employers' liability insurance association are performed and
regular meetings of the Occupational Safety Committee are held. Another key job is to increase
employees' awareness levels about occupational safety as well as healthful working conditions and
processes. As part of a continuous development process, focal points are regularly reviewed and
expanded. One of the focal points is to develop "technically modern" and efﬁcient risk assessment.
The goal is to create a system that can be used to identify and evaluate risk areas and to develop
recommendations for suitable implementation measures. Risk assessment is based on systematic
store inspections using electronic measurement of risks. In addition, employee surveys and
checklists that are documented in IT systems to the greatest extent possible are used during
physical risk assessments. A key performance indicator (KPI) designed to monitor the long-term
impact was deﬁned: lowering accidents from 50.6 per 1,000 FTEs (full-time equivalents) in 2010 to
48.0 accidents by 2015.
In addition to addressing "traditional" occupational and safety issues, REWE Group systematically
works to promote the good health of its employees. The company's goal is to further lower the
number of paid sick days. The KPI being used to measure this progress is the reduction in the days
of paid sick leave. This total should be lowered to 3.5 per cent by 2015 (compared with 3.6 per cent
in 2010). To reach this goal, REWE Group has expanded an array of health-promotion programmes
and projects as well as created new ones. In one reﬂection of this effort, a single company-wide
service provider is responsible for occupational medicine support of the sales lines of REWE Group
(REWE, PENNY, toom Baumarkt, ProMarkt 1 and Travel and Tourism). This work is coordinated by
the chief medical ofﬁcer in coordination with the heads of the business units and occupational
safety experts in a needs-based manner that corresponds to strategic objectives.

The stores of the consumer electronics division that operated under the ProMarkt brand name were sold or closed in 2013.

G4-LA5 | Aspect: Occupational Health and Safety | Labor Practices and Decent Work

Percentage of total workforce represented in health and safety
committees
In their role as key groups, the Occupational Safety Committees (OSCs) are organised in the
strategic business units of REWE Group. In the business units that are particularly decentralised
(REWE, PENNY), members of the committees consist of regional executives, representatives from
sales, employees in the construction department, safety ofﬁcers, members of the Works Council,
safety experts and the company physician in accordance with legal requirements. In the national
business units, meetings are conducted with the representatives responsible for a particular
subject. Overall, more than 75 per cent of the company's entire workforce in Germany is
represented by Occupational Safety Committees. OSC meetings are held regularly to examine
accident statistics broken down by business unit and region. During this work, accidents are
analysed and accident-prevention recommendations are made by the occupational safety ofﬁcer.
Afterwards, these recommendations are implemented by executives in the strategic business units
and regions in the best possible manner.
In addition to the OSC meetings, the National Labour Team on Health Management convenes
quarterly. The group develops recommendations about such areas as occupational safety,
company physician care and health promotion. A decision about implementing the ideas is then
taken by the responsible executives (human resources directors) in the business units.
On-site occupational safety is provided by qualiﬁed full-time employees: At the Cologne
headquarters sites, PENNY, toom Baumarkt DIY stores, toom consumer markets 1 and ProMarkt 2 ,
qualiﬁed prevention ofﬁcers from central health management serve as local occupational safety
experts. An occupational safety ofﬁcer also works in Travel and Tourism.
REWE Markt GmbH has selected its own occupational safety specialists and is not supported by
the holding. In REWE supermarkets, trained employees are responsible for occupational health and
safety. As a new business, REWE Digital became a member of REWE Markt GmbH's support area in
mid-2014. REWE Digital conducts its own national OSC meetings in its role as a national unit.
At REWE International AG, full-time specialists in occupational safety and external occupational
medicine provide support to the work sites of trade and headquarters companies in accordance
with the German Occupational Safety Act. Occupational Safety Committee meetings are held twice
a year at locations with more than 100 employees. Representatives are regional ofﬁcers,
employees, occupational safety experts, occupational health physicians, safety ofﬁcers and Works
Council members. In addition, a central OSC meeting is held annually at the company headquarters.
This meeting is chaired by the employer and attended by representatives of the groups cited above.

Injuries, occupational diseases, lost days, and work-related
fatalities
The accident statistics tracked by REWE Group cover occupational accidents and the lost work
days caused by them. They also facilitate an evaluation by gender and work area. Like the statistics
of the employers' liability insurance association, the ﬁgures involve reportable accidents per 1,000
full time equivalents (FTEs).
In 2014, the accident rate was 48.3 accidents per 1,000 FTEs. Within a period of two years, the rate
has decreased by nearly 2.3 accidents per 1,000 FTEs. One reason for this largely positive trend –
which varies by business unit – is the reduced number of accidents that occur on the way to work
and back. In 2014, ﬁve deaths were reported. The total was three in 2013.
The number of sick days at REWE Group climbed from 5.56 in 2012 to 5.8 per cent in 2013 and then
to 5.92 in 2014. The number of paid sick days rose from 3.76 in 2012 to 3.99 in 2013, while it fell
minimally to 3.94 per cent in 2014. In general, sick days are rising throughout Germany. In 2013,
Germany also experienced a ﬂu epidemic that had an impact on the number of paid sick days.
The sick day statistics for 2013 (based on a health report of all German public health insurance
providers) show that the number of lost work days per case of illness at REWE Group remains
above the industry's levels. The number of work incapacity cases rose to nearly 1.3 cases per
insured person. In a reﬂection of demographic trends, the number of sick days among older people
rises as a result of a proportionally increased length of occupational incapacity. Given the
heterogeneity of REWE Group, industry comparisons on the aggregated level are not particularly
meaningful.
REWE Group has increasingly focused on the health report covering all types of health insurance
schemes since its introduction in 2008 and discusses it in various committees. The health report
covers cases of work incapacity in REWE Group reported to major health insurance providers. Data
about occupational illnesses are not documented. But experience has shown that only a small
number of occupational illnesses are reported at REWE Group.
Like the entire retail business, robberies remain an issue at REWE Group. The affected employees
can suffer physical and psychological damage as a result of such incidents, causing them to miss
work for a signiﬁcant period of time. Acute intervention following traumatic events can provide
major assistance. In 2012, 293 employees were victims of robberies in Germany and Austria.
During the reporting period, this total fell to 238 (2013) and to 213 (2014).
REWE Group service providers are generally independent, decentralised contract partners. As a
result, data about accident rates, sick days and deaths involving external service providers are not
collected.

Workers with high incidence or risk of diseases
There is no indication that employees have a high illness rate or health risks as a result of their jobs.
The issue of workplace ergonomics plays a major role on the store and logistics operations. The
repetitive movements that employees perform in these areas as well as incorrect ways of lifting,
carrying and standing frequently result in pain and missed days at work. During the reporting period,
ergonomic training and action days regarding back health were offered in many regions.
In health promotion activities, dealing with stress and mental strain plays an important role. Mental
strain can sometimes have a devastating effect on people's employability, motivation and job
performance. For this reason, REWE Group worked with the Institute for Health Promotion in 2011
to develop a project called "LoS! – Lebensphasen orientierte Selbsthilfekompetenz" (or Life Phase
Oriented Self-Help Skills).
To prevent addiction, REWE Group joined the DAK health insurer in conducting action days at
Cologne business locations in 2014. Across Germany, more than 30 employees of REWE Group
have been trained as occupational addiction ofﬁcers. In this role, they can answer questions posed
by colleagues and managers as well as hold conﬁdential conversations.
The pilot project "Voll im Leben – Kenn Dein Limit" (In the Middle of Life – Know Your Limit) aims its
addiction prevention activities directly at adolescents and young employees. It was conducted in
2013 for the ﬁrst time with about 350 trainees and was honoured as a "project with role model
character" by the employers' liability insurance association Berufsgenossenschaft für Handel und
Warendistribution (BGHW). As a result of the strong response among young employees, "Voll im
Leben – Kenn Dein Limit" became a permanent part of training at REWE Southwest in 2014.
Company integration management assists employees who return to work after long health-related
absences. It focuses on legal regulations and takes account of company conditions like location
and employee structures. Furthermore, all employees in the Region South can use the rehabilitation
newtork Netzwerk Reha REWE – a partnership project organised by REWE, the German State
Pension Agency Bavaria South, Swabia and Northern Bavaria as well as a number of rehabilitation
hospitals. The network enables employees to receive systematic, high-quality and work-related
rehabilitation.

Health and safety topics covered in formal agreements with
trade unions
In its occupational safety efforts, REWE Group complies with legal requirements and rules issued
by employers' liability insurance associations. REWE Group does not treat occupational safety
issues separately in formal agreements it reaches with unions.

G4-DMA | Aspect: Training and Education | Labor Practices and Decent Work

Aspect: Training and Education
Management approach: Positioning REWE Group as an attractive employer in order to recruit
talented individuals is an important goal of the company. The demographic shift and the shortage
of skilled employees arising from this trend have turned this goal into an even higher priority. The
company is working to recruit as many skilled employees and executives from its own ranks as
possible and to establish a long-term relationship with qualiﬁed and motivated employees.
This is why REWE Group continuously expands its range of employee development activities. Once
an individual has joined the company, he or she can choose from a broad range of training
programmes. The challenge of this work is to design the training courses in such a way that they
meet the sale lines' broad range of needs while also considering the employee's individual
requirements. This is done by offering comprehensive seminar programmes, individual advanced
training and coaching sessions to all employees throughout their entire careers at REWE Group.
Through its systematic career and succession planning, the company ensures that openings for
skilled employees and managers are ﬁlled by internal candidates to the greatest extent possible.
The goal of increasing the share of internal hirings of managers to 68.4 per cent by 2015 was
actually achieved in 2012. By 2014, it had climbed to 76.4 per cent.

G4-LA9 | Aspect: Training and Education | Labor Practices and Decent Work

Average Hours of training
Training hours are tracked decentrally. In 2013, the entire workforce of REWE Group completed an
average of 10.6 training hours. The total rose to 11.5 hours in 2014.
REWE Group offers training in a wide range of occupations. In addition to traditional trainee
occupations, REWE Group gives people an opportunity to take part in a college-level programme
that combines theory and practice. This programme is offered at such institutions of higher
learning as the European University of Applied Sciences, the Baden-Württemberg Cooperative State
University, the University of Applied Sciences for Business and the Frankfurt University of Applied
Sciences. The courses of study focus in particular on the areas of trade and tourism management
as well as information systems. The programme is designed to provide a practical form of
university education. In 2013, 155 students in Germany and Austria were part of the programme.
The total rose to 165 in 2014.

Programs that support the continued employability of
employees
REWE Group provides all employees and managers with a broad range of internal education and
training programmes that are designed to help these individuals to grow in both personal and
professional terms. With prior consent, executives can take part in coaching and supervision
programmes. As a rule, external training programmes are worked out on an individual basis and
ﬁnancially supported.
Development of Young Employees
The company systematically develops young employees with the help of the association REWE
Nachwuchsförderung e. V. that was set up in 1964. In 2013, the association began to conduct the
sustainability competition "REWE Group Star": In a combine-wide team competition, trainees and
young employees can jointly plan and carry out sustainability campaigns based on one of the
company's four pillars of sustainability. In doing so, they gain an understanding of the importance
of sustainability in trade. In 2012, the individual strategic business units became solely responsible
for trainee marketing. These units can systematically recruit new trainees and cover the need for
skilled employees.
Education
In addition to the broad range of training opportunities for all employees of REWE Group, the
company provides executives with special education programmes. The Management Academy and
the Management Campus are two demanding and comprehensive internal advanced training
programmes that are designed to teach knowledge needed on the job and to facilitate combinewide networking of managers in REWE Group. With classroom courses, lectures, coaching and
other learning opportunities, the Management Campus supports the continuous professional
growth of upper-level managers. In one special aspect of this work, managers attend a seminar
called "Sustainability 2.0" where they have an opportunity to discuss how the value of sustainability
can be integrated into the company's management and culture.
Holistic management planning requires targeted development of young employees. With its
Management Academy, an effort that was formerly called the General Management Programme
(GMP), REWE Group provides individual support to high potential candidates working on the
management level below Top Executive. The academy is designed to address the individual needs
of managers and to continuously improve the quality of management.
On the store level, PENNY employs a management development programme for its discount
business known by the German acronym FeDi to develop and promote prospective and new store
managers. It also trains them in professional and personal terms for the position of store manager.
In addition, the company offers job-entry programmes for new district managers and executives,
management workshops for all PENNY managers, free individual seminars for managers and
employees as well as store system training courses for store personnel, store managers and
district managers. PENNY also provides trainers with the opportunity to attend a train the trainer

G4-LA10 | Aspect: Training and Education | Labor Practices and Decent Work

programme certiﬁed by the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce. During the reporting
period, REWE Markt GmbH created a continuing education programme for young retailers called
Junior Campus that is designed to help participants to become self-employed.
Sustainability Training
All purchasers at REWE Far East and in the non-food area receive training in sustainability issues
that pertain to their work, including seminars about the Code of Conduct of the Business Social
Initiative (BSCI). Other courses address raw materials, an area about which REWE Group has
prepared guidelines. These raw materials include ﬁsh, palm oil and soybeans. In addition, the
training focuses on special issues that apply to REWE Group like ways to avoid environmentally
harmful chemicals.
Redundancies
For employees whom REWE Group declares redundant, the company works with employee
representatives to develop a redundancy programme when necessary. Such programmes frequently
include qualiﬁcation activities for the employee that are designed to help him or her ﬁnd another
position.

G4-LA11 | Aspect: Training and Education | Labor Practices and Decent Work

Percentage of employees receiving regular performance and
career development reviews
The career and succession planning (CSP) of REWE Group is a critically important aspect of groupwide talent management. The planning process is designed to recruit skilled workers and managers
from the company's own ranks, to identify high-potential employees at an early stage as well as to
create a long-term relationship with motivated employees and to develop these individuals' skills.
In each strategic business unit as well as in headquarters, the CSP process begins with a review of
the responsibilities contained in the job description. A manager will evaluate the performance of an
employee on the basis of task fulﬁlment and abilities. In addition, an evaluation of the employee's
potential is made. This appraisal and the employee's own self-assessment are then discussed
during so-called potential conferences held by management.
During the potential conferences, managers on a particular hierarchical level will discuss
employees whom they directly supervise. The aim is to develop joint standards for judging
performance and potential, to set up targeted and effective development planning and to create the
basis for systematic succession planning. The potential conferences for Top Executives and for
managers on the level directly beneath them are held annually. For most employee groups on the
other levels, potential conferences are generally held every two years.
The subsequent annual development meeting ensures that goals, requirements and work results,
aspects of the working relationship and questions about personal and professional development
are discussed, documented and systematically addressed. The direct supervisor conducts the
conﬁdential development meeting with each of his or her employees once a year.
In 2011, the company began to systematically depict the career and succession planning for the
entire combine in SAP on a step-by-step basis. The application optimises the process and makes it
transparent. In 2013, the CSP process was depicted for 14,168 employees. In 2014, the total rose to
17,936. Each year, further employee groups will be added. In 2014, for instance, store managers at
PENNY were incorporated.

G4-DMA | Aspect: Diversity and Equal Opportunity | Labor Practices and Decent Work

Aspect: Diversity and Equal Opportunity
Management approach: The promotion of diversity in the company is a critical factor in its
business success. Companies that focus on diversity improve their ability to adapt to changing
market conditions and improve their competitive position in the race to recruit qualiﬁed skilled
employees. With this in mind, REWE Group focuses its personnel management work on creating a
diverse employee structure and on maintaining a discrimination-free workplace for employees
irrespective of their gender, age, religion, sexual identity, origin or disability in which all employees
have equal opportunities. This also includes equal pay for men and women.
In this effort, the company focuses on the following issues:
!

Generation mainstreaming encompasses respect for all generations in the company's culture
and the promotion of good working relationships among various age groups. In light of the
growing number of older employees in the company, this work plays an important role.

!

Disability mainstreaming ensures that employees with disabilities have equal treatment. This
effort includes work areas and work stations adapted to the needs of the disabled. People with
disabilities and people at risk of disability can turn to the company's representative for the
disabled at any time. This representative assists them with the preparation of applications to the
German Ofﬁce for Social Services, reintegration into the work world following a long absence
due to illness and all other legal questions.

!

Appreciation of cultural diversity is the focal point of cultural mainstreaming, an effort in which
REWE Group promotes intercultural and open structures and processes.

!

The gender balance is designed to further the gender-speciﬁc promotion of professional and
personal abilities and development opportunities.

!

REWE Group is committed to creating a work-life balance for employees.

The commitment to discrimination-free formulation of company human resources policies is
included in the Guidelines for Sustainable Business Practices at REWE Group. It is also a
fundamental component of the code of conduct that applies to all employees and managers.

G4-LA12 | Aspect: Diversity and Equal Opportunity | Labor Practices and Decent Work

Composition of governance bodies and breakdown of
employees by aspects of diversity
Women made up 70.4 per cent of the total workforce of REWE Group in 2014. They also composed
47.6 per cent of the company's managers (2012: 47.3 per cent, 2013: 47.2 per cent) per cent. The
share of women among its top management was 10.3 per cent (2012: 11.1 per cent; 2013: 11.8 per
cent).
The Supervisory Board of REWE-Zentral-Aktiengesellschaft (RZAG) had 18 ordinary members (16
men and two women) in 2014. The Supervisory Board of REWE-ZENTRALFINANZ eG (RZF) had 20
ordinary members (17 men and three women) in 2014. No women were members of the
Management Board in the reporting period. No women were members of the Managing Board or
the Supervisory Board of REWE International AG.
REWE Group determines the employment rate of people with disabilities in accordance with section
2 of the German Social Welfare Code (Sozialgesetzbuch). Under this deﬁnition, the employment rate
of employees with disabilities at REWE Group was 2.9 per cent in 2014, a slight increase from
previous years (2013: 2.7 per cent, 2012: 2.6 per cent). In Germany, no comprehensive reporting
requirement applies to people with disabilities. For this reason, all employees with a reported
disability are included in this calculation.

gender-neutral compensation. It is also a fundamental component of the code of conduct that
applies to all employees and managers. With its non-discriminatory systems, REWE Group ensures
that female employees do not experience any reduction in non-negotiated compensation. This
includes a ranking system that focuses exclusively on the job requirement and qualiﬁcation level of
the respective position – regardless of the particular person who holds the position.
In addition to ensuring gender-neutral compensation, external recruiters are required to submit both
female and male candidates to ﬁll vacant positions.

Aspect: Supplier Assessment for Labor Practices
Management approach: As an international trade company, REWE Group obtains a large variety of
products and product ingredients from countries outside the European Union. In their purchasing
activities, all sales lines must obtain products at favourable terms while also ensuring that
production is done in a socially and environmentally conscious manner.
The basic values contained in the Guidelines for Sustainable Business Practices also apply to the
business partners and suppliers of REWE Group. REWE Group reserves the right to apply sanctions
when the values contained in the guidelines are deliberately and ﬂagrantly breached.
REWE Group strives to make its very complex global supply chain more sustainable in cooperation
with its suppliers. This is achieved in part by playing an active role in product and industry initiatives
like the Social Business Compliance Initiative (BSCI), the cross-industry guidelines for raw materials
and the PRO PLANET sustainability label.

G4-LA14 | Aspect: Supplier Assessment for Labor Practices | Labor Practices and Decent Work

Percentage of new suppliers that were screened using labor
practices criteria
The Guidelines for Sustainable Business Practices of REWE Group have one objective: to work
with business partners and implement binding standards for their joint supply chain. This goal
should be reached by taking three steps:
!

Boosting the number of non-food suppliers with social audits (BSCI) from developing countries
to 85 per cent by 2015

!

Since the beginning of 2014, store brand suppliers in the fruit and vegetable segment have been
contractually obligated to comply with the Global G.A.P. GRASP (G.A.P: Good Agricultural
Practice, GRASP: GLOBALG.A.P. Risk Assessment on Social Practice) module or a similar
standard. An exemption has been granted to QS-certiﬁed companies because an equivalent
standard of QS GmbH will not be available until 2015. This requirement will be extended to all
fruit and vegetable supply partners in 2015.

!

Developing a supplier questionnaire that contains all 16 factors in the guidelines. The labourpractices criteria are a ban on forced labour, a prohibition on child labour, fair dealings with
employees, the promotion of equal treatment, employee rights to freedom of association and
collective bargaining, work schedule rules, compensation and occupational health and safety.
The environmental criteria are climate protection, conservation of resources, protection of
endangered species, biodiversity, animal protection and experimentation as well as risk
management covering the use of environmentally relevant operating resources. With the help of
a specially developed algorithm, these factors are measured using nine indicators (the public,
goals, measures, measurability, area of responsibility, supply chain, certiﬁcation, self-evaluation
and risk assessment). The extent of sustainability for individual companies and value chain
steps is then described. The validation of this approach was conducted during a pilot phase
carried out in the second quarter of 2015 with 48 suppliers (food/non-food). The roll-out for
other store brand suppliers is planned to start in the fourth quarter of 2015.

G4-LA15 | Aspect: Supplier Assessment for Labor Practices | Labor Practices and Decent Work

Signiﬁcant impacts for labor practices in the supply chain
Based on the questionnaire concept described in LA14, REWE Group will be able to measure the
degree to which the indicators have been achieved. In an additional step, plans have been made to
audit 1 per cent to 2 per cent of suppliers and to validate the results. The evaluation scheme makes
it possible to identify signiﬁcant deviations and expresses the degree of achievement as a
percentage. Steps are taken if signiﬁcant deviations are found. Under initial plans, the contract
partners will be informed about the corresponding issues. If necessary, steps like certiﬁcation
measures (including BSCI membership or participation in the GRASP module) or training will be
recommended. A development plan will then be worked out with the contract partner. The objective
is to jointly work on improvements and to support the suppliers' capacity-building processes.

G4-DMA | Aspect: Labor Practices Grievance Mechanisms | Labor Practices and Decent Work

Aspect: Labor Practices Grievance Mechanisms
Management approach: To ensure that fair labour practices are used in the supply chain, new
processes are being developed. Once implemented, these processes will include the approach to
complaints and notiﬁcations about unfair labour practices. See the aspect "Supplier Assessment
for Labor Practices" as well as LA14 and LA15.
No formal process has been developed to address complaints about labour practices in REWE
Group. When they have a complaint, employees can speak with a variety of different contact
partners. In addition to managers, these partners include the Works Councils and the
representatives for employees with severe disabilities.

G4-LA16 | Aspect: Labor Practices Grievance Mechanisms | Labor Practices and Decent Work

Grievances about labor practices
No process is currently available to register formal complaints about labour practices in the supply
chain. Of course, REWE Group complies with Germany's General Act on Equal Treatment
(Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz) that governs employees' complaint rights. But formal
complaints about the labour practices of REWE Group are not recorded centrally.
See the aspects “Non-discrimination” and “Compliance”.

G4-DMA | Aspect: Investment | Human Rights

Aspect: Investment
Management approach: The Guidelines for Sustainable Business Practices of REWE Group apply
to all business relationships. The guidelines are based on the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and the conventions of the International Labour Association (ILO), among other principles.
They address such issues as a ban on forced labour and exploitative child labour as well as fair
employee policies. REWE Group reserves the right to apply sanctions when the values contained in
the guidelines are deliberately and ﬂagrantly breached.

G4-HR1 | Aspect: Investment | Human Rights

Signiﬁcant investment agreements and contracts that include
human rights clauses or screening
As the evaluation basis for countries where the risk of human rights violations is particularly high,
REWE Group uses the list of BSCI 1 risk countries. During the reporting period, no signiﬁcant
investments were made in BSCI risk countries. The majority of REWE Group's own business sites
are located in the European Union.

G4-HR2 | Aspect: Investment | Human Rights

Employee training on human rights issues
All employees of REWE Group who work in non-food purchasing in Germany and at REWE Far East
receive regular training about relevant sustainability issues. This ensures that the deﬁned social
standards, including BSCI, are considered in the selection of suppliers and in the purchasing
process.

G4-DMA | Aspect: Non-discrimination | Human Rights

Aspect: Non-discrimination
Management approach: The corporate culture of REWE Group is characterised by a trusting and
respectful relationship among customers, employees and business partners. This commitment is
laid down in the company's fundamental values. In addition, the Guidelines for Sustainable
Business Practices apply to all employees and business partners. These guidelines include a
clearly formulated ban on discrimination: "We do not tolerate discrimination in employment and in
the workplace for reasons of gender, race, religion, ethnic heritage, age, nationality, marital status,
sexual orientation, disability, social background or political orientation." This principle applies to the
hiring of new employees, current employees and business partners. Allegations about
discrimination are thoroughly investigated.

G4-HR3 | Aspect: Non-discrimination | Human Rights

Incidents of discrimination and corrective actions taken
REWE Group conducts a thorough investigation of discrimination allegations. Should the
allegations turn out to be true, disciplinary and possibly personnel measures are taken. No
discrimination cases were reported during the reporting period.

G4-DMA | Aspect: Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining | Human Rights

Aspect: Freedom of Association and Collective
Bargaining
Management approach: The Guidelines for Sustainable Business Practices of REWE Group apply
to all business relationships. The guidelines are based on the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and the conventions of the International Labour Association (ILO). They concern a ban on
forced labour and exploitative child labour as well as fair employee policies. REWE Group reserves
the right to apply sanctions when the values contained in the guidelines are deliberately and
ﬂagrantly breached.
REWE Group takes a risk-based approach to its activities and ensures that production sites in risk
countries from which it obtains products are socially audited. Recognised social standards are the
Standard of the Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI), the SA8000 Standard and the
Standard of the International Council of Toy Industries (ICTI).
In 2008, REWE Group joined the BSCI, an alliance of companies that are committed to improving
labour and social standards in risk countries. To achieve this goal, BSCI members have developed
the BSCI code of conduct. This code was revised in 2014. Its requirements include a renunciation of
exploitative child and forced labour as well as freedom of association and collective bargaining.
Drawing on its Guidelines for Sustainable Business Practices, REWE Group has also developed a
supplier questionnaire that it uses to help suppliers to estimate the level of commitment to
sustainability aspects in their company and to improve it. In this regard, see the aspect: " Supplier
Human Rights Assessment".
As the evaluation basis for countries where the risk of human rights violations is particularly high,
REWE Group uses the list of BSCI risk countries 1 . Because the majority of REWE Group's own
business sites are located in the European Union, which is not included among risk countries, no
supplemental social audits are conducted.

REWE Group obtains non-food products, including household goods, primarily from Asian countries.
Many of these countries are on the list of BSCI risk countries * . For this reason, REWE Group pays
careful attention to ensure that the products it buys come from socially audited production sites in
these countries.
REWE Group purchases non-food products through its own purchasing cooperative REWE Far East
(RFE) or through other importers. In 2014, 89 per cent of RFE revenue in risk countries was
generated in factories that had undergone social audits. The other importers that supply REWE
Group with non-food products must also demonstrate that their production sites have undergone a
recognised social audit.

The result of 35 per cent of socially audited production sites, in terms of RFE revenue, in 2013 was
due to a change in the data-collection process. Before 2013, the auditing was conducted on the
supplier level. It was then broken down to the much more meaningful level of production sites. For
this reason, not all factories from which REWE Group obtained goods through RFE were known in
2013. In 2013 and 2014, REWE Group worked intensely to increase the level of transparency in its
supply chains, to directly track the production sites and to have production sites in risk countries
undergo audits.
In 2014, more than one-third of production sites received an assessment score of "good" or had a
SA8000 or ICTI certiﬁcate. The remaining two-thirds of factories must improve their social
standards performance. On the basis of this ﬁnding, the company is monitoring the implementation
of improvement recommendations included in the audit reports and requires the production sites to
participate in BSCI training courses. The objective is for buyers and factories to work together on

G4-HR4 | Aspect: Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining | Human Rights

improving conditions in the workplace. If, on the other hand, the partnerships with production sites
that have not completely met all requirements were terminated, the effort to make continuous
improvements would be halted.
Since 2013, REWE Group has required producers of primary agricultural products to pledge that
they would pay the statutory, negotiated or contractually set wage within the context of their
national code of laws as part of the framework agreement on compliance with the core labour
standards of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The suppliers must also demonstrate this
compliance to the company. The suppliers are also required to ensure that their own suppliers also
meet these standards.
All producers of fruit and vegetable products must demonstrate that they meet the requirements
cited above by undergoing external audits (such as GLOBALG.A.P Risk Assessment on Social
Practice (GRASP), SA8000, Sustainable Agriculture Network (SAN), BSCI). Compliance with these
requirements is checked during spot audits.
In 2010, REWE International AG began to require PRO PLANET suppliers of fruit, vegetables and
eggs to have the social aspects of their operations evaluated on the basis of GRASP standards.

G4-DMA | Aspect: Local Communities | Society

Aspect: Local Communities
Management Approach: As a result of the company's cooperative tradition, assuming social
responsibility comes naturally to REWE Group. It plays an active role in the cities and communities
where it does business. And this applies to both its store and administration sites as well as to
travel destinations. In these holiday areas, the company is taking steps to prevent children and
adolescents from being sexually exploited by tourists. In addition to the programmes organised by
REWE Group, independent retailers, store managers and DER Touristik (organiser and sales) carry
out their own projects and support local initiatives. They are ﬁrmly rooted in their regions and have
a deep understanding of their customers' and communities' needs. In each area of the company's
social involvement, REWE Group strives to create long-term partnerships designed to effectively
and positively change society.

G4-SO1 | Aspect: Local Communities | Society

Percentage of operations with implemented local community
engagement, impact assessments, and development programs
The business run by REWE Group has a multifaceted impact on the community life at each
individual store locations:
!

The stores of REWE Group generally create local jobs, including many part-time opportunities.

!

When REWE Group decides to build a new store at a particular location, it consults with the local
government. For stores with more than 800 square metres of space, a special site designation
must be issued, a process that requires a change to the land use plan to be made ﬁrst. This
designation is governed by legal regulations, which include comments from affected residents.

!

The impact on the environment is covered by legal standards that REWE Group meets.

!

The local needs of communities, including socially disadvantaged groups, are considered in
particular by the individual activities of partner retailers.

G4-SO2 | Aspect: Local Communities | Society

Operations with actual and potential negative impacts on local
communities
None of the retail activities, which, with the exception of BILLA Russia, are conducted exclusively in
countries of the European Union and are thus tightly regulated, have a signiﬁcant negative impact
on local communities. This may not always be the case in the area of Travel and Tourism. For this
reason, REWE Group has joined the ﬁght against sexual exploitation of minors and violence against
children. In cooperation with the non-government organisation ECPAT Deutschland e.V., DER
Touristik and especially the business travel specialist FCm TRAVEL Solutions work to prevent
children from being sexually exploited. The following steps have been taken:
!

Training in DER Touristik hotels

!

Training and presentations as part of destination workshops organised by the German Travel
Association and ECPTAT Deutschland e.V.

!

Intensive public relations work (ﬂiers, presence at trade fairs, customer events, press releases
internal/external)

!

Participation in train-the-trainer seminars organised by ECPAT Deutschland e.V. designed to
present the special qualities of such places as the business travel area

!

Membership in the working group on child protection of the German Travel Association

During the reporting period, DER Touristik conducted 13 seminars in 11 destinations. In addition,
trainees and travel agency employees of DER Touristik learned about the issue during a one-day
seminar, and a training session for hosts at DER Touristik hotels was conducted. In 2013 and 2014,
FCm TRAVEL SOLUTIONS provided information about this issue at such places as trade fairs,
conferences and train-the-trainer seminars. In recognition of their efforts, the business travel
experts were named a "top member" of the Child Protection Code in 2014. The wide range of
activities in the area of business travel was honoured here.

G4-DMA | Aspect: Anti-corruption | Society

Aspect: Anti-corruption
Management approach: Violations of regulations can have personal consequences (including
claims for damages or criminal charges) for individual employees or the board members of REWE
Group. This, in turn, could hurt the image of companies in REWE Group. For this reason, the
Guidelines for Sustainable Business Practices of REWE Group formulate clear principles for fair,
incorruptible behaviour.
An anti-corruption system was introduced in 2007. As part of this effort, various codes of conduct
were implemented for managers and employees. In addition, an internal anti-corruption ofﬁcer and
an external ombudsman were appointed. In February 2009, REWE Group named a chief compliance
ofﬁcer. And, in June 2010, the internal corporate department Governance & Compliance began to
combine and coordinate the activities of REWE Group. Since 2011, it has been supported in its work
by decentralised compliance ofﬁcers in the respective business units and country companies (see
Compliance). As part of an efﬁcient compliance management system (CMS), drawn from the
standard IDW PS 980, REWE Group has set up a compliance programme that comprises a number
of preventive steps. Since mid-2011, regular compliance risk analyses have been conducted with
the goal of developing further preventive measures. Training for employees and special rules
governing ways to handle gifts made to top executives or purchasing departments are also
included. For donations, a separate guideline deﬁnes minimum requirements and approval
processes to be documented.

G4-SO3 | Aspect: Anti-corruption | Society

Percentage of operations assessed for risks related to
corruption and risks identiﬁed
With the help of an IT-supported tool, corruption risks are systematically recorded and evaluated in
REWE Group. Appropriate measures are then developed on the basis of this information. This
represents 100 per cent coverage of the strategic business units.
On the basis of a compliance risk analysis in 2012, the focal point addressed during the reporting
period was reﬁnement and implementation of appropriate risk management measures. As part of
the integration project Governance Risk & Compliance (GRC), business operation risks and
compliance risks were jointly ascertained and uniformly evaluated. As a result, risk assessments
and measures are being integrated into a group-wide system solution. The process will be
completed in 2015.

G4-SO4 | Aspect: Anti-corruption | Society

Communication and training on anti-corruption
In 2013, a mandatory e-learning course called "Compliance Basics" was rolled out across Germany
for all administrative employees. The course focused on the correct approach to gifts (anticorruption). The course was voluntary for top executives. Furthermore, classroom training sessions
and counselling were provided to areas vulnerable to corruption like purchasing and expansion
(national / international). For 2015, mandatory classroom training sessions for all national /
international top executives at REWE Group are planned. This top executive group extends all the
way to the third management level.
Since 2013, basic compliance information about tip-off management and the code of conduct have
been available on the REWE Group website. In addition, a national business partner mailing (about
14,000 recipients) was carried out in 2013. This mailing reported on the activities being undertaken
to ﬁght and prevent corruption and on the whistleblower system. In 2014, a total of 9,526
international business partners were added to the group of recipients. Government agencies,
landlords, travel and tourism and business partners with annual revenues of less than 10,000 euros
were excluded from the group. Internationally, the countries of Ukraine and Russia were also left
out.
Every employee of REWE Group can ﬁnd basic compliance information in the intranet and in various
team rooms.

Conﬁrmed incidents of corruption and actions taken
Whistleblower tips received by compliance ofﬁcers are systematically compiled in the compliance
tip tool. They are then reviewed and forwarded to the appropriate department – in particular
auditing. This department examines the allegations and reports the results and measures to be
taken as a result to the Department of Governance & Compliance. It is the responsibility of the
operative units to implement these measures, which can involve such matters as labour or criminal
issues. Seven credible tips about corruption were received by the Department of Governance &
Compliance in each of the years 2013 and 2014. In all instances, labour law measures were taken
to address the issues.
Together with decentralised compliance ofﬁcers, the Corporate Department of Governance &
Compliance holds annual workshops for the purpose of modifying the compliance program and
implementing preventive measures to minimise compliance risks.

G4-DMA | Aspect: Public Policy | Society

Aspect: Public Policy
Management approach: To support future-oriented business, nutritional and environmental policies,
REWE Group conducts a dialogue with political leaders on various levels. In August 2014, the
company opened a capital city ofﬁce in Berlin to serve as a platform for dialogue and discussion
with key stakeholders for the trade industry and REWE Group. In this work, REWE Group excludes no
one from the dialogue. During the reporting period, a number of roundtable discussions,
background meetings and events were held. Invitations to these meetings were extended to a large
number of decision makers without regard for their political party or persuasion. One key focal
point of several events organised by the capital city ofﬁce in Berlin was the issue of healthful diets.
In addition, representatives of REWE Group speak directly with elected representatives to raise their
awareness level about key issues and to represent the company's interests.
REWE Group has also facilitated discussions about the planned free-trade agreement TTIP. As part
of this work, REWE Group sent a letter at the beginning of 2014 to German members of the
International Trade, Agriculture and Food committees of the European Parliament to express the
company's concerns that TTIP could result in the weakening of food-safety and quality standards in
Europe. In addition, REWE Group called for a more transparent decision-making process that would
include representatives from agricultural, environmental and consumer protection organisations as
well as the trade industry.
Donations made to parties or political groups, elected representatives, government agencies,
churches and other religious groups must be approved by the entire Management Board of REWE
Group. Every donation must comply with legal regulations and regulatory guidelines at REWE Group,
including the code of conduct.

REWE Group strives to make its very complex global supply chain more sustainable in cooperation
with its suppliers. This is achieved in part by guidelines for raw materials, the PRO PLANET process,
establishing industry initiatives and playing an active role in platforms like the Forum for
Sustainable Palm Oil (FONAP), the German Initiative on Sustainable Cocoa (GISCO) and the Social
Business Compliance Initiative (BSCI).

Management approach: Integrity is a fundamental aspect of REWE Group's company policies. To
facilitate this, REWE Group has created an anti-corruption system that also covers complaint
mechanisms.
See the aspect “Anti-corruption”.

Number of grievances about impacts on society
Formal complaints can be addressed to a number of different departments at REWE Group,
including compliance, quality management and purchasing. They can also be sent directly to the
stores themselves. For this reason, a comprehensive overview of the submitted complaints cannot
be created.

G4-DMA | Aspect: Customer Health and Safety | Product Responsibility

Aspect: Customer Health and Safety
Management approach: To ensure the quality and safety of its products, REWE Group has
introduced a comprehensive, cross-stage quality assurance system that extends along the entire
value chain in its core business of trade. The system comprises such preventive measures as the
preparation of product guidelines, systematic issue monitoring, controls, audits and consumer tips
about the proper way to use products at home. A system of key performance indicators introduced
in 2010 makes compliance with legal and company quality standards more measurable and
transparent. The key performance indicators, including the results of internal microbiological
analyses or rates of complaints, are prepared quarterly, evaluated and presented in the
management report of REWE Group's quality management.
A special focal point of quality management is store brand products: The combine deﬁnes special
requirements for the products and suppliers to meet in all steps along the value chain – from raw
materials and recipes to labelling and packaging. These speciﬁcations form the basis for regular
spot checks conducted by independent accredited testing institutes. The spot checks are
determined on the basis of supplier and product risk. Foods like fresh fruit and vegetables are
tested more frequently than products like salt and sugar. For fruit and vegetables, the combine has
an annual "Status Report on Chemical Pesticides" prepared for Germany. The reports have been
compiled and released by the Austrian environmental organisation GLOBAL 2000 since 2009.
In addition to the products themselves, other links in the value chain are examined: All store-brand
suppliers in the food area must be certiﬁed according to the internationally recognised standard IFS
Food or the standard of the British Retail Consortium (BRC). Furthermore, REWE Group conducts
additional supplier audits on the basis of a risk analysis. This involves evaluating a number of key
performance indicators like dissatisfaction with products, customer complaints and the risk
classiﬁcation of the product group. Manufacturers and suppliers who fail to meet REWE Group's
quality standards are asked to remedy the situation. Otherwise, they face the possibility of being
delisted.
Annual audits of the company's warehouses are conducted by internal auditors as well as by
independent external organisations. All areas of the warehouse are included in these audits, from
goods receipt to transport to stores. In addition, special audits that focus on quality requirements
for fruit and vegetables are conducted in warehouses.
Regular internal and external inspections are also conducted in REWE Group's food stores. The
external inspections are conducted on the basis of checklists prepared by QS GmbH, Bonn. The
lists focus on meat, meat products, fruit, vegetables and potatoes. Products produced in REWE
stores themselves, including ground meat (at the service counter) or fruit and convenience
products are subject to microbiological monitoring. These samples are examined by independent
laboratories.

Incidents of non-compliance with regulations and voluntary
codes concerning the health and safety impacts of products
and services
In 2013, REWE Group had ﬁve public product recalls. Three recalls involved suspicions that horse
meat had been used in place of beef that was shown on the label. The products were REWE Beste
Wahl Chili Con Carne, REWE Spaghetti Bolognese and Corbell (PENNY) Gypsy Hamburger Steak. In
response to this fraudulent practice that affected the entire food retail sector, REWE Group decided
to use only German beef in its store brand convenience foods. Another recall affected Bebivita Milk
Rice of REWE. It was ordered as a result of foreign substances found in the product. The ﬁfth recall
involved Gut Erkenloh pork mince (PENNY). It was ordered after microbiological tests found that
threshold values had been exceeded.
Five public recalls also occurred in 2014. Three of them involved the frozen broccoli of the brands
Bio, Greenland and REWE. The recall was ordered after residues of chlorate were discovered.
Mühlenhof ground beef (PENNY) and Timbu spice mills were recalled because of foreign
substances.
In every case, customers were able to return the product and get their money back.

G4-DMA | Aspect: Product and Service Labeling | Product Responsibility

Aspect: Product and Service Labeling
Management approach: Information about the ingredients and product features of foods make it
easier for customers to take their purchasing decisions and protect consumers with allergies or
intolerances from certain ingredients. In labelling products, REWE Group not only meets legally
mandated information requirements, but also exceeds them in many ways. This commitment is
reﬂected ﬁrst in the provision of clear nutritional information labelling on all food packages of the
store brands sold by REWE and PENNY. Furthermore, it involves information about sustainability
aspects. This is part of the company's strategic objective to promote sustainable consumption in
the pillar Green Products. With its PRO PLANET process, REWE Group has created a system that
enables it to clearly and transparently provide sustainability information on products. As a result,
the PRO PLANET label serves as a compass for consumers. In addition, REWE Group uses external
labels to mark its store brands and has separate labels for organic and regional products.
As part of its Guideline for Fish, Crustacean and Molluscs (formerly the Guideline for Purchasing
Sustainable Wild Fish), REWE Group introduced a tracking code for store brand ﬁsh products in
2012. With this code, customers can go online and learn about the supply chain for the ﬁsh product.
In addition, the ﬁrst aquaculture products can now be tracked online all the way back to the farming
region. All fresh ﬁsh counters at REWE stores have been certiﬁed by the Marine Stewardship
Council (MSC) since 2009 and by the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) since 2012.

Principles/ procedures for product and service information and
labelling
The products of REWE Group are labelled in accordance with legal requirements regarding their
origin, composition and usage (including the expiration date). In addition, products contain
sustainability information provided as part of the Sustainability Strategy.
Key types of labels are:
!

The PRO PLANET label: Number of labelled products: Germany 2013: 557; 2014: 622; Austria:
2013: 220; 2014 251;

!

TÜV exclusive label: 2013: 158 TÜV-certiﬁed products; 2014: 211 TÜV-certiﬁed products, a total
of 3,134 TÜV-certiﬁed products

!

Tracking code for wild ﬁsh: more than 70 products

Labelling of the farming form for hens regarding products whose egg content serves as a key
ingredient and products whose egg content is listed in the standard description.

In 2014, the name of the actual production company began to be included on the store brand
products sold by PENNY and REWE. In taking this step, PENNY and REWE responded to consumers'
desire for more transparency in the supply chain:
REWE continues to be listed as the production company in only a few exceptions, including the
products of the Feine Welt brand that are made by small suppliers.

G4-PR4 | Aspect: Product and Service Labeling | Product Responsibility

Incidents of non-compliance with regulations and voluntary
codes concerning product and service information and labeling
REWE Group does not release ﬁgures related to violations that resulted in warnings or ﬁnes
because these numbers require extensive explanation and could be used against the company
without any detailed information about the causes.

G4-PR5 | Aspect: Product and Service Labeling | Product Responsibility

Results of surveys measuring customer satisfaction
REWE Group employs an institutionalised system to gain and evaluate customer feedback: A
central customer service unit also handles complaints and questions. All incoming customer
complaints are examined in terms of initiators and reasons. Should a number of complaints be
received, quality management will contact the supplier and enable this company to take corrective
action by applying appropriate measures. The complaint rate is evaluated by product group and is
considered in the supplier's performance evaluation.
In addition, REWE Group tracks customer satisfaction in annual surveys. Results show that
customer satisfaction has continuously improved.

G4-DMA | Aspect: Marketing Communications | Product Responsibility

Aspect: Marketing Communications
Management approach: As a matter of principle, REWE Group advertises its products and services
in strict conformity with legal requirements as well as with ethical and cultural standards. It
expressly avoids the use of sexist, discriminatory, political, pornographic, extremist and violenceglorifying advertising. Truth, precision and transparency are the fundamental advertising principles
employed by the company. In addition, REWE Group adheres to its own company-wide code of
conduct, regulations, guidelines and rules laid down by national advertising boards.
To succeed, communications of sustainability issues require a signiﬁcant amount of credibility. In
its Guidelines for Sustainable Business Practices, REWE Group expresses its explicit commitment
to complying with applicable consumer-protection regulations and to employing appropriate sales,
marketing and information practices in communications with consumers. As a way of considering
these factors in the advertising concepts, the company's ads are approved by the Sustainability
Department before being published.

G4-PR6 | Aspect: Marketing Communications | Product Responsibility

Sale of banned or disputed products
REWE Group sells no products that are banned by the laws of the country where it does business. In
line with its guidelines, REWE Group also avoids the use of controversial raw materials in its
products or replaces them:
!

Guideline for Ecological Products: To the greatest extent possible, countries that have become
the target of criticism are removed from the company's list of raw material suppliers.

!

Guideline for Soy in Animal Feed: This guideline deﬁnes feed that is free of genetically modiﬁed
substances as a requirement. It also stipulates and encourages the substitution of soybean
meal imported from South America with German and European protein feed.

!

Guideline for Fish, Crustacean and Molluscs / Status Report Fish: The selection of wild ﬁsh sold
by REWE Group is based on the regularly updated "orientation list for sustainable wild ﬁsh". This
list draws on the ﬁndings of leading environmental organisations (such as Greenpeace, WWF,
Monterey Bay Aquarium, Fishsource). No endangered wild ﬁsh will be sold as a result.

!

Guideline for Natural Stone Products: Expansion of the range of certiﬁed and labelled natural
stone products from more sustainable production.

!

Guideline for Palm Oil: Replacement of palm (kernel) oil with other vegetable fats and oils or the
conversion to certiﬁed, more sustainable palm (kernel) oil products. In the food area, 90 per cent
has already been converted using the mass-balance approach and segregation. The total is
nearly 30 per cent in the non-food area.

!

Guideline for Cocoa: By the end of 2015, all store brands should have completed the conversion
process to cocoa that has met the three recognised certiﬁcation standards Fair Trade,
Rainforest Alliance and UTZ certiﬁed. At the end of 2014, 86 per cent of the cocoa used in the
products had been converted.

Incidents of non-compliance with regulations and voluntary
codes concerning marketing communications
In the reporting period 2013/2014, no signiﬁcant violations were known.

G4-DMA | Aspect: Customer Privacy | Product Responsibility

Aspect: Customer Privacy
Management approach: As a matter of principle, REWE Group handles personal data conﬁdentially.
REWE Group secures these data in accordance with legal requirements. REWE Group has made this
practice a high priority – particularly in light of the growing online business being conducted by its
sales brands.
REWE Group documents, reviews and processes every inquiry by a customer or data protection
authority regarding personal data. Internal and external data protection ofﬁcers (currently, this
totals seven for 49 companies) monitor the legally compliant handling of data and the processing
programmes being used. In addition, they work on the modiﬁcation of company-speciﬁc data
protection and data security measures and advise organisational units and departments. The data
protection ofﬁcers report directly to the top management of the companies or the Managing Board
of REWE Group.
During the reporting period, the security of data on the servers of service providers was increased in
response to corresponding instruction. Organisationally, this effort was supported by the
dissemination of additional guidelines on data protection and data security. In addition, awareness
programmes are increasingly being offered as a way of boosting all employees' knowledge about
data protection and data security.
In 2013, video monitoring became a major issue following a report broadcast by the German TV
magazine Frontal 21. Following the broadcast, the Managing Board instructed a task force to review
the conditions for the legally compliant use of video monitoring measures in the company's stores
and to deﬁne them in a more binding manner if necessary. On the basis of a threat-classiﬁcation
process developed during this review, all PENNY stores were evaluated. New requirements for video
monitoring in stores are now being measured on the basis of it.

G4-PR8 | Aspect: Customer Privacy | Product Responsibility

Substantiated complaints regarding breaches of customer
privacy
In the reporting period 2013/2014, a total of 91 legitimate complaints involving data-protection
violations were made against REWE Group Germany. 20 of these were made by regulatory
authorities. 55 complaints were ﬁled against DER Touristik. The chief reason for this high number
was the traveltainment incident in 2013.
