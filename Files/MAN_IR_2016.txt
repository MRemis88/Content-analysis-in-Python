How are climate change, urbanization, and digitization impacting MAN?
And what role does MAN play in shaping these megatrends? Our CR Strategy
2020+ is our response to these questions. By defining concrete measures and
targets in the areas of Integration, Products, Production, and People, we have
brought transparency and accountability to our activities. As one of Europe's
leading commercial vehicle and mechanical engineering companies, this is
how we demonstrate responsibility along our entire value chain.
Climate protection is one area where we see great potential for
leveraging our corporate responsibility. More than 90% of the greenhouse
gas emissions caused by MAN are generated through the use of our products. So we are continuously working to boost their energy efficiency. We
assign high priority to the development and use of alternative drives. We
firmly believe that the drive systems of the future will be electric – at least
in urban settings. At the end of 2019 we will be launching series production of an all-electric city bus, with an electric truck due to roll off the line
in early 2021. As early as the end of 2017, we will make the first electric
trucks available to our logistics partners for real-world trials.
With new business models and innovative mobility solutions, we
are also taking advantage of the opportunities offered by digitization.
With RIO we launched an open, cloud-based platform in 2016, which bundles digital services for the entire transportation sector.
RIO is now an independent digital brand of Volkswagen Truck &
Bus, that we are developing together with our sister brands. RIO frees up
cargo capacity, helps prevent empty runs, and reduces traffic volumes.
Our customers benefit from more efficient use of capacity and higher productivity – which in turn lead to higher profits. At the same time, we
reduce emissions within the transportation and logistics ecosystem.
We have come a step closer to reaching our climate goal for our
production operations – a 25% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2020 – by
cutting our CO2 emissions by 19.8% in the year under review (baseline:

2008). One contributing factor was the construction of a combined heat
and power plant in Munich, which enables us to generate up to 20% of our
power needs on site.
In 2016, MAN also continued with its refugee integration activities,
helping 39 migrants gain a foothold in the working world by offering them
initial vocational training, apprenticeships, and internships. Our initiatives are grouped under the umbrella of MAN refugee aid, which coordinates numerous activities and offers assistance.
Our CR Strategy 2020+ provides a roadmap for sustainable development, while this report shows the ground we have covered and the
progress we have made. It is aimed at analysts, investors, customers, and
business partners. Prepared in accordance with the standards of the
Global Reporting Initiative and checked by an independent auditing firm,
it presents performance indicators and data that are relevant to sustainable business practices. And it outlines the ways in which we live up to our
commitment to the ten principles of corporate responsibility
defined by the UN Global Compact. We have also made
an interactive abridged version of the report available
online.
We invite you to join us on the path we have
embarked on and to keep in touch with us. You can
reach us by e-mail at CorporateResponsibility@man.eu.
Best regards

Joachim Drees
Chief Executive Officer of MAN SE

Economic environment
As a whole, the global economy again recorded muted growth in 2016 and
was impacted by economic and political crises. As expected, this made for
a challenging business environment for MAN in the year under review –
and this will not change in the foreseeable future.
The Commercial Vehicles business area saw significant growth in the
European commercial vehicles market. Demand for powerful commercial
vehicles was particularly high in a number of countries such as Italy and
Poland. In Brazil, however, the ongoing recession and the accompanying
political uncertainty led to a considerable market decline, following what
had already been a weak economic performance in the previous year.
In the Power Engineering business area, the situation in key segments of the marine and turbomachinery markets deteriorated further.
Given this difficult environment, the MAN Group performed well
in 2016. We generated Group sales revenue of €13.6 billion in the year
under review, down 1.0% on the previous year. Our operating profit was
€204 million, which represents an improvement of some €100 million.
Excluding special items attributable to restructuring expenses, we
increased our operating profit to over €400 million in 2016. Restructuring
expenses related to the MAN Diesel & Turbo program for future growth
totaled €155 million, while restructuring expenses at MAN Latin America
amounted to €58 million. We paid out guaranteed dividends to our shareholders of €3.07 per share in 2016. The MAN Group’s operating return on
sales increased noticeably from 0.7% to 1.5%. MAN does not take extensive
measures to optimize its taxes.

Further information on our financial performance is available in our
2016 Annual Report.
Volkswagen AG’s stake in MAN SE
A domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (DPLTA) between
Truck & Bus GmbH (now Volkswagen Truck & Bus GmbH), a wholly owned
subsidiary of Volkswagen AG, and MAN SE was entered into the commercial register on July 16, 2013, and has been effective since that date. On
December 31, 2016, Volkswagen Truck & Bus GmbH held 75.73% of MAN
SE’s voting rights and 74.52% of its share capital. On December 31, 2016,
24.27% of MAN’s common shares were in free float.
Capital expenditures
In the 2016 fiscal year, the MAN Group incurred capital expenditures totaling €860 million, after €708 million in the previous year. There was growth
in both payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment, and in capital
expenditures on intangible assets in fiscal 2016. In view of the difficult economic situation, we are reviewing planned capital expenditures particularly critically, and are systematically prioritizing them. We are deliberately
retaining the necessary capital expenditures that will lead to long-term
growth and are capable of improving our operational efficiency.

Strategy and Governance

MAN’s future performance depends on understanding global challenges
and identifying the opportunities and risks with regard not only to sustainable
development, but also to our commercial success. MAN's CR Strategy 2020+
is our response to the worldwide megatrends associated with these challenges.
This is how we live our responsibility – along our entire value chain.
CR Strategy 2020+
Since 2010 corporate responsibility (CR) has been an integral part of MAN’s
Corporate Strategy. And our CR Strategy 2020+ is MAN’s response to the
global challenges which have material significance for the Group. It allows
us to identify the risks and opportunities arising from these challenges at
an early stage and react accordingly. This safeguards the future success of
our business and makes a contribution to sustainable development.

With its four cornerstones of Integration, Products, People, and Production, MAN’s CR Strategy 2020+ outlines the ways in which we take responsibility along our value chain. Four fields of action have been assigned to
each of these four CR cornerstones (, page 6).

MAN’s Climate Strategy
We have assigned the five core initiatives defined in MAN’s Climate
Strategy to the Integration, Production, and Products cornerstones of
our CR Strategy 2020+. We will continue to develop MAN’s Climate
Strategy in 2017 taking into account the United Nations Paris Agreement on climate change.
1.

25% reduction in CO2 emissions at MAN sites by
2020 (baseline: 2008)

We will reduce CO2 emissions at MAN sites by improving energy efficiency, using renewable
energy sources (solar, wind, geothermal), generating energy using combined heat and power
(CHP) plants, and through integrated energy-management technology and organization.

2.

Consistently efficient product portfolio

We position ourselves in the commercial vehicles and power engineering sectors with sustainable products and services.

3.

Customer involvement and dialog

We involve our customers and talk to them about ways to reduce the global carbon footprint. After all, many of our customers have already set themselves ambitious targets for
cutting CO2 emissions.

4.

Potential for reducing CO2 emissions along the
product life cycle

To identify potential for reductions, we measure CO2 emissions along the entire product
life cycle.

5.

Climate strategy management

We manage the implementation of our Climate Strategy and have defined KPIs that are
regularly measured and published.

Global challenges: MAN ranking of opportunities and risks

[G4-18] As part of a multi-step materiality analysis conducted in 2014, we
identified global challenges that are relevant to MAN. This included not
only what our stakeholders expect of the Company, but also MAN’s own
objectives for sustainable commercial success. We are planning to update
the materiality analysis in 2017.
Evaluation by the MAN CR Steering Committee
In 2014, the MAN CR Steering Committee (, page 11) discussed and analyzed twelve global challenges, including climate change, population
growth, resource scarcity, poverty, and health. Using a scale of zero (low) to
ten (high), they evaluated the challenges with regard to business opportunities and risks for MAN (, see graphic).

Assessment by stakeholders
[G4-24, G4-25, G4-26, G4-27] To supplement the materiality analysis performed by the MAN CR Steering Committee, in 2014 we asked our stakeholders what expectations they have of MAN. For this process we elected
to use an international, open, online questionnaire. In order to include as
many stakeholder interests as possible, we did not pre-select target groups.
Over a period of several months, over 1,700 people participated in the survey on the MAN corporate website. We were able to analyze more than 150
of these data sets.
Material global challenges facing MAN
In addition to the assessments of the global challenges which were performed by the MAN CR Steering Committee and our stakeholders, we also
conducted an analysis of our competitors and consulted expert opinion.
This led to the definition of six material challenges as the basis of the MAN
CR strategy and of our reporting to the G4 standard of the Global Reporting
Initiative (GRI). These global challenges were then assigned to the corresponding GRI Aspects (, page 10) for which MAN reports at least one performance indicator (, GRI-Index, page 66 et seq).
We performed the materiality analysis for the MAN Group as a
whole. To take account of regional variations, MAN Latin America conducted an additional, separate analysis, which confirmed the MAN Group
results to a very great extent. In this analysis, regionally relevant issues such
as access to water, biodiversity, and population growth were ranked higher
and are addressed accordingly by the CR activities of MAN Latin America.
MAN Diesel & Turbo also conducted a materiality analysis specifically for the subgroup. In February 2016, the findings of this analysis were
reviewed by experts from the specialist functions and measured against
MAN’s CR Strategy 2020+.

Description

Relevance for MAN

Among other problems, the rise in global temperatures
caused by greenhouse gas emissions leads to extreme
weather events, rising sea levels, and natural disasters. In
many regions, this in turn leads to further negative impacts
on ecosystems as well as social and economic systems.

In this context, the transportation and logistics sector is called on to reduce its emissions of CO2 and
other greenhouse gases and minimize climate
impacts. We give top priority to the development
and use of alternative drives and fuels.

Energy
Emissions
Transportation

Resources include all raw materials and natural resources
such as water, energy, and land which are necessary for
life and economic activity. Overuse of these resources
leads to water shortages, desertification and erosion, and
rising prices for raw materials and building materials.

Resource scarcity impacts on MAN as a manufacturing company and makes its supply of production
materials less secure and economical.

Materials

The percentage of the total world population living in urban
areas is growing steadily. According to United Nations estimates, 60% of all people will live in cities by 2030.

The quality of life and ecological sustainability of
large cities depends on efficient transportation and
energy solutions, as well as intelligent mobility. MAN
can make a material contribution in these areas.

Energy
Transportation

Severe physical stress, lack of exercise, and psychological
issues such as mental stress are key challenges in the field
of health. To increase road safety, accident prevention
measures also play an important role.

As an international manufacturer of heavy industrial
machinery and commercial vehicles, the issue of
occupational health and safety has traditionally
played an important role at MAN. Another key challenge facing MAN is the occupational health of its
employees in countries outside Germany. MAN has
also engaged in accident research for many years
to improve the safety of its vehicles.

Occupational health and safety
Customer health and safety

The increasing amounts of waste produced around the
world have far-reaching effects on plant, animal, and
human life. Millions of tonnes of plastic waste end up in the
oceans and contaminate the groundwater. In addition,
waste incineration plants cause air pollution.

MAN makes every possible effort to limit the environmental impacts of its production activities,
focusing on the continuous reduction of volumes of
waste and assessing the recyclability of materials in
product life cycle assessments.

At MAN, corporate responsibility is a top managerial function. The Chief
Human Resources Officer and Arbeitsdirektor (Executive Board member
responsible for employee relations) is ultimately responsible for CR at
MAN. Reporting to him is the MAN Group's Corporate Responsibility
function, which is responsible for implementing MAN’s CR Strategy 2020+.
The Corporate Responsibility function serves as the central point of contact for all CR issues in the Company. It also coordinates the CR Steering
Committee, whose members include managers from the Production,
Products, and Integration functions (e.g. from Procurement, the Group
Works Council, and Human Resources) and all subgroups. In addition to
the continuous development of the CR strategy, the CR Steering Commit-

tee is responsible for integrating CR in our operating processes and for systematic stakeholder dialog. In the year under review, the CR Steering Committee met one time; it is being restructured. In addition, we steer our CR
activities through our integrated management systems, as described in
the People (, page 36) and Production (, page 50) chapters of this report.
Activities within the Volkswagen Group
As a strong brand within the Volkswagen Group, we participate in the
Corporate CSR & Sustainability and Environment & Energy Steering
Groups in order to play an active part in shaping the Volkswagen Group’s
environmental and sustainability strategy. Since 2016, MAN has also
been a member of the Group working committee on aid to refugees.

Management approach

Our business practices are shaped by corporate responsibility (CR). It is our aim to live our responsibility
every day. We continue to boost our competitive edge by anchoring CR firmly in the strategies of our divisions,
our operating processes, and our vocational training and continuing professional development. Responsible
corporate governance is the foundation on which we build. Dialog with our stakeholders and customers helps
us integrate CR in our core business activities. Through our corporate citizenship initiatives and MAN aid to
refugees, we also make a lasting contribution to sustainable development.
Responsible corporate governance

Compliance program

Challenges and objectives
Compliance with the law is the basic precondition for the success of our
business. At MAN, management and supervision of the Company and the
Group is focused on ensuring sustained value creation and an appropriate
profit in line with the principles of the social market economy.

Challenges and objectives
MAN does not tolerate illegal or irregular conduct. Managers have a
particular responsibility to lead by example, follow rules, and comply
with the law.

Principles and guidelines
Corporate governance at MAN complies with nationally and internationally recognized standards of good and responsible corporate governance.
Important policies and guidelines include:
Corporate law and regulations
The German Corporate Governance Code
The UN Global Compact
Our Code of Conduct
Our Articles of Association and internal policies

Organization
The MAN Group Corporate, Governance & Compliance (GRC) function is
currently staffed by 47 employees. This function is under the Head of
GRC / Chief Compliance Officer (CCO), who reports regularly to MAN SE’s
Executive Board and the heads of other functions on the current status
of GRC activities. At different levels of the Group, regular status reports
on GRC programs and initiatives are also presented in the responsible
committees. Compliance and risk management responsibilities are also
carried out by employees known as Compliance Champions and by the
coordinators of the risk management and internal control system. They
are not full-time GRC employees, but MAN employees and managers
who have taken on special responsibility for topics related to compliance
and risk management.

Management approach

Principles and guidelines
Our Code of Conduct outlines standards of behavior that are binding for all
our employees in their daily work. Our compliance guidelines also provide
concrete instructions for handling ambiguous situations. Relations with
our business associates are governed by our Code of Conduct for Suppliers
and Business Partners, which requires them to comply with basic principles of corporate responsibility, transparency, fairness, and data protection.
Systems and instruments
Rolled out in 2010, our compliance management system helps us detect
non-compliance at an early stage and respond quickly, effectively, and
consistently. It is designed to address issues related to white-collar crime
(in particular, the prevention of corruption, money laundering, and terrorism financing) and antitrust law. The Disciplinary Sanction Committee
is the body responsible for imposing internal sanctions in the event of
compliance violations. It meets on an ad hoc basis and is made up of the
Chief Executive Officer of the subgroup concerned, the Chief Human
Resources Officer of MAN SE, the Chief Compliance Officer, and the Compliance Officer of the subgroup in question. The findings of misconduct
investigations – as well as the results of regularly conducted compliance
risk assessments – are used to continuously improve our compliance
management system and introduce selective compliance measures.
Memberships
MAN is a member of Transparency International and the German Institute for Compliance (DICO). We are active in several different DICO committees and working groups. MAN also remains committed to the ten
principles of the United Nations Global Compact. In addition, we support

the Alliance for Integrity, an initiative of Germany's Federal Ministry for
Economic Cooperation and Development, the Federation of German
Industry, and numerous German companies, which promotes integrity in
business practices.

Risk management
Challenges and objectives
Entrepreneurial activity entails constant exposure to risk. With a view to
exploiting market opportunities, we deliberately accept risk if, by doing
so, we can expect to see an appropriate increase in shareholder value. As a
basic principle, risk that could jeopardize the Group’s continued existence
may not be entered into, while unavoidable risk must be minimized by
taking suitable measures. Global challenges such as climate change, demographic change, globalization, population growth, digital transformation,
and urbanization represent opportunities and risks for MAN, as does the
internationalization of our business activities.
Organization and instruments
Our Group-wide, centralized risk management system allows us to contain risk and leverage opportunities by providing us with the necessary
information at an early stage. Comprising key elements such as risk and
opportunity management, our internal control system, our continuous
controls monitoring system, and the standard GRC process of Volkswagen AG, it is an integral part of our corporate management and business
processes. To assess risks and opportunities, experts regularly conduct
risk analyses. More information on this topic can be found in the
MAN 2016 Annual Report, page 46 et seq.

Climate-related risks and opportunities
At MAN, the following climate-related risks and opportunities apply to
one or more of our subgroups:
Regulatory risks, particularly with regard to a CO₂ tax or emissions trading in the logistics sector
Extreme weather events, such as severe storms, flooding, hail, or heavy
snowfall, which could interrupt production or affect suppliers
Reputation risk – because the use of our products generates greenhouse
gas emissions and MAN can only achieve long-term market success if
the Company invests in energy-efficient and low-carbon technologies
At the same time, the consistent continuation of the European climateprotection policy and the gradual implementation of similar policies in
the BRIC countries will also yield new growth opportunities for MAN.
These include:
Increasing market share through early compliance with regulatory
requirements
Strengthening ties to customers and suppliers through joint efforts to
cut CO₂ emissions
Increasing competitiveness through greater immunity to energy price
fluctuations, resulting from increased reliance on internal energy generation and renewables

Corporate citizenship
Strategic approach
At MAN we see ourselves as part of society. Our goal is to be a good corporate citizen and promote sustainable development. We can make the most
valuable contributions to issues that relate to our core business areas.

We have enjoyed a successful strategic partnership with SOS Children’s Villages since 2008. Our joint activities focus on long-term and sustainable
education programs for children and young people. In cooperation with
the non-profit organization, we implement projects around the world –
often with the help of volunteer work by our employees. With our attractive initiatives, we are aiming to make a contribution to society and
increase our employees’ identification with the Company.
Furthermore, in the year under review MAN Diesel & Turbo and
the non-governmental organization Mercy Ships formalized their longstanding partnership by signing a sponsorship agreement. The collaboration with Mercy Ships, a health care charity that operates worldwide,
extends back to 2010.
Policies
All donations and sponsorship activities must comply with our mandatory,
Group-wide policy. Permissible fields of activity for donations include education, academia, the arts, community programs (social welfare organizations and charitable and humanitarian projects), and disaster relief efforts.
Instruments
Most of our sponsorship activities and donations are long standing and
closely related to our core business areas. We apply the internationally
recognized standard of the London Benchmark Group (LBG) to measure
the success of our community projects.

Integration in corporate divisions
The integration of CR in the strategies of the divisions, operating processes, and vocational training and continuing professional development
activities is the most important factor in our success. Systematic stakeholder dialog and open communication facilitate the integration of CR in
MAN’s core business activities. In 2016, we again worked with a number of
relevant partners to drive corporate responsibility initiatives at MAN
Truck & Bus and MAN Diesel & Turbo.
„We at MAN“ onboarding program
In 2016, the MAN Academy continued to offer training within the framework of the MAN onboarding program. At MAN Truck & Bus a total of 116
new employees from our German sites had the chance to participate in
the first course in the MAN onboarding program, “We at MAN,” which was

offered five times. Participants learn about the structure and responsibilities of all functional areas within the Company. They also have a chance to
dialog with experts in three marketplaces themed around corporate
responsibility & environment, health management, and compliance.
Presentations from each division and a guided tour of the truck
assembly plant in Munich offer the participants detailed insights into the
world of MAN. Another highlight of the program is a visit to the test track,
where the newcomers can gain firsthand experience of our products by
driving trucks and buses.
At MAN Diesel & Turbo too, the topic of corporate responsibility
has been firmly anchored in training programs for managers and new
vocational trainees, as well as onboarding activities for new employees.

German Corporate Governance Code
In its management and reporting activities, MAN SE largely complies with
the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (DCGK)
as amended on May 5, 2015. The most recent Declaration of Conformity was
issued in December 2016. MAN SE departed from the DCGK recommendations with regard to three points ( 2016 Annual Report, page 14 et seq).
Business Partner Approval Tool
Our policy on engaging business partners regulates collaboration with
business partners who support our sales activities. The Business Partner
Approval Tool is used to check and approve their integrity. A list of all companies that we are not permitted to work with is updated on a monthly
basis and communicated within the Group.
In total, 1,995 checks were conducted using this tool in the reporting period. Because approvals are issued for a limited period, some of the
checks were related to renewals of the approvals granted to individual
business partners.
Compliance Helpdesk
All MAN employees can contact the central Compliance Helpdesk by
phone or e-mail to obtain answers to compliance-related questions. In the
reporting period, 355 questions were answered by the central office, while
1,850 questions were handled locally by compliance managers in various
business units and sales regions.
Compliance training
Compliance awareness training courses were held for 1,767 employees
around the world in the year under review. These on-site training courses
focus on providing basic knowledge on the topics of combating corruption,
antitrust law, and money-laundering prevention. We also conduct special
courses on antitrust law and combating corruption for employees who are

particularly exposed to risks in these areas. In the reporting period, these
courses provided in-depth training to 1,902 employees. Since 2015, we have
also been offering our managers special on-site compliance training
courses. The focus here is on specific compliance risks and challenges as well
as the special responsibilities that come with a leadership role.
In the reporting period, 666 managers attended these courses.
Special on-site training courses were also held for 103 procurement
employees and 26 business partners in 2016.
Furthermore, in the year under review 1,736 employees successfully
completed the first compliance e-learning module on the Code of Conduct,
which addresses the topics of combating corruption, antitrust law, and
data protection. In the second module on the Code of Conduct, 2,035
employees were trained in correct conduct during searches, dealing with
conflicts of interest, and preventing money laundering. In October of the
year under review, a third Code of Conduct e-learning module was rolled

out to supplement the first two courses, offering more in-depth treatment
of the issues of integrity, transparency, and personal responsibility. In the
reporting period, 10,979 employees completed this new module.
Since 2013, employees who are exposed to an increased corruption
risk (e.g. in sales and purchasing) have also participated in an in-depth
web-based training module on combating corruption. In 2016, 225 employees completed this module. Also in the reporting period, 802 employees
took advantage of a training module called “Antitrust Law: Preventing
Antitrust Infringements.”
Integrity campaign
An integrity campaign held in the reporting period included a variety of
activities designed to generate and raise awareness of issues related to ethical behavior. One example was the creation of an in-house film focusing
on the topic of integrity and using case studies to illustrate the meaning of
lawful behavior. In addition, the Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC)
organization has initiated “Compliance Alerts,” a new newsletter format
that makes it possible to provide employees with timely information on
current compliance risks and hints on correct conduct. In-house events
were also organized worldwide to call attention to the issue of combating
corruption and the importance of ethical behavior.
Preventing money laundering
Both the Geldwäschegesetz (GwG – German Money Laundering Act), and
many laws in other jurisdictions require companies to introduce measures
to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing. Among other things,
our Group-wide money-laundering policy establishes minimum standards
for handling suspicious business partners and requires investigation of
ambiguous circumstances before a business transaction is concluded. We
educate our employees on this topic as part of the training module on our
Code of Conduct ( , Compliance training).

Reporting compliance violations
The “Speak up!” whistleblower portal helped to uncover and prevent serious risks for MAN in the year under review. “Speak up!” is used to accept
and analyze information relating to serious compliance violations, especially in the areas of white-collar crime (e.g. corruption offenses and
money laundering), antitrust law, and data protection. MAN employees
and third parties can use "Speak up!" to report compliance violations —
confidentially and regardless of time and location. MAN does not tolerate compliance violations under any circumstances. Reports of possible
violations are investigated in detail and violations are dealt with and
sanctioned in line with the penalties permitted under labor law. In addition, findings from the investigation of compliance violations are used to
continuously improve the compliance management system.

Data protection
MAN stands for effective data protection in compliance with legal regulations, applied worldwide based on the rigorous European standards. To
meet these stringent requirements, the MAN Group maintains a global
network of data protection officers and coordinators. In Germany, four
data protection officers in seven companies work to ensure that the personal data privacy rights of employees, customers, suppliers, and business
partners are respected. Outside of Germany the network comprises 73
coordinators in 42 nations who work on data protection in 81 companies.
MAN SE, Group Data Protection, coordinates the network. In the reporting
period, Group Internal Audit was the body responsible for data protection.
Due diligence
CR and compliance risks can ensue from the acquisition or disposal of
equity investments. To avert such risks, the GRC function is involved in
acquisition projects from the outset. Target companies must complete a
due-diligence questionnaire that addresses CR and compliance issues,
and includes questions on human rights and environmental impacts.

Dialog with policymakers
[G4-26] We are actively working to develop solutions for global challenges.
To this end, we also contribute our knowledge and expertise to the ongoing political debate. Our focus here is on topics relevant to our core business, such as reducing worldwide CO₂ emissions caused by the transportation of goods and people. To this end we maintain an ongoing dialog with
the responsible ministries at the national, EU, and international levels, as
well as with elected representatives and opinion leaders from the government and the opposition.
The MAN guidelines for lobbying are defined in a Code of Conduct
which applies Group-wide. This Code explicitly outlines our commitment
to nonpartisanship and to making our positions transparent. In 2016,
MAN spent around €80,000 on direct lobbying activities.
Dialog with local policymakers and businesses
As part of the Munich Business Climate Pact, initiated by the City of
Munich, MAN and 14 other major Munich-based companies have committed to a shared goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The pact was
signed at City Hall by representatives of all participating companies in
2016, followed by an initial workshop and the launch of a joint activity. In
this context, in January 2017 vocational trainees from the participating
companies attended an energy-scout course offered by the Chamber of
Industry and Commerce. MAN is making an important contribution to
the Climate Pact through the construction of a combined heat and power
plant at its Munich site and other climate protection measures in buildings at the site.

In addition, MAN Truck & Bus has been part of the Bavarian Environmental
Pact since 1996, working for sustainable business practices and environmental protection. This agreement between the Bavaria state government
and Bavarian businesses is based on a commitment to voluntary action,
showing initiative in environmental protection, and cooperative activity.
Customer involvement and dialog
Dialog with our customers – one of the core initiatives of MAN’s Climate
Strategy – represents a valuable opportunity to discuss the reduction of
global CO₂ emissions. After all, many of them have already rolled out their
own CO₂ reduction targets. It is essential for MAN to understand future
customer needs; by flowing customer requirements into the development
of our products and services, we create more customer value.
At meetings of the customer advisory panel, first set up in 2009,
MAN Truck & Bus customers exchange ideas with MAN experts and the
Executive Board member responsible for sales. Selected customers participate in this discussion and feedback platform.
We also conduct targeted customer dialog at trade fairs for our sector. For instance, MAN Diesel & Turbo showcased its modular power plant
concept at the 2016 Power-Gen Europe fair, and presented its entire maritime portfolio at the 2016 SMM, the leading trade fair for shipbuilding and
marine technology.

Stakeholder and customer satisfaction

Customer satisfaction
Along with our employees, customers are our most important stakeholders because they drive our business success. In order to maintain
long-term relationships with our customers and better understand their
needs, we conduct regular surveys in all our business areas to find out
how satisfied customers are with our products and services. By way of
example, MAN Truck & Bus continuously tracks customer satisfaction
using the CustomerFirst Study (CFS). As part of the CFS, in 2016 we conducted telephone surveys of over 40,000 customers – significantly more
than in the previous year. More than 90% gave MAN Truck & Bus a
“good” rating or better, while almost 70% responded with “very good” or
better. This indicates that customer satisfaction has shown a further rise
compared to 2015 levels.

Production
Annex

Every two years, MAN Diesel & Turbo conducts an online survey which
also serves to monitor customer satisfaction. In 2015, some 4,000 customers were asked to provide feedback on the company’s products and services. 35% of the participants rated the performance of MAN Diesel &
Turbo as “good,” 42% as “very good,” and 9% as “excellent.”

We use the results of these customer surveys to check the effectiveness
of our customer satisfaction improvement measures and initiate follow-up activities.
Customer information
We provide our customers with comprehensive information and instructions for all our products. By optimizing the operation of our products,
our customers help not only to improve product safety, but also to conserve resources. We therefore inform them specifically about factors, such
as rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag, which influence vehicle emissions and fuel consumption. We present information on the CO₂ emissions generated by our vehicles with reference to the total lifetime mileage. The calculations can be simulated using the
TCO (Total Cost of
Ownership) calculator on the MAN Truck & Bus website.
We are working to raise awareness among MAN Truck & Bus sales
employees and provide them with regular training in the correct use of
our products and services. In 2016, a total of around 13,000 employees
participated in over 200,000 hours of training. Of these, 700 participants completed training courses on climate protection and the environment.

Long-term partnership with SOS Children’s Villages
As part of our long-term partnership with SOS Children’s Villages, we have
pledged annual funding of €150,000. This provides support for SOS Children’s Villages facilities in Germany, Ethiopia, and Haiti. In the year under
review, a key focus of our support was on a variety of refugee aid projects.
In Germany we assisted SOS Children’s Villages initiatives near six of our
sites. This included a new refugee aid project run by SOS Children’s Villages in Zwickau. A large part of the pledged funds and a donation in the
amount of €26,500 were used for SOS Children’s Villages refugee aid projects. In addition to offering financial assistance, we strongly encourage
employee volunteering.
In 2016, the long-standing and successful partnership between MAN
Diesel & Turbo and the Augsburg SOS Children’s Village was continued.

Vocational training in Ethiopia
One international program that we support is the SOS Vocational Training College in Kality, Ethiopia. Since 2008, MAN has contributed a total
of €600,000, which has gone toward the construction of a new training
building, facility maintenance, the salaries of five teachers, and MAN
scholarships for young people. In 2016, MAN again assisted with the

financing of the engine servicing and maintenance, drive systems, and
automotive mechanics programs. With a donation of €30,000, MAN
covers a large share of the running costs for this vocational program.
School education in Haiti
In Haiti we support the SOS Herman Gmeiner School, a primary and secondary school which is located in Santo on the outskirts of the capital
Port-au-Prince and is currently attended by more than 1,000 children. The
children can attend these SOS schools free of charge. In 2016, MAN provided €20,000 to pay for approximately three-and-a-half teaching positions at the Santo school.
Partnership with Mercy Ships
In 2016, MAN Diesel & Turbo and the non-governmental organization
Mercy Ships formalized their long-standing partnership by signing a
sponsorship agreement at the SMM maritime trade fair in Hamburg.
Mercy Ships is a health care charity that operates worldwide.
Its hospital ships offer free state-of-the-art medical services to
people with no regular access to health care. Surgeons, dentists, nurses,
health care trainers, teachers, cooks, mariners, engineers, farmers, and
other specialists all volunteer their time and expertise in aid of this
worthy cause.
The agreement between MAN Diesel & Turbo and Mercy Ships
pledges the annual provision of spare parts for the four engines of the
M/V Africa Mercy hospital ship to the value of up to €250,000. MAN
Diesel & Turbo’s collaboration with Mercy Ships extends back to 2010.

Refugee integration
We see immigration as an opportunity. The shortage of skilled professionals in Germany will only increase as the country’s demographics
continue to shift. The decisive thing now is to give motivated refugees a
chance to build a better future. To this end, MAN not only makes donations to integration projects, but also fosters the integration of refugees
in the Company. In the 2016 fiscal year, 39 refugees were integrated into
the MAN Group through a variety of channels. This included 18 young
refugees who completed initial training (eight) or a vocational training
program (ten). 20 refugees were offered internships, and three other refugees were employed.
Donations
In 2016, our cash and non-cash donations totaled €1,147,454 (2015:
€837,937). MAN extended this support to numerous charitable projects
and institutions – with a focus on scientific, educational, and social welfare initiatives.

Since 2011, MAN has supported approximately 300 recipients of the Germany Scholarship, which opens up educational opportunities to high-performing students regardless of their social background and the location of
their university. Half of the funding for the scholarships, which are
awarded in recognition of outstanding achievements, comes from the
German federal government, with the other half contributed by companies, foundations, and private individuals. MAN provides Germany Scholarship funding at the Technical University of Munich, Munich University
of Applied Sciences, RTWH Aachen University, Deggendorf Institute of
Technology, and the Technical University of Berlin. In all, we collaborate
with almost 100 technical universities around the world. Several years ago
MAN PrimeServ China launched its own scholarship program, which
allows MAN Diesel & Turbo to support students of marine engineering at
Shanghai Maritime University and Dalian Maritime University in China.
Each year, four students at these universities are granted scholarships
based on their outstanding academic achievements.

Management approach

MAN stands for efficient transportation and energy solutions. Our approach to product responsibility
is broad and comprehensive: not only must our products offer maximum economic benefits for our
customers and the lowest possible environmental and carbon impact, they must also offer top-class
safety and add value for society as a whole.

Challenges and goals
To meet the global challenges in the areas of health, resource scarcity,
urbanization, and climate change, MAN takes a broad and comprehensive
approach to product responsibility. This focuses on everything from the
development of efficient and safe products and the implementation of
environmentally friendly, resource-efficient production processes to environmentally responsible after-sales activities and customer support. Consequently, product responsibility at MAN is based on four cornerstones –
environment, safety, health, and social responsibility – and takes into
account the entire product life cycle, from raw materials extraction to endof-life disposal. This broad-based approach allows us to meet the increasing
expectations of our stakeholders.
Principles and goals
We are committed to continuously improving the efficiency of our products. After all, in most cases our customers base their decision to buy a
product on total cost of ownership. In the freight transportation sector,
fuel costs account for approximately one third of this sum, which is why
the quest for greater efficiency and low emissions is a key technology

driver. In pursuit of technology leadership, MAN focuses its research and
development activities not only on developing new products and enhancing existing ones but also on
Reducing fuel consumption and emissions
Alternative drive concepts
Alternative fuels
Systems and instruments
Future trends and scenarios are an important benchmark for MAN’s strategic product development process. MAN Truck & Bus uses a “Trend
Radar” to assist in the early identification, evaluation, and analysis of relevant trends. The findings are then integrated into our Product Engineering Process. MAN Truck & Bus calculates the life cycle environmental
impact of its products in two stages. Stage one is a Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) analysis. For example, we performed a PCF for a typical longhaul truck, which was then externally verified. Stage two is a Life Cycle
Assessment (LCA).
To meet the high safety standards expected of our products, MAN
Diesel & Turbo has set up a Product Safety Committee. At the corporate
organizational level, product safety is also underpinned by the “Product
safety monitoring and the handling of substandard products” subgroup
policy. The Executive Board has also signed off on internationally binding
product safety guidelines. As in previous years, the product safety audits
carried out in 2016 documented the awareness of product safety that
exists throughout the organization.

Reducing the life cycle CO2 emissions of our products
To identify the potential for reducing the life cycle CO2 emissions of our
products, we calculate PCFs for virtually all product groups of the MAN
Truck & Bus subgroup and for selected product groups of MAN Diesel &
Turbo. The benchmark products for which calculations have been performed include not only a dual-fuel engine, but also a performanceenhancing system (turbocharger) and a Selective Catalytic Reduction
(SCR) system. The calculation methodology is based on the requirements
of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.
The product life cycle stages used by MAN Truck & Bus in this calculation model are defined in accordance with standard automotive
industry practice. They comprise:
1. Production
2. Use phase
3. End of life (recycling and waste processing)

As early as late 2014, our PCF study for a typical long-haul truck was verified in accordance with TÜV NORD standard TN-CC 020 based on the
international standard ISO 14064-3. The study was carried out in line with
the requirements of the GHG Protocol Product Accounting and Reporting
Standard. We also perform LCAs which take into account additional environmental impact categories, such as photochemical ozone creation
potential and ozone depletion. In 2016, MAN Diesel & Turbo went on to
calculate a PCF for a transmission compressor. The findings were clear: for
a transmission compressor as well, the use phase accounts for by far the
largest share of CO2 emissions.
On average, more than 90% of the total life-cycle greenhouse-gas
emissions of the products of both our Commercial Vehicles and our Power
Engineering business areas are generated during the use phase. Bearing in
mind that most of our products have a very long service life, during which
they are used intensively, we implement a future-oriented product development process aimed at reducing environmental impacts.

Efficient diesel engines
Ever since Rudolf Diesel developed the diesel engine in the late 19th century
together with engineers at Maschinenfabrik Augsburg (a forerunner of the MAN
Group), we have worked continuously to improve the efficiency and performance
of this internal combustion engine. Today, economical and efficient transportation and energy solutions from MAN are in operation all over the world.
Trucks
The highly efficient TGX EfficientLine, now into its third generation, incorporates a range of fuel-saving technologies aimed at further reducing
total cost of ownership and CO2 emissions. The fuel consumption of the
MAN TGX EfficientLine 3 has been reduced by 6.35% compared with the
previous model. This calculation was verified by the TÜV technical
inspection authority in 2016. By way of example, a GPS-based EfficientCruise cruise control system on this model anticipates upcoming uphill
and downhill stretches and calculates the most fuel-efficient speed in
advance, allowing the vehicle’s momentum to be used to save fuel.
Fuel-saving technologies on the TGX EfficientLine 3 include:
EfficientCruise predictive cruise control
EfficientRoll coasting function
D26 engine series developing enhanced torque and power

TipMatic manual transmission with efficiency functions
High-performance TeleMatics system
Since market launch in 2010, more than 65,000 customers have already
opted for the extra-fuel-efficient EfficientLine models and packages.
Coaches
With its aerodynamically optimized design, the NEOPLAN Skyliner
double-decker coach returns fuel consumption of less than
30 l/100 km – a saving of approximately 5% in highway driving at a
constant speed of 100 km/h. This has benefits for the environment as
well, with CO2 emissions of just 12 g/passenger kilometer when operating at full passenger capacity.
Awards
The MAN TGX EfficientLine 3 delivered an impressive performance in
a road test trade magazine “transporte mundial,” recording the lowest
average consumption of any vehicle tested by the magazine to date.
German trade magazines “Verkehrsrundschau” and “Trucker” honored
the new model’s predecessor, the TGX EfficientLine 2, with their “Green
Truck Innovation” award, based on its 2016 environmental rankings.
The NEOPLAN Skyliner was presented with the “International busplaner
Sustainability Award 2017” by German trade magazine “busplaner.”

Low-pollutant natural gas engines
As a clean fuel, natural gas plays a key role in our product portfolio. As well as
providing low-emission propulsion for buses, trucks, and ships, natural gas is
also ideally suited for use in the power generation industry.
City buses
When operated on biogas or e-gas, the MAN Lion’s City GL CNG natural gas-powered city bus is virtually carbon-neutral. Gas-powered
buses accounted for one in five of all MAN city buses sold during the
year under review. MAN Truck & Bus is the leading European supplier
of gas buses, with a current average market share of 39%. In 2016,
the first vehicles were delivered under a contract to supply 143 Lion’s
City CNG buses to the Tbilisi Transport Company in Tbilisi, Georgia.
Ever since MAN presented its first gas-powered bus back in 1943,
the Company has been continuously developing and improving both
the engine and the emissions technology for these vehicles.
Trucks
To explore the potential for natural gas in Brazil and other emerging
markets, MAN Latin America has developed a 23-tonne 100% natural
gas-powered truck for urban operation. A tank capacity of 150 m3
gives this vehicle a driving range of 200 km. Chassis dynamometer tests
have shown major reductions in emissions, with a 95% reduction in
fine particle emissions, a 70% reduction in nitrogen oxides and a 20%
reduction in CO2.

Dual-fuel engines
With its dual-fuel engines, which are capable of operating on both gaseous and liquid fuels, MAN Diesel & Turbo offers a low-carbon propulsion solution for ships that combines energy efficiency with flexibility.
As well as liquefied natural gas (LNG), MAN Diesel & Turbo also offers
engines capable of running on methanol, ethanol, or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).
The first primarily LNG-powered container ships will have engines supplied by MAN Diesel & Turbo. The U.S. shipping company TOTE Inc.
has signed a contract with the NASSCO shipyard in San Diego for the
construction of two new container ships, both powered by an 8L70MEGI dual-fuel two-stroke engine capable of operating on both liquid and
gaseous fuels.
Gas storage
In addition to dual-fuel engines, under the MAN Cryo brand MAN Diesel & Turbo also supplies systems for the storage and processing of
natural gas in maritime applications. This means the Company is able
to supply its customers with complete engine/gas supply solutions for
gas-powered ships.
Gas-fired power plants
MAN Diesel & Turbo gas turbines and gas-only engines offer an ideal
solution for decentralized energy generation. Following the launch of
the 35/44G gas engine (electrical output: 10,335 kW) for power gen-

eration, MAN Diesel & Turbo has now extended its gas engine portfolio
with the 51/60G, which has an electrical output of 18,465 kW. This
unit also features very high efficiency.
In one example from this segment, energy company EnBW Energie
Baden-Württemberg AG has commissioned MAN Diesel & Turbo to
build a 30 MW gas-fired combined heat and power (CHP) plant at its
Stuttgart-Gaisburg site. In addition to producing electricity this plant,
which will be powered by three MAN 20V35/44G gas engines, will also
provide up to 30 MW of district heating. With up to 90% overall efficiency, the plant will achieve a very high fuel utilization factor.
MAN Truck & Bus offers low-pollutant gas engines for CHP plants in an
output range from 37 kW to 580 kW in the case of natural gas, and
from 68 kW to 580 kW for operation on alternative gases such as biogas, landfill gas, or sewage gas. Specially developed for operation on
natural gas and alternative gases, these MAN engines are noted for

their high standards of reliability and energy efficiency. With their optimal combustion/CHP processes, they achieve overall efficiencies of
over 90%. With lambda=1 control and 3-way catalytic converter, the
extensive range of low-maintenance, naturally-aspirated gas engines
allows operators to comply with very strict emissions standards.
Aftertreatment systems
MAN Diesel & Turbo offers its customers highly efficient aftertreatment
systems capable of ensuring compliance with both present and future
emissions requirements. These technologies are not only fitted on new
engines, but are also available for retrofitting on engines already in operation. MAN was the first manufacturer to offer IMO Tier III compliance for
its four-stroke engines by combining them with an SCR (selective catalytic reduction) system. Now we have successfully applied this technology to two-stroke engines as well.

Electricity – the climate-friendly drive technology
With zero pollutant emissions and low noise, plus a low carbon footprint
when the power is renewably generated, electricity is set to be the drive
technology of the future – at least around town and on shorter journeys. By
2020, as a step to expanding electric mobility in the commercial vehicle
sector, we plan to begin volume production of an all-electric city bus and an
electric truck (eTruck). Our economically robust eMobility solutions are
being developed in close collaboration with cities and logistics partners.
Hybrid buses
Our MAN Lion’s City bus is already available in a hybrid version. The
MAN Lion’s City Hybrid bus is powered by a frugal internal combustion engine and an efficient electric motor. Fuel consumption is cut by
up to 30%, equivalent to a reduction of 26 tonnes in annual CO2 emissions. More than 450 MAN hybrid buses have been supplied to customers since the market launch in 2010.
Electric buses
Thanks to its long experience developing electrified powertrains and
components for the MAN Lion’s City Hybrid, MAN Truck & Bus is well
placed to offer practical and efficient solutions for all-electric buses,
too. Here MAN has opted for a modular concept. Charging technologies can be freely selected and combined, and the number of battery
modules can be varied – in line with individual requirements in terms
of driving range and transportation capacity.

In 2016, MAN Truck & Bus entered into “innovation partnerships” with
a number of cities to work towards the goal of emissions-free public
transportation. Together, we are looking to expand the development
of alternative-powered line-service buses.
MAN’s partners include:

The aim of this collaboration is to develop a TCO-optimized, zeroemission concept for electric mobility. At the same time, the innovation partnerships will also provide an opportunity for reviewing and
exploring the potential of fuel cell and hydrogen technology.
Electric trucks
Since 2009, MAN Truck & Bus has been working on new concepts for
goods delivery and waste collection in urban areas. Cities today increasingly face the challenge of finding new ways to balance the requirements of a healthy climate and good quality of life for citizens with the
need for urban goods transportation and delivery. Back in 2012, MAN

2017

eTrucks scheduled to join the MAN product portfolio

Truck & Bus presented a solution in the form of the MAN Metropolis
concept vehicle. In all-electric mode, this electrically powered 26-tonne
refuse collection vehicle operates with zero CO2 emissions. At the
same time, its very low noise emissions mean that it can also operate
at night even in downtown areas. A range extender fitted in the chassis
increases the daily driving range to as much as 150 km.
At the 2016 Commercial Vehicles Trade Fair in Hanover (IAA), MAN
Truck & Bus took the Metropolis approach one stage further, this time
presenting an electrically powered semitrailer tractor for night-time
urban delivery work – a distribution model already well-established in
the food sector, among others. This concept vehicle meets the main
requirements for urban delivery vehicles of the future, combining
generous cargo space with a low unladen weight, zero emissions, and
very quiet operation. Field testing of this vehicle by nine partners from
the Austrian Council for Sustainable Logistics (CNL) will begin in 2017.
From 2020, CNL is planning to switch increasingly to eTrucks for urban
and urban-fringe distribution work. MAN Truck & Bus and CNL signed
a memorandum of understanding regarding this project in early 2017.
The signing was attended by Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern and
Austrian Minister for Transport, Innovation and Technology Jörg
Leichtfried.

Key challenge:
charging technology standardization
MAN sees charging interface standardization as a key
challenge which still needs to be resolved. Standardization is
an essential requirement for ensuring flexibility, interoperability,
and a stable planning framework for city bus operators, and
for the successful introduction of emission-free propulsion
technologies in urban transportation. With this in mind, MAN
is taking part in the public-funded project “eBusCS” (Electric
Bus Charging System), whose sponsors include the German
Federal Ministry for Economics and Energy. For the
manufacturers, the main standardization issues to be tackled
include vehicle-to-grid communication as described in ISO
15118, the positioning of automated charging systems, and
the positioning of the charging inlet on the vehicle.

Remanufacturing and service
The climate footprint of a vehicle depends to a large extent on the length
of its service life. Extending the service life of vehicle components cuts
costs and, compared with manufacturing new parts, also reduces CO₂
emissions and resource consumption. With this in mind, MAN Truck &
Bus professionally remanufactures used parts such as coolant pumps or
crankshafts under the MAN Genuine Parts ecoline brand. These parts then
go back into everyday use. More than 3,000 parts are now offered under
this program. A comprehensive remanufacturing process at our plant in
Nuremberg, Germany, restores used original components to tip-top condition. The first step is a thorough cleaning. The components are dismantled, cleaned in a wash bay, sandblasted, and recoated. Some parts are also
rejected at this stage, since the cleaning process reveals which parts are
still usable and which should be sent for recycling. Parts which are still
functional now enter the remanufacturing process, while worn components are replaced. Finally, the remanufactured components are reassembled and function-tested. The quality standards are high: despite an up to
50% lower price tag, MAN Genuine Parts ecoline products come with the
same warranty as new parts. For customers in most parts of Europe an
extensive range of MAN replacement units and parts is also available.
With more than 115 locations worldwide, MAN PrimeServ, the service
brand of MAN Diesel & Turbo, maintains a strong local market presence.
The PrimeServ portfolio spans everything from certified original parts
and high-quality servicing to customer training and retrofits. Retrofits, for
example for diesel engines or marine propulsion systems, help boost efficiency and cut emissions.

Leveraging the potential of digitization
Digital transformation is opening up whole new business opportunities
and fields of activity for MAN. Taking commercial vehicle connectivity as
our starting point, we are already offering smart services that reduce fuel
consumption, increase fleet utilization levels, and reduce the frequency
of workshop visits.
Sustainable transportation systems from RIO
The transportation industry continues to be dogged by a range of efficiency issues. Often the problems are further compounded by high costs
and time-consuming processes. Digitization has the power to transform
this situation, providing alternatives to the patchwork of stand-alone
solutions that exist at present. Volkswagen Truck & Bus’s digital brand
RIO is pursuing this goal with an open, cloud-based, manufacturer-independent platform which aims to integrate the entire transportation and
logistics ecosystem.
The RIO platform consolidates information from across the transportation and logistics chain, creating a pool of data that can be used to
provide practical advice to all parties in the logistics chain. By improving
information flow, RIO helps to improve the profitability and competitiveness of its customers.
With its digital freight-matching service, for example, RIO is able
to ensure better utilization of truck capacity, reducing the number of
empty journeys. This reduces traffic volumes and brings significant
resource savings. It also improves efficiency and cuts emissions. Because
every empty run comes at a high environmental cost.

Saving potential

2.3

l/100 km: that’s how much fuel experienced
drivers can save by adopting a more efficient driving
style with the help of Connected CoDriver

Connected CoDriver – the virtual co-driver
MAN is also using digitization to support a low-carbon driving style.
After all, even if driver assistance systems already play an important supporting role, the driver still has a major influence on fuel economy. With
Connected CoDriver, MAN Truck & Bus offers its customers a system
which, for the duration of the training period, pairs drivers with an
instructor who acts as a virtual co-driver. Driving data – about the vehicle, the style of driving, and the route topography – is supplied to the
instructor by the TeleMatics system. The instructor uses this data to provide regular coaching and tips for a more efficient driving style via the
hands-free phone system.
Platooning
At the present time, the mandatory minimum following distance between
trucks driving on Europe’s highways is 50 meters. In the future, truck platooning could change all this – with benefits both for the environment
and for traffic flows. MAN defines platooning as a vehicle-based system,
still at the development stage, in which two or more truck-trailer combi-

nations follow each other in close proximity with the aid of driver assistance systems, controller technology, and vehicle-to-vehicle communication. The vehicles are effectively connected by an “electronic tow bar,” with
the lead vehicle controlling the following vehicles in the platoon. The distance between each semitrailer combination is less than 15 meters, or
roughly half a second of driving time. The resulting “slipstreaming effect”
achieves an overall fuel saving for the platoon as a whole of up to 10%,
depending on vehicle model and convoy length, which also leads to
reduced CO2 emissions.
MAN is working with its customer DB Schenker to continue developing and improving platooning technology. This is the first time that a
logistics company and a vehicle manufacturer have cooperated on the
development of connected truck platoons and their testing under realworld conditions. A memorandum of understanding regarding this
cooperation was signed by DB Schenker and MAN in 2016. The first step
will be to define the framework for the project and the accompanying
field tests. Then in 2018, the plan is for a truck platoon to operate on the
“digital highway test track” – a section of the A9 highway between DB
Schenker’s Munich and Nuremberg depots. In the second phase of the
project, self-driving trucks would then be operated at the DB Schenker
site in Nuremberg.
Long trucks
On certain routes, extra-long trucks (up to 25.25 m) have the potential to
absorb the forecast future growth in road freight traffic while at the same
time helping to curb greenhouse gas emissions. An MAN truck was among

the vehicles taking part in the German long-truck field trial which concluded at the end of 2016. The trial vehicle shuttled daily between the
Dachau parts depot and the Salzgitter plant. Findings derived from the scientific monitoring of the field trial show that on average, one trip by a long
truck can replace 1.56 trips by a conventional standard truck, reducing fuel
consumption and CO2 emissions by up to 25%.
In Germany, long trucks are already in regular operation on certain
sections of the highway network. Since December 2016, a further long
truck has been operating between our Munich plant and a freight company in Braunschweig. MAN’s findings corroborate the savings claimed by
the Federal Highway Research Institute.
Since mid-2014, MAN has been playing a pilot role in the “Study on
High Capacity Vehicles” task force of the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA). The aim is to analyze the opportunities and
risks offered by new vehicle concepts for long-haul transport. This will be
underpinned by the development of a Smart Infrastructure Access Policy
(SIAP) aimed at improving the efficiency of multimodal freight transport.

Product quality
As already reported in the 2015 GRI Report, MAN Truck & Bus performed
strongly in the 2015 TÜV Report for Commercial Vehicles, where it was
the truck manufacturer with the highest share of vehicles to pass the
main TÜV inspections free of faults. 85.9% of the trucks proved free of
faults (2014: 83%). A TÜV Report for Commercial Vehicles was not published in 2016.
Driver assistance systems
Highly and fully automated driving is an increasingly important development focus. As well as improving safety, such systems also help make our
vehicles even more efficient. Based on many years of accident research,
MAN Truck & Bus is working to continuously improve the safety of its
vehicles. The following are some of the driver assistance systems which
are playing a key role:
 daptive Cruise Control (ACC): The ACC radar sensor, which has a
A
range of approx. 150 meters, detects the distance and relative speed of
preceding vehicles in the same lane as the subject vehicle. Armed with
this information, the system actively controls vehicle speed, acceleration, and deceleration in order to maintain the required distance from
the vehicle ahead.
 mergency Brake Assist (EBA): The new-generation EBA (Emergency
E
Brake Assist) system makes MAN vehicles safer on the road and reduces
the risk of accidents. Sensor fusion – data from the radar sensor at the

front of the vehicle is combined with information from the camera in
the front windscreen – allows the new system to detect hazardous situations even faster and more reliably, and to initiate emergency braking
sooner in a critical situation.
 ane Guard System (LGS): On long and monotonous journeys, or
L
when driving at night, drivers may be prone to attention lapses or
microsleep. By monitoring lane-keeping behavior, LGS improves both
safety and driving comfort. The system provides an audible alert if the
vehicle starts to stray from its lane, provided the driver has not signaled
a lane change with the direction indicator.
The European research project euroFOT, in which companies and institutions from ten different countries took part, established that MAN driver
assistance systems improve road safety and reduce fuel consumption.
Trucks using ACC achieved average fuel savings of almost 2% over the
period of the trial, despite also recording a higher average speed. At the
same time critical events such as hard braking or sudden evasive maneuvers were reduced by more than one third, while the number of times the
following distance from the vehicle ahead fell to critical levels was halved.
LGS, which warns the driver of a lane departure, resulted in better lanekeeping and smoother steering. In the concluding driver survey, 94% of
drivers said that ACC significantly improved safety – and rated it as one of
the most important driver assistance systems for trucks.

MAN Diesel & Turbo’s 13 PrimeServ Academies offer technical training
and customized product training for both customers and employees,
which can be delivered directly on-site, even on board the customer’s
ship or at the customer’s power station. Technical know-how transfer
mainly takes the form of hands-on product-based training. In 2016, we
provided training for 9,000 participants, approximately 7,000 of them
customers. All PrimeServ Academies worldwide operate to the same
high quality standards. The PrimeServ Academies also serve as a network for promoting the exchange of knowledge between customers,
suppliers, and our research and development departments. We also offer
web-based training that combines practical elements with e-learning.
Fifteen thousand participants have already benefitted from our digital
training portfolio.
When it comes to product safety, we depend on the support of
each and every one of our employees. This calls for a high level of safety
awareness along with high standards of competence on the part of our
employees when it comes to areas as critical as explosion safety or
machine safety. This was the focus of the Rollout of Standardized Safety
Training (ROST) project, which was completed in 2016. Its goal of realigning existing continuing professional development programs around the
topic of product safety and achieving a uniform standard across the
Company was achieved. At MAN Diesel & Turbo, more than 4,500 participants received product safety training in 2016.

Strategic priorities and their implementation
The key priorities for the implementation of MAN’s human resources
strategy are:
Attracting the right employees
As an attractive, modern employer, it is our aim to get potential employees excited about MAN and win them over at an early stage. Our employer
marketing activities are aligned with the demands of digitization and new
generations of employees. We offer a variety of opportunities for getting
started at MAN – from internships for secondary-school students to a
wide range of vocational training programs, our Global Champion Trainee
Program, and traditional direct hiring.
Retaining the right employees
We offer our employees opportunities to structure their working hours
more flexibly and freely, through models such as Flex Work, telecommuting, and trust-based hours. When designing offices and workstations, we
pay attention to layout, furnishings, and equipment. Through our new,
open-plan concepts for different working environments, we are aiming to
boost our employees’ efficiency, innovativeness, and satisfaction – and
helping to keep them with MAN for the long term.

As a top employer, we recognize the importance of continuing professional education and development for our employees. Whether their goal
is to build and expand skill sets for their current position or for the next
step in their career, we support every employee by offering them targeted
training opportunities. We honor performance by ensuring that all
employees share in the Company’s success – because good performance
should be rewarded.
Diversity
Diversity is an important issue for MAN, and goes far beyond creating
opportunities for women. A diverse workforce boosts our competitiveness, making it a cornerstone of our corporate success going forward.
For this reason, we recognize and actively foster the distinctive qualities of
our employees. At MAN, we define diversity as encompassing gender,
nationality, disabilities, age, competencies, and both professional and life
experience. By adopting a clear stance in favor of diversity, we create value
for the Company.

Occupational health and safety management
Challenges and objectives
Shifting demographics and the ever-increasing pace of change in the
working environment present significant challenges for occupational
health and safety at MAN.
These factors affect our employees’ productivity and require holistic approaches to maintain and restore their health. Given that healthy
and productive employees are essential to the long-term success of the
Company, within the framework of our comprehensive occupational
safety and health management program at MAN we place high priority on
ergonomics and preventive health and safety in the workplace.

Management approach

Organization
The central health services function at MAN is responsible for guiding
us as an employer in the formulation and implementation of our Company-wide health management strategy. The goal is to define a coordinated strategic approach to health services worldwide by developing principles which are applicable in every location. In addition, the health
services at our plants act independently to address specific concerns with
appropriate measures.
Systems and instruments
At MAN, occupational health measures aim to strengthen the health
awareness of our employees and managers and encourage them to take
the initiative in matters concerning their own health. To this end, we offer
health counseling, training courses, therapeutic measures, and re-integration assistance.
Occupational safety includes all measures related to preventing
workplace accidents, work-related illnesses, and occupational diseases.
Our occupational safety management is part of our integrated management system (, page 48). The OHSAS 18001 certified management
systems at our sites help to continuously improve the safety and health
of our workforce.
Across the Group, we systematically evaluate workstation ergonomics and potential workplace hazards. This reflects the high priority
that we assign to improving ergonomics in our production sites with the
aim of keeping our employees healthy and physically fit. In addition, we
conduct regular internal and external occupational health and safety
audits and inspections.

Employee structure
The MAN headcount is defined as active employees (permanent staff),
employees in the passive phase of partial retirement, and vocational trainees. It does not include subcontracted employees.
On December 31, 2016, the MAN Group employed 53,824 people. This
represents a decrease of 1,206 employees compared with the end of 2015.
The ratio of employees in Germany to those in other countries changed
only slightly. Our non-German companies employed a total of 22,380 people, a year-on-year downturn of 930. Compared with the previous year, the
number of employees working in Germany fell by 276 to 31,444.
The number of employees on fixed-term contracts rose by 28% to
1,881 (2015: 1,467). The number of subcontracted employees increased by
760 to 1,562. In 2016, 109 subcontracted employees were taken on as permanent staff. In the year under review, 941 women and 309 men at MAN
held part-time contracts not related to parental leave.

Vocational training and the dual model
Our dual model of vocational training ensures the professional development of the next generation of outstanding technical and commercial
employees. The program, which is anchored in the MAN Academy, saw
some 800 young people start their careers at MAN in late 2016 – in locations including Germany, Austria, Turkey, and Poland.
At MAN, our vocational trainees were able to complete their training in a total of 26 vocational training programs, 22 for technical and four
for commercial professions. In the year under review, 17.0% of our 3,145
vocational trainees were women.
Dual education programs in cooperation with various universities
are increasingly popular among young people. At present, more than 180
students on dual education and integrated vocational training and degree
programs are completing the practical part of their studies at our sites in
Germany. 25.4% of the participants in these programs are women, an
almost 5.0% increase against the previous year.
Worldwide, vocational trainees and students on dual programs
make up 6.3% of the MAN Group’s active workforce. The digitization of the
workplace (Industry 4.0) plays a key role in our vocational training programs, which can focus on areas such as virtual welding, 3D printing,
and robot cells.

Approximately 175,400 participants around the globe took part in some
14,500 continuing professional development (CPD) and training initiatives in 2016. Each MAN Truck & Bus employee received an average of 20.3
CPD hours in the year under review.
At MAN, learning and teaching takes place in close cooperation
with internal experts. They pass their knowledge on to their colleagues
within the “Berufsfamilien” (vocational groups), which include all employees who have a common skill that they develop further. This training and
knowledge transfer takes place within the Berufsfamilien Academies. In
2016 the principle of the Berufsfamilien Academies (BFA) was further
expanded and broadened by the MAN Academy to guarantee uniform
standards of quality and competencies around the globe. The focus of
expansion was on the Sales/AfterSales, Engineering, and Finance sectors.
In early 2016, the number of users with access to all of the content of our
centralized learning platform was also expanded to include the employees
at our Steyr and Ankara sites. Furthermore, we added to our digital learning programs aimed at employees and managers.
Segment heads and group leaders (“Meister”) working at VW Truck
& Bus GmbH brand sites in Germany also had the opportunity to take part
in the joint “New Dimensions for Production Supervisors” leadership program, which gave them a chance to network and learn from each other.
The participants came from the Production, Engineering, and Vocational
Training functions. As part of our international CPD initiatives, this program was also rolled out in Turkish at our Ankara site.

Leadership and management training
As the working environment continues to change, digitization progresses,
and the disconnect between workplace and working hours grows, managers in particular are facing new challenges. To help them keep pace with
the shifting demands of their positions, in 2016 MAN Truck & Bus
launched initiatives such as the “Leadership Forum” as a new training format at its Munich site. It gives managers a chance to reflect on and discuss
the transformation of the workplace and the leadership challenges it
poses, and to take advantage of their colleagues’ advice.
The selection and training of high potentials for management
functions and leadership roles continues to be a key aspect of HR development at MAN. In addition, more new training initiatives are being rolled
out for the commercial vehicle brands. One important objective of these
programs is cross-brand networking between managers.

Top employer
To secure a lasting position as a top employer, MAN has committed itself
to the following objectives:
offering comprehensive onboarding programs to integrate new

employees into the world of MAN as quickly as possible
providing topic-specific and interdisciplinary training and CPD
facilitating the creation of professional and international networks
fostering cooperation across divisions
positioning MAN as a top IT employer
reaching out to a new target group through innovative recruiting methods and events such as the hackathon held at the Technical University
of Munich in 2016
We believe that our employees make the most convincing ambassadors
for the Company’s attractiveness as an employer. “Best Employer of 2016,”
a Germany-wide study conducted by the Statista, Xing and Kununu online
portals in cooperation with FOCUS magazine, ranked over 2,000 companies. Rated by industry, MAN placed 19th in the mechanical engineering
sector. We were also ranked 33rd in the 2016 Trendence survey of college
graduates in Germany, and finished 26th in the Universum ranking.
Fostering young talent
It is our aim to attract and retain talent at an early stage. We offer internships, scholarships, and career development programs to young people
who are attending or have recently graduated from universities and vocational-technical schools. In 2016, the MAN Group supported 20 PhD students and gave some 3,000 students from universities and schools around
the world a chance to gain first-hand work experience with the Company.
Our young talent programs target students at more than 100 technical colleges and universities. In 2016, the MAN Group was represented at
some 15 specialist and university career fairs. In addition, our experts

staged numerous activities at colleges and universities around the world.
By way of example, for five years now MAN has supported teams from
Munich Technical University, Munich University of Applied Sciences, Karls­
ruhe Institute of Technology, and RWTH Aachen in the Formula Student
Germany race series. These activities focus on providing opportunities for
meetings and discussions with MAN employees.
Employee opinion survey
[G4-26] In mid-2016, we conducted our employee opinion survey for the
fourth time. The opinion survey (also known by its German name “Stimmungsbarometer” or mood barometer) is a standardized, anonymous,
voluntary survey of the employees of all brands and companies in the
Volkswagen Group. By participating, employees can play an active role in
shaping events at MAN. The survey measures employee satisfaction and
identification with the Company and is also used to gauge the success of
MAN’s “Top Employer” HR strategy. In recent years, the “Stimmungsbarometer” has been not only the catalyst for the generation and implementation of numerous improvements in a variety of areas, but also the
source of ideas for fine-tuning the survey itself. This prompted us to
revamp the employee opinion survey for 2016 and roll it out in its new
and improved form.
37,215 employees of the MAN Group participated in the 2016 survey, representing a participation rate of 86% – almost the same as in the
previous year (87%). At 74.7 points, the measured level of employee satisfaction is more positive than in 2015 (73.9). Employees expressed their
opinions in sections under the headings of “In our organizational unit,”
“Working together,” and “My work and I at MAN.” Their responses revealed
both strengths and scope for improvement in fields such as working conditions, information, quality, productivity, leadership, and teamwork. The
survey results will be used as the basis for subsequent improvement processes and follow-up activities. By the deadline of March 1, 2017, 4,662

measures had been defined. These will be implemented in the departments and teams in 2017. Not only does this tool help foster an intrapreneurial attitude among our employees, it also boosts our image as an
employer and makes a positive contribution to the transformation of
our corporate culture.
Retirement benefits
When their active working life comes to an end, employees in Germany
receive benefits from a modern and attractive occupational pension system that constitute a key element of MAN’s remuneration policy. These
benefits represent a reliable source of additional income on retirement
and also provide cover for the risk of permanent disability or death during
active employment. Employees benefit from employer contributions that
are tied to their remuneration and can make additional provision through
deferred compensation — which is employer-subsidized for staff who are
covered by collective bargaining agreements.
For employees at sites outside Germany, depending on the usual
practice in each country we make market-based contributions to thirdparty pension plans or retirement investment funds. These also include
defined benefit pension plans, the majority of which are designed to provide life-long annuities.
Job security
As part of a realignment of the MAN Truck & Bus production network,
we have streamlined our European manufacturing group, clearly defining the operational focal points of each plant. We achieve higher produc-

tivity by bundling similar types of production at fewer sites, while efficient vertical integration keeps our headcount at an almost consistently
high level. Against this backdrop, MAN Truck & Bus plans to make a
three-digit million euro investment by 2019. These plans are being rolled
out in consultation with the responsible labor unions in Germany,
Poland, Austria, and Turkey.
In late 2016, MAN Diesel & Turbo launched its Base Camp 3000+
program dedicated to ensuring the future viability and profitability of the
company. Base Camp 3000+ will tackle the further development of the
company’s strategy in light of the business sector’s increasing focus on
digitization and carbon neutrality, with the long-term aim of boosting
earnings by €450 million. The greatest share of this improvement will be
achieved through efficiency measures and optimizations affecting development, sales, quality, product costs and Group functions. Furthermore,
at the end of March 2017 the Executive Board and General Works Council
of MAN Diesel & Turbo SE agreed on a series of measures aimed at the
structural optimization of its Augsburg, Berlin, Hamburg, and Oberhausen sites. A total of 900 jobs will be cut as a result of these measures, 600
of them in Germany. Further savings will be targeted through the streamlining of procurement and order processing. Under the plan, each site in
the turbomachinery network will be assigned clearly defined competences and products. The company’s two Hamburg plants will be merged.
The negotiated agreement does not call for any site closures or lay-offs;
the downsizing will be conducted in accordance with the company’s commitments to social responsibility. The agreed measures are due to be
implemented by the end of 2018 at the latest.

Employee rights
The MAN Code of Conduct guides our daily behavior and activities. We
respect human rights, do not tolerate discrimination, and are committed to transparency. In the reporting period, no cases of discrimination
were ascertained.
MAN recognizes the rights of workers to form and participate in
unions and to conduct collective bargaining. Almost all permanent staff in
Germany are covered by collective bargaining agreements; around the
globe, the share of our workforce which falls under collective agreements
stands at 83%.
The Volkswagen Charter on Temporary Work has been rolled out at
MAN Truck & Bus and MAN Diesel & Turbo. As the next step in the rollout
of the Charter on Labor Relations, in 2016 a framework participation agreement was agreed for the MAN Truck & Bus Group companies in Poland. In
the various countries where MAN is active, employee relations are structured in accordance with national laws and regulations.

Equal opportunity
MAN is committed to diversity and equal opportunity – respecting
employees regardless of age, gender, religion, ethnicity, and sexual orientation. This is why, around the world, we actively promote the diversity of
our workforce, recognize the value of each individual, and foster a teamoriented culture of performance based on our corporate values.
One area we focus on is equal opportunities for men and women,
which we advance by holding events such as our “Girls for Engineering”
Camp. In Austria, our “Women on the fast track” recruiting campaign
aimed at encouraging women to undertake technical vocational training
won a gold HR Award and raised the percentage of women among the new
vocational trainees to 30% in 2016.
MAN offers special HR development measures, such as its mentoring program, to support women who are starting out as specialists and
managers. We offer special programs and training courses for our employees on parental leave.
Our guidelines for management hiring specify that diversity and
the placement of qualified women in particular are to be given due consideration. Our new managers receive training to raise their awareness
of the issue of equal opportunity. In 2016, the proportion of female managers rose slightly to 9.0% (including Executive Board; not including
Executive Board members: 9.2%), up from 8.6% in 2015. We promoted 14
women within management levels one to three in the year under review.
This represents 14.3% of our management promotions (2015: 11%). These
management levels are part of the management structure of the MAN
Group, which is derived from our assessment of the functions and
reflects their value to the Company. Generally speaking, level one is
equivalent to employees at the first reporting level. There are currently
no women on the Executive Board of the MAN Group. However, one

additional woman joined the Supervisory Board in the year under review,
bringing the number of women who sit on that Board to four – representing 25% of its membership.

Balancing work and family
MAN continues to work to help its employees achieve a better work-life
balance, offering measures which include flexible working hours, the
opportunity to split a full-time position into two part-time positions, and
company daycare centers at MAN’s Munich and Augsburg sites that care
for 137 infants, toddlers and young children. We also offer part-time hours
for management staff. Information sessions for expecting parents, a seminar on re-entry into the workforce after parental leave, a vacation program
for employees’ children, and opportunities to work from home round off
the opportunities available at the Munich site.
In summer 2016, an agreement was concluded at MAN Diesel &
Turbo with the aim of providing more long-term support for employees
balancing work and families. The agreement empowers employees to
work remotely on a regular or a flexible, as-needed basis, and has been
taken up by both female and male employees alike. On the school holiday

Inclusion
The Company management, the General Works Council, and the Group
Council for Employees with Disabilities are committed to providing equal
opportunities for and preventing discrimination against people with severe
disabilities or an equivalent status. In the year under review, MAN employed
1,689 severely disabled people in Germany (2015: 1,609).

Examples of active measures to promote inclusion at our Munich site
include redesign of workstations, creation of new jobs for severely disabled persons, accessible communication for deaf employees, and mobility aids. At the MAN Truck & Bus plant in Salzgitter, inclusion is an integral part of the vocational training program. As part of the “Changing
Sides” project, vocational trainees from the Braunschweig chapter of Lebenshilfe, an association for the support of people with disabilities, spend
two weeks at the MAN Academy. In return, five vocational trainees from
MAN spend two weeks helping out at the Lebenshilfe workshop. The project was awarded the Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s Social Transfer Prize in 2015. It continued in 2016 with joint projects to design a reception area for the Salzgitter plant and to convert a bicycle into an
info-mobile for Lebenshilfe Braunschweig.

Preventive occupational safety
Across the Group, we have continued with all existing initiatives to cut
accident rates and prevent work-related illness. As part of our “Workplace
Optimization” initiative, we systematically assessed the ergonomics of all
workstations in MAN Truck & Bus production sites. The cross-site Health
and Safety Competence Forum aims to facilitate the exchange of information and the strategic development of occupational health and safety in
the coming years.
In 2016, MAN Diesel & Turbo continued and expanded its focus on
health and safety on business trips. In addition, the “Increased assessment
of dangers to mental health in the workplace” project was brought to a
successful conclusion and integrated into regular processes at all German
and Swiss sites. In one occupational health program at our Augsburg site,
we took an in-depth look at allergies, our focal topic for the year, in a series
of coordinated events.
At MAN Truck & Bus in Munich, the “Assessing dangers to mental
health in the workplace” pilot project was also successfully rolled out in
several segments in 2016. It will be expanded to include all production
areas in the Munich plant in 2017. In addition, in 2016 we developed and
finalized our "Healthy Leadership” seminar. Every manager will be able to
participate in this program going forward.
In 2016, MAN Latin America carried out a total of 150 measures
aimed at improving occupational safety. Occupational health and safety
activities focused on issues related to ergonomics, work-related health
risks, and safe operation of production machinery.

When it comes to documenting workplace accidents, MAN is aware of
regional and cultural differences that impact on reporting. With this in
mind, we are aiming to address these differences by incorporating suitable measures in our management approach.

calculating the index is the number of workplace accidents multiplied by 1 million divided by hours worked.
4 The accident severity index indicates the severity of accidents by showing the sum of workdays missed due to injury in relation to the number of hours worked. The formula for calculating the index is the number of workdays missed multiplied by 1 million divided by hours
worked multiplied by 10.

In 2016, there was a fatal accident during a field service assignment of an
employee from the MAN Diesel & Turbo Copenhagen site, which we
deeply regret. The Executive Board was informed of the incident. The accident was analyzed with the authorities and the existing hazard assessment process was reviewed. As a result, we have introduced measures to
prevent a recurrence of this type of accident. In addition, the results of the
analysis were passed on to all relevant sites and reported to occupational
safety bodies throughout the Group.

Occupational health and safety

Behavior-based safety
We promote the health of our employees by taking measures to reduce
accidents, prevent occupational illnesses, and maintain good health.
As part of our “Workplace Optimization” initiative, we assessed the
ergonomics in MAN Truck & Bus production sites, leading to a significant
reduction in physical strain at all workstations. One aspect of our “Always
Safe. Always Good.” initiative, which has been rolled out at almost all of
our European sites, is the improvement of behavior-based safety. The
campaign is aiming to improve the safety culture in which managers and
employees are trained. In 2016, some 35 workshops were held to train
more managers and employees at the German sites of Munich, Nuremberg, and Salzgitter in behavior-based safety. At both sites in Poland, in
2016 the campaign was carried out by a specially qualified trainer. We are
planning to launch the initiative at our Plauen and Ankara sites in 2017.
In addition, the Occupational Safety Competence Forum, a regular
meeting for the heads of occupational safety from the MAN Truck & Bus
plants, contributes to the continuous improvement of occupational safety
throughout the Group.
MAN Diesel & Turbo places particular emphasis on preventing
occupational accidents. Thanks to the MAN Diesel & Turbo “Zero Accident” initiative, 2016 marks the eighth year in a row in which there has
been a decrease in the severity of workplace accidents within the subgroup. Established in 2014, behavior-based safety programs were finetuned in the UK, the United States, and our Augsburg site in 2016. The programs aim to increase awareness of hazardous situations, systematically
eliminate risks, and foster safe workplace habits. In addition, the “Safety
First” campaign has made a valuable contribution to improving safety
awareness and occupational health and safety. The majority of MAN Die-

sel & Turbo’s service engineers have also been trained and certified in line
with the Safety Certificate Contractors standards, which aim to sharpen
safety awareness on customer construction sites and in projects.
In the year under review, the international MAN Diesel & Turbo
HSE Conference was held again to focus on strategy and targets in the area
of occupational health and safety. In 2016, an all-day event called “Safety
Stand-down Day” was also held for the third time for all employees at
MAN Diesel & Turbo sites in the USA.
OHSAS 18001 certification
In the reporting period, our sites in Dachau and Rheine received OHSAS
18001 certification for the first time. This means that 27 of our sites are now
certified under the occupational health and safety management system.

Occupational health and safety

Through our targeted occupational health measures, we encourage our
employees to take the initiative in matters concerning their own health.
This not only includes offerings from our annual health program, but also
initiatives such as stop smoking classes, intraocular pressure examinations, flu shots, massages, and a healthy eating program in cooperation
with Weight Watchers. In cooperation with MAN Academy, we offer
numerous training programs which reinforce employees’ personal
responsibility, underpin healthy behavior and teamwork, and foster a
leadership culture which promotes good health.
In addition, MAN sees programs and assistance for employees reintegrating into the workplace following a protracted illness or accident
not only as a legal obligation, but as an integral part of maintaining our
employees’ ability to work and employability. The “MAN Checkup” is a preventive health initiative which is also aimed at helping employees remain
healthy as well as identifying any potential risks at an early stage.

At MAN Diesel & Turbo, the employee assistance program (EAP) is another
important pillar of occupational health management. An integral part of
our HR policy for many years, EAP services include counseling during crisis situations and the development of concrete solutions.

Environmental Management
Challenges and goals
In the production sector, climate change, pollution, and resource scarcity
are global challenges to which the MAN Group is responding. With this in
mind, accepting responsibility for the climate and the environment has
traditionally been a key element of our corporate culture. We use our integrated management systems and advanced technology to mitigate the
adverse environmental impacts of our activities. We take our responsibility seriously; in 2011 we drew up MAN’s Climate Strategy, which included
the binding goal of reducing CO2 emissions from our production plants by
25% by 2020, compared to the 2008 baseline (, Climate Strategy, 7).

Annex
Material GRI aspects covered by this chapter:

Materials – Energy – Emissions – Effluents and Waste – Compliance with
Environmental Legislation and Regulations – Transportation

Organization
Our environmental management systems are organized at MAN subgroup level and implemented in line with the requirements of ISO 14001.
The overarching objectives, such as MAN’s Climate Strategy, are additionally reported to the CR function of the MAN SE Group. All goals are pursued in collaboration with the subgroups, and put into practice by the
responsible individuals at each site.
The central Environmental Protection and Occupational Safety functions of the subgroups analyze requirements, implement and steer the
management systems, and drive them forward in close collaboration
with the environmental management officers at the production sites.
The plant managers and heads of production are responsible for operational tasks related to environmental protection. At each site, they are supported by specialist officers and/or environmental protection experts.
Regular meetings on environmental protection, climate action, and
energy management are held at subgroup level to ensure an ongoing
exchange of information across all central functions and sites.

Management approach

Systems and instruments
The MAN Group operates systems for managing environmental protection, occupational safety, and quality. At the production sites, these systems are regularly verified by external experts or auditors, as well as by
internal audits. We also operate a range of activities relating to energy
management. Other key systems and instruments for implementing
MAN’s Climate Strategy and environmental protection include:
Internal policies and guidelines
Regulations on environmental protection, energy, and occupational safety
Alongside occupational safety, environmental protection is firmly
anchored in the vocational training and continuing professional development activities of our employees.

Transportation and Logistics Management
Principles and guidelines
Reducing the environmental impacts of our transportation and logistics
activities is another key element of our integrated environmental management system. MAN Truck & Bus has set a number of targets in this
respect, including the optimization of transportation structures and procedures. A dedicated tool for computing the CO2 emissions from transportation activities has been put in place.
To reduce CO2 emissions within our own logistics chain, we supply
our regional freight forwarders via freight hubs, which consolidate shipments, optimize vehicle capacity utilization, and prevent vehicles from
having to make empty runs. As a commercial vehicle manufacturer, we
expect our service providers to use state-of-the-art trucks that comply
with the latest emissions standards.

Our regulations on air travel, car rental, and rail travel, which apply across
the MAN Group, stipulate that journeys should only be undertaken when
unavoidable. Alternatives such as video and telephone conferencing
should always be considered in the first instance, and priority should
always be given to the most environmentally friendly mode of transportation, provided it is financially feasible.

Supplier Management
Challenges and goals
The MAN Group’s procurement policy aims to reduce environmental and
social risks in the supply chain while simultaneously optimizing material
costs. As well as maximizing cost-effectiveness and efficiency, we are also
committed to improving sustainability aspects.
To this end, MAN has adopted the core system of the Volkswagen
Group’s “Sustainability in Supplier Relations” concept. Together with traditional priorities such as quality, price, and delivery times, the concept
has been thoroughly integrated into our procurement processes. Before
submitting a quote, suppliers are required to accept the Volkswagen
Group’s sustainability requirements, which are written into all supplier
contracts ( Code of Conduct for Business Partners).
The requirements apply to all purchased goods and services worldwide. We also expect our tier 1 suppliers to pass these requirements on to
their own suppliers. This helps ensure a consistently high quality of procured goods and services, while avoiding potential supply shortages and
damage to our reputation. Both MAN and its suppliers profit from the
long-term supplier relationships which result.

Management approach

Concept and organization
The “Sustainability in Supplier Relations” concept is based on three main
pillars: requirements, monitoring, and development. The idea is to minimize and prevent negative social, environmental, and financial impacts
along our supply chain.
The Volkswagen Group’s requirements regarding sustainability in supplier relations span a range of issues, including environmental protection, employee rights, fair market conduct, and transparent business
relations, and have been a mandatory element of all contracts since
2015. They set out expectations in terms of business partners’ conduct
with regard to central environmental and social standards. Among
other things, they are based on the principles of the UN Global Compact, the International Chamber of Commerce's Business Charter for
Sustainable Development, and the relevant conventions of the International Labour Organization. The observance of human rights is another
key element, including the rejection of child, forced, and compulsory
labor, and compliance with all other regulations on worker protection.
These principles are supplemented by MAN’s Environmental Policy
and all related environmental targets and regulations, the Group’s
Quality Policy, and the Volkswagen Declaration on Social Rights
( 2016 Volkswagen Sustainability Report).
We use the
Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) to help us identify
risks early on. This sustainability questionnaire was jointly developed
by ten OEMs within the European Automotive Working Group on Supply Chain Sustainability, and is continuously updated. We also appoint
independent auditors to conduct sustainability audits, which scrutinize our suppliers for compliance with environmental, social, and
human rights standards.
This monitoring enables us to identify areas for improvement and
guide our suppliers toward development opportunities, including an
e-learning course offered by the VW Group.

Systems and instruments
To ensure that the concept of sustainability is firmly anchored in our supply chain, the MAN Group provides all suppliers with access to an e-learning module on sustainability, which is available in all the languages of our
defined risk markets. After completing this module, the supplier must
take a final examination.
The Volkswagen Group uses an internal system for sustainable supply chain management, providing supplier-specific sustainability information to facilitate comprehensive analysis. If one of our suppliers or
their suppliers is suspected of violating our sustainability requirements,
we will request a written statement using a standardized report (known as
the 6D report). Based on the six points in the report, the supplier can
respond to the alleged violations, describe what remedial action is being
taken, and submit the required documentation. If the answers prove
unsatisfactory, we take further appropriate steps, such as the examination
of documents, on-site visits to the supplier’s premises, or further tailored
supplier training activities.
Throughout all process steps and measures, the focus is on fair dialog between partners and on supplier development, in the interests of
continuous, long-term collaboration.

[G4-22, G4-23] This chapter covers 30 production sites in the MAN Truck
& Bus, MAN Latin America, MAN Diesel & Turbo, and Renk divisions. As
in the previous year, it also includes data from the St. Petersburg site,
which is now operated as a joint venture with Scania. In the interests of
transparency, in 2016 the Group introduced a uniform reporting framework aligned with that of the Volkswagen Group. The framework has also
been redefined with regard to the production sites. Under the new, uniform Group definition, non-production sites (Dachau, Salzgitter (warehouse), Holeby, and Plauen) are no longer included in the reporting
framework. Direct comparisons with previous years’ figures are therefore
only possible to a limited extent. Eliminating the four non-production sites
leads to minor deviations from the previous years’ figures. In 2015, MAN
Diesel & Turbo acquired a new production site in Bangalore, which will be
included in reporting from 2017 onward. An overview of all Group sites
can be found on the Volkswagen Navigator ( Volkswagen Navigator).

The following environmental data for production at MAN is based primarily on production volumes plus one-off effects that impact the 2016
environmental indicator levels.

The reporting of CO2 emissions in the Progress Report on MAN’s Climate Strategy refers solely to the 28 production sites that fall within the
scope of the Climate Strategy, and excludes the Winterthur and
St. Petersburg sites.
Our reporting of direct and indirect CO2 emissions is aligned with the emission factors of the Association of the German Automotive Industry (VDA),
except for emissions from district heating. Wherever possible, we use sitespecific emission factors here; otherwise the VDA factors are applied.

Commercial Vehicles
In 2016, production at MAN Truck & Bus was characterized by rising
production volumes compared with 2015, with an increase of more than
6% in the number of vehicles produced to over 83,000. This in turn drove
up demand for energy and raw materials, along with the volume of production-related waste and emissions. Additionally, in the reporting
period, construction work at production sites influenced energy and raw
materials demand, as well as volumes of construction waste.
In 2016, production at MAN Latin America was affected by the difficult
market environment in Brazil. Production output dropped a further
16% or so against the already comparatively low level of the previous
year, to less than 20,000 vehicles. This in turn led to a decrease in
volume-dependent environmental indicators.
On balance, the number of vehicles produced in the Commercial Vehicles business area remained more or less constant.
When interpreting the environmental and climate indicators in the
Commercial Vehicles business area, it is also important to bear in mind
the realignment of the MAN Truck & Bus production alliance in 2016,

which led to an adjustment of production volumes. During the course
of the year, bus production was relocated from Poznan to Starachowice, and environmental figures from the Poznan site are therefore
included in this CR Report for the last time. Neoplan bus production in
Plauen was discontinued in 2015 and relocated to our Ankara site. The
factory in Salzgitter was redeveloped into a component plant. Truck
production at our Munich plant was further expanded to accommodate volumes from other sites. Production volumes at our Steyr site
were likewise realigned to improve capacity utilization and efficiency,
reducing energy consumption as well. Because these modifications
entailed some major construction work, some of which will continue
into 2017, the environmental indicators reflect a number of additional
special effects. As such, the full potential of this realignment will not be
seen until all the changes and updates are complete. “Produktion”
magazine and management consultants A.T. Kearney presented MAN
Truck & Bus with an award at the “Factory of the Year 2016” conference in recognition of its redeveloped production network.

Power Engineering
Production at MAN Diesel & Turbo was affected by the difficult market
environment in the power engineering sector. An increased number of
product tests instigated by our customers, coupled with extensive
marine engine testing required as part of our R&D activities, outweighed the energy efficiency gains achieved, although visible signs of
progress were seen in other indicators such as water use and VOC
(volatile organic compound) emissions.
Production figures at Renk showed a stable development, and environmental indicators were on par with the previous year.

Energy management
The efficient use of energy, energy-saving targets, and the use of renewables are all part of our environmental management system. At our
Nuremberg site, as well as at our sites in South Africa, we conducted an
assessment to gauge compliance with the requirements of ISO 50001. Our
distribution company in Germany (SRG) is certified to ISO 50001.
Energy experts at MAN Truck & Bus and MAN Diesel & Turbo meet
regularly to discuss ways of improving energy efficiency and optimizing
energy management.
To complement the intranet-based platform established in 2015, in
the year under review a workshop was held at MAN Diesel & Turbo with
energy experts from the sites, with a view to intensifying the exchange of
knowledge. At our Augsburg site, we also updated our energy management system to ISO 50001 and had the foundry recertified in 2016, following on from its original certification in 2014.
Energy consumption
In 2016, energy consumption at MAN production sites showed only a minimal year-on-year change, remaining on par with the previous year at
1.37 million megawatt-hours (MWh). In the Commercial Vehicles business
area, energy consumption per vehicle produced fell from 9.4 MWh in 2015
to 8.8 MWh per unit in 2016, due to the higher production figures at MAN
Truck & Bus (economies of scale) and the effects of the energy-saving measures implemented.

CO2 reduction as part of MAN’s Climate Strategy
By 2020, we are aiming to reduce our CO₂ emissions from production by
25% relative to the 2008 baseline. So far, we have achieved a 19.8% reduction – equivalent to around 108,000 tonnes of CO₂. (, Scope of the Climate Strategy, page 53). Year-on-year, our CO₂ reductions have remained
stable at a high level. In working toward our climate goal, the sites have
drawn up plans to save energy and cut CO₂ emissions. They include measures such as:
Implementing new energy supply concepts
Using renewable energies
Optimizing lighting systems
Reducing base load by switching off machinery on weekends and
when plants are closed
Replacing ventilation systems
Optimizing heating control
Renovating buildings
Raising employee awareness

Measures implemented in 2016 under
MAN’s Climate Strategy
Munich cogeneration plant
In 2016, construction work on the combined heat and power (CHP)
plant in Munich was completed. The twin 2.5 megawatt natural gas
units are capable of generating up to 20% of the plant’s heat and
power requirements, marking a significant milestone in MAN’s Climate Strategy and “Green Production” initiative. CHP uses the heat
produced during electricity generation to achieve major energy savings and CO2 reductions. This measure alone has contributed
around 40% to the Munich site’s target for reducing CO2 emissions.
Use of energy-efficient lighting
In 2016, all subgroups at MAN SE prioritized the conversion to
energy-efficient lighting. Having successfully completed the installations and testing in prior years, projects to install indoor and outdoor LED lighting were rolled out at more than 20 sites at MAN
Truck & Bus, MAN Diesel & Turbo, MAN Latin America, and Renk.
As well as maximizing energy efficiency potential, this also led to
improved workplace lighting. Modern lighting control systems help
to ensure the targeted and efficient use of lighting.

Emissions from transportation and logistics
In the year under review, in the logistics sector MAN Truck & Bus caused
the release of 77,070 tonnes of CO2 for incoming supplies and 84,768
tonnes of CO2 in delivering its products. This equates to an increase of
around 2.8% compared to 2015 due to an extended production range.
CO2 emissions per vehicle produced continued to decrease, thanks to a
range of optimization measures in logistics. In 2016, these emissions
totaled approximately 1.9 tonnes of CO2 per vehicle.

Employee mobility
In the year under review, business travel by our employees caused around
15,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions. This figure relates to business travel
booked through the central travel service in Germany, around 87% of
which was for flights. Since 2013, the central Environment & Safety function at MAN Truck & Bus has been offsetting the carbon emissions from
employees’ international meetings and business trips, making them carbon-neutral. In 2016, this entailed purchasing offset certificates equivalent to 74 tonnes of CO2 emissions.
In Germany, depending on the available infrastructure, we provide
subsidized tickets for employees' journeys to and from work. At selected
sites outside Germany we provide our employees with bus transfers, for
example. MAN also helps to reduce commuter traffic and related CO2
emissions by offering the option of working from home.

Environmental Management
All MAN production sites are certified to a quality standard (the majority to ISO 9001). We have set ourselves the target of certifying these sites
to the ISO 14001 environmental management standard as well. Twentyfive of our production sites now have a certified environmental management system to ISO 14001 in place, and certification is pending at
our Aurangabad, Olifantsfontein, Quéretaro, and Rheine sites.
Five MAN Truck & Bus sites are additionally validated to the
European Environmental Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) and
regularly publish site-specific environmental statements.
Consumption of resources and raw materials
The principal raw materials, auxiliaries, and consumables used by MAN in
its production are steel, copper, aluminum, and various plastics. Managing these resources economically is pivotal to our success. In 2016, expenditure on raw materials, auxiliaries, and consumables was down 2% compared to the previous year.

We prioritize the reuse of metals in our foundries in order to save
raw materials. For instance, at our Augsburg plant we remelt the chips produced when castings are machined. At our Augsburg and Nuremberg
plants, we purchase and reutilize scrap from external recycling processes.
In the year under review, these plants also began recycling chips and scrap
from our own production for reuse in the manufacturing process.

Over the same period, total waste volumes amounted to approximately
105,000 tonnes, 92% of which was recycled.
The disposal and recycling of hazardous waste is subject to local
waste management legislation. Disposal providers have confirmed proper
disposal. No waste was exported.
Many sites continued to record non-production waste (construction waste), which in the year under review totaled 96,677 tonnes for the
MAN Group as a whole (2015: 78,139 tonnes). The rise in construction waste
is attributable to an increase in construction work in 2016.
Water and wastewater
In the reporting period, we met the bulk of our water requirements from
well water and surface water abstraction from lakes, rivers, and the sea. For
trials on the test rigs in Augsburg and Saint-Nazaire (France) by MAN Diesel & Turbo, we abstracted large volumes of water from watercourses. This
was used solely for cooling purposes and to operate water brakes during
engine testing. After use, this water is returned to its source.
At our Munich site, work to expand the central well water supply
was still ongoing. Groundwater is pumped up through a central well and
used for cooling purposes, then returned to its source via decentralized
absorbing wells. This procedure reduces the amount of energy needed to
cool plant and processes.
In 2016, MAN Latin America introduced a water treatment process
in a truck testing line to reduce water consumption.

Investment in environmental protection
In the year under review, the sites invested around €11 million in environmental protection measures (2015: €5.8 million). In other words, our investments almost doubled year-on-year. Measures for MAN’s Climate Strategy
(,Measures implemented in 2016 under MAN’s Climate Strategy, page 57
et seq) were the principal focus of investments, the largest single project
being the Munich combined heat and power plant.
Environmental violations and accidents
No significant accidents with significant environmental impacts occurred
in the reporting period. Total fines were less than €3,500.

Purchasing
MAN buys in around €7 billion worth of raw materials, goods, and services annually. Metals and plastics account for the bulk of raw materials.
In 2016, we began integrating due diligence requirements into our “Sustainability in Supplier Relations” concept to promote responsible supply
chains for minerals sourced from conflict and high-risk zones. On request,
full disclosure about the origin of minerals purchased from our suppliers
and their suppliers must be provided. Faced with a growing, increasingly
global, and more complex supply chain, the MAN Group believes it has a
responsibility to promote sustainability throughout the entire value creation process, with the aim of establishing robust and efficient flows of
goods and supplies.

Local suppliers
By purchasing raw materials, goods, and services close to our production
operations, we support local economic and social development. For example, more than 98% of suppliers to MAN Truck & Bus have their registered
offices in Europe and Turkey; around 60% of them in Germany.
Growth potential leveraged by demand for goods and services by
MAN has a positive impact on infrastructure, thanks to downstream
effects: jobs are created and local incomes rise. Regional suppliers are also
preferable from an environmental perspective, since shorter logistics
chains mean lower transportation-related emissions.

Only reported lost-time injuries affecting permanent staff in production or production-related sites.
2 In accordance with the German Social Code (SGB), lost-time injuries are defined as injuries incurred by the insured while carrying out their
insured employment. We count lost-time injuries starting at one day of missed work.
3 The accident frequency index is an indicator of the frequency of lost-time injuries relative to the sum of all hours worked. The formula for
calculating the index is the number of workplace accidents multiplied by 1 million divided by hours worked.
4 The accident severity index indicates the severity of accidents by showing the sum of workdays missed due to injury in relation to the number of hours worked. The formula for calculating the index is the number of workdays missed multiplied by 1 million divided by hours
worked multiplied by 10.

To MAN SE, Munich
We have been engaged to perform a limited assurance engagement on the
sustainability information marked with
in the CR-Report 2016 of
MAN SE, Munich, (hereafter the “Company”) for the period January 1 to
December 31, 2016 (hereafter the “CR-Report”).¹
Management’s Responsibility
The Company’s Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the CR-Report in accordance with the criteria as set out in the
G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative
(GRI) (hereafter the “GRI-Criteria”) and for the selection of the information
to be assessed.
This responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the CR-Report as well as the use of assumptions
and estimates for individual sustainability disclosures which are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, the responsibility includes
designing, implementing and maintaining systems and processes relevant for the preparation of the CR-Report, which is free of material misstatements due to intentional or unintentional errors.
Audit Firm’s Independence and Quality Control
We have complied with the German professional provisions regarding
independence as well as other ethical requirements.
The audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional standards – in particular the Professional Code for German Public
Auditors and German Chartered Auditors (“Berufssatzung für Wirtschafts-

prüfer und vereidigte Buchprüfer“: “BS WP/vBP”) as well as the Institut der
Wirtschaftsprüfer (“Institute of Public Auditors in Germany; IDW”):
Requirements to quality control for audit firms (“Entwurf eines IdW Qualitätssicherungsstandards 1 „Anforderungen an die Qualitätssicherung in
der Wirtschaftsprüferpraxis” (IdW EQS 1)”) – and accordingly maintains a
comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies
and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Practitioner’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the sustainability information marked with
in the CR-Report based on our work performed.
Within the scope of our engagement we did not perform an audit
on external sources of information or expert opinions, referred to in the
CR-Report.
We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): “Assurance
Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information” published by IAASB. This Standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance whether any
matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the sustainability information marked with
in the CR-Report has not been
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the GRI-Criteria.
In a limited assurance engagement the evidence-gathering procedures are more limited than for a reasonable assurance engagement and
therefore significantly less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable
assurance engagement. The procedures selected depend on the practitio-

ner's judgement. This includes the assessment of the risks of material misstatements of the sustainability information marked with
in the
CR-Report with regard to the GRI-Criteria.
Within the scope of our work we performed amongst others the
following procedures:

 nalytical procedures on selected sustainability information of the
A
CR-Report

Inquiries of personnel involved in the preparation of the CR-Report
regarding the preparation process, the underlying internal control system and selected sustainability information

Conclusion
Based on our limited assurance engagement, nothing has come to our
attention that causes us to believe that the sustainability information
marked with
in the CR-Report of the Company for the period January 1
to December 31, 2016, has not been prepared, in all material respects, in
accordance with the GRI-Criteria.

 ssessment of the presentation of selected sustainability information

Emphasis of Matter – Recommendations
Without qualifying our conclusion above, we make the following recommendations for the further development of the Company's sustainability
management and sustainability reporting:

B
inclusion of challenges in the Disclosures on Management Approach;
 tronger focus on indicators relevant for a comprehensive manageS

About this report

Credits & additional
information

[G4-24] Since 2011, each year we have provided our stakeholders with information about our progress in implementing our corporate responsibility
(CR) strategy. This 2016 GRI report is aimed at analysts, investors, customers, and business partners. It presents relevant management approaches,
measures, indicators, and data related to sustainable business practices at
the MAN Group. Furthermore, it outlines the ways in which we live up to
our commitment to the ten CR principles defined by the UN Global Compact. An interactive abridged version of the report is available online.
Report structure
MAN has systematically aligned its GRI Report with its CR Strategy 2020+.
The sections correspond to the four CR cornerstones of Integration, Products, People, and Production, while their subsections are named in accordance with the fields of action. (, page 6). Each of the four sections begins
with an overview of the management approach. In the four subsections
that follow this overview, we describe the measures taken and progress
made in 2016 in each of the fields of action.
Report standard
The report meets the standards of the G4, the latest version of the Global
Reporting Initiative (GRI). It was prepared in accordance with the GRI G4
Core option. MAN’s CR reporting was preceded by a process of materiality
analysis which also took stakeholder views into account – as described on
pages 10 to 12. The GRI content index outlines our compliance with the relevant GRI indicators (, see page 66 et seq.), and represents our UN Global
Compact Communication on Progress.

Report audit
We voluntarily submitted our 2016 GRI Report to a comprehensive independent audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), which was conducted in
accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements
(ISAE) 3000 (revised) (, page 70 et seq.). The focus of the audit was on
employee and environmental indicators in production operations. The
verified content is marked in the report with a
symbol.
Scope
[G4-17] The 2016 reporting period is identical with the 2016 fiscal year, which
runs from January 1 to December 31. The closing date for contributions was
May 31, 2017. The next report is due to appear in the first half of 2018.
Unless otherwise specified, the facts and figures published in this
report relate to the entire MAN Group (MAN SE including subsidiaries, but
excluding joint ventures, associated companies, and financial investments).
In the interests of readability, we have not used the full legal names
of MAN SE and its subgroups.
