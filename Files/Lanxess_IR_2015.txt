Letter from the CEO

Letter from the CEO

2015 was a very busy year indeed – a very challenging year for us all and one that we can look back on
with pride. In the past fiscal year, for example, not only did we exceed all of the financial targets we com­
mitted to at the start of the year, we also made rapid and significant progress in realigning the company.
At the start of the year, we reorganized our business units and group functions, restructured our manage­
ment team and initiated sustainable cost reductions, some of which had been realized sooner than expected
by the end of fiscal 2015. We also found the ideal partner for our rubber business in Saudi Aramco. Im­
proved access to strategically important raw materials combined with the strengths of our Tire & Specialty
Rubbers and High Performance Elastomers business units will ensure their long-term competitiveness
in a market that has changed fundamentally in recent years.
We intend to use the financial proceeds from the partnership with Saudi Aramco to continue developing
LANXESS in line with a clear strategy. We aim to achieve a better balance in our portfolio and to engage
primarily in mid-sized markets. And we intend to invest only where sustainable growth is possible. Our
objective is clear: In 2020, LANXESS should be a more stable, less cyclical and more profitable specialty
chemicals company.
Quality and sustainability are the stable foundation on which we are building this transformation. However,
we do not restrict our concept of quality to our products and services; quality shapes our culture and
our entire corporate philosophy. This philosophy also includes meeting our global responsibility toward
people and the environment. In 2015, we underscored our sense of responsibility by reaffirming our
commitment to the principles of the U.N. Global Compact.
On behalf of my colleagues on the Board of Management, I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely
thank our employees for their extraordinary dedication and willingness to embrace change. They have
done first-class work. I would also like to thank our customers, business partners and particularly you,
our stockholders, for your confidence in our change process. Together we have achieved something very
important in just a very short time: We are LANXESS again. And I am confident that if we can sustain this
momentum and this will to succeed, we will achieve so much more in the years ahead.

A NEW
QUALITY OF
COOPERATION
The inventor of synthetic rubber. More than 100 years’ experience. The world market
leader with the broadest product portfolio in the industry. Globally recognized for first-class
product and service quality. The characteristics of our rubber business are not ones that
would normally be associated with an economic problem child. But what is the value of
tradition if the future makes different demands? And what is the value of market leadership
if it fails to deliver adequate returns?

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

A new quality of cooperation

 Matthias Zachert and Abdulrahman F. Al-Wuhaib, Senior

Vice President Downstream of Saudi Aramco, signed the
new joint venture agreement in September 2015.

Nothing is as it once was
There has been a sea change in the global rubber
market, resulting in permanent change to the com­
petitive environment. In recent years, significant
production capacities – for high-quality products
as well – have been created in countries such as
China that used to be traditional export markets.
And the lower raw material and energy prices in
many parts of the world have further exacerbated
the wage-related cost disadvantages of European
producers.
Greek philosopher Aristotle may not necessarily
be regarded as the father of modern manage­
ment ­science, but he did coin a phrase that re­
mains ­e qually relevant thousands of years on:
“We ­cannot direct the wind, but we can adjust the
sails.” We followed this advice on September 22,
2015, and signed an agreement with the Saudi
Arabian Oil Company – Saudi Aramco for short –
to e
­ stablish a joint venture for synthetic rubber. Its
name: ­A RLANXEO. This will incorporate our Tire &
­Specialty Rubbers and High Performance Elas­
tomers business units, including supporting staff
functions. 

» A strong team: The number one in
synthetic rubber has joined forces

 Our partner Saudi Aramco

has the world’s largest crude
oil reserves.

Integration as a factor in success
The number one in synthetic rubber has joined
­forces with the number one among integrated ­energy
companies. This alliance heralds a new q
­ uality of
cooperation for our rubber business because we
were previously the only one of the world’s top ten
producers without any forward or backward inte­
gration. That brings us back to the issue of value.
What is the value of this cooperation for which, on
the face of it, we are relinquishing the independence
of our largest business unit?
Even in more profitable times, our rubber business
had a strategic weakness – our restricted access
to vital raw materials. Once our current supply con­
tracts have expired, the joint venture will give us
cost-effective access to the world’s largest crude oil
reserves. The real attraction of this arrangement is
that, although Saudi Aramco will be our preferred

partner and the lead buyer on the new joint venture’s
management team, we are not obliged to purchase
our raw materials there.
Wherever we obtain our raw materials, the laws
of business management will ultimately apply. In a
­material-intensive business such as rubber produc­
tion, more favorable purchasing terms mean signifi­
cantly lower manufacturing costs – and thus more
competitive sales prices. In conjunction with our high
quality standards, we will therefore be able to offer
our customers an even more attractive ­package in
the future.
Although the Tire & Specialty Rubbers and High
Performance Elastomers business units have not
been able to post satisfactory results in the recent
past, it should not be forgotten that the structural
problems lie in the market, not in the product itself.
Synthetic rubber is anything but past its prime. 

PERSPECTIVES

The LANXESS Board of Management talks about
the company’s realignment, plans for growth
and the opportunities afforded by the capital market.

Matthias Zachert

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

15

In the past one-and-a-half years,
LANXESS has undergone a dramatic
change process. What do you think
was special about it?
Matthias Zachert: In a first for our company, this
change process didn’t just involve a small team but
spanned all business units and functions. They have
worked together to evaluate an enormous amount of
information. This process yielded the organizational
and strategic changes we have made as well as
various initiatives that have produced very tangible
and impressive results.

Can you give us an example?
Matthias Zachert: Central outcomes have been
the streamlining of the business unit structure and
the strategic realignment of the company. The
latter was instrumental in the decision to seek a
partner for the rubber business.
Dr. Hubert Fink: We have also worked hard on
projects aimed at improving our competitiveness.
Take our manufacturing excellence initiative, for
example. Through mid-2018, interdisciplinary teams
of experts will be analyzing the processes, working
practices and organizational structures of around
40 production facilities with the goal of reducing
operating costs and material inputs. In the medium
term, we consider annual savings of €150 million
to be realistic.
Dr. Rainier van Roessel: Another concrete
example is our initiative to achieve commercial
and supply chain excellence, which will help us to
improve our alignment with our markets. This initia­
tive most particularly has intensified the ­exchange
between colleagues in the sales companies,
­business units and group functions. The strategy
development process has therefore set something
in motion which will continue to benefit our business
operations in the future.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

Dr. Hubert Fink

Until now, LANXESS has always
been associated with rubber.
What will the company’s name
stand for in the future?
Matthias Zachert: The realignment doesn’t
mean that we’re withdrawing from the rubber busi­
ness altogether. However, we can only have a future
in this market if our organization is as strong as that
of our competitors. And most of them are backward
integrated meaning that they themselves produce
the raw materials needed to manufacture rubber.
That is why we have entered into a partnership with
Saudi Aramco and will in the future be operating on
the basis of our combined strengths. Going forward,
LANXESS will ideally no longer be associated with
just one product in particular but its name will stand
for first-class specialty chemicals.

» In a first, the strategy
process has spanned
all business units and
functions. «

16

Change creates new perspectives

» There are plenty of examples
showing that sustainable operations
contribute to higher profitability. «

Talking of first-class – painful price
losses and exit from the DAX mean
that LANXESS stockholders haven’t
exactly been spoiled in recent years.
When will they again be able to enjoy
their investment?
Michael Pontzen: Unfortunately, there’s no
­simple answer or patent recipe here. Basically it’s up
to us to provide investors with strong a­ rguments for
putting a higher value on LANXESS stock. In this
respect, we certainly achieved quite a lot in 2015.
And it’s not as if the capital market has ­entirely
­ignored our realignment until now. ­Standard &
Poor’s has raised its outlook for LANXESS, while
Moody’s has also positively commented on the
measures we’ve taken. If these now take effect as
planned, it should be reflected in our share price
sooner or later. However, there’s always the m
­ arket
as a whole to consider, which is something we unfortunately can’t influence and which is currently
dragging the entire industry down.

What you can influence, though,
is your indebtedness, which the
capital market has been watching
closely in the recent past. When
will this get back down to a healthy
level?
Michael Pontzen: It already has. We’re pleased
to have been able to substantially reduce our indebtedness over the past two years. The transaction
with Saudi Aramco and the resulting cash inflow
will tangibly improve our capitalization in 2016 and
place us in a relatively comfortable financial position.
As a company, we have thus regained our financial
strength and can start to invest again.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

17

You’re talking again about making
acquisitions as well as capital
expenditures. Is that not contrary to
a secure investment-grade rating?
Dr. Rainier van Roessel

Michael Pontzen: It’s important to us that we
maintain a solid investment-grade rating. Yes, we’re
looking at growth opportunities, but always with this
objective in mind. We attach high priority to ensuring
that our capital expenditures afford good potential for
growing earnings. At the same time, we also want to
improve the risk profile of our portfolio. The bottom
line is that we are aiming to increase profitability while
reducing the volatility of our earnings.

Change creates new perspectives

» We are seeking to support each
individual in becoming creative and
proactive, in addressing and acting
on issues.«

You are also aiming to improve the
company’s profitability. How can you
reconcile this with the increasingly
stringent and costly global requirements in respect of quality manage­
ment, safety and environmental
protection?

This is to be achieved above all by
capital expenditures in the Advanced
Intermediates and Performance
Chemicals segments. Is LANXESS
not again running the risk of being
one-sided?
Matthias Zachert: Not at all. We are willing in
principle to develop all three business areas – in other
words, including High Performance Materials. The
precondition for any capital expenditure is that it will
contribute to creating value. Budgets are generally in
the range of €100 million to €150 million.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

Dr. Hubert Fink: Simply speaking, we’re going to
have to. Worldwide, requirements in the aforemen­
tioned areas are becoming increasingly demanding.
Sooner or later, this will result in global standards –
and high standards at that. Compliance with these
standards and the willingness to make all the neces­
sary investments will give companies their license to
continue operating. With our demonstrably strong
production culture, we therefore see great oppor­
tunities for our company – especially in key markets
outside Germany. There are also plenty of examples
showing that sustainable operations contribute to
higher profitability. If I use less energy, I not only
reduce my emissions, but also save money. If I can
ship my products more efficiently, I not only cut
pollution, but also save money. The same applies
analogously to water and waste.

19

LANXESS has seen sweeping
changes and will have to adapt to
new situations in the future as
well. How do you motivate your
workforce in such processes
and how can you make LANXESS
attractive to new employees?
Dr. Rainier van Roessel: We have been work­
ing hard to improve the way we interact within the
company. That means we are collaborating more
closely, being more open in the feedback we give and
facilitating greater participation in major decisions. It is
very important to me to motivate our e
­ mployees. We
are seeking to support each individual in becoming
creative and proactive, in addressing and acting on
issues. This helps our employees to identify with what
they do and is the best fuel for LANXESS’s commer­
cial success. Ultimately, it benefits our employees
as well.
Matthias Zachert: We have returned to being a
company that is working at shaping its future with a
great deal of energy, drive and enthusiasm. I believe
that makes us attractive to all target groups – to our
present workforce and potential new employees, but
also to business partners and investors.

QUALITY
Our concept of quality extends far beyond our

the philosophy practiced by our company and by
each individual employee. It is characterized by an
entrepreneurial mindset, quick decision-making
and unconventional solutions.

22

Strategy

Successful transition
In a market environment that is undergoing fundamental change, we must change as
well. Through the three-phase realignment program we are implementing systematically
and successfully, we created the basis for a new strategic course in 2015. The aim
is for LANXESS to be a much more stable and profitable specialty chemicals enterprise
in 2020.

An industry facing change
Despite its comparative maturity, the chemical industry is continuing to expand. Worldwide it is achieving
growth rates which are in part well above overall global economic expansion. However, for European
chemical companies in particular, it will become increasingly challenging in the medium term to benefit
from this generally positive environment. The reason for this is to be found in profound change ­processes
which have impacted market structures and mechanisms – some of which have been in place for d
­ ecades –
and which will continue to shape the industry’s operating environment over the coming years.

1. Overcapacities in the synthetic rubber market
The commissioning of major new plants for the production of synthetic rubbers in recent years has created
considerable overcapacities in this market, which has exacerbated the existing pressure on prices worldwide.

2. Competitive raw material prices
and ongoing cost optimization are crucial
In the price-sensitive synthetic rubbers business, raw materials and energy account for about 75% of
production costs. Producers in emerging economies and the Middle East mostly have better access to
low-cost raw materials and energy, as do those in the United States. As a result, they enjoy cost advantages
which European suppliers will struggle to achieve through efficiency gains.

3. European chemical industry under pressure
The ongoing expansion of local production capacities in the global growth regions, especially Asia,
means the progressive decline of export opportunities for European suppliers. By contrast, the United
States and the Middle East – aided by low energy prices and the ready availability of raw materials – are
transitioning from importers to exporters in the commodity segment, bringing low-cost products to the
world’s markets.

4. China remains the main growth market
China will further strengthen its role as the growth engine of the global chemical industry through 2030.
According to estimates from market research company IHS, the country is likely to account for around
40% of global chemicals demand in 2030. A significant proportion of this demand will likely be covered
by domestic suppliers. Suppliers wishing to participate in this growth will have to build not just individual
plants but entire value chains in the country.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

23

Successful transition An industry facing change

5. The focus of innovation is shifting from molecules
to applications and processes
In the past, innovative expertise was mainly manifested in the successful development of novel chemical
compounds with new or improved properties. In view of the enormous scientific advances being made and
the high cost of registering new substances, there are now fewer opportunities for bringing commercially
viable new chemical compounds to market. For the broad majority of chemical companies, innovation
in the future will mean accessing new fields of application for existing products and making production
processes as safe and efficient as possible.

6. Environmental standards will converge at a high level
in the medium to long term
With growing environmental awareness, sustainable production standards worldwide will converge at a
high level. In the medium term, this development will offer a further opportunity for consolidation, because,
in the growth markets in particular, not all competitors will make the necessary capital investments to
upgrade their plants to meet regulatory requirements. However, in the long term, producers that have
always applied high standards will lose this advantage over their competitors.
We, like others, face the challenge of reacting to these change processes. Our measures can be consoli­
dated in six strategic approaches.

Reduction of dependence on volatile
raw materials such as ethylene and
butadiene

Sustained growth in China, North
America and Southeast Asia

Process and cost optimization
as an ongoing entrepreneurial
challenge

Strengthen the competitiveness
of our networked sites

Successful transition Successful realignment creates strategic headroom

Phase I: Competitiveness of the business and administrative structure
Through our new and more efficient organizational structure (see also combined management report,
page 112) and extensive optimization measures in our business units and group functions, we are not only
fostering market and customer proximity but also sustainably improving our cost position. In the reporting
year, we already fully realized annual savings of around €150 million, which we originally expected to
achieve from 2016. These are set against cumulated exceptional charges of around €150 million for fiscal
2014 and 2015 together. In close and constructive dialogue with employee representatives, we eliminated
around 1,000 positions worldwide – about half of them in Germany – in this first phase of the program.

Phase II: Operational competitiveness
As a result of our initiative to optimize production operations, we intend to discontinue the manufacture
of EPDM rubber at the Marl site in Germany by the end of the first quarter of 2016. We are also reducing
capacities for NBR and ESBR rubber at our sites in La Wantzenau, France, and Duque de Caxias, Brazil.
In conjunction with many process improvement and efficiency enhancement measures, we aim to achieve
a further €150 million in annual cost savings by the end of 2019.
As part of our initiative to achieve commercial and supply chain excellence, we automated and harmonized
order processing in 2015. A further project was dedicated to developing a new customer care approach,
aimed at tailoring our services even better to the needs and expectations of our different customer groups.

From 2019,
sustainable savings of

€300
million

will be generated by Phase I
and II measures.

Phase III: Competitiveness of the business portfolio
In September 2015, we agreed a partnership for the synthetic rubber business with Saudi Aramco – the
world’s largest integrated energy producer – in which each party will hold a 50% interest. We are contrib­
uting our Tire & Specialty Rubbers and High Performance Elastomers business units to the alliance, with
a total of 20 production facilities in nine countries and around 3,800 employees as well as management
support functions. Our partner will facilitate competitive access to strategic raw materials for this business
area in the medium term (see also “In focus,” page 8).
Saudi Aramco is expected to pay around €1.2 billion for its 50% interest after deduction of debt and other
financial liabilities. This cash inflow will not only allow us to pay down more of our debt, but will also give
us the crucial headroom for the strategic optimization of the Group in the years ahead.

Strategy

A clear vision for progress
Through its new strategic alignment, LANXESS aims in 2020 to be a less cyclical specialty chemicals
group with a strong cash flow and a balanced portfolio. To achieve this, we will be building especially
on our strengths in mid-sized markets. Here we can offer our customers an attractive combination – the
professionalism of a global chemicals company coupled with the customer proximity and agility of a
specialized niche provider. These advantages, along with mostly above-average growth rates in these
markets, create good prospects for LANXESS.
In the further optimization of LANXESS, we will be focusing on the following areas of activity in particular.

1. Achieving a more balanced portfolio

We have defined
China, North America and
Southeast Asia as the growth
markets for LANXESS.

It is our declared aim to reduce financial dependence on individual industries or closely correlated markets
in the future. In regional terms, too, we aim to achieve an even better balance in our portfolio by increasing
the share of our business accounted for by the growth markets of China, North America and Southeast Asia.
With the aim of achieving this better balance, we can work in many respects from a position of strength to
develop the Advanced Intermediates and Performance Chemicals segments and the High Performance
Materials business unit of our Performance Polymers segment.
The two business units of our Advanced Intermediates segment hold leadership positions with their highly
diversified product portfolios and count a number of global players among their customers. By expanding
our highly efficient networked sites in Germany, we are creating the necessary capacities for leveraging
growth opportunities in Asia and the United States.
Our application-driven businesses, which we have brought together in the Performance Chemicals
segment, are world leaders in their niche markets. Potential lies above all in further integration of global
value chains and the elimination of existing capacity bottlenecks. Moreover, in part highly fragmented
competitive structures are expected to provide us with the opportunity in the medium term to actively
participate in market consolidation.
High Performance Materials, with its expertise in innovative hybrid and composite technologies, a backward
integrated value chain and a globe-spanning network of modern production facilities, is in a promising
position to serve the growing demand for high-tech plastics for automotive and many other applications.
In this business, we aim to improve the balance of the value chain especially by increasing the captive use
of intermediates for our innovative polyamide compounds, an area in which we seek further expansion.

in our organic growth.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

In order to further improve the alignment of our businesses and leverage future growth potential, we aim
to invest around €400 million of the proceeds from the rubber transaction in our organic growth. We have
already decided to expand Saltigo’s production capacities at our networked site in Leverkusen, where we
will invest around €60 million in constructing two new agrochemicals production lines. Construction is
scheduled to begin in mid-2016 and production should start by the end of 2017.
We are additionally seeking external growth opportunities. In this way, we aim to take advantage of
­consolidation opportunities in areas of business in which LANXESS already operates. On the other
hand, we are also investigating options to extend our portfolio into related areas of business that are the
right fit. Here, we will consider both integrated chemical value chains and suitable application-driven
businesses.

Successful transition A clear vision for progress
 Quality and sustainability – key success factors

29

A clear objective in our sights

Quality and sustainability –
key success factors
Quality and sustainability are the strong foundation on which we aim to build LANXESS. However, we do
not restrict our concept of quality to our products and the associated services; quality is an element of the
philosophy already practiced by our company and each individual employee. We foster and promote a
value-based performance culture. Every employee – regardless of function or position in the hierarchy –
is expected to display an entrepreneurial mindset, to quickly take solution-oriented decisions and to be
open to new and unconventional approaches. Our diverse team is the key to successfully implementing
our strategy. In this context, our global human resources work (see the “Corporate Responsibility” section,
page 42) is an important pillar of our corporate strategy.
We also consider quality to mean conducting our business sustainably in the broadest sense. We strive
to combine safety, environmental protection, social responsibility and commercial efficiency in our busi­
ness operations. Sustainability is an important criterion in all our strategic considerations and decisions.
This is summed up not least by the sentence: “Good for business, good for society” (see the “Corporate
Responsibility” section, page 32). We aim to sustainably increase the company’s enterprise value and to
make a value contribution that serves the interests of our stockholders, customers, employees and society.
From an external perspective, quality and sustainability are to a certain extent the catalysts for creating
value: for our customers, who see in LANXESS a reliable partner that not only reliably delivers top-quality
products but also actively supports their innovation processes; for our investors, whose capital we use
responsibly and who benefit from an appropriate share in the company’s success by way of a consistent
dividend policy – even in challenging times; and for society, which we serve in many ways as a construc­
tive and fair partner.

A clear objective in our sights
The operational progress and important strategic decisions made in 2015 have laid the foundation for
LANXESS’s future viability and development – together with our strong partner Saudi Aramco in the
rubber business, and independently as a leading supplier in promising mid-sized specialty chemicals
markets. In 2020, the name LANXESS should stand for stability, earning power and moderate growth –
in short, for successful transition.

Corporate Responsibility
As an international specialty chemicals group, we bear a major responsibility
toward people and the environment. Our entrepreneurial activities reflect this
sense of responsibility, which is also a key component of our strategy. Safety,
environmental protection, social responsibility, quality and commercial efficiency
are all key corporate goals at LANXESS.

CR management
We regard acting and thinking sustainably as the responsibility of each and every employee at LANXESS.
However, sustainability in itself is no more than an abstract concept. Appropriate organizational structures,
strategies, operational guidelines and goals are needed to enable our employees to act sustainably in their
day-to-day work and to translate the abstract concept into a specific factor of entrepreneurial success.

	Representatives from selected group functions develop our CR strategy and ensure that all LANXESS’s
CR activities are in line with this strategy. As an interdisciplinary competence center, the committee
­advises both the Board of Management and the business units on all matters relating to sustainability. It
is also responsible for collecting and maintaining reliable data that comply with current market standards
for use in our external CR communications. The Board of Management is regularly represented on the
CR Committee by Dr. van Roessel.

HSEQ Committee
	LANXESS’s senior executives, under the direction of Board of Management member Dr. Hubert Fink,
ensure worldwide compliance with uniformly high quality management, safety, environmental, energy
and climate protection standards. The committee has responsibility for initiating and monitoring the
global implementation of all necessary HSEQ guidelines, strategies and programs, as well as for
­defining our HSEQ objectives and monitoring their achievement. It also defines the global strategy for
our integrated quality and environmental management system and our energy management system.

Compliance organization
	The compliance organization, which is made up of the Group Compliance Officer and a network of
local compliance officers, handles all referrals concerning compliance violations, with the goal of
countering illegal or unethical conduct by LANXESS employees at an early stage and introducing
suitable measures to prevent improprieties.

nn

At the end of 2015, we additionally established an interdisciplinary project team headed by Dr. Fink, which
has the task of aligning our strategic corporate objectives more closely with the requirements of sustain­
ability management and corporate responsibility at LANXESS. The interactions between ­political, social
and corporate strategy developments are of central importance here. Ultimately, a committee comprising
top management representatives (Board of Management, business units and group functions) will take
the decisions concerning our future course in respect of significant sustainability issues such as climate
strategy, ecological efficiency in our operations, product stewardship, and human resources and supply
chain management.

Integrated management system creates transparency
At LANXESS, a central management system provides the necessary global structures to ensure responsible
commercial practices. Through this tool, we have created a transparent system and set of rules that unite
management and employees across national borders. Worldwide, we are guided by internal directives
and operating procedures, as well as by the ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 international standards for quality
and environmental management and ISO 50001 for energy management.
External, independent experts regularly audit the progress in integrating new sites into our management
system and the system’s performance worldwide. Confirmation of our compliance with ISO 9001 and
ISO 14001 takes the form of a global matrix certificate. We successfully completed the recertification
audit in 2015. Our energy management system was certified separately in Germany.
As of December 31, 2015, our matrix certificate covered 48 companies with 80 sites in 23 countries.
The sites in Epierre, France; Lipetsk, Russia; and Little Rock, United States, were included for the first
time, as planned. Our sites in the United States have also received confirmation of certification to RC 14001
(RC = Responsible Care®). In 2016, we intend to integrate the production sites in Neville Island, United
States; Rustenburg, South Africa; and Joo Koon, Singapore, into the matrix certificate.
HSEQ (health, safety, environmental protection and quality) management is an important part of our inte­
grated management system. We have aligned our HSEQ management system toward ensuring uniform
standards and reference bases for all our sites. The key performance indicators (KPIs) required for this
purpose are recorded, thus enabling us to systematically determine and analyze performance in each
business unit and at each site and to develop this sustainably in the future.

Corporate Responsibility

Guidelines for business conduct
All management systems are based on guidelines that provide a clear framework for a company’s manage­
ment and employees. Our system is based on established global standards and on our company’s own
basic rules, which are subject to ongoing amendment.

LANXESS is committed to
the principles of the
U.N Global Compact.

LANXESS respects applicable law and requires its employees and business partners to do likewise. All
our decisions and activities must meet this requirement of the compliance code, irrespective of the aims
we are pursuing or the conditions we face. In the first instance, we define applicable law as any inter­
national or national legislation in the jurisdictions in which LANXESS operates. Moreover, human rights
and ethical principles apply without restriction, even if they are not stipulated in the applicable law. As a
global enterprise, we are committed in all our markets to promoting respect for human rights at all times
and to preventing child and forced labor. In this context, we have also signed the U.N. Global Compact
and recognize the principles it sets forth as inalienable rights. We renewed our commitment in this regard
for the 2015 reporting year.

www.unglobalcompact.org

We understand compliance to be the observance of all legal provisions that are binding on the LANXESS
Group and its employees and of internal LANXESS rules. In addition, we are committed to ­internationally
recognized basic principles of business activity. As well as the principles of the Responsible Care®
Global Charter, these include ILO labor standards and the basic principles of the Global Compact. Our
­employees’ integrity and awareness of their responsibilities are key factors in the success of our company.

CR management

The “Code of conduct – Code for integrity and compliance at LANXESS,” which is applicable throughout
the Group, specifies minimum standards and gives our employees advice and guidance on complying
with these standards.
Our code covers issues such as anti-competitive behavior, anti-corruption, data protection, o
­ ccupational,
product and plant safety, and environmental protection. Other directives set forth detailed rules for s­ pecific
areas covered by the code and concrete requirements for the conduct of LANXESS employees. All
globally applicable LANXESS directives and guidelines are contained in a system that is accessible to
every employee. Our code of conduct can be found on our website at www.lanxess.com under Corporate
Responsibility/Corporate Governance/Compliance at LANXESS.

Compliance management system
We have established a compliance management system (CMS) to implement our clear commitment to
compliance in our daily business activities. This system guides our employees and eliminates p
­ otential uncer­
tainties relating to our compliance principles. It also encompasses advice and training in ­compliance-related
issues.
Our global compliance management system is defined in our CMS directive and is externally audited
at regular intervals in respect of its design, suitability and effectiveness. These audits are not restricted
to defined risks but focus on the ten main compliance risks that we have identified. The last audit by
­Deloitte & Touche GmbH in 2012 was completed without observation and with an unqualified audit opinion.

Compliance risks
	The risks are regularly analyzed, discussed with the Board of Management and evaluated according
to the likelihood of occurrence and damage potential. Risk exposure is analyzed both for business
areas and countries, and corresponding countermeasures are defined. The main areas of potential
compliance risk are antitrust and competition law, anti-corruption, foreign trade law, environmental
and safety regulations, data protection, product liability, insider trading, discrimination, accounting law
and fraud against the company.

nn

Compliance program
	
Our compliance program includes all of the “classic” CMS elements, such as a compliance code,
specific guidelines and work instructions, established guidance systems, information and training.
We aim to ensure compliance in the broader sense by clearly assigning responsibilities within our
structural and process organizations, and by implementing a functioning internal control system and
suitable auditing and monitoring activities.

nn

Compliance organization
	
L ANXESS has established a compliance organization, headed by the Group Compliance Officer,
to assist its employees in observing the code of conduct and to provide support for the compliance
management system. In those countries where LANXESS operates through subsidiaries, the Group
Compliance Officer is assisted by local compliance officers. The responsibility for ensuring legally
compliant behavior, however, always rests with the respective decision-maker. We therefore view
compliance primarily as a key leadership task.

nn

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

37

CR management

Compliance communication
	
Information events and training courses enable our employees to fulfill their tasks correctly and in
compliance with the law. The compliance section on the LANXESS intranet also offers e-learning
programs. Compliance issues and problems are reported from the bottom up to the local compliance
officers and by them on to the Group Compliance Officer. All significant developments, findings and
measures are reported to the Board of Management and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory
Board on a regular basis. There is an obligation to report ad hoc to the Board of Management and the
Supervisory Board in the event of wide-reaching compliance violations. However, there has been no
need to do so as yet.

nn

Compliance monitoring
	
Compliance monitoring is performed by means of general audits and special audit programs conducted
by Internal Auditing and a central HSE department. Since Internal Auditing is itself part of the CMS, we
have this organizational unit regularly audited by independent third parties. The status of compliance
at LANXESS is also subject to regular review by the auditor of the annual financial statements.

nn

Responsible Care®
Transparency and improved public dialogue are among the stated objectives of the Responsible Care®
Global Charter launched by the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA). The aim is to
build confidence and trust in an industry that has a crucial role in improving people’s living standards
and quality of life. We became one of the signatories to the ICCA charter in 2006. By signing the revised
Responsible Care® Global Charter in 2014, we reaffirmed our commitment to the visions and ethical
principles of the initiative. For us, applying the Responsible Care® Global Charter to our business means
consistently working to improve our processes and performance in terms of environmental and climate
protection, health, safety and quality. Our corporate directives ensure that the principles of the charter
are integrated into our management principles and corporate strategy.
We expect our suppliers to commit to our values and rules, especially the Global Compact, to establish
adequate systems for ensuring legally compliant behavior and to carry ethical behavior throughout their
organizations. The LANXESS Supplier Code of Conduct is part of our communication with suppliers.
Reviewing compliance with these requirements is a key aspect of our collaboration in the Together ­for
Sustainability initiative we operate jointly with 17 other international chemical companies (see page 119).
Additionally, in the course of acquisitions, we make it a principle of our due diligence processes to ensure
that human rights are also respected by the target company.

The stakeholders of relevance to LANXESS are the groups, institutions and people with whom we are
linked directly or indirectly through our business units and who therefore have a justified interest in our
activities. Our most important stakeholder groups are customers, employees, suppliers, capital market
participants, the media, neighbors of our sites and representatives of politics, public authorities and
non-governmental organizations (NGOs). We conduct an intensive dialogue with all these groups with
the aim of identifying topics that they consider to be significant in terms of corporate responsibility. At the
same time, we seek to encourage mutual understanding and build trust through an open and constructive
exchange of views.

External stakeholder survey enables accurate materiality analysis   
In order to optimize our sustainability strategy and utilize resources in the most effective way possible, it
is essential to systematically prioritize the various areas of activity. In this regard, we consider the mate­
riality analysis as defined by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) to be an important tool. This analysis is
based on four principles: sustainability context, materiality, completeness and stakeholder inclusiveness.
In 2015, we commissioned a comprehensive personal survey of our main external stakeholders which
was based in both content and method on our 2014 internal survey.

The survey participants were unanimous that sustainability is of great strategic importance for a global
chemical company. A broad majority regard LANXESS as a company that acts sustainably and rated us
highly for fulfilling our corporate responsibility. Of the 31 issues evaluated in six areas, our external stake­
holders consider anti-corruption, safety at work and compliance to be the most relevant. They saw room
for improving sustainability communications through face-to-face discussions – customers in particular
would welcome a more active information policy from LANXESS.

Thus, as well as the detailed information on our compliance management system contained in this
­section, a large amount of other information about anti-corruption and compliance is once again provided
in the GRI Content Index starting on page 247 of this report. Measures aimed at achieving continuous
improvements in occupational safety are brought together in the Board of Management’s “Xact” initiative,
which we discuss in detail on page 55. The Together for Sustainability initiative mentioned previously
seeks to provide a transparent portrayal of sustainability in our supply chain. The progress achieved in
the reporting year is described in the combined management report on page 119.

Customer satisfaction as a success factor
Customer satisfaction and customer loyalty are among the most important success factors to us. Our
central inquiry management system provides customers with information about our products, their
applications and potential risks and with product certificates. Critical feedback from customers gives us
valuable pointers for improving our products and processes. In early 2015, we established a decentral
customer complaint management system in the operating units. Anchored directly in the business units,
this process is aimed at addressing customer issues both quickly and competently so as to establish a
sustained bond between the customer and us.

Our 2015 customer
survey was completed by

421
respondents.

By conducting regular customer surveys using recognized opinion research methods, we obtain vital
information about the loyalty of our customers, their expectations and how they perceive our products
and services compared with those of our competitors. In the course of the “Let’s LANXESS again” pro­
gram, responsibility for customer surveys was transferred to the individual business units and thus also
decentralized. In 2015, five of our ten business units carried out surveys with a total of 421 participants.
Positive ratings were received for our technical expertise, customer focus and delivery reliability in par­
ticular. On the other hand, the customers surveyed still saw room for improvement in terms of pricing
and delivery flexibility. In 2016, the other five business units will follow with their own surveys.
Our daily commitment to high product quality and customer satisfaction is regularly recognized and
honored with awards and prizes. For example, in 2015 LANXESS was named Top Influential Brand at
the China International Rubber Industry Exposition, a key industry event. U.S. company Dayco, the world
leader in manufacturing toothed belts for engine drives and a major customer for our high-performance
elastomer Therban, once again rated us its best supplier in China.

Acting together – maintaining effective networks
We are very aware that no single organization alone – company, government, research institute or NGO –
will be able to master the major societal challenges of our time. Alongside our own CR activities, we
therefore participate in powerful global networks where we combine our competence in sustainable
development with the expertise of other partners. As well as state institutions, NGOs in particular – with
their extensive expert knowledge of specific issues – have a crucial role here.

CR management

Since 2013, for example, we have been supporting “Chemie³,” the joint sustainability initiative of the
German Chemical Industry Association (VCI), the German Mining, Chemical and Energy Industrial Union
(IG BCE) and the German Chemical Industry Employers’ Association (BAVC). The initiative focuses on the
Guidelines for Sustainability in the Chemical Industry in Germany, which encompass a total of 12 areas
of activity and were formulated with input from internal and external stakeholders. They are a mission
statement for the industry, supporting companies and their employees in expanding their contributions
to sustainability. The initiative has also set itself the goal of developing new economic, environmental and
social progress indicators in the area of sustainability by 2017.

We have been supporting
the Chemie3 initiative
in Germany since 2013.

In addition to trade shows, high-level congresses provide us with important forums for discussion with
potential and existing business partners, competitors, scientists and opinion leaders on current develop­
ments and future challenges in the area of sustainability. In November 2015, more than 150 international
participants accepted our invitation to attend the second LANXESS Pigments Symposium in Shanghai,
China. The two TfS Supplier Days that we organized in São Paulo, Brazil, and Shanghai, China, in the
reporting year attracted around 750 visitors in total.
We often contribute to studies concerning socially relevant issues, such as an environmentally friendly
approach to mobility. In the reporting year, a European Climate Foundation study we supported entitled
“Fuelling Britain’s Future” received a great deal of attention and was even presented in the British House
of Commons. The central finding of this study was that, like alternative vehicle powertrains, high-tech
plastics can make a significant contribution to climate protection. In addition, in a long-term test conducted
jointly with energy provider RheinEnergie and confirmed by TÜV Rheinland, we demonstrated that the
use of green tires can reduce fuel consumption in urban traffic by up to 7%.
We also conduct an open dialogue with government representatives and with authorities on local, Euro­
pean and international level. The focus is on an active exchange of ideas on strategic corporate issues
such as environmentally friendly product and process innovations, developments on raw material and
energy markets, and issues relating to the labor market and education policy. Our own offices in Berlin
and Brussels place us close to the center of political decision-making. LANXESS representatives are
also active in a number of industry associations.
Another important element of our stakeholder communication is structured dialogue with residents in
the immediate vicinity of our sites. For example, our affiliate Currenta operates Chempunkt neighborship
offices in Leverkusen, Dormagen and Krefeld-Uerdingen to serve as a point of contact for local residents
interested in discussing issues concerning the Chempark sites.

Awards for sustained commitment
Our commitment was again recognized with various awards in 2015. For the first time, the China Enterprise
Evaluation Association (CEEA) and the Social Science Faculty of Tsinghua University published a list of
500 companies in China which best fulfill their responsibility to society. In 130th place, LANXESS ranked
in the top third of the listing. At the Salute to the China Dream financial summit, LANXESS received the
Best CSR Award for the second time in succession in recognition of our leading position in the area of
corporate social responsibility and environmentally compatible corporate development.

Corporate Responsibility

Employees
Our long-term entrepreneurial success is fundamentally based on our employees’ sense of ­responsibility,
professionalism and focus on solutions. We as a company will only be able to continue successfully
exploiting the opportunities presented by evolving markets if we constantly invest in employee training
and development – in particular in their ability to act on the basis of values, to take a fresh approach and
swiftly implement ideas, and to work as part of a team in developing solutions.
In 2015, our HR strategy continued to support the successful realignment of the Group. In order to
shape and steer the cultural shift we are seeking, the Board of Management and senior executives
used an interactive approach to develop a new value model, which they discussed with employees in
numerous workshops held at almost all our sites around the world. Other focal points of HR strategy
were implementing and supporting global restructuring activities and designing the organization of our
new partnership with Saudi Aramco.
The ongoing realignment of the LANXESS Group was reflected in our global headcount in 2015. A total
of 825 new employees joined the company worldwide in fiscal 2015. 155 new employees were hired in
Germany, where our focus was on the recruitment of specialists from various disciplines.

Employees

Of approximately 1,000 positions worldwide earmarked for elimination through 2016 as part of the re­
alignment (see “Strategy” section, page 24), 933 were eliminated through the end of 2015, as planned,
as the result of early retirement and severance agreements. To cushion the impact in a socially respon­
sible way, we have taken measures such as appointing an advisory and placement agency in Germany.
Against the backdrop of our headcount adjustment program, we recorded increasing turnover during the
reporting period. In Germany, the turnover resulting from voluntary resignations was 1.1% in the reporting
period (2014: 0.69%). Globally, it was around 2.9% (2014: 3.29%).

Corporate Responsibility

Enthusing talent worldwide
As part of our sustainable, value-based corporate policy and against the backdrop of demographic change,
LANXESS is continuing to invest in well-qualified young talents – both apprentices and university grad­
uates – and in experienced specialists and managers.
In order to achieve our corporate goals, it is essential that we remain flexible and open to change in the
areas of recruiting and talent management as well. When faced with challenging markets and operating
conditions, we expect our employees to display a high degree of professionalism, flexibility and willingness
to change. In return, we offer a wide range of development opportunities, including foreign assignments,
collaboration in interdisciplinary projects and transfer between business units and central functions.

In fiscal 2015, we continued to seek direct contact worldwide with talented university and school stu­
dents through dialogue with universities and our presence at scientific conferences and by organizing
our own events.
We are especially committed to fostering young talents during their undergraduate or PhD study programs
and facilitating their successful career start. To enable the smartest minds to realize their full potential,
we specifically sponsor outstanding master’s and PhD students in scientific and engineering subjects
through the LANXESS support program. As well as providing financial support, we also greatly value an
exchange of information on specialist and career-related issues.

Interns who display above-average qualities may be offered further support through our “eXclusive” talent
program. The goal is to give preference to candidates who have completed this program when filling
positions within the company.

A successful recruiting tool which also benefits society is our partnership with Teach First in Germany
and Teach For India (TFI). We have been one of the main sponsors of these not-for-profit organizations
since 2010. Both organizations are national network partners of the global Teach For All initiative, which
aims to help school students who have had a difficult start in life, fostering their individual talents and
developing their career prospects. Particularly highly qualified university graduates from all disciplines,
who also have the requisite soft skills, act as fellows for a period of two years, helping schools in socially
disadvantaged areas with education and schooling tasks.

Acquiring and retaining specialists and managers

9

international trainee programs
offer university graduates
attractive entry opportunities
at LANXESS.

In recent years, our international trainee programs have proved very successful. Particularly highly
quali­fied university graduates are prepared for challenging specialist and management roles within the
company, already gaining international experience during the program. In 2015, nine international ­trainee
programs were launched in Germany with a total of 16 participants (12 women and 4 men). The focus
was on marketing, controlling, engineering, human resources and finance.
We also offer local trainee and university student programs in various regions. In the United States,
we collaborate with a number of universities to provide trainee and intern programs in the fields of finance
and engineering.
LANXESS in India has established three “XTrainee” programs structured individually for students, gradu­
ates and prospective managers. Participants in these programs are given a specific project to work on and
are supported by a mentor. In 2015, 29 students, graduates and prospective managers received training
and guidance in one of these programs. LANXESS in India runs a further one-year training program in
collaboration with the Industrial Training Institute (ITI) which allows 14 young people to continue their
training after completing an apprenticeship as a production specialist or technician.
On account of their location away from the main business centers, our South African sites have ­traditionally
faced a particular challenge in attracting suitably qualified university graduates. For that reason, we offer
attractive trainee programs in a number of engineering and business fields. In 2015, we employed a
total of 11 trainees.

Vocational training valuable in recruiting

500

young people were in
vocational training at LANXESS
on the reporting date.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

We have always given priority to training young people as a means of safeguarding the company’s future
and as an element of our social responsibility. Vocational training is an integral part of our strategy to
develop our own skilled workers for our German sites. In 2015, 139 (2014: 147) young people (126
men and 13 women) started a vocational training or combined vocational training and study program
at LANXESS in Germany. As of December 31, 2015, LANXESS had a total of 500 young people (82
women and 418 men) in 19 different career paths, including six combined vocational training and study
programs. In 2015, despite our restructuring program, we hired 80% of those who completed their vo­
cational training with us in Germany. We aim to maintain both the number of training places we offer and
the proportion of young people subsequently hired at this high level in the years ahead.

Employees

47

In addition, our one-year orientation program “XOnce” provides young people with guidance on their way
to vocational training if they are not ready to take this route at the current time. We also aim to help the
steadily rising number of people who have sought refuge in Germany from war and poverty. To this end,
we are currently developing a concept for offering refugees guidance in their career choice. We are also
examining whether we could offer additional, specifically tailored internships, apprenticeships and jobs
in the medium term.

An exemplary model
	
Our company in South Africa provides proof that Germany’s vocational training model – with
its balanced mix of theory and practice – can be transferred to other countries. As of the end
of 2015, 18 young people were participating in a two- to three-year training program in various
manual trades. Of course, we aim to hire as many of them as possible in permanent positions at
LANXESS once they have completed their examinations. However, even those who do not work
for us afterwards will have good career prospects with the qualification they have acquired –
in the mining industry, for example. In this way, we are also fulfilling an important social role at
our South African sites.

Redefining leadership and performance – optimizing development worldwide
Successful change is primarily the result of successful leadership, which in turn is underpinned by clear,
globally binding values and standards. For that reason, we have translated our new value model into
five management principles that are applicable worldwide. By the end of 2016, we will integrate these
principles into all relevant HR processes and tools.
Our management principles were also taken into account when developing our Executive Database, a
global talent management tool that facilitates the matching of job profiles against the candidate profiles
produced in annual HR development conferences. At these conferences, we review the performance,
potential, individual development needs and future career planning of all our managerial employees
around the world. During 2016, we intend to implement the Executive Database worldwide for senior
management levels.
In connection with the changes we are making, the question of how well a person represents LANXESS’s
target performance culture in all its facets is also becoming more important for employees taking on their
first managerial role. In India, an analysis of this aspect has been a fixed element of promotion procedures
since 2015. We are also pursuing a similar approach in Brazil.
It goes without saying that employee training and development remained important elements of our
HR development activities in 2015. Alongside formal training sessions and seminars, which amounted
to 10,973 hours in France, for example, employees were able once again to take advantage of many
informal measures, such as mentoring and peer-to-peer coaching, which foster continuous knowledge
sharing across the company.

Corporate Responsibility

In Germany, the Summer Academy format has been translated into a new program that is offered through­
out the year. This program, which is available to all specialist and managerial employees at our German
sites, provided a total of 19 training sessions enabling staff to improve their hard and soft skills and to
participate in an intensive interdisciplinary exchange of ideas. 194 employees from various business units
(62% men and 38% women) took advantage of the offering.
At the Singapore site, we introduced a Skills Matrix Program aimed specifically at production technicians.
The program enabled participants to engage in a learning process which they themselves shaped in order
to extend their knowledge of production processes beyond their own area of responsibility.

Experience for international markets
Our global alignment is a key strategic advantage. LANXESS currently employs people from 69 (2014: 77)
countries across the world. We do not view training, the transfer of know-how and international experi­
ence as a matter of origin or hierarchy. Both new talents and top managers from all regions are given the
opportunity to acquire and deploy experience worldwide.
International assignments are a key component of our systematic HR development process. We advertise
expatriate positions globally on an internal platform. We also feel it is important to give the best-possible
consideration to an employee’s family circumstances in the event of international assignment. That is why
we support the accompanying partner’s professional development, for example.
Short-term assignments, which are necessary for project work, are becoming increasingly important
at LANXESS. At the same time, they offer employees with only short-term international mobility the
opportunity to gain experience working in other countries. We have therefore enhanced the framework
conditions for these short-term assignments. For example, an attractive mix of fringe benefits and special
training is now offered for short-term assignments, too.
Since 2014, in the course of our realignment, we have tangibly reduced the number of employees on
long-term international assignments. At year end 2015, a total of 87 employees (2014: 136 employees) –
around 2.7% (2014: 4%) of our specialists and managers – were working as expatriates outside their
home countries. The focus was in the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

Employees

In addition to achieving a focused global transfer of knowledge by sending experts and managers abroad,
our goal is still to develop local management with the necessary expertise and international competencies
in each country and to transfer challenging tasks to suitable employees. At sites outside Germany, 81.1%
(2014: 80.9%) of our management functions are currently filled by local employees.
Our Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) project is aimed at enhancing diversity at LANXESS and using its
positive effects to benefit our company and our employees. The D&I project is focused on the dimensions
of age, gender and nationality. It is helping us to become more innovative and effective and to attract and
retain promising talents – which is essential given that our business is becoming increasingly ­international
and demographic change has presented us with major challenges in many of our core countries.

Our Diversity & Inclusion project
is focused on the dimensions
of age, gender and nationality.

The D&I Dashboard facilitates the detailed analysis of data pertaining to the three dimensions in our focus.
Each business unit and group function can view its D&I indicators on national, regional and global level,
enabling the development of appropriate strategic measures.
Since the project was launched, we have implemented a large number of measures and created the
­appropriate structures. In the reporting year, the project – which was established in 2011 as a Group-wide
Board of Management initiative under the patronage of Board of Management member and Labor Rela­
tions Director Dr. Rainier van Roessel – was incorporated into the regular HR organization and operations.
For example, we successfully extended our global mentoring program in 2015. In China, more than ten
managerial employees agreed to be mentors and share their experience and insights with promising
young talents.
Our HR organization in India created an initiative named EmpowHER to represent the interests of women.
In the future, it will develop specific measures for the development of women and serve as a first point
of contact for all female employees. Moreover, an experiential learning program is aimed specifically at
women, encouraging them to pursue on their own career paths. Two network events across all sites
rounded off the varied offering for our female employees in India.
Through these measures, our D&I initiative is making an important contribution to reaching the goal we
set ourselves in 2012, in connection with the voluntary undertaking by the DAX 30 companies, of raising
the proportion of women in middle and upper management to 20% worldwide by 2020. The figure
currently stands at 15.6%.
In accordance with the law on the equal representation of women and men in management positions in
the private and public sectors, which came into force on May 1, 2015, certain companies in Germany
are required to define targets for the proportion of women on the first two management levels below the
Board of Management and to specify when these targets are to be met. In the case of first-time targets, the
deadline for implementation may not be later than June 30, 2017. Against the backdrop of LANXESS’s
ongoing restructuring program, the Board of Management of LANXESS AG resolved to retain the existing
proportion of women as the target for the first and second management levels through June 30, 2017. At
the time this resolution was taken, the proportion of women on the first and second management levels
below the Board of Management was 9.8% and 20.5%, respectively. The proportion of women at both
management levels together should be 18.6% at the closing date. We have already taken and are continu­
ing to pursue measures to increase the number of women in management positions across the company.

Meeting demographic challenges
To address the challenges posed by demographic change, LANXESS worked closely with the e
­ mployee
representatives in 2009 to develop “XCare,” a comprehensive demographic program based on the
collective agreement on lifelong working time and demography in the chemical industry. This program,
which applies to our German companies, aims to find answers to the challenges posed by a steady rise
in the average age of our workforce, coupled with a shortage of skilled young people. The measures
brought together within the “XCare” program encompass five areas of activity:
People and health
Work and training
nn Time and organization
nn Career and family life
nn Savings and retirement provision
nn
nn

Balancing work and family life remains a main focus of the “XCare” program and is important to an
­increasing number of employees. A total of 7.0% (2014: 6.7%) of our employees in Germany aged
­between 20 and 40 made use of the option to take parental leave. Of this figure, almost 43% (2014:
42%) were fathers. 97% (2014: 82%) of the employees who ended a parental leave period in 2015
returned to a job at LANXESS.
Our “Xkids” company daycare center in Leverkusen is now in its third year of operation and all places
are full. The facility offers around 50 places for children aged between six months and six years in two
preschool groups and one crèche group. In addition, we offer a needs-based number of places at daycare
centers in Cologne, emergency places for those instances when regular care arrangements are unavail­
able, and a Germany-wide agency service for childcare providers.
Statutory maternity leave is a matter of course in Germany and similar models are in place in other Euro­
pean Union countries. However, it is by no means standard practice around the world. For that reason, we
investigate whether country-specific models can be introduced or extended at our sites outside Europe.
In Brazil, for example, we have reached agreement with the trade unions to benefit our employees by
extending maternity leave from the statutory four months to over six months. Also in Brazil, we pay pre­
school fees for children up to the age of two whose parents return to work for us after their parental leave.

Employees

Against the backdrop of demographic change in Germany, providing care is an important aspect of the
“career and family life” area of activity of the “XCare” program. Alongside advice from an external service
provider and the arrangement of care placements throughout Germany, we offer our employees paid
short-term release from duties. Caregiver leave remains at the heart of the LANXESS caregiving program.
This allows employees to reduce their working time to a greater extent than their salary during the care
phase and to make up the shortfall when they return to work. To date, 40 employees in Germany have
taken advantage of caregiver leave and other job release options.
More flexible worktime models are becoming increasingly important at our sites outside Germany as well.
For example, we introduced three new worktime models in 2015 for our administrative employees in
China, encompassing flextime, part-time and home office working. In Brazil, meanwhile, we offer our
administrative employees a model with flexibilized starting times.

Health and preventive action
Protecting the health and safety of our employees remained a focus of activity in 2015. These issues are
a regular aspect of the dialogue between employee and employer representatives in all countries where
collective agreements apply.
Our occupational health management is based on raising all employees’ awareness of their own health
and motivating them to adopt healthy behaviors in their professional and private lives. In many plants
and departments, employees have taken part in running groups. We also offer influenza vaccinations to
all employees at the different sites. In addition, the members of our top management can undergo an
extensive medical check-up. If health problems have already arisen, such as musculoskeletal disorders,
we offer services such as access to orthopedic specialists, who treat our employees much more quickly
than would be the case in the regular health system.
We have successfully deployed reintegration management at all German sites for a number of years.
Employees who are suffering illness or have had long periods of absence from work in the past twelve
months are provided with extensive advice by our workplace reintegration officers – appointed by the
employer – and the reintegration teams made up of employee representatives. Among other things, the
teams arrange external contacts and provide individual support for technical or organizational issues at
the workplace. In 2015, as in the previous year, more than 40% of the employees invited to participate
accepted the offer of an individual consultation with the respective site workplace reintegration team.
In Germany, our occupational health management and workplace reintegration programs are based on
agreements with employee representatives. The operational teams are managed by steering committees
made up equally of employer and employee representatives.
We also offer employee health promotion initiatives at our sites outside Germany. For example, all our
employees in the United States have access to health check-ups paid for by their health insurance. In
­Canada, our employees receive financial support to pay for membership at a gym or other health-­promoting
establishment. Our Employee Assistance Program in South Africa offers support in a range of areas over
and above health. Employees with personal, family, financial or health issues can turn in confidence to
qualified external advisory services.

97

%

of our non-managerial employees
have a long-term account
that enables them to retire earlier.

In the area of savings and retirement provision, we continued the long-term account for non-managerial
employees as regulated by the agreement with the employee representatives and the collective agreement.
In 2015, the very good participation rate was further increased to around 97%. The reporting year was
the first in which employees were able to take the time accumulated in their accounts as leave before
they retired.
All benefits with respect to work and family, health and retirement provision apply to the core workforce.
Individual benefits may vary regionally and be adjusted locally to our employees’ needs. Our core work­
force comprises all employees with a permanent full-time or part-time position. As of December 31,
2015, they made up 93.3% of our total workforce worldwide. In fiscal 2015, we employed a total of 140
temporary staff (134 men and 6 women) at our German companies – LANXESS GmbH, Saltigo GmbH
and IAB Ionenaustauscher GmbH.
88.3% (2014: 88%) of our employees worldwide receive variable compensation. A total of 64.7% (2014:
65%) of our employees worldwide benefit from unfunded company pension plans.

Rewarding performance transparently and fairly
LANXESS offers its employees worldwide transparent, market-rate compensation, which also includes
a bonus system linked to the company’s long-term success. An employee’s individual income is based
on his or her responsibilities and performance. As well as collective agreements that are the basis for the
compensation of non-managerial staff in Germany and many other countries, legal requirements such
as minimum wage levels are also important in ensuring fair compensation. In Germany, for example, we
obtain temporary employees only from agencies that are covered by the collective agreement for temporary
employment. In addition, the chemical industry pays industry-specific supplements.
The fixed salaries of managerial staff – and of some non-managerial staff – are supplemented by a per­
formance-based variable compensation component known as the Annual Performance Payment (APP),
which is paid to employees in countries that participate in this program. The Annual Performance Payment
is linked to the attainment of the Group’s defined EBITDA target. Additional individual targets are set for
top management. In 2015, our employees around the world shared in the company’s success in 2014
with a payout totaling €63 million.

In 2015, we rewarded

outstanding individual performance
with payments totaling.

€11.2
million

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

During the course of the year, supervisors are also able to reward outstanding employee performance
quickly and unbureaucratically with an Individual Performance Payment (IPP). In fiscal 2015, payments
of €11.2 million worldwide were made solely for outstanding individual performance. Around 82% of our
employees around the world are currently eligible for IPP, which also provides them with a prompt as­
sessment of their performance and career prospects.
For some time now, we have also offered a long-term incentive program for managers in Germany and
similar programs in the United States, Canada, India and the Netherlands. The Long-Term Stock Perfor­
mance Plan (LTSP) 2014 – 2017 consists of four tranches, one commencing each year, and compares
the performance of LANXESS stock against the MSCI World Chemicals Index over a four-year period.
Since participants make a personal investment and there is the chance that the stock will increase in
value, this program is an attractive long-term incentive and a means of enhancing employee loyalty. The
participation rate for all eligible employees in the current program is 99.8%.

Recognizing, rewarding and using good ideas
In 2015, we further optimized the processes and structures of our idea management system. A new
works agreement, which became effective on September 1, 2015, is intended to simplify and accelerate
the processing and evaluation of ideas. In addition, Saltigo GmbH was integrated into the LANXESS
idea management system.
In 2015, employees at our German companies submitted a total of 2,027 (2014: 2,807) suggestions, a
rate of 274 (2014: 373) per thousand employees. In the same period, 1,077 ideas (2014: 1,312) were
implemented, yielding total savings of €2.56 million (2014: €2.52 million). In addition, 789 sugges­
tions (2014: 887) led to improvements in occupational safety and environmental protection. A total of
€0.95 million (2014: €1 million) was paid out to employees whose ideas were put into practice.

Shaping change processes in partnership
A key pillar of our HR policy that we practice worldwide is close cooperation between employee repre­
sentatives and management, including trade unions and employers’ associations, in line with the principle
of active codetermination. This means that we also comply with International Labour Organization (ILO)
standards and the U.N. Global Compact in respecting our employees’ freedom of association and valid
collective agreements. Worldwide, 66.9% (2014: 67%) of our employees are covered by collective
agreements; in Germany the figure is just under 90% (2014: 90%).
We maintain a dialogue with employee representative bodies in Germany, Europe and around the world
to discuss our corporate goals on a regular basis and involve these bodies in organizational changes
at an early stage. In the context of the realignment and associated global restructuring program,
manage­ment and the employee representatives in various countries collaborated during the reporting
period to develop and implement socially acceptable solutions. In August 2015, the annual meeting
of the European Forum – the company’s codetermination platform in Europe – was also dominated by
the Group’s realignment.
In accordance with the German Works Constitution Act, LANXESS is obliged to inform the Works Council
fully and in good time of any planned operational changes which could result in material disadvantage to all
or substantial parts of the workforce. The Economics Committee is also informed on a regular basis about
the company’s economic affairs. We fully comply with our legal obligations with respect to the responsible
bodies. Notification periods are defined in the collective agreements in Germany and other countries. In
Germany, for instance, it is four weeks. Similar periods in other countries are also always complied with.
Outside Europe, too, we give high priority to fair dealings with employee representatives and trade
unions. In South Africa, for instance, we comply with International Labour Organization (ILO) standards
with respect to our employees’ freedom of association. This includes regular dialogue between local
management and trade union representatives as well as binding collective agreements on compensation
and working conditions. In the reporting year, local management and trade union representatives at our
Sarnia site in Canada worked together to draw up an action plan aimed at improving communication and
collaboration between the two parties.

Corporate Responsibility

Health, safety, environment and climate protection
in the value creation chain
LANXESS is responsible for its actions across the entire supply and value creation chain – from the global
procurement of raw materials and product development, through production, storage and transport, to
use and disposal. The health and safety of our stakeholders – employees, contractors, immediate neigh­
bors of our production sites, customers and end users – is of central importance at each of these stages.
Through our safety standards, we aim to ensure the responsible application of chemistry in health and
environmental protection, in the handling of chemicals, in plant safety and in workplace safety precautions.
Company-wide standards are in place to define the associated requirements and responsibilities. Through
the ongoing training of our employees and regular auditing of our health, safety and environmental manage­
ment, we ensure that the requirements are systematically and sustainably implemented in our processes.

Uniform standards in production
Across the globe, LANXESS operates at 52 production sites in which it holds an interest of more than 50%
(as of December 31, 2015). The diversity of the company’s product portfolio necessitates the use of many
different chemical and technical processes. Uniform standards for planning, engineering and operating
facilities are applied to ensure a high level of process, plant and occupational safety. Handling chemical
substances and working with technical equipment fundamentally involve health and safety risks. Wherever
in the world we operate, we systematically identify these risks and the hazard potential – both for existing
and new facilities – and minimize them by implementing defined preventive and protective measures. To
help us achieve this, we have established LANXESS-specific guidelines within the context of our global
management system. These govern our procedures for all safety-critical processes in our production
facilities and cover aspects such as the formulation and implementation of technical and organizational
protective measures and the environmentally friendly handling of raw materials, products and waste.

In 2015, we audited

45

production facilities

in the context of HSE
(health, safety, environment)
compliance checks.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

To ensure compliance with LANXESS directives and local regulations for the safe operation of facilities,
experts on site conduct audits based on targeted spot checks that are carried out with a frequency
­appropriate to the relevant risk profile and results. At each facility across the globe, compliance with the
safety standards must be certified regularly, at least at the intervals required by local legislation. A total
of 45 production facilities (2014: 38), 19 of them in Germany (2014: 19), were audited in the context of
HSE (health, safety, environment) compliance checks in 2015.

“Xact”: Board of Management’s global safety initiative
LANXESS attaches the highest priority to the safety of all its work processes. Our “Xact” global safety
program, launched in 2011, is aimed at encouraging all employees to work together to improve safety
throughout the company and at raising their awareness of this issue.

GRI
G4–26
G4–27

Making a company safer is a complex task in which each and every employee has the most crucial role. That
is why we developed six “Xact” safety regulations as the central principles of safe working at LANXESS.
These address the main areas in which every employee – whether they are employed in production or
administration and irrespective of their function or position in the hierarchy – can actively contribute to
their own safety and that of their colleagues.

After familiarizing our employees around the world with the cultural elements of our occupational safety
program in 2014, we launched five more HSE standards in 2015. These incorporate new, stricter regu­
lations for technical activities with a higher risk potential, such as entering containers or tight spaces and
using forklift trucks. After receiving extensive training from the “Xact” regional managers, our managerial
staff communicated these standards throughout the entire organization during the reporting year.
At the same time, we also continued to drive forward implementation of the program’s cultural elements.
One important format in this regard is the safety dialogue, when positive and critical behaviors are
­discussed and possible improvement measures devised. These discussion sessions regularly take place
between supervisors and their staff as well as among groups of colleagues.
We are also seeking to achieve an improved mutual understanding of occupational safety with suppliers
who provide us with technical services, for example, and are increasingly integrating them into our s­ afety
culture. Here, we apply the principle of “select, train, support and evaluate.” For example, our partners
must provide verification of their own safety management system and that their employees who work for
us have received certain safety training. Independent of this, we give employees of our partner companies
individual safety briefings as a matter of course.

Another “Xact” tool that is becoming increasingly well established is the Pulse Check survey, which was
again conducted among all LANXESS employees in 2015. This gave them a fresh opportunity to describe
their personal experience of key safety aspects at LANXESS. Among other things, the anonymous survey
seeks to establish the importance that individuals attach to safe working practices, whether they feel in­
volved in safety activities and whether they receive positive feedback for working safely. More than 10,000
employees – a response rate of 61% – provided feedback on their experiences. The level of participation
was therefore almost double that for the first survey in 2014 and the responses to all specific questions
were generally more positive than last time. For example, 87% of respondents are now familiar with the
six “Xact” safety regulations. Our employees believe there is room for improvement regarding the degree
to which supervisors acknowledge their safe working practices. Furthermore, the view that all accidents
are avoidable is not shared by as many of our employees as we would like.

Recording accidents and incidents
Thanks to our electronic Incident Reporting System (IRS), we are able to record accidents and incidents
worldwide using standardized procedures. The incidents that are documented include accidents involv­
ing people, transport accidents, near accidents, safety-relevant incidents, environmental incidents and
downtime caused by, for example, bad weather or strike action. We communicate significant incidents
worldwide via our intranet or by newsletter. Each incident is carefully analyzed to identify measures that
can be taken to avoid similar accidents, disruptions or near accidents in the future.
LANXESS uses the recordable incident rate (RIR, the number of injuries per 200,000 working hours
that are reportable as per OSHA rules) and the lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR, known as MAQ in
Germany and describing the number of injuries for every million hours worked) as indicators for evaluating
occupational safety. The LTIFR was 2.2 in 2015, slightly lower than the previous year’s level. It was 3.2 in
2013 and 3.4 in 2012. This substantial medium-term reduction shows that the measures implemented
over the past three years to improve occupational safety at LANXESS are taking effect. For example,
we have seen a significant decrease in the number of work-related injuries at our chrome oxide mine in
South Africa. The RIR, which was recently introduced to enhance international comparability, was 0.8 in
2015 and 2014, down from 1.1 in 2013.
Carrying forward the positive trend of recent years will require further concerted efforts supported by
“Xact.” We should benefit from our employees being much more safety-conscious than they were in the
past owing to the raised profile of occupational safety.

Global product stewardship
LANXESS is committed to the Responsible Care® Global Charter, a comprehensive product stewardship
initiative by the world’s chemical industry launched by the International Council of Chemical Associations
(ICCA) that was the key factor in the development of the Global Product Strategy (GPS). This aims to
provide basic information and risk assessments for substances so that the impact of chemicals on human
health and the environment can be minimized and products can be manufactured and distributed in such
a way as to prevent injury to people and damage to the environment.
In line with the aforementioned commitment, our product stewardship covers the safe handling of chemical
substances and products throughout their life cycle – from procurement and research and development,
through production, storage, transportation and downstream processing to marketing and disposal.
The Product Safety Management at LANXESS Directive steers the Group-wide observance of prod­
uct stewardship and secures the participation of everyone involved. This applies in particular to those
substances in our product portfolio that are classified as hazardous. Our Central Product Surveillance
Directive systematically governs worldwide tracking of our products and their use in respect of potential
health and environmental impacts. The information acquired is used by our product developers and
product safety experts in their evaluations.

Management of chemical control regulations
The safe handling, marketability and safe transportation of our chemicals and products are conditional
on compliance with global chemical control regulations.
LANXESS has a global organization supported by an electronic safety data system to ensure compliance
with both mandatory and voluntary control requirements. Material safety data sheets in more than 30
languages inform our customers worldwide about substance data and the safety measures that are
necessary when using the relevant chemicals. We aim to raise marketability and the provision of hazard­
ous goods data to a globally uniform safety and technical standard by successively integrating this
safety data system into our SAP system worldwide. In 2015, we integrated our country organization in
Spain and the Rhein Chemie organization in the United States into the system.
We regularly adapt our electronic safety data system to reflect changes to the GHS (Globally Harmonized
System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals) in various countries. The GHS is a system under
the umbrella of the United Nations that aims to harmonize existing classification and labeling systems
used in various sectors such as transportation and consumer, employee and environmental protection.
We observe regional variations in the implementation of the GHS such as the European Union’s CLP
(Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures) regulation.
Before manufacturing, importing or selling our products in a given country, we examine their marketability
in accordance with the chemicals legislation in force there. We register our substances and products in
line with local requirements and participate in the substance analysis programs of the responsible author­
ities by supplying all available information and collecting new data if necessary. Efforts to meet the new
requirements in chemicals legislation in Taiwan and South Korea – in terms of registration requirements
for both new and previously listed substances – continued in 2015. Our experience in implementing
REACH in the European Union helped with this.

We expressly support the protection goals of the E.U. REACH regulation, which aims to ensure a high
level of safety for human health and the environment in the manufacture and use of chemicals. We have
so far pre-registered all the substances that are relevant for LANXESS with the European Chemicals
Agency (ECHA) in Helsinki, Finland, by the stipulated deadlines. By the third deadline, on May 31, 2018,
all substances we produce in volumes exceeding one ton will have been registered in Europe. Registration
involves the systematic evaluation of information concerning our substances and their uses. In doing this,
we consider the entire product life cycle. Within the context of a voluntary commitment made by the
German Chemical Industry Association (VCI) in 1997 to record and assess substances, we go beyond
the legal requirements to determine a basic data set for our intermediates as well, in line with Appendix VII
of the REACH regulation.
In the case of consumer applications in particular, such as those in the areas of food and drinking water
contact, toys, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and medical products, we ensure that our products meet
national and international laws and standards, religious dietary laws and quality hallmarks. In this way,
we actively support our customers in the certification of their materials for drinking water contact appli­
cations, for example.
The exchange of information with our customers is an important aspect of our product stewardship
activities. We therefore provide them with extensive information about our products via the IMDS (Inter­
national Material Data System), an automotive industry database for archiving, exchanging and managing
information, or via LANXESS’s product-specific database, which has a public area and a restricted area
for registered business partners.

No Pellets Emission –
making sure everything stays where it belongs
	A good example of how we use the information gained from product monitoring to develop
our own measures is the No Pellet Emission project. This focuses on plastic pellets, which
may be released into the marine environment due to inattentiveness at various stages of
the value chain – during production, distribution, storage and transportation. Plastic pel­
lets themselves do not react chemically but may have an undesired impact on account of
their small size and volume. We therefore joined forces with PlasticsEurope Deutschland
to launch the No Pellet Loss project as part of the Responsible Care® initiative, with the
goal of motivating all stakeholders to handle plastic pellets in a responsible way.
	As part of the internal LANXESS No Pellet Emission project, our facilities in Germany
that handle pellets have systematically analyzed all potential emission sources and put in
place measures designed to effectively prevent water pollution caused by pellets. Based
on our experience and findings to date, we want to give the No Pellet Emission project
global scope in 2016.

Procurement in the supply chain
Responsible action begins in procurement. At LANXESS, raw and other materials, plant and services must
satisfy globally uniform safety and environmental protection requirements. Raw materials in particular are
subject to stringent monitoring to ensure safe processing in our production facilities. For example, the
procurement of any raw material is dependent on the submission by the supplier of a current material safety
data sheet. Our procurement department clarifies which of the REACH requirements must be satisfied in
the case of raw materials from non-European suppliers. In order to minimize our procurement risks and
enhance supply chain transparency, we and five other international chemicals companies founded the
Together for Sustainability initiative in 2012 (see page 119).

Global dangerous goods and transport safety management
Through our global dangerous goods and transport safety management system, we ensure the avoidance
of hazardous situations in the relevant processes. We centrally coordinate, supervise and review the im­
plementation of international, regional and local dangerous goods and transport safety regulations and
internal company guidelines. The central classification of our products ensures uniform interpretation of
international, regional and local dangerous goods regulations, while at the same time respecting regional
and local specifics.
Classification determines, among other things, the form of encapsulation (packaging and tanks), marking
and labeling, permitted modes of transport and transport routes and the measures that emergency ser­
vices must take in the event of a transport incident. The corresponding classification data are archived
in LANXESS’s safety data system for chemicals. In 2015, we expanded the central dangerous goods
classification for Mexico and Uruguay and made preparations to incorporate Australia into the system.
In the years ahead, we aim to consistently pursue this approach and integrate the remaining countries –
Argentina, India, Japan, Russia and South Korea.

Storage management
We operate our own warehouses, but also commission external warehousing service providers, selecting
them on the basis of a specified process that considers relevant aspects such as logistics, safety and
security, environmental protection and cost-effectiveness. In line with a chemical industry concept, we
apply a globally standardized warehouse concept that takes into account the substances stored and meets
fire protection and occupational health and safety requirements.

Corporate Responsibility

Ecological responsibility
As LANXESS sees it, conserving natural resources – for example, through the most efficient possible
use of raw materials and energies – and identifying further potential for reducing emissions and waste
are an ongoing mission and an inherent part of our ecological responsibility to which we must apply our
expertise. We equip all new production sites in line with state-of-the-art environmental standards, taking
into account local requirements. This often sets us apart from local competitors.

Systematic energy management
Resource and energy efficiency are key factors both for the cost-efficiency of our company and in climate
and environmental protection. In this connection, we have established a global procedure for an energy
management system in line with ISO 50001. The centrally managed global implementation project was
completed in 2014. Our certification in Germany was reconfirmed in 2015. On account of our realignment
activities, we have revised our strategy of global certification of the energy management system in favor
of a regional certification strategy. In the future, decisions will be taken locally on the basis of regulatory
requirements. For example, LANXESS Liyang in China successfully obtained certification in April 2015.
In 2015, we concluded the LANXESS Energy Efficiency Program (LEEP), in which we had combined
our measures to increase energy efficiency since 2012, and handed over ongoing projects to the rel­
evant business units for further implementation. A number of cross-business unit projects had already
been concluded by this time. The results achieved by LEEP are now being fed into the business units’
potential analyses and optimization projects.

In 2015, we participated for the tenth time consecutively in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), sharing
data and information on climate protection and the reduction of emissions. The CDP is an organization
representing international institutional investors which have joined forces in order to improve transparency
for the financial market on questions linked to climate change and the requisite corporate guidelines. We
achieved a disclosure score of 98 out of a possible 100 points in 2015, having created a very high level
of transparency for the greenhouse gas emissions caused by LANXESS and our strategies and activities
designed to reduce our environmental impact.
In Europe, 17 LANXESS facilities and/or sites are subject to the European Emissions Trading System.
Trading in CO2 emission rights – or allowances – is a cost-effective way of reducing harmful CO2 emis­
sions. Since all our facilities that are eligible for emissions trading are at the cutting edge of technology
and compete on the international market, we expect to receive an adequate number of free allowances
up to the end of the third trading period in 2020 to cover our anticipated CO2 emissions.

Sustainable logistics
We select our transport solutions worldwide on a case-by-case basis, applying the principles of safety, punc­
tuality and cost-effectiveness. We also take into account the CO2 emissions resulting from our transports.
Today, we already use ships as the means of transport with the lowest emissions for around 90% of all
ton-kilometers (tonnage transported multiplied by the distance transported in kilometers). In Germany,
we continue to use the TÜV SÜD-approved Eco Plus solution offered by logistics provider DB Schenker
Rail for transporting our products by rail. The electricity required for transport is obtained from renewable
energy sources. This enables us to reduce the CO2 emissions from our German rail transport operations
by almost 75% compared with the standard solution. In 2015, we further extended our tried-and-tested
railshuttle concept for our Uerdingen site. Every day, up to 20 export containers now leave the site by rail,
bound for seaports. We also use this concept to bring in raw materials that are landed at the same ports.
Packaging is an often critical aspect in sustainable logistics processes. However, it is of lower significance
to a chemical company like LANXESS because at least 60% of our products are transported in reusable
containers.

Other atmospheric emissions
In the year under review, our emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) decreased further – both in
absolute terms and in relation to the volumes sold. This was due to, among other things, various measures
we had taken to achieve our environmental protection target of cutting VOC emissions by 30% through
the end of 2015 (base year: 2010).

Responsible use of water resources
All wastewater and surface water discharges at our sites are subject to legal and permitting requirements.
We use both technical (wastewater treatment) and organizational (monitoring) measures to comply with
these requirements.
Before the authorities issue an operating permit, an assessment is carried out on the possible economic,
social and environmental impacts of water extraction on the surrounding area. At all LANXESS sites,
this takes place under approved conditions. The issue of water extraction is also addressed by our envi­
ronmental protection compliance program.

Sustainable waste management
The company aims to employ a consistent material flow management process – from the use of raw
materials to the manufacture of the final product – so as to deploy resources as efficiently as possible and
minimize the amount of waste we produce. Some forms of waste can be used as secondary raw materials
and are thus a valuable resource. Sustainable waste management therefore involves systematically avoiding
waste and, if this is not possible, using waste as a raw material or energy source. In order to minimize the
amount of waste requiring disposal, we seek to continuously improve our production processes.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

Health, safety, environment and climate protection in the value creation chain

The total amount of waste generated in relation to volumes sold dropped slightly compared with the
previous year. The amount of waste classified as hazardous also declined at the same time. All forms of
waste are disposed of or reused in compliance with statutory requirements. Almost half of our waste is
used in material or energy recovery.

Systematic recording of key performance indicators
We use an electronic system for the systematic global recording of key performance indicators (KPIs) in
the areas of safety and environmental protection. This system enables us to define a broad range of HSE
performance data for each business unit and site worldwide. These provide a valid database for internal
and external reporting and map the progress we are making toward achieving our globally applicable
HSEQ targets (see table on page 72). Data for all indicators except the LTIFR are gathered only at those
production sites in which the company has a holding of more than 50%. We are working systematically
to improve our data recording processes and data quality.
PricewaterhouseCoopers AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft assessed our HSE indicators for 2013 to
2015 (see below) and the necessary data recording processes in the course of a business audit with a
view to achieving a “limited assurance” rating. The audit certificate can be found on page 245.

Explanations concerning our environmental and safety performance data

* The aggregate data refer to all LANXESS production sites in which the company holds an interest of more than 50%.
2013/2014/2015: Some of the data are based on estimates and projections.
The indicators were assessed (limited assurance) by PwC AG Wirtschafts­prüfungsgesellschaft in the course
of a business audit.
1) LTIFR: accident rate per million hours worked resulting in one workday or more lost f­ollowing the day of the accident,
calculated for all employees (including temporary ­workers) at all sites
2) Volume sold of goods manufactured by LANXESS and sold internally to another LANXESS company or externally
(excluding commercial products)
3) The energy volumes given were calculated on the basis of simplified assumptions and typical substance values. They do
not include other forms of imported energy (e.g. the energy contained in raw materials).
4) Equivalent to circulating cooling water
5) The emission factors used for fossil fuels are based on calculations by the U.S. EPA (AP-42 from 1998) and on the
IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (2006). In accordance with the GHG Protocol (2004),
the factors for calculating CO 2e are based on the global warming potential (time horizon: 100 years) defined in the
IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR 1995).
All Scope 1 greenhouse gases are calculated as CO 2e. In accordance with the GHG Protocol, the CO 2 emissions from
the combustion of biomass are shown separately and are not included in the Scope 1 emissions. The following emissi­
ons were produced during the reporting period: 2013: 223 kt CO 2, 2014: 217 kt CO 2, 2015: 236 kt CO 2.
6) All Scope 2 greenhouse gases are calculated as CO2e. The conversion factors used were provided by the energy producers
for 2008 or 2009. Where these were not available, factors from the IEA (International Energy Agency) for 2011 were used
for fiscal year 2013, factors from 2012 were used for fiscal year 2014 and factors from 2013 were used for fiscal year
2015.
The Scope 2 CO2e emissions are calculated using the market-based method in accordance with the GHG Protocol.
Using the location-based method, Scope 2 CO2e emissions for 2015 amounted to 4,508 kt.
7) Nitrogen oxide (NO X) calculated as NO2 (excluding N2O – nitrous oxide)
8) Sulfur dioxide (SO2) + SO3 calculated as SO2
9) Total VOC (volatile organic compounds) excluding methane and acetone
10) Heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, mercury, nickel, lead, tin, zinc)
a) Values restated due to supplementary notifications

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

Health, safety, environment and climate protection in the value creation chain

Mid-term emissions targets achieved
In 2010, we set ourselves the target of reducing both the specific energy consumption and specific CO2e
emissions of each of our business segments by 10% through the end of fiscal 2015. We also formulated
the target of reducing our VOC emissions by 30% through the end of 2015. Due to various influencing
factors, we achieved both our CO2e and VOC targets (unadjusted) by the end of 2015, but did not achieve
our energy target. First, we did not achieve our planned business growth targets, which had been used
as the basis for setting both the aforementioned targets and the budget for the corresponding investment
in efficiency measures. Second, portfolio adjustments in the form of acquisitions and new facilities also
had a substantial effect and, in some cases, hindered progress in achieving the targets. As the volumes
produced and the respective product mixes are significant factors alongside efficiency, the savings effects
cannot be directly depicted in absolute energy and emissions data.
Specific energy consumption
Comparing the specific energy consumption in the individual segments in 2015 with the figures from
the base year 2010 shows that only the Advanced Intermediates segment has improved, while the other
two segments have not. On the one hand, this outcome can be attributed to LANXESS’s business de­
velopment, which resulted in production and sales volumes that were below original assumptions. On
the other hand, measures associated with the “Let’s LANXESS again” program and changes to the way
energy is recorded are also involved. For example, one consequence of the realignment program was
that the energy efficiency measures identified by LEEP could only be implemented to a limited extent, if
at all. Furthermore, due to the continuous expansion of our energy recording systems, far more energy
sources are now included in our reporting than was the case in the base year 2010.
Specific CO2 emissions
In terms of specific CO2 emissions, all segments achieved their reduction targets. With a reduction of
around 30%, the Performance Chemicals segment substantially exceeded its target. The situation was
also very encouraging in the two other segments – Performance Polymers and Advanced Intermediates –
where we succeeded in cutting specific CO2 emissions by approximately 13%. One key reason for this
achievement is the partial switchover to climate-neutral biomass for in-house power generation. We were
able to reduce our specific CO2 emissions across all segments by more than 15%.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

70

Corporate Responsibility

Absolute VOC emissions
The situation regarding VOC emissions is also encouraging. Focused measures enabled us to exceed
our reduction target of 30% (in absolute terms). For example, at our sites in Belgium, Brazil and Canada
alone, which are responsible for a significant share of our total volatile organic compound emissions, we
reduced emissions by some 3,000 tons.
Analysis of adjusted values
In terms of specific energy consumption, the picture is slightly different if we factor in the effects of portfolio
adjustments and larger volumes of energy data being collected. Here, too, the Advanced Intermediates
segment achieved its energy efficiency target and the Performance Polymers segment succeeded in
slightly reducing its specific energy consumption. The Performance Chemicals segment cannot point to
any improvement in energy efficiency for the period from 2010 through 2015. However, the LANXESS
Group as a whole achieved a 5% reduction in specific energy consumption.
In terms of CO2 emissions per ton of product sold, the Advanced Intermediates and Performance Chem­
icals segments achieved their targets with reductions of 13.9% and 33.4%, respectively. Although the
reduction of 2.9% in the Performance Polymers segment is below the target value, it still contributed toward
the overall result. We succeeded in lowering our specific CO2 emissions across all segments by 12.3%.
In terms of volatile organic compounds, we not only achieved but substantially exceeded our adjusted
target. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the measures implemented in the facilities that already
belonged to LANXESS in the base year 2010.

Health, safety, environment and climate protection in the value creation chain

New environmental protection and climate targets formulated for 2025
Environmental and climate protection continue to be a top priority at LANXESS. That is why, at the start
of 2016, we set new long-term targets for CO2 and VOC emissions and for reducing energy consumption.
By 2025, we aim to cut our specific CO2 and VOC emissions by 25% (base date: December 31, 2015).
We also aim to reduce specific energy consumption by 25% through 2025. In the future, assessment
will no longer be based on the performance of the reporting segments, but rather on that of LANXESS
as a whole. This approach takes account of the company’s changing structures.

As a company, we draw numerous benefits from the society in which we operate – well-trained e­ mployees,
satisfied customers, legal and political stability and a good infrastructure. We believe it is only right that,
in line with the concept of corporate citizenship, we assume responsibility and thus contribute to the
evolution of society.
We focus on four areas of activity: education, climate protection, water and culture. In 2015, we again
initiated or supported a number of projects worldwide in these areas of activity. The regional focus of our
activities in the reporting year was Europe, where more than half of all projects were implemented. Overall,
more than 335,000 (2014: more than 218,000) mainly young people benefited from our projects, which
we funded with some €2 million in 2015 (2014: some €0.9 million).

The LANXESS education initiative – a global success story
We endeavor to encourage young people worldwide to develop a passion for chemistry at a young age,
awaken their inventive spirit and make them aware of the diverse career opportunities that the LANXESS
Group offers. Within the context of the LANXESS education initiative, we have established projects at
many of our sites to pursue these objectives in varying ways.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

Society

We underscore our clear commitment to Germany as a business location and a base for the chemical
industry not just through financial assistance for schools close to our sites but also through collaboration
in the provision of scientific teaching materials. For instance, we have worked with an experienced partner
specializing in education media to develop teaching materials on the subjects of mobility, globalization,
urbanization and water for use in elementary schools. We distributed the materials to a total of 269 ele­
mentary schools throughout Germany. The “TuWaS!” (Do Something!) project initiated by the Cologne
Chamber of Commerce and Industry and supported by LANXESS also targets elementary school students
with the aim of getting children interested in scientific and technical questions through play. We have pro­
vided a total of €90,000 in funding for middle and high schools close to our sites at Krefeld, Leverkusen,
Dormagen, Brunsbüttel and Cologne. This has enabled these schools to implement projects in MINT
subjects (mathematics, information technology, natural sciences and technology), for example on acids,
photometry, computer-assisted measurement recording and the generation and storage of electricity.
In Brazil, we promote scientific knowledge and environmental awareness at our various sites through the
“Green Cycle” competition, which gives participants the opportunity to develop their own environmental
protection projects. LANXESS provides full funding for implementing the winning projects. Participants
receive assistance from an agency that specializes in environmental projects. Since the competition
­began in 2010, we have successfully initiated 38 projects that have benefited more than 8,000 people. In
addition, our employees in Brazil participate in Community Day once a year and spend the day providing
practical assistance to facilities such as kindergartens, hospitals, schools and social centers.
The “Educar para Crecer” (Educate to Grow) initiative in Argentina aims to promote development in
the Zárate region by supporting schools and not-for-profit organizations engaged in educational, social
and environmental protection activities there. As part of this initiative, we provide funding for sustainable
education projects and help those wishing to launch such projects by delivering the fundamental k­ now-how
they need. Since the initiative began in 2007, more than 40 projects have been implemented, directly
or indirectly benefiting about 10,000 people. The “La Basura Sirve” (Waste is Useful) initiative launched
in Zárate in 2012 also promotes responsible environmental practices. The program, which we conduct
in collaboration with a group of schools, encourages the collection and sorting of inorganic household
waste. The income from the sale of reusable materials to recycling companies is used by the participating
schools to finance purchases.
In China, we collaborate with the Goethe Institute to offer the LANXESS-PASCH Dream Career Program.
Each year, two students from the Goethe Institute’s partner schools complete a four-week internship with
LANXESS. In Liyang, we provide support to particularly gifted or very committed school students. Each
year, students from the three renowned universities we partner in Qingdao, Shaanxi and Changzhou can
apply to LANXESS for a scholarship and internship.

Corporate Responsibility

In Japan, we have been working for a number of years with the aid organization Save the Children Japan.
In August 2015, under the motto “Exciting Experiments,” our Japanese company arranged workshops at
three schools in Miyagi Prefecture. In one of these workshops, participants made batteries from vegetables.
Each year, we support “Fun Chemistry World” in South Korea, an initiative organized by the South
Korean Responsible Care Council in four different cities. Through a variety of experiments, LANXESS
employees provide insights into the exciting world of chemistry for the more than 1,000 school students
who regularly participate.
Since 2011, we have been the main sponsor of the “Rally to Read” initiative in South Africa, which aims
to reduce the significant difference in reading and writing skills between students in rural areas and their
counterparts in urban centers. Each year, we provide schools in remote areas with items such as teacher
training guides, container libraries, writing materials, sports equipment, educational toys and school shoes.
In 2015, twelve schools in the vicinity of our Rustenburg site benefited from these measures.
Our partnership with the Junior Achievement organization in the United States also fully reflects our
commitment to corporate volunteering. LANXESS employees regularly visit schools in the Pittsburgh
area to teach first- to fifth-grade classes basic aspects of economics, entrepreneurship and corporate
responsibility. Another project which LANXESS has been supporting for some time is the Neighborhood
Academy, which supports and mentors disadvantaged young people from Pittsburgh in preparing for
their high school diploma examinations.

The LANXESS education initiative
has already reached tens of
thousands of children, adolescents
and young adults worldwide.

Since its launch, the LANXESS education initiative has reached tens of thousands of children, adolescents
and young adults worldwide. Feedback from teachers, principals and school authorities shows that the
initiative has significantly enhanced the importance of the MINT subjects in school timetables.

Committed to protecting the climate and water resources
A further focus of our corporate responsibility is enhancing awareness worldwide of the causes and
consequences of climate change and water scarcity – for both drinking and industrial uses. In Brazil,
we collaborated in 2015 with Valdemir Cunha, one of the country’s best-known landscape and nature
photographers, to organize photography workshops for school students at five sites. Previously, Cunha
had documented Brazilians’ day-to-day relationship with water in a book entitled Água (Water) that was
sponsored by LANXESS. In China, to mark the publication of the Chinese government’s Water Action
Plan, we initiated a new research competition in the reporting year. Students from five universities were
asked to develop approaches for protecting water as a vital resource.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

Society

Promoting art and culture
We are convinced that successful scientific work and, ultimately, social progress can only flourish in a
culture of thought, research and critical evaluation. As part of our cultural commitment, we therefore
sponsor both literary and musical talents. We have been the main partner to lit.COLOGNE, Europe’s
biggest literature festival in Cologne, since 2010. Since 2013, we have also been partnering its sister
event phil.COLOGNE, a top-class international philosophy festival.
The second mainstay of our cultural commitment is support for musical training, especially for young
people. The Young Euro Classic initiative brings together talents from Germany and LANXESS’s main
markets around the world. LANXESS SNYO Classic sponsors an exchange and mentoring program for
the Singapore National Youth Orchestra. In Japan, we support the Ozawa International Chamber Music
Academy (OICMA), which enables talented young musicians from across Asia to receive a top-quality
musical education. Furthermore, we are a partner to the “Kölner Philharmonie,” one of Europe’s premier
cultural institutions. In addition to the “Acht Brücken” (Eight Bridges) contemporary music festival, we
support initiatives such as a discounted concert subscription for university students.

Alleviating distress, creating opportunities
	In 2015, more than one million refugees came to Germany to escape war and poverty in
their countries of origin. We, like others, wish to make a helpful contribution to alleviating
the immediate distress of these people and to providing them with opportunities for the
future. We have therefore provided €400,000 to support selected refugee aid projects
in Cologne, Leverkusen, Dormagen, Krefeld and Brunsbüttel. These funds will be used
mainly to finance language teaching for children at schools as part of their preparatory
classes and for adults at further education centers. We consider language skills to be
the key to successful integration.
	In addition, we are expressly fostering our employees’ individual involvement. They can
take paid leave for up to eight days to help established aid organizations in their work.
And we are granting two days’ leave for local or self-initiated aid projects. We also aim
to provide career opportunities for people seeking refuge and – in light of demographic
change – acquire well-trained employees for LANXESS at the same time. Therefore, as
a first step, we have created twelve additional places on the one-year preparatory course
prior to vocational training. In addition, we are organizing trial weeks to help with career
choices. In the medium to long term, we intend to offer additional internships, vocational
training places and jobs, some of which will be specifically tailored to refugees’ particular
needs. We are working closely with the responsible public agencies and, when the time
comes, will offer assistance in assessing refugees’ skills.

LANXESS on the Capital Market

LANXESS on the Capital Market
In a year in which the stock market was again characterized by a high level of volatility,
LANXESS stock outperformed the DAX and its two industry benchmark indices.
Year on year, the share price rose by around 11%. After switching index at the end
of September, our stock is again listed in the MDAX.

In 2015, the German stock market performed positively overall, but was subject to sharp price fluctuations
over the course of the year. The German lead index, the DAX, made a very strong start to the trading
year. This was stimulated by the European Central Bank (ECB) asset purchase program announced in
January as well as by improved economic data from the eurozone and the continuation of expansionary
monetary policy in key economies such as the United States and China. A rally lasting more than three
months pushed the index to record levels. On April 10, for example, the DAX closed at a new all-time
high of 12,375 points.
However, shortly thereafter negative factors gained the upper hand for several months. In particular, the
ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Greece, weaker macroeconomic data from China, a sharp correction
on Chinese equity markets and growing discussion of an interest rate rise in the United States sent the
DAX back below the 9,500 point mark by the end of September. There was no clear turnaround in this
trend until October, when the ECB announced that it might further ease its expansionary monetary policy
at the end of the year. However, market participants’ hopes of increased bond purchases were dashed
in December. Moreover, the impact of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s long-anticipated interest rate increase
was felt. On December 30, the DAX closed at 10,743 points – 9.6% higher than the 2014 closing price.
Viewed over the full year, the MDAX was much more stable, rising by 22.7% to 20,775 points.
By contrast, the LANXESS benchmark indices – the Dow Jones STOXX 600 Chemicals SM and the MSCI
World Chemicals Index – were much weaker in 2015. The Dow Jones STOXX 600 Chemicals SM rose
by only 5.6% to close the year on 829 points. The more comprehensive and international MSCI World
Chemicals Index declined 2.8% year on year, closing 2015 at 250 points.

Of all the benchmarks,
only the MDAX posted
a stronger performance
in the reporting year.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

After being heavily impacted in 2014 by company-specific news, LANXESS stock moved largely parallel
with the market as a whole during the reporting year. Positive news, such as the successful implementa­
tion of our realignment program and a significantly improved operating performance, contrasted with the
switch from DAX to MDAX as a result of insufficient market capitalization. LANXESS has again been
listed in the MDAX since September 21, 2015. Our stock reached its high for the year of €55.59 on
June 26 but remained below the €50 mark in the second half of the year. The closing price on Decem­
ber 30 was €42.68. Thus, in 2015, LANXESS stock gained 11.0% in value, significantly outperforming
its two industry benchmark indices and also faring better than the DAX. Of all the benchmarks, only the
MDAX posted a stronger performance in the reporting year.

Sustainability
Exercising responsibility in our entrepreneurial activities is a key element of our corporate strategy. We
therefore aim to position LANXESS as a sustainable investment for providers of equity and debt capital.

In 2015, we were included in
the Dow Jones Sustainability Index
(DJSI) World for the fifth time.

In the Carbon Disclosure Project,
we achieved

98

out of a possible 100 points
for disclosure.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

In 2015, for the fifth time in succession, we were included in the respected Dow Jones Sustainability
Index (DJSI) World. The index applies the best-in-class principle and includes only the top ten percent
of the companies evaluated. This year, we received special recognition for our commitment in the areas
of occupational health and safety, codes of conduct and compliance, risk and crisis management,
­customer relationship management, corporate citizenship and innovation management. Our listing in
the FTSE4Good Index, in which we were first included in 2011, was also confirmed. In addition, oekom
research – one of the leading sustainability rating agencies – gave us a corporate responsibility rating
of C.
Climate protection and correspondingly transparent reporting about our achievements in this area have
a key role in our sustainability activities, which we again demonstrated through our annual participation
in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). In 2015, we achieved 98 out of a possible 100 points for d
­ isclosure.
In addition, environmental data are an important component of our sustainability reporting.
Detailed information about sustainability can be found in the “Corporate Responsibility” section starting
on page 32 and on our website.

Stockholder structure

Stockholder structure
The majority of LANXESS’s stockholders are institutional investors whose strategy is oriented toward
growth or value. At January 31, 2016, these investors held around 89% of the stock. The remaining
share of around 11% of LANXESS stock is owned by private investors, including our employees, who
hold around 1%. Since LANXESS was first listed on the stock exchange, most of our private investors
have been located in Germany.
In 2015, as in the past, many of our institutional investors were based in the United States, the United
Kingdom and Germany. The proportion of our stockholders in the United States increased further and at
January 31, 2016, was around 35% (2014: 31%). At the same date, some 17% (2014: 18%) of LANXESS
stock was held in the United Kingdom. Institutional investors from Germany represented about 15%
(2014: 14%) of our stock. Taking private and institutional investors together, ownership of our shares in
Germany increased slightly to around 26% (2014: 25%).
In other regions, LANXESS is represented in France, the Netherlands and Switzerland, in particular. The
proportion of institutional investors from the rest of Europe declined year on year to 12% (2014: 18%).
For other regions, on the other hand, the figure increased to around 10% (2014: 8%), due especially to
growing ownership of our stock by Asian investors.
An overview of the institutional investors which have issued mandatory notices reporting ownership of at
least 3% of LANXESS’s outstanding shares is published in the Investor Relations section of our website.

Analysts
We accord high priority to regular and extensive dialogue with analysts. In fiscal 2015, around 30 sell-side
analysts again issued reports detailing their estimates of our company’s current and future development.
Key themes were implementation of the realignment and – following announcement of our strategic alliance
with Saudi Aramco in the rubber business – the future direction of LANXESS. Alongside our dialogue
with the sell side, we maintained our close interaction with fixed-income analysts during the reporting year.
As of January 31, 2016, 36% of analysts (2014: 37%) recommended buying LANXESS stock. A further
48% (2014: 42%) said to hold our stock, while 16% (2014: 21%) gave a sell recommendation. In the
Investor Relations section of our website we publish consensus estimates compiled by an independent
service provider on the basis of current analyst evaluations.

Annual Stockholders’ Meeting
At our Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on May 13, 2015, 47,783,228 shares and the same number of
votes – equivalent to 52.21% of the voting capital – were represented. This was an improvement against
the prior year, when representation was already at a good level. LANXESS stockholders passed all the
agenda items. Detailed voting results and additional information about LANXESS’s Annual Stockholders’
Meeting are available in the Investor Relations section of our website.

Dividend
A dividend of

€0.60
has been proposed
for fiscal 2015.

LANXESS follows a consistent dividend policy. We aim for our stockholders to share in our business
performance in an appropriate and sustainable way. That remains the case in challenging fiscal years.
The Board of Management and Supervisory Board of LANXESS AG will therefore propose to the ­Annual
Stockholders’ Meeting on May 20, 2016, that a dividend of €0.60 per share be declared for fiscal 2015
(2014: €0.50 per share). The 20% increase in the dividend is a signal of the company’s increased
­profitability and financial solidity.
Relative to the price of €42.68 at which LANXESS shares ended 2015, this equates to a dividend yield
of 1.4%. Subject to approval of the corresponding resolution by the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting, the
dividend will be paid on May 23, 2016.

Ratings
LANXESS’s creditworthiness is regularly evaluated by the rating agencies Standard & Poor’s and
Moody’s Investors Service. It is our strategic corporate goal to retain an investment-grade rating in the
BBB range.
In September 2015, Standard & Poor’s confirmed LANXESS’s investment-grade rating at BBB– and
raised its outlook from stable to positive. The reason given by the rating agency for this improvement
was the company’s financial profile, which it considered to have been tangibly improved by the pending
cash inflow from the Saudi Aramco transaction. Our consistently conservative financing policy and
­improved operating performance in the course of the fiscal year additionally supported this assessment.
In July 2015, Moody’s confirmed LANXESS’s investment-grade rating of Baa3 with stable outlook. It
also took a positive view of our strategic partnership with Saudi Aramco in September 2015. Rating
agency Fitch, which latterly gave LANXESS a BBB– rating with stable outlook, discontinued its un­
solicited rating in March 2015.

Investor relations activities
Maintaining an active, broad and uninterrupted dialogue with investors and analysts is a top priority for
LANXESS. Our objective is to provide a continuous and sustained flow of information about our company.
Our activities remain focused on addressing equity-side investors. However, we also maintain a close
dialogue with fixed income investors and with institutional investors focused on sustainability.

The Chief Financial Officer and
the Investor Relations team
represented LANXESS at roadshows
and capital market conferences on

76

days.

We consider roadshows and conferences to be highly relevant because they give LANXESS man­
agement and Investor Relations the opportunity to engage in a broad and personal dialogue with institu­
tional investors. Key roadshow locations are international capital market centers such as Boston, New
York, London, Paris, Frankfurt and Zurich. Elsewhere in Europe, the Benelux and Scandinavian countries,
Italy and Spain have also become destinations for regular roadshows. Other regions where there is­
interest in our shares are Asia (Singapore and Japan) and North America. As far as conferences are
concerned, we focus on international cross-industry events organized by well-known banks. We also
participate at conferences specifically for mid caps or the chemical industry. In addition, we attend forums
for private investors in order to present our company’s business performance. In fiscal 2015, the Chairman
of the Board of Management, the Chief Financial Officer and the Investor Relations team represented
LANXESS at roadshows and capital market conferences on a total of 76 days (2014: 72).
However, we also use our own events to explain and discuss central issues for our company. For example,
our LANXESS Capital Markets Day on November 6, 2015, centered on our new strategic focus
following successful implementation of our realignment. All presentations from the Capital Markets Day
can be downloaded from the Investor Relations section of our website.
Conference calls are a further important means of providing capital market participants with timely
and extensive information updates. In these calls, the Board of Management comments on our published
results and reports on current measures being taken by LANXESS. Conference calls are streamed live
in the Investor Relations section of the LANXESS website, and recorded versions are available for
download for one year. Of course, here you will also find all key presentations, our financial publications
and information about our stock and bonds.
The high quality of our investor relations work again received external acknowledgment in 2015. For
­example, the sell-side analysts surveyed each year by U.S. magazine Institutional Investor ranked
LANXESS first among European chemical companies in the Best Investor Relations and Best IR Profes­
sional ­categories. LANXESS was also included in the Most Honored Companies list from among almost
1,300 companies named by survey participants.

Corporate Governance Report

Corporate Governance Report
The Board of Management and Supervisory Board of LANXESS are committed
to the principles of transparent and responsible corporate governance and control.
They place high value on the standards of good corporate governance with a
view to strengthening the trust of investors, customers, employees and the public
in LANXESS.
The Board of Management and Supervisory Board herein report on corporate governance at LANXESS
pursuant to Section 3.10 of the German Corporate Governance Code. The Board of Management also
issues its corporate governance statement pursuant to Section 289a of the German Commercial Code.

Implementation of the
German Corporate Governance Code
As LANXESS is a stock corporation listed on the German stock exchange, corporate governance at
the company is aligned with Germany’s securities and capital market legislation, regulations pertaining
to codetermination and the German Corporate Governance Code. The latter makes recommendations
and suggestions concerning corporate governance. There is no obligation to comply with this code.
However, pursuant to Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act, the Board of Management and
Supervisory Board of LANXESS are required to issue an annual declaration of compliance in line with the
recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, providing information about and stating
the reasons for any deviations from these recommendations. Shareholders can view the declaration of
compliance on the company’s website at any time. There they will also find the now invalid declarations
made in the previous five years.
On December 9, 2015, the Board of Management and Supervisory Board issued the following joint
declaration pursuant to Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act:
“I. Recommendations
Since the issuance of the last declaration of compliance on 10 December 2014, LANXESS AG has com­
plied with the recommendations of the Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance
Code (“Government Commission”) as amended on 24 June 2014, which was published on 30 September
2014 by the Federal Ministry of Justice in the official portion of the Federal Gazette with the exceptions
described in the declaration of 10 December 2014 in Sections 4.2.3, Paragraph 2, Sentence 6, 4.2.3,
Paragraph 2, Sentence 8, 5.1.2 Paragraph 2 Sentence 3, 5.4.1 Paragraph 2 Sentence 1 as well as the
meanwhile inapplicable exception in Section 4.2.3 Paragraph 4, Sentence 1. LANXESS AG has and will
henceforth comply with the recommendations of the Government Commission as amended on 5 May
2015, which was published on 12 June 2015, with the following exceptions:

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

Implementation of the German Corporate Governance Code

Section 4.2.3, Paragraph 2, Sentence 6
The amount of compensation shall be capped, both overall and for variable compensation components.
The current employment contracts for Board of Management members are besides the fixed compen­
sation capped regarding the variable compensation components and the fringe benefits. They do not
provide in addition a separate overall cap of the compensation also including a possible discretionary
bonus. However, the Supervisory Board will rightfully exercise its discretion regarding a discretionary
bonus as shown in the past.
Section 4.2.3, Paragraph 2, Sentence 8
Changing such performance targets or the comparison parameters retroactively shall be excluded.
When the Supervisory Board resolved in December 2014 the conditions of the variable salary component
Annual Performance Payment (APP) for the members of the Board of Management for fiscal year 2015 it
reserved the right to retroactively adapt the comparison parameters of the APP. In order to synchronize
the conditions with those applicable to the other management, the Supervisory Board exercised its right
of modification and agreed to adapt the relation of target achievement and potential payout of the APP
for the Board of Management in fiscal year 2015.
Section 5.1.2, Paragraph 2, Sentence 3
An age limit for the members of the Board of Management shall be specified.
The Supervisory Board does not consider an age limit to the members of the Board of Management as
appropriate. The ability to successfully manage a company does not necessarily cease when a specific
age is reached. It rather may be in the interest of the company to appoint a member of the Board of
Management beyond a defined age limit.
Section 5.4.1, Paragraph 2, Sentence 1
The Supervisory Board shall specify concrete objectives regarding its composition which, whilst
considering the specifics of the company, take into account the international activities of the company,
potential conflicts of interest, the number of independent Supervisory Board members within the meaning
of section 5.4.2, an age limit to be specified for the members of the Supervisory Board and a regular limit
of length of membership to be specified for the members of the Supervisory Board as well as diversity.
The Supervisory Board does not adhere to the rigid age limit for the Supervisory Board members. The
age of Supervisory Board members is not a criterion for their qualification and competence. The company
does not want to waive longtime experiences. Moreover, the company would restrict itself regarding the
appointment of adequate members to the Supervisory Board.

Corporate Governance Report

II. Suggestions
In addition to its recommendations, the Corporate Governance Code also contains a number of sugges­
tions for efficient, responsible corporate governance compliance which is not required to be disclosed
under the statutory provisions. LANXESS currently complies with these suggestions as well, with only
a few exceptions.
In accordance with Section 3.10 Sentence 2 of the German Corporate Governance Code, the Board of
Management and the Supervisory Board therefore voluntarily issue the following declaration:
Since the issuance of the last declaration of compliance on 10 December 2014, LANXESS AG has com­
plied with the suggestions of the Government Commission as amended on 24 June 2014, which was
published on 30 September 2014 by the Federal Ministry of Justice in the official portion of the Federal
Gazette, with the following exceptions and will continue to comply the suggestions of the Government
Commission as amended on 5 May 2015, which was published on 12 June 2015, with the following
exceptions:
Section 2.3.2, Sentence 2, 2nd Half-Sentence
The Management Board shall arrange for the appointment of a representative to exercise shareholders’
voting rights in accordance with instructions; this representative should also be reachable during the
General Meeting.
The representatives appointed by LANXESS AG to exercise stockholders’ voting rights in accordance
with instructions can be reached at the Stockholders’ Meeting until the voting is held. Stockholders not
attending the meeting can reach the representatives up to the previous evening.
Section 2.3.3
The company should make it possible for stockholders to follow the General Meeting using modern
communication media (e. g. Internet).
The speech by the Chairman of the Board of Management to the Stockholders’ Meeting is broadcast on
the Internet. Continued broadcasting of the proceedings thereafter, particularly of contributions made by
stockholders, could be seen as a violation of the stockholders’ rights to privacy. For this reason, LANXESS
does not plan to broadcast the further proceedings.”

Other key principles of the management practices applied by LANXESS

Other key principles of the management
practices applied by LANXESS
Prominent among the other relevant management practices applied throughout the company are the
principles of business conduct. LANXESS views compliance with laws and ethical principles as the basis
of sustainable corporate governance. Our employees’ integrity and awareness of their responsibilities
are key factors in the success of our company. Compliance with laws, social responsibility, sustainable
environmental protection, and occupational, plant and product safety are an essential part of our corpo­
rate culture. The “Code for integrity and compliance at LANXESS,” which is applicable throughout the
Group, specifies minimum standards and gives our employees advice and guidance on complying with
these standards. This code can be viewed on our website at http://www.lanxess.com under Corporate
Responsibility/Corporate Governance/Compliance.
An effective compliance management system, which is regularly examined, has been established to imple­
ment the compliance code. This system was globally audited in 2012 by Deloitte & Touche GmbH, which
applied the AuS 980 standard promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW – Institute of Public
Auditors in Germany). The system was rated favorably, and there were no objections. Components of this
system include a compliance organization that is integrated into the overall LANXESS Group organization,
risk identification and assessment, a compliance program (comprising directives, hotlines, training, know­
ledge sharing, compliance reporting and guidance on responding to observed breaches of compliance),
and measures for monitoring the overall compliance situation within the LANXESS Group. The objective
is to prevent breaches of compliance and to create and foster a culture of compliance. LANXESS does
not tolerate breaches of compliance and enforces observance of the provisions of its compliance code.
As an international specialty chemicals enterprise, LANXESS bears a large degree of responsibility toward
people and the environment. Our entrepreneurial activities reflect this sense of responsibility. Safety, en­
vironmental protection, social responsibility, quality and economic efficiency are all key corporate goals
at LANXESS. The company’s objective is sustainable, forward-looking development which meets the
demands of economics, ecology and society in equal measure. The greatest benefits of our corporate
responsibility activities are achieved if they are balanced with entrepreneurial and, especially, economic
objectives. They must therefore be linked to our core business or to our available expertise. An overview
of the implementation of corporate responsibility at LANXESS can be downloaded from the Corporate
Responsibility section of our website at http://www.lanxess.com/. Additionally, LANXESS joined the
United Nations Global Compact initiative in July 2011 and has supported the Responsible Care® Global
Charter adopted by the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA) since 2006, a commitment
the company reconfirmed by signature in August 2014.
LANXESS has supplemented German legislation prohibiting insider trading with a Group-wide insider
directive. This defines rules of conduct for trading in the company’s securities so that insider trading vio­
lations can be avoided. The names of persons with authorized access to insider information required for
the performance of their professional duties are included in an insider register that is regularly updated.
The directive also stipulates the reporting and disclosure obligations for transactions with LANXESS
shares (directors’ dealings).
Corporate policies on other important issues, such as occupational safety and diversity, are implemented
throughout the Group on the basis of Board of Management initiatives. With its Diversity & Inclusion
initiative, LANXESS aims to promote equal opportunity for employees and facilitate work/life balance.

Corporate Governance Report

Composition and work of the Board of Management
and of the Supervisory Board and its committees
LANXESS AG is a company established under the laws of Germany. One of the fundamental principles
of German stock corporation law is the two-tier management system with the governing bodies of
manage­ment board and supervisory board. This system is characterized by a clear separation between
the management board as the body that manages a company and the supervisory board as the body that
advises and oversees management. Concurrent membership on both boards is strictly prohibited. The
management board and the supervisory board work closely together in a relationship of mutual trust for
the benefit of the company.

Board of Management
The Board of Management of LANXESS AG currently comprises four members: Matthias Zachert
­(Chairman), Dr. Hubert Fink, Michael Pontzen and Dr. Rainier van Roessel. Information about the ­members
of the Board of Management is available on our website at http://www.lanxess.com/ under Investor
Relations/Corporate Governance/Board of Management.
The Board of Management is appointed to manage and represent the company. It is responsible for
­conducting business in the company’s interests with the goal of creating sustainable value. The ­principal
tasks of the Board of Management include defining the company’s goals and strategic alignment, managing
and overseeing the operating units, setting human resources policy, arranging the company’s financing,
and establishing an effective risk management system. It is also responsible for preparing the quarterly and
half-year financial statements, the financial statements of LANXESS AG, the consolidated financial state­
ments of the LANXESS Group and the management report for LANXESS AG and the LANXESS Group.
The Chairman coordinates the work of the Board of Management. As a rule, Board of Management decisions
are adopted with a simple majority. In the event of a tie, the Chairman has the casting vote. Resolutions of
the Board of Management are generally passed at regularly held meetings. The rules of procedure for the
Board of Management that are enacted by the Supervisory Board contain further regulations concerning
the form of cooperation within the Board of Management, the allocation of duties and the matters requiring
resolution by the full Board of Management. In deciding the composition of the Board of Management,
the Supervisory Board gives consideration to professional suitability, leadership qualities and diversity.
By way of implementing the law on the equal representation of women and men in management positions
in the private and public sectors, which came into force on May 1, 2015, the Supervisory Board resolved
to maintain the status quo with a target for the proportion of women on the Board of Management of
LANXESS AG of 0% through June 30, 2017, in light of the fact that the appointments and service
­contracts of the members of the Board of Management serving at the time the resolution was taken are
valid beyond June 30, 2017. In the future, however, the Supervisory Board will seek to appoint women with
the appropriate professional qualifications and personal skills as members of the Board of Management.

Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board of LANXESS AG is composed of twelve members, with equal numbers of stock­
holder representatives and employee representatives, in accordance with the provisions of the German
Codetermination Act of 1976. The stockholder representatives are elected by the Annual Stockholders’
Meeting, whereas the employee representatives are elected in accordance with the provisions of the
Codetermination Act and its electoral regulations. Supervisory Board members normally serve for a
five-year term.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

Composition and work of the Board of Management and of the Supervisory Board and its committees

Gisela Seidel, Manuela Strauch, Werner Czaplik, Dr. Hans-Dieter Gerriets, Thomas Meiers and Ralf Sikorski
serve as the employee representatives on the Supervisory Board. Claudia Nemat, Dr. Friedrich Janssen,
Lawrence A. Rosen, Dr. Rolf Stomberg, Theo H. Walthie and Dr. Matthias L. Wolfgruber serve as the
stockholder representatives. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board is Dr. Rolf Stomberg. The Vice
Chairwoman is Gisela Seidel. Information about the members of the Supervisory Board is available on our
website at http://www.lanxess.com/ under Investor Relations/Corporate Governance/Supervisory Board.
The Supervisory Board’s role is to advise the Board of Management in its management of the company
and to monitor its conduct of the business. The Supervisory Board discusses business performance,
planning and strategy at regular intervals. Its responsibilities also include appointing the members of the
Board of Management as well as reviewing the financial statements of LANXESS AG and the consoli­
dated financial statements of the LANXESS Group. The Supervisory Board reaches its decisions with a
majority of the votes cast unless a different majority is stipulated by law. In the event of a tie, the Chair­
man of the Supervisory Board has two votes in a second ballot on the resolution, even if this also results
in a tie. The German Codetermination Act contains special requirements concerning resolutions. The
Chairman of the Supervisory Board coordinates the work in the Supervisory Board, chairs its meetings
and represents the concerns of the body externally. Supervisory Board resolutions are usually adopted
at regularly held meetings.
The Supervisory Board has issued its own rules of procedure, which, in addition to defining the tasks and
responsibilities of the Supervisory Board and the personal qualifications of its members, establishes the
processes for convening, preparing and chairing meetings as well as the procedures for voting.
The Board of Management reports to the Supervisory Board on a timely and comprehensive basis about
the progress of business and the situation of the Group, including potential risks and relevant issues relating
to corporate planning. The Supervisory Board has laid down the Board of Management’s notification and
reporting requirements in detail in its rules of procedure. The Chairman of the Board of Management
regularly exchanges information with the Chairman of the Supervisory Board in order to discuss matters
of strategy, planning, business performance, risks, risk management and compliance. Certain transactions
and measures of major or long-term importance require the Supervisory Board’s approval. Measures
requiring approval include, but are not limited to: adoption of the corporate planning; the acquisition, sale
or encumbrance of real property, shareholdings or other assets; borrowings and certain other types of
financial transactions. Thresholds have been set for some of these transactions.

Goals for the composition of the Supervisory Board
Section 5.4.1 of the German Corporate Governance Code states that the concrete objectives of the
Supervisory Board regarding its composition and the status of the implementation of these objectives
are to be published in the Corporate Governance Report.
The members of the Supervisory Board of LANXESS AG are expected to possess the necessary exper­
tise, skills and professional experience to perform their duties. The members of the Supervisory Board
autonomously undertake the necessary training required for their tasks and are supported in their efforts
by the company. In making nominations, the Supervisory Board applies only legally permissible and fair
selection criteria, acts in the company’s best interests, and gives consideration to the nominated candi­
dates’ integrity, commitment and independence.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

Corporate Governance Report

The Supervisory Board of LANXESS AG should ensure the provision of impartial advice and supervision
­­
to the Board of Management. All current stockholder representatives on the Supervisory Board are
independent. The Supervisory Board also assumes the independence of the employee representatives
on the Supervisory Board and that their ability to act independently is not affected by their status as
employees of the company or members of labor unions. No member of the Supervisory Board has a
personal or business relationship with the company, its executive bodies, a controlling shareholder or any
enterprise affiliated with a controlling shareholder that may cause a material and not merely temporary
conflict of interest. No former member of the Board of Management of LANXESS AG is a member of the
Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board also aims for all future members of the Supervisory Board to
be independent within the meaning of Section 5.4.2 of the German Corporate Governance Code and
free of conflicts of interest.
The Supervisory Board does not consider it appropriate to apply a rigid age limit for its members as it
does not view age alone as a measure of their qualification and competence. The company should not
have to forgo extensive experience. This takes into account the maximum length of membership of the
Supervisory Board of generally not more than three full terms of office (15 years) that has been specified
by the Supervisory Board.
In general, the Supervisory Board should be guided by the principles of diversity in its composition. On
the basis of their various personal and professional backgrounds, the members of the Supervisory Board
contribute a broad spectrum of experience and skills. The global reach of LANXESS AG has been reflected
in the composition of the Supervisory Board thus far and will remain a factor in selecting candidates to
be proposed to the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting for election to the Supervisory Board. In many cases,
the experience and skills of the members of the Supervisory Board have been acquired while working
abroad for a long period or in an international field. Two members of the Supervisory Board are not
German citizens. The members of the Supervisory Board have professional knowledge of the chemical
industry and other sectors that are important for the company’s business.
Diversity applies equally to gender. In accordance with the law on the equal representation of women
and men in management positions in the private and public sectors, codetermined stock corporations
like LANXESS AG are required to appoint at least 30% women and 30% men when refilling Supervisory
Board positions that become vacant from January 1, 2016. Existing appointments – including those of
substitute members – can run until they end regularly. Three of the twelve members currently serving on
the LANXESS AG Supervisory Board are women, which is a proportion of 25%. Future new appointments
must be made in accordance with the legal stipulations.

Composition and work of the Supervisory Board committees
The Supervisory Board has a Presidial Committee, an Audit Committee, a Committee pursuant to
­Section 27, Paragraph 3 of the German Codetermination Act and a Nominations Committee formed
from among its members.
The Presidial Committee discusses key issues and prepares the meetings and resolutions of the
­Supervisory Board. It makes decisions on transactions requiring approval that are already included in the
company’s annual planning. The Presidial Committee may also resolve on the exercise of participation
rights pursuant to Section 32 of the German Codetermination Act and on transactions requiring approval
that cannot be deferred. It consults regularly about long-term succession planning for the Board of Manage­
ment. Furthermore, the Committee also prepares the personnel decisions to be made by the Supervisory
Board and resolutions of the full Supervisory Board regarding the compensation of the members of the
Board of Management. In place of the full Supervisory Board, the Presidial Committee resolves on the

conclusion and amendment of employment contracts with the members of the Board of Management and
all other contractual matters not pertaining to compensation. The members of the Presidial ­Committee
are Dr. Stomberg (Chairman), Ms. Seidel, Ms. Strauch, Mr. Sikorski, Mr. Walthie and Dr. Wolfgruber.
The Audit Committee supports the Supervisory Board in overseeing the conduct of the business and
deals with matters relating to the supervision of accounting, the effectiveness of the internal control
system, the risk management system and the internal auditing system, as well as auditing, including
the independence of the auditor and the work additionally performed by the auditor, and compliance. It
­prepares the Supervisory Board’s resolutions concerning the annual financial statements of LANXESS AG
and the consolidated financial statements of the LANXESS Group and recommends an auditor whom the
Supervisory Board then proposes to the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting for appointment. The members
of the Audit Committee are Dr. Janssen (Chairman), Ms. Nemat, Mr. Czaplik, Dr. Gerriets, Mr. Meiers and
Mr. Rosen. Dr. Janssen, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, is an independent financial expert and has
specialist knowledge and experience in the field of accounting acquired through his professional activities.
The Committee pursuant to Section 27, Paragraph 3 of the German Codetermination Act
­performs the tasks described in Section 31, Paragraph 3 of the German Codetermination Act. The
members of this committee are Dr. Stomberg (Chairman), Ms. Seidel, Mr. Meiers and Dr. Wolfgruber.
The Nominations Committee solely comprises stockholder representatives and proposes candi­
dates for the Supervisory Board to nominate for election as new members of the Supervisory Board
by the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting. The members of this committee are Dr. Stomberg (Chairman),­
Mr. Rosen and Dr. Wolfgruber.
Other Supervisory Board committees established for a particular purpose perform the duties assigned
to them by Supervisory Board resolution.
The respective committee chairmen report regularly to the Supervisory Board on the work of the committees.

Stockholders and stockholders’ meetings
The stockholders of LANXESS AG exercise their rights at the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting, where
they can vote on the resolutions submitted. The Annual Stockholders’ Meeting resolves on all matters
reserved for its decision by law, with binding effect on the stockholders and the company. Each share
confers one vote.
The items resolved on by the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting include appropriation of the balance sheet
profit, ratification of the actions taken by the members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory
Board, appointment of the auditors and election of the stockholder representatives to the Supervisory
Board. The Annual Stockholders’ Meeting also resolves on amendments to the articles of association,
measures affecting the company’s capital and the approval of intercompany agreements. Each year
there is an Annual Stockholders’ Meeting at which the Board of Management and Supervisory Board
give an account of the last fiscal year. The German Stock Corporation Act requires the convening of an
Extraordinary Stockholders’ Meeting in certain situations.
All stockholders who register in time and prove their eligibility to attend the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting
and exercise their voting rights shall be allowed to participate in the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting. Stock­
holders may exercise their voting rights at the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting in person, through a proxy
of their own choosing or through a company-nominated proxy who acts according to their instructions.

Compensation report
The compensation report, which describes the compensation system and the amount of compensation
paid to the members of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board for their service in fiscal 2015,
is part of the combined management report for LANXESS AG and the LANXESS Group.

Risk management
Corporate governance also includes the responsible handling of business risks. Therefore, a systematic
and effective risk management system is the basis for professional corporate governance. Our risk
­management system aims to identify risks and opportunities at an early stage and to steer and minimize
the risks that materialize. It is subject to ongoing optimization and adaptation to changing conditions. The
Board of Management informs the Supervisory Board about the existence and development of potential
risks on a regular basis. The Audit Committee regularly reviews the effectiveness of the risk management,
internal control and auditing systems.

Liability insurance
The company maintains a directors’ and officers’ (D&O) liability insurance policy for members of the Board
of Management and Supervisory Board. The suitable deductible required by Section 93, Paragraph 2
of the German Stock Corporation Act has been agreed for members of the Board of Management, and
the recommended deductible within the meaning of Section 3.8 of the German Corporate Governance
Code has been agreed for the members of the Supervisory Board.

Reportable securities transactions
Pursuant to Section 15a, Paragraph 1 of the German Securities Trading Act (WpHG), the trading of
securities by certain parties, including members of a management board or supervisory board, must be
reported if the total sum of the transactions undertaken in any given calendar year equals or exceeds
€5,000. Individuals who are closely related to these parties (e.g. spouses, registered partners and
first-degree relatives) are also subject to this reporting requirement. Reportable securities transactions
are published on the LANXESS website.
The total number of shares of LANXESS AG held by members of the Board of Management and Super­
visory Board as of December 31, 2015 was less than 1% of all shares issued by the company.

Accounting and auditing
LANXESS AG prepares its consolidated financial statements and interim financial statements in accor­
dance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the European Union.
The separate financial statements of LANXESS AG for any given fiscal year (“financial statements”) are
prepared in accordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB). The financial statements, consolidated
financial statements and combined management report are published, once adopted and approved by the
Supervisory Board, within 90 days of the end of the fiscal year. The company’s accounting for the 2015
fiscal year was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers Aktiengesellschaft Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft

Report of the Supervisory Board
Dear Stockholders,
Behind LANXESS lies another challenging year. The company took on and successfully mastered the
challenges it faced.
With an EBITDA pre exceptionals of €885 million, we were able to substantially improve the company’s
earning power – despite the persistently difficult competitive environment for the rubber business. All
three segments contributed to this result. The Board of Management of LANXESS, with the support of
the Supervisory Board, systematically implemented the extensive realignment program initiated in the
previous fiscal year. We have improved our administrative structures, initiated optimization measures in
production operations and found a strategic partner for our rubber business: Saudi Aramco. We are on
schedule with the implementation of the joint venture named ARLANXEO and, working together with
our strong partner, will soon be able to drive our rubber business forward.
Fiscal 2016 will continue to be shaped by the challenges in the synthetic rubber business. However, with
the approval of the Supervisory Board, the Board of Management has set the course for new growth in
our Advanced Intermediates and Performance Chemicals segments and in the High Performance Mate­
rials business unit. Alongside the integration of the joint venture and ongoing stabilization of our financial
position, growth should again become the focus for LANXESS.
During 2015, the Supervisory Board duly and fully performed the tasks and duties incumbent upon it
under the law, the articles of association and the rules of procedure for the Supervisory Board. It advised
the Board of Management regularly on the management of the company and monitored its work. In par­
ticular, it dealt with matters relating to the company’s realignment, its strategic development, the various
options for the rubber business and measures to increase competitiveness.

Report of the Supervisory Board

The Supervisory Board was directly involved in all decisions of fundamental importance for the company.
The Board of Management informed us regularly in written and oral reports about business performance,
the situation of the Group, including the risk situation, strategic development and current issues. On the
basis of these reports, we discussed significant business transactions in detail. We thoroughly examined
the reports and the resolutions proposed by the Board of Management and discussed them at length
in meetings of the full Supervisory Board and its committees. If the law, articles of association or other
provisions required the Supervisory Board to approve the actions of the Board of Management, we dis­
cussed these actions and adopted resolutions on them.
The Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management were in regular contact outside
of the Supervisory Board’s meetings. We regularly discussed the present state of the company, matters
of strategy, planning, business performance, risks, risk management, management development, com­
pliance and material events.

Principal topics discussed by the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board met a total of eight times in 2015.
We regularly discussed the sales and earnings performance of the company and its segments, as well as
the financial position. Additionally, the Board of Management kept us updated about the overall state of
the economy, the situation in the chemical industry, the performance of LANXESS stock, and investment
and acquisition plans. Other important issues addressed by the Supervisory Board are presented below.
The focus of the Supervisory Board meeting held on March 17, 2015, was the review of the annual
financial statements and consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2014 and the proposal for use of
the distributable profit. The Supervisory Board also discussed and passed motions for resolution by the
Annual Stockholders’ Meeting and reviewed corporate governance matters. An important topic at this
meeting was the discussion of personnel matters pertaining to the Board of Management. The Super­
visory Board approved the mutually agreed termination of the appointment of Dr. Bernhard Düttmann as a
member of the Board of Management effective March 31, 2015, and the severance agreement in respect
of his service contract. Effective April 1, 2015, Michael Pontzen was appointed as a member of the Board
of Management. At the same time, responsibilities were reassigned within the Board of Management.
Furthermore, the Supervisory Board defined the variable compensation components for the members
of the Board of Management on the basis of target attainment in fiscal 2014.
At the meeting held on May 6, 2015, we discussed with the Board of Management the impact on e­ nergy
costs at LANXESS that will result from Germany’s Renewable Energy Act and the emissions trading
system. The Board of Management made a full report on environmental protection and occupational and
plant safety, which was subsequently discussed by the full Supervisory Board.
The meeting that took place immediately prior to the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on May 13, 2015,
served to prepare that meeting. Following the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting, a constituent meeting of
the Supervisory Board took place with the stockholder representatives newly elected by the Annual
Stockholders’ Meeting and the employee representatives who had already been elected by the LANXESS
workforce in April. Dr. Rolf Stomberg was re-elected Chairman of the Supervisory Board. Ms. Gisela Seidel
was appointed Vice Chairwoman. In addition, new committee members were elected.
At the meeting on August 5, 2015, the Board of Management reported in detail on the status of various
options for the rubber business and on the planned legal separation of the organizational units affected.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

105

We also discussed with the Board of Management the factors relevant to calculating the provisions for
pensions in Germany. Moreover, we resolved the awarding of the audit contract for the consolidated
financial statements for fiscal 2015. The Board of Management explained the implementation of the
new law on equal representation of women and men in management positions in the private and public
sectors. In light of the fact that the appointments and service contracts of the members of the Board of
Management serving at the time the resolution was taken are valid beyond June 30, 2017, the Super­
visory Board resolved to maintain the status quo with a target for the proportion of women on the Board
of Management of LANXESS AG of 0% through June 30, 2017.
At an extraordinary meeting on September 22, 2015, the Supervisory Board reviewed the advanced
status of negotiations with potential partners for the rubber business. The offers were subsequently
assessed in terms of the opportunities and risks they presented. In conclusion, we decided to approve
the proposal of the Board of Management for a joint venture with Saudi Aramco in which each partner
would hold 50% and to which LANXESS would contribute its entire rubber business. With a view to the
company’s realignment, the Supervisory Board also decided to fill the vacant position for a second oper­
ational member of the Board of Management. Effective October 1, 2015, Dr. Hubert Fink was appointed
as a member of the Board of Management. At the same time, a change to the assignment of Board of
Management responsibilities was also decided.
At the meeting on November 4, 2015, the Board of Management reported on decisions taken in
respect of capital expenditures in the Saltigo business unit, which we discussed at length. We were also
informed about the status of the closure of the Marl site and other measures aimed at strengthening the
competitiveness of the rubber business. Additionally, the Board of Management described the ­company’s
financial position and financial policy. We approved the creation of a new financing framework for
­concluding further finance agreements with a total value of €1 billion. Lastly, the Board of Management
explained the company’s internal control, risk management and auditing systems.
At its meeting on December 9, 2015, the Supervisory Board reviewed in full and approved the ­corporate
planning for 2016 proposed by the Board of Management. It also discussed the company’s ­strategic
alignment and capital expenditure policy. As in previous years, current developments in corporate
­governance were a topic on the agenda of the December meeting. After reviewing compliance with the
­recommendations and suggestions of the Corporate Governance Code, we resolved to issue a declaration
of compliance. We also specified a regular limit of three full terms of office (15 years) for the length of
membership of the members of the Supervisory Board and agreed changes to the rules of procedure of the
Supervisory Board. In order to synchronize the conditions with those applicable to the other manage­ment
levels, the Supervisory Board agreed to adapt the relation between target achievement and p
­ otential payout
of the Annual Performance Payment (APP) – a variable compensation component – for the ­members of
the Board of Management for fiscal 2015. Lastly, the Supervisory Board defined the conditions for the
Board of Management’s variable compensation components for fiscal 2016.
All members of the Supervisory Board and its committees performed their duties diligently and conscien­
tiously. The German Corporate Governance Code recommends that this report should contain a remark
if any member of the Supervisory Board attends only half or fewer of the meetings of the full Supervisory
Board and of the committees of which he or she is a member. Until he left the Supervisory Board on
conclusion of the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on May 13, 2015, Robert J. Koehler had attended fewer
than half of the meetings of the full Supervisory Board and of the Presidial Committee on account of ill
health. The stockholder representatives and employee representatives to the Supervisory Board worked
together in a spirit of trust. They regularly held separate meetings at which they prepared the meetings of
the full Supervisory Board. The members of the Board of Management attended the Supervisory Board
meetings unless the Chairman of the Supervisory Board determined otherwise.

Report of the Supervisory Board

Work of the committees
The Supervisory Board has four committees: the Audit Committee, the Presidial Committee, the Nomi­
nations Committee and the Committee formed pursuant to Section 27, Paragraph 3 of the German Co­
determination Act. The committees are tasked with preparing the topics and resolutions to be discussed
at meetings of the full Supervisory Board. They also, at times, exercise decision-making powers conferred
on them by the Supervisory Board.
The Audit Committee met four times during the year. It dealt in particular with the annual financial state­
ments of LANXESS AG for fiscal 2014, the consolidated financial statements and combined management
report for fiscal 2013, the interim reports issued during fiscal 2015, and the condensed consolidated
financial statements and interim management report included in the 2015 half-year financial report. It also
reviewed the company’s risk management and internal control systems. Other topics discussed were the
significant findings by the internal audit department, corporate planning, compliance, the development of
pension provisions and the determination of the principal areas of focus for the audit of the 2015 financial
statements. The external auditor attended two of the Audit Committee’s four meetings and reported on
the auditing activities.
The Presidial Committee convened six times during 2015 to prepare the meetings of the ­Supervisory
Board and the decisions to be reached by the full Supervisory Board concerning human resources
­measures in the company’s Board of Management.
The Nominations Committee and the Committee formed pursuant to Section 27, paragraph 3
of the German Codetermination Act did not convene in 2015.
The chairmen of the committees each reported on the meetings and the work of the committees at the
meetings of the full Supervisory Board.

Corporate governance and declaration of compliance
In the year under review, the Supervisory Board discussed the German Corporate Governance Code (the
Code). The joint declaration of compliance made on December 9, 2015, by the Board of Management
and Supervisory Board pursuant to Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act can be viewed
by stockholders at any time on the company’s website. As expressed in the declaration, LANXESS AG
complies with the Code’s recommendations and suggestions except in a few justified cases. No conflicts
of interest on the part of Supervisory Board members became known last year. Further information about
corporate governance can be found in the Corporate Governance Report and in the Board of Manage­
ment’s declaration pursuant to Section 289a of the German Commercial Code.

Financial statements of LANXESS AG and
consolidated financial statements of the LANXESS Group
The Board of Management of LANXESS AG prepared the financial statements for the 2015 fiscal year
in accordance with the rules of the German Commercial Code, the consolidated financial statements for
fiscal 2015 in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the combined
management report for 2015. These were all audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers Aktiengesellschaft
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, the auditor appointed by the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting and engaged
by the Supervisory Board. The auditor issued an unqualified opinion in each case.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

107

The Supervisory Board convinced itself of the independence of the auditor and the persons acting on
the auditor’s behalf.
The audit reports and the documents relating to the financial statements were discussed at length with
the Board of Management and the auditor at the Audit Committee meeting held on March 14, 2016.
They were also discussed in detail on the basis of the required documents and notes at the Supervisory
Board’s financial statements meeting held on March 15, 2016. The responsible auditor was present for
the discussions concerning the financial statements of LANXESS AG and the consolidated financial state­
ments of the LANXESS Group. He reported on the material results of the audits. He was also available
to the Audit Committee and full Supervisory Board to provide additional information.
Based on the recommendation of the Audit Committee as well as on its own review and in-depth discussions
about the financial statements of LANXESS AG, the consolidated financial statements of the LANXESS
Group, the combined management report and the proposal for appropriation of the profit, the Supervisory
Board endorsed the auditor’s conclusions and had no objections to raise. The Supervisory Board has
approved the annual financial statements of LANXESS AG and the consolidated financial statements
of the LANXESS Group, which were prepared by the Board of Management. The Supervisory Board
endorsed the Board of Management’s proposal for use of the distributable profit after close examination
and extensive deliberations that carefully weighed the best interests of the company and the stockholders.

Composition of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board was newly constituted in fiscal 2015. With the conclusion of the 2015 Annual
Stockholders’ Meeting, the terms of office of all employee representatives and of five of the six stockholder
representatives routinely ended.
The following employee representatives were elected in April 2015 by delegates elected by the work­
force: Gisela Seidel, Werner Czaplik, Dr. Hans-Dieter Gerriets, Thomas Meiers, Hans-Jürgen Schicker
and Ralf Sikorski. Axel Berndt and Ulrich Freese are no longer members of the Supervisory Board. On
June 30, 2015, Mr. Schicker resigned as a representative of the LANXESS workforce. He was succeeded
as a member of the Supervisory Board by Manuela Strauch, who was his elected substitute member.
At the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting of LANXESS AG on May 13, 2015, Dr. Friedrich Janssen,
­Lawrence A. Rosen, Dr. Rolf Stomberg, Theo H. Walthie and Dr. Matthias L. Wolfgruber were elected
as the stockholder representatives on the company’s Supervisory Board. Robert J. Koehler and Rainer
Laufs resigned from the Supervisory Board. Mr. Koehler passed away in May 2015 after a serious illness.
The Supervisory Board greatly valued Mr. Koehler’s commitment and input and will continue to hold his
memory in high esteem.
The Supervisory Board thanks the Board of Management, all of the Group’s employees and the employee
representatives for their enormous dedication and work.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

For additional information, please also see the Corporate Governance Report.

Business
Business organization
As part of the “Let’s LANXESS again” realignment program,
LANXESS has agreed with Aramco Overseas Company B.V.,
The Hague, Netherlands, a subsidiary of Saudi Aramco, to form
a ­s trategic alliance for the synthetic rubber business named
­ARLANXEO, in which each party will hold a 50% interest. Saudi
Aramco is expected to pay LANXESS around €1.2 billion for its
share after deduction of debt and other financial liabilities. The
transaction has been approved by all relevant antitrust authorities
and financial completion is expected on April 1, 2016. It is planned
that the business concerned will continue to be included in the
consolidated financial statements of the LANXESS Group and will
be fully consolidated in the first three years.
As part of our realignment, we combined some of our business units
effective January 1, 2015. The LANXESS Group is still structured in
three segments, which comprise a total of 10 business units, each of
which conducts its own operations and has global profit responsibility.
The Butyl Rubber and Performance Butadiene Rubbers business units
were merged to form the Tire & Specialty Rubbers business unit. This
decision was based on overlapping customer structures, regional
commonalities in the established markets and changed conditions
in the emerging economies. Furthermore, LANXESS consolidated
the High Performance Elastomers and Keltan Elastomers business
units in the High Performance Elastomers business unit. Here, too,
there were substantial overlaps in customer structures. The specialty
chemicals product line of the Rubber Chemicals business unit, the
Functional Chemicals business unit and the Rhein Chemie business
unit now make up the new Rhein Chemie Additives business unit.
By consolidating our additives business operations, we are seeking
access to new markets and customers. Effective January 1, 2015, the

113

Group structure
Business

antioxidants and accelerators product lines of the Rubber C
­ hemicals
business unit were integrated into the portfolio of the Advanced
Industrial Intermediates business unit. To improve comparability, the
prior-year figures have been restated wherever necessary.
Group functions support our business units by providing financial,
legal, technical and other centralized services. Complementing this
global alignment of the business units and group functions, the
­country organizations ensure the necessary proximity to markets
and provide the organizational infrastructure required.
In the Asia-Pacific region, the new plants for our Tire & Specialty
Rubbers and High Performance Elastomers business units came on
stream during the reporting period. Further information on this can be
found in the “Financial condition and capital expenditures” section.

The business activities that LANXESS combines in its Advanced
Intermediates segment make it one of the world’s leading suppliers
of industrial chemical intermediates and a key player in the custom
synthesis and manufacturing of chemical precursors and specialty
active ingredients.

In connection with the optimization of the plant networks for ­rubber
products, LANXESS intends to discontinue production of ethylene
propylene diene monomer (EPDM) rubber at the site in Marl,
­Germany, at the end of the first quarter of 2016. Within LANXESS’s
EPDM rubber production network, the Marl facility is no longer
­competitive due to its relatively small capacity and comparatively
high energy and raw material costs.

Strategy
The LANXESS Group is a globally operating chemicals enterprise
that is characterized particularly by flexible asset structures, a
­diversified customer base, a worldwide presence and an entrepreneurial management structure. The company’s portfolio ranges
from polymers to industrial, specialty and fine chemicals.
Although the chemical industry achieves growth rates worldwide
that are in part much higher than the overall growth of the global
economy, European chemical companies in particular will find it
increasingly difficult to benefit from this generally positive situation
in the medium term. The reason for this is to be found in profound
change processes which have impacted market structures and
mechanisms – some of which have been in place for decades – and
which will continue to shape the industry’s operating environment
over the coming years:

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

The commissioning of major new plants for the production
of synthetic rubbers in recent years has created ­considerable
overcapacities in this market, which has exacerbated the
­existing pressure on prices worldwide.
nn In the price-sensitive synthetic rubber business, p
­ roducers
in the emerging economies, the Middle East and the ­United
­States, for example, mostly have better access to low-­priced
raw materials and energy, thus benefiting from cost ­advantages
which European suppliers can barely compensate with
­efficiency gains.
nn The ongoing expansion of local production capacities in the
global growth regions, especially Asia, means the progressive
decline of export opportunities for European suppliers. In
addition, the United States and the Middle East are transitioning
from importers to exporters in the commodity segment in
­particular, bringing inexpensive products to the world’s markets.
nn According to estimates from market research company IHS,
China is likely to account for around 40% of global chemicals
demand in 2030. A significant proportion of this demand will
nn

115

Strategy

probably be met domestically. Suppliers wishing to ­participate
in this growth will have to build not just individual plants but
entire value chains in the country.
nn In view of the enormous scientific advances being made
and the high cost of registering new substances, there are
now fewer opportunities for bringing commercially viable
new c­ hemical compounds to market. For the broad ­majority
of chemical companies, innovation in the future will mean
­accessing new fields of application for existing products
and making production processes as safe and efficient as
possible.
nn With growing environmental awareness, sustainable ­production
standards worldwide will converge at a high level. In the
­medium term, this development will offer a further ­opportunity
for consolidation, because, in the growth markets in ­particular,
not all competitors will make the necessary capital investments to upgrade their plants to meet regulatory requirements. However, in the long term, producers that have always
applied high standards will lose this distinguishing feature.
We, like others, face the challenge of reacting to these change
processes. Our measures can be condensed into six ­strategic
­a pproaches, which are reflected in the three-phase global
­realignment program we initiated in 2014 and in the areas of activity
for strategic optimization of the Group defined in 2015:
1. Raw materials: reduce dependency on volatile raw materials
such as ethylene and butadiene
2. Costs: process and cost optimization as an ongoing
business requirement
3. Value chains: further expansion of our integrated value chains
4. Growth: sustained growth in China, North America and
­Southeast Asia
5. Plants: strengthen the competitiveness of our existing
­networked sites
6. Markets: increase focus on profitable mid-sized markets

Three-phase realignment program is being
systematically implemented
We already succeeded in fully realizing the annual cost savings
of around €150 million resulting from our new and more efficient
organizational structure and from extensive optimization measures
in our business units and group functions in the reporting year.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

As a result of our manufacturing excellence initiative, we intend
to discontinue the manufacture of EPDM rubber at the Marl site
in ­Germany by the end of the first quarter of 2016. We are also
­reducing capacities for NBR and ESBR rubber at our sites in
­La Wantzenau, France, and Duque de Caxias, Brazil. In conjunction
with many other process improvement and efficiency enhancement
measures, we aim to achieve a further €150 million in annual cost
savings by the end of 2019. As part of our commercial and supply
chain excellence initiative, several other projects have been implemented which are aimed mainly at improving efficiency.
In September 2015, we agreed a partnership with Saudi Aramco for
the synthetic rubber business, in which each party will hold a 50%
interest. We are contributing our Tire & Specialty Rubbers and High
Performance Elastomers business units and management support
functions to the alliance, which is named ARLANXEO. Our partner
will facilitate competitive access to strategic raw materials for this
business area in the medium term. Saudi Aramco is expected to pay
around €1.2 billion for its 50% share after deduction of debt and
other financial liabilities. This cash inflow will not only allow us to pay
down more of our debt but will also give us the financial headroom
for the strategic optimization of the Group over the coming years.

Strategic optimization through 2020
Through its new strategic alignment, LANXESS aims by 2020 to
become a less cyclical specialty chemicals group with a strong
cash flow and a balanced portfolio. To this end, we will be ­building
in p
­ articular on our strengths in medium-sized markets, which
we address above all through our Advanced Intermediates and
­Performance Chemicals segments.
It is our declared aim to reduce economic dependency on individual
sectors or closely correlated markets in the future. In regional terms,
too, we aim to achieve an even better balance in our portfolio by
increasing the share of our business accounted for by the growth
markets of China, North America and Southeast Asia.
As in the past, we will ensure stability through a conservative
­financing policy that is guided by clear criteria and focused on
maintaining our investment-grade rating and achieving a strong
free cash flow. In terms of capital requirements and capital investment, we will work to optimally reconcile competing requirements
for profitability, liquidity, security and autonomy. The debt level is
aligned to the ratio systems used by the leading rating agencies
for investment-grade companies.

In order to further improve the alignment of our businesses and leverage future growth potential, we aim to invest around €400 million
of the proceeds from the rubber transaction in our organic growth.
The following principles guide our capital expenditure activities:

We are additionally seeking external growth opportunities with
a view to benefiting from consolidation options in those areas of
­business in which LANXESS already operates, on the one hand,
while at the same time reviewing opportunities to extend our portfolio to neighboring areas of business with an appropriate fit.

Value management and
control system
To achieve our strategic goals, we need indicators that we can use
to measure the outcomes of our activities. The most important
indicator of our financial performance – and thus the company’s
key controlling parameter – is EBITDA (earnings before interest,
income taxes, depreciation and amortization) pre exceptionals. We
view other financial performance ratios such as return on capital
employed (ROCE), days of inventory outstanding (DIO) and net
financial debt ratio as company-specific lead indicators or as a
basis for monitoring.

The calculation of specific indicators is founded on a reliable, readily
understandable financial and controlling information system. We
are constantly working to improve the budget, forecast and actual
data provided by the Accounting and Corporate Controlling group
functions through consistent reporting.
Our success is largely reflected by our earning power so our control
system is focused on steering this parameter.

Earning power
The key indicator for steering the earning power of the LANXESS
Group and the individual segments is EBITDA pre exceptionals. It
is calculated from EBIT by adding back depreciation of property,
plant and equipment, amortization of intangible assets and any
­exceptional items. The latter are effects of an unusual nature or
magnitude. They may include write-downs, restructuring e
­ xpenses,
expenses for the design and implementation of IT projects, ­expenses
for portfolio adjustments and reversals of impairment charges.
Grants and subsidies from third parties for the acquisition and
construction of property, plant and equipment are accounted for
as deferred income using the gross method. In this respect, no
adjustments other than for gross depreciation and amortization
are made when calculating EBITDA pre exceptionals.
Every operational decision or achievement is judged in the short and
long term by its sustainable impact on EBITDA pre exceptionals. As
part of the annual budget and planning process, targets are set for
this benchmark of our company’s success, which are then taken into
account in determining employees’ variable income components.

Strategy
Value management and control system

We use EBITDA pre exceptionals as our key controlling parameter
because it facilitates assessment of the company’s development
over several reporting periods.
Simple revenue data such as net sales are not among the Group’s
controlling parameters because they do not permit any direct
­conclusions about our profitability. Volatile raw material prices are
a hallmark of our industry and their fluctuation throughout the
year impacts our selling prices. This influences sales but, other
than short-term effects, generally has no impact on the margins
that are significant to our profitability. We therefore set no sales
targets, either for the short or medium term.

Profitability
Return on capital employed (ROCE) has been implemented as a
profitability ratio at Group level which indicates how efficiently we
utilize our capital. This makes it an important criterion in capital
expenditure decisions, for example.

ROCE =

EBIT pre exceptionals
Capital employed

Capital employed = Total assets
. /. Less deferred tax assets
. /. Less interest-free liabilities

Company-specific lead indicators
Lead indicators support the timely identification of material changes
in the company’s earnings, asset and financial position and the
initiation of appropriate measures.
Our annual budget and planning process delivers key values for
the Group’s earning power and our ability to finance operations
from our own funds as the starting point for steering the company.
This information is used, for example, to make financing and capital
expenditure decisions. To ensure a timely response to changes in
market conditions and the competitive environment, we prepare
operational forecasts twice each year as the basis for updating the
full-year budget and the associated key values we use to control
the Group. In addition, regular forecasts of the key values for our
earning power are prepared.
Certain parameters used in budgets and forecasts are defined
centrally and applied uniformly because they have a major i­nfluence
on the key values. Strategic raw materials, like butadiene, have a
crucial role in forecasting. The development of procurement prices
is significant to the timely adjustment of selling prices. Even regional
differences in the availability of raw materials over a specific ­period
of time may become significant. Given the regional diversification
of our production sites and customer markets, exchange rate
­development also affects the earning power resulting from sales
and cost trends, with corresponding repercussions for pricing and
hedging strategies. In addition, we draw on continuously updated
growth forecasts for our customer industries and the regions where
we do business in order to prepare and review sales and capital
expenditure decisions.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

Interest-free liabilities comprise provisions (except those for pensions
and other post-employment benefits), income tax liabilities, trade
payables and items included under “other non-financial liabilities.”
In addition, we use a simplified variant of ROCE, called “business
ROCE,” to evaluate the contribution of our business units.

Cost of capital
Borrowing costs are calculated from risk-free interest, i.e. in our
case, from the return on a long-term German government bond plus
a risk premium for industrial companies in the same risk category
as LANXESS. The cost of equity reflects the return expected by
investors from an investment in LANXESS shares. Equity investors
demand a risk premium because of the greater risk involved in
acquiring shares rather than buying risk-free government bonds.
This is known as a market risk premium and is calculated using the
long-term excess return generated by a stock investment over an
investment in risk-free government bonds and adjusted by the beta
factor denoting the relative risk of an investment in LANXESS stock
compared with that of the market as a whole.
In 2015, ROCE was 8.4% – against 7.9% in 2014 – and thus slightly
above our weighted average cost of capital (WACC) after adjustment
for comparability.

Combined Management Report

Capital employment

Procurement and production

To optimize our working capital at the operational level, we use
two key performance indicators: DSO (days of sales outstanding)
and DIO (days of inventory outstanding). These show receivables
in relation to sales and inventories in relation to the costs of goods
sold for the previous quarter. In 2015, DIO was at 84.3 days (2014:
79.1 days) and DSO at 47.6 days (2014: 48.0 days).

Procurement

Expenditures for property, plant and equipment are subject to rigorous capital discipline and are systematically aligned with the
product areas with the greatest potential for success. We prioritize
investment projects on the basis of financial indicators such as the
pay-off period, net present value and ROCE. The investment rate is
an indicator which describes cash outflows for capital expenditures
divided by sales. For more detailed information about our capital
expenditure guidelines, please see “Strategy” above.

Debt
The net financial debt ratio, which we use solely at Group level, is
defined as net financial liabilities divided by EBITDA pre ­exceptionals.
Net financial liabilities are the total of current and non-current financial liabilities, less cash, cash equivalents and near-cash a­ ssets. The
financial liabilities reflected in the statement of financial ­position
are adjusted here for liabilities for accrued interest. Due to lower
net financial liabilities at December 31, 2015, the net financial debt
ratio decreased to 1.4, against 1.7 at the previous year's r­ eporting
date. Our net financial liabilities declined by €125 million to
€1,211 ­million. Moreover, at Group level, we consider provisions for
pensions and other post-employment benefits to be components of
debt. They decreased by €75 million compared with the end of 2014, to
€1,215 million.

LANXESS uses its centrally managed global procurement organization – Global Procurement & Logistics – to ensure a reliable supply
of raw and other materials and services. Global Categories closely
coordinate with our business units to pool their requirements in
the raw materials, technical goods, packaging materials, energy,
services and logistics segments.
Our worldwide procurement network facilitates purchasing
­synergies, so that we can move efficiently in the market and ­exploit
price advantages. We avoid delivery bottlenecks or reliance on
­individual suppliers by using strategies like multiple sourcing. As
a result, we experienced no delivery shortfalls or bottlenecks in
the reporting period that had a material effect on our business
­development.
Procuring chemical raw materials is a significant priority at
LANXESS. Our aim is to secure our supplies on the basis of longterm contracts. The availability of raw materials has always been a
crucial factor in facility location decisions. We procure key raw materials like butadiene and utilities in the form of steam and biomass
from the immediate vicinity at several of our production sites. In this
way, we not only minimize the costs and environmental impact of
our transportation activities, but reduce the risk of delivery shortfalls
caused by transportation issues in particular.
Our biggest suppliers of chemical raw materials in 2015 included
BASF, BP, Braskem, Covestro, ExxonMobil, INEOS, LyondellBasell,
Nova Chemicals, Sabic and Shell Chemicals.
Among the most important strategic raw materials by far for our
production operations in 2015 were ammonia, butadiene, caustic
soda, cyclohexane, ethylene, isobutylene, propylene, raffinate 1,
styrene and toluene. In all, strategic raw materials accounted for
a purchasing volume of about €2.5 billion in fiscal 2015 (2014:
about €3.0 billion), or around 81% of our total expenditure for raw
materials and goods in 2015, which amounted to approximately
€3.1 billion (2014: about €3.7 billion). Around 76% (2014: 78%) of
our total expenditure for raw materials and goods went to ­suppliers
from countries in the upper third of the Country Sustainability
­Ranking. Of the remaining 24%, nearly two-thirds were accounted
for by supplies from Brazil, China and India. Our total procurement
spend in 2015 was around €5.9 billion (2014: about €6.2 billion).
We systematically apply best-practice processes. These include
e-procurement tools, such as e-catalogs, auctions and ­electronic

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

Procurement and production

marketplaces, many of which are integrated into our internal IT
systems. At the end of 2015, about 70% of all items ordered
(2014: around 66%) were handled in e-procurement systems.
In this ­context, we have linked in 214 new catalogs globally and
maintained a catalog use rate of at least 25%.
Our HSEQ management process begins when raw materials and
services are procured. Across the LANXESS Group, a global
­procurement directive defines how our employees should behave
toward suppliers and their employees. In the reporting year, our
procurement transactions involved more than 18,000 suppliers.
Based on the principles of the U.N. Global Compact, the ­Inter­national
Labour Organization (ILO), Responsible Care® and other c­ orporate
responsibility codes, we expect our suppliers to comply with all
applicable national and other laws and regulations in o
­ rder to safeguard the environment, ensure health and safety in the workplace
and deploy appropriate labor and hiring practices. These provisions
of our Supplier Code of Conduct are key criteria in our selection
and evaluation of suppliers. A successful sustainability assessment
and/or audit are a fundamental requirement for major new suppliers
seeking to be included in our portfolio. In the reporting year, to
support the global rollout of the assessment process, we trained
­employees in Brazil, China and North America to conduct sustainability assessments of our suppliers.
As a founder of the Together for Sustainability (TfS) initiative, we aim
to enhance supply chain transparency and thus further minimize procurement risks. This initiative, membership of which rose to 18 international chemical companies in the reporting year, aims to develop
and implement a global audit program to assess and continuously
improve sustainability activities along the chemical industry supply
chain, focusing on human rights, child labor, ­working ­standards,
occupational safety, environmental protection and ­business integrity.
As the assessment and audit results are shared within the initiative,
we had access to a substantially larger number of sustainability
assessments (more than 4,600) and audit reports (466) at the
end of 2015. Suppliers whose sustainability-related activities have
been assessed currently account for 57% of our relevant procurement spend. Countries such as Brazil, China and India remained
the focus of the 179 audits conducted in 2015. These identified a
continuing need for action in respect of labor and human rights and
occupational safety. However, no serious deficiencies were identified
that would have resulted in termination of a business relationship.
In 2015, around 750 participants attended the TfS Supplier Days
in São Paulo, Brazil, and Shanghai, China, the purpose of which
was to explain to suppliers the growing importance of a sustainable
supply chain to LANXESS and the other members of the initiative.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

Production
LANXESS is one of the world’s major producers of chemical and
polymer products. Our production facilities make anywhere from
very small batches of custom-synthesized products to basic, specialty and fine chemicals and polymers in quantities of several ten
thousand tons.
Our production facilities are organizationally assigned to individual
business units. The most important production sites are at Lever­
kusen, Dormagen and Krefeld-Uerdingen, Germany; Antwerp,
Belgium; Sittard-Geleen, Netherlands; Orange, United States;
Sarnia, Canada; Triunfo and Duque de Caxias, Brazil; Jhagadia,
India; Singapore; Changzhou and Wuxi, China. LANXESS also
has other production sites in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil,
China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, South Africa,
Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. For a detailed
breakdown of our production sites by segment, please see “The
segments in brief” in this combined management report.
The following significant changes occurred in our global production
network in 2015:
In Singapore, the new plant for manufacturing neodymiumbased performance butadiene rubber (Nd-PBR) came on
stream. The plant, which is assigned to the Tire & ­Specialty
Rubbers business unit, has an annual production capacity
of 140,000 tons.
nn At the site in Changzhou, China, our High Performance
­Elastomers business unit commissioned a new EPDM ­r ubber
plant with a nominal annual capacity of 160,000 tons.
nn

Including the measures described above, cash outflows for capital
expenditures came to €434 million in fiscal 2015. Further information about the capital expenditures can be found in the “Statement
of financial position and financial condition” section of this combined
management report.
In connection with the optimization of our global production network, we also intend to discontinue production of EPDM rubber at
the site in Marl, Germany, at the end of the first quarter of 2016.
Within LANXESS’s EPDM rubber production network, the Marl
facility is no longer competitive due to its relatively small capacity
and comparatively high energy and raw material costs.

Sales organization and customers

Customers

Sales organization

Because of our broad offering, we have business relationships with
a large number of customers all over the world. These customers
need an individualized, well-focused approach, which we are able to
provide because our sales organizations are managed through the
business units. We regularly review individual sales and marketing
strategies on the basis of customer satisfaction surveys.

We sell our products all over the world, to several thousand customers in more than 150 countries across all continents. LANXESS’s
long-standing customer base includes leaders in each of its user
industries. We have well-established customer relationships in all
sales regions. To meet our customers’ needs, we have set up flexible
marketing and sales structures. We manage our sales throughout
the world through 46 companies owned by LANXESS itself. In
countries where we do not yet have our own company, we work
with local sales partners.
To keep as close as possible to customers and ensure they receive
individual support, each of our business units manages its own sales
organization. Another competitive advantage is derived from having
50 of our own production sites in 17 countries. Wherever possible,
customers are supplied from production sites in the same region,
yielding advantages in terms of time and costs.
In 2015, we expanded our e-business activities in purchasing, sales
and logistics. Altogether, more than 1,000,000 orders and the
­respective automated follow-up notices were handled as e-­business.
This capability is provided by the “LANXESS one” Internet portal and
the system-to-system connections via ELEMICA. We will continue
to expand this process, which provides benefits for all involved,
by adding further partners and technical services. The net sales
invoice values accounted for by e-business came to approximately
€1.7 billion.
Selling costs in the reporting year came to 9.6% of LANXESS Group
sales, up 0.3 percentage points on the prior-year level of 9.3%.

In 2015, as in the prior year, our top ten customers accounted for
about 22% of total sales. None of our customers accounted for more
than 10% of Group sales. 55 (2014: 50) customers accounted for
annual sales in excess of €20 million.
The number of customers in each segment varies widely. The
­Performance Polymers segment had some 3,700 customers in
2015 (2014: 3,600), while Advanced Intermediates and Per­
formance Chemicals had about 3,400 (2014: 3,100) and around
10,400 (2014: 11,300), respectively. This information is based on
the number of customer accounts in each segment. Each segment
includes all customer groups and sales categories. However, one
customer may do business with more than one segment.
The comparatively low sales per customer in the Performance
Chemicals segment, as well as its broad customer base, reflect the
way in which its business often involves custom-tailored solutions in
specialty chemicals. By contrast, the substantially lower number of
customers in the Performance Polymers segment, which nonetheless generates relatively high sales, is typical of the synthetic rubber
products business. On account of the extensive customer base, no
segment can be considered dependent on just a few customers.

Research and development

Research and development
Research and development makes an important contribution toward
increasing our competitiveness and expanding our product portfolio
through the development of innovative products and processes as
well as the ongoing optimization of existing production processes. In
2015, as part of our realignment program, we also adjusted the organizational framework for research and development. As we merged
various business units, we also combined the associated R&D units.
The existing Innovation & Technology Group Function was ­integrated
into the newly established Production, T
­ echnology, Safety &
Environment Group Function. We are continuing to ­concentrate on
projects with a short- to medium-term time horizon for products
and processes in our core businesses.

Organizational focus
Our research programs are directly and consistently aligned with
the needs of our customers in the end markets relevant to our
businesses. For example, the business units in the Performance
Polymers segment are strengthening the focus of their activities
on optimizing their products and product quality, as well as on
developing new products.
Other business units with most of their products in very mature
markets, such as the Advanced Industrial Intermediates ­business unit
in the Advanced Intermediates segment, concentrate on c­ ontinuous
process optimization to improve their production f­acilities and
­processes.
The specialist departments within our Production, Technology,
Safety & Environment Group Function support and complement the
business units’ research and development activities to ensure that
synergies are exploited to the full and innovations can be ­applied
in various LANXESS units. Cross-business unit projects are also
bundled in this group function. In this context, our research concentrates on both process and product innovation, which are handled
by separate departments.
In the area of process innovation, the emphasis is on planning new
processes and integrating new technologies into existing production
processes with the aim of achieving cost and t­echnology leader­
ship. One focus is on reviewing current production processes
­using m
­ athematical and experimental methods in order to p
­ inpoint
­optimization potential. In this way, we have identified potential
­savings on raw materials and energy, developed process concepts
to exploit these savings and already realized them in several areas.
We have also succeeded in further reducing our operating costs
by developing new model-based process control concepts that we

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

have implemented with the incorporation of state-of-the-art online
analytics. These concepts enable us to run our plants even closer
to the optimum operating point and make them even more efficient
in terms of raw material and energy consumption.
Product innovation is focused on developing new products and
new applications for existing products as well as on product
­modifications. Here, product development is more broadly based
than in the business units – the main areas of focus are generally
applicable to multiple business units. Here, too, our research goals
are derived from the needs of our customers in the markets that
are relevant to us.
Our main research and development units are at the sites in Lever­
kusen, Krefeld-Uerdingen and Dormagen, Germany; London,
­Canada; and Qingdao and Wuxi, China. We also operate a center
for engineering plastics in Hong Kong to strengthen our relations
with automakers in the Asia-Pacific growth region. At our inter­
national research and development sites, we test materials such as
high-performance rubbers and engineering plastics for lightweight
automotive engineering applications.

Main research and development projects
In the Performance Polymers segment, work continued in 2015
on further developing our portfolio of high-quality rubber and
plastic products, focusing especially on green tires. BUNA FX is
a f­unctionalized SSBR (solution styrene-butadiene rubber). The
products from this family are characterized by improved interaction between the rubber and filler, which significantly reduces
the rolling r­ esistance of tires. Buna VSL 3038-2HM improves wet
performance while at the same time facilitating good rolling resistance. Thanks to their outstanding material properties, both
these rubber grades are ideal for high-quality summer tires. With
Durethan BKV 25 FN27, LANXESS developed a new halogen-free,
flame-retardant ­polyamide 6 for electrical switches. Compared with
the mineral-filled polyamide 6 grades often used in this area, the
glass-reinforced material ­impresses through its high mechanical
strength and thermal ­stability. Components made from this material
can therefore withstand the enormous mechanical stresses and high
temperature peaks a­ ssociated with a short circuit. Furthermore,
the halogen-free flame retardance package additionally equips the
polyamide with good fire resistance.

122

Combined Management Report

The Advanced Intermediates segment is systematically expanding
its range of screed additives. The new “pro-Linie” product family
was introduced to the market in September 2015. These modern,
formaldehyde-free additives make the screed material easier to process and require less water, which increases firmness and reduces
drying time.
The Performance Chemicals segment likewise brought i­mportant
­innovations to market. For instance, innovative halogen-free,
phosphorus-based flame retardants were introduced for flexible
foams. These are characterized by lower emissions (fogging) and
less scorching and are therefore ideal for use in the furniture and
­automotive industries. In fact, foams manufactured from Levagard
TP LXS 51114 meet the stringent standards of the German Automotive Industry Association for the properties of materials used in
motor ­vehicles. With Preventol A31-D, we have also ­developed a
new p
­ reservative for exterior coatings. It can be used, for e
­ xample,
in algicidal and fungicidal facade paints. Thanks to an innovative ­combination of fungicides and a slow-release ­mechanism,
the p
­ roduct displays a broad spectrum of activity even in low
­concentrations.
In our central research unit, work with the Tire & Specialty Rubbers
business unit is ongoing to develop a technology which maintains
air pressure in a tire that has been punctured by an object such as a
screw or a nail. The puncture closes in a self-healing process. In the
medium term, this technology means there will be no need to carry
spare tires or repair kits in a car, thereby further reducing weight
and fuel consumption. The technology will additionally enhance
the reliability of tires.
The research-intensive product and process development activities
coordinated by the Production, Technology, Safety & Environment
Group Function are also conducted via alliances with universities
and research institutes. Generating knowledge in this way substantially complements LANXESS’s in-house research activities.
In 2015, we had a total of 153 (2014: 154) major research and
development alliances, 35 (2014: 41) of which were with universities, 97 (2014: 79) with suppliers or customers, and 21 (2014:
34) with research institutes.

Materials and Saltigo business units together accounted for the
largest share of these expenses in 2015 at 57%. Material Protection
Products, Saltigo, Liquid Purification Technologies and High Performance Elastomers were the business units most active in research in
terms of their ratios of research and development expenses to sales.
The decrease in research and development expenses was the result
of focusing our R&D pipeline on our core businesses and of organizational changes made when combining individual business units.

Fields of activity and patent strategy

Integrated management system

Within the context of our global realignment, we are focusing our
research and development activities on market-driven core projects.
In 2015, we conducted 223 projects (2014: around 210), 128 of
which (2014: around 120) aimed to develop new products and
applications or improve existing ones. The remaining 95 projects
(2014: some 90) concerned process technology issues with a view
to reducing costs, improving efficiency or increasing capacity. We
plan to have about 41% of the research and development projects
we started in 2015 in the market or in technical implementation
stages by the end of 2016 (2014: roughly 20%).

At LANXESS, a central management system provides the ­necessary
global structures to ensure responsible commercial practices.
Worldwide, we apply internal directives and operating procedures
together with the ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 international standards for quality and environmental management and ISO 50001
for energy management. External, independent experts regularly
audit the progress of integrating new sites into our management
system and the performance of our management system worldwide.
­Confirmation of our compliance with ISO 9001 and ISO 14001
takes the form of a global matrix certificate. We successfully completed the recertification audit in 2015.

The results of our activities are protected by patents, where this
is possible and expedient. In the course of 2015, we submitted
52 priority applications worldwide. As of December 31, 2015, the
full patent portfolio included approximately 1,060 patent families
covering around 6,850 property rights.

Corporate responsibility
As an international specialty chemicals group, we bear a major
responsibility toward people and the environment. Our entrepreneurial activities reflect this sense of responsibility, which is a key
component of our strategy. Safety, environmental protection, social
responsibility, quality and commercial efficiency are all key corporate
goals at LANXESS. Our products and activities enable us to make a
contribution worldwide to supporting our customers and improving
people’s quality of life. Our responsibility spans the entire supply
and value creation chain – from the global procurement of raw
materials and product development, through production, storage
and transport, to use and disposal. Moreover, all our corporate
responsibility (CR) activities must be linked to our core business
or to our expertise.
We consider compliance with laws and ethical principles to be
the basis for sustainable corporate governance. The “Code of
­conduct – Code for integrity and compliance at LANXESS,” which is
­applicable throughout the Group, specifies minimum standards and
gives our employees advice and guidance on complying with these
­standards. We have been supporting the Responsible Care® ­initiative
since 2006 and affirmed our commitment in 2014 by ­signing the
Responsible Care ® Global Charter. We are also ­committed to
the ­established principles of the world’s largest corporate social
­responsibility initiative, the U.N Global Compact.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

As of December 31, 2015, our matrix certificate covered 48 companies with 80 sites in 23 countries. The sites in Epierre, France;
Lipetsk, Russia; and Little Rock, United States, were included for
the first time, as planned. Our sites in the United States have also
received confirmation of their certification to RC 14001 (RC =
Responsible Care®). In 2016, we intend to integrate the production
sites in Neville Island, United States; Rustenburg, South Africa; and
Joo Koon, Singapore, into the matrix certificate.
In addition, we have established a global procedure for an energy
management system in accordance with ISO 50001. Our certifi­
cation in Germany was reconfirmed in 2015. Outside Germany, the
ongoing implementation and preparation for local certification are
taking place decentrally at the sites. For example, the site at Liyang,
China, was successfully certified in April 2015.

Environment data
We use an electronic data capture system for the systematic ­global
recording of key performance indicators (KPIs) in the areas of safety
and environmental protection. Data for all indicators except the
­LTIFR are gathered only at those production sites in which the company has a holding of more than 50%. Pricewaterhouse­Coopers AG
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft assessed our HSE indicators for
2013 to 2015 and the necessary data recording processes in
the course of a business audit, with a view to achieving a “limited
­assurance” rating.

Social commitment

The economic environment

Our not-for-profit activities focus on providing support for science
education in schools. The LANXESS education initiative is the
Group-wide platform for these activities and has been used to
­establish relevant projects at almost all LANXESS sites. Since its
launch in 2008, we have reached tens of thousands of children,
adolescents and young adults worldwide.

In the reporting year, development of the economic environment
varied. The continuing decline in the oil price acted as a positive
stimulus in countries with a high demand for oil. In the eurozone, by
contrast, economic activity was held back by the ongoing ­discussion
of the crisis in Greece and persistent debt issues. Growth was also
dampened by the smoldering conflicts in eastern Ukraine and
­escalation of the situation in the Middle East. Uncertainty caused
by the growing terrorist threat also proved increasingly detrimental
to economic sentiment.

Legal environment
There were no changes in the legal environment in 2015 that would
have had a material impact on the earnings, asset and financial
position of the LANXESS Group or LANXESS AG.

Global economic growth weakened slightly over the course of
2015, ending the year at 2.4%. It was held back by factors including
­declining capital investment in the energy sector due to the collapse
of the oil price. Growth varied regionally. Asia-Pacific posted com­
paratively low growth of 4.0% owing to slower growth ­momentum
in the Chinese economy. This also impacted other major ­economies
in the region. Growth in EMEA (including Germany) came to 1.6%,
with a positive trend in the eurozone because of the weaker euro
and low oil price. Economic output in Germany expanded by 1.7%,
driven mainly by rising consumer spending. On the other hand,
Russia remained mired in recession because of ongoing sanctions
and the collapse of the oil price. In Latin America, the downward
trend resulted in a decrease of 1.4% in gross domestic product.

The U.S. dollar continued to gain in value against the euro in a
trend which began in 2014. In terms of monetary policy, the two
currency zones diverged significantly during the course of the year.
While the European Central Bank consistently pursued its policy
of expanding the money supply through negative deposit rates
for commercial banks, purchases of government bonds and other
quantitative easing measures, the U.S. Federal Reserve gradually
scaled back its bond purchases and finally discontinued them at
the end of October. At the end of December, the Federal Reserve
then initiated a turnaround in interest rates in the United States
with a slight increase in its key rate, ending a period of interest
rate reductions lasting several years. Against this backdrop, the

Business conditions

U.S. currency appreciated continually through mid-April, starting
at US$1.21 against the euro and reaching US$1.06. After a short
phase of depreciation, the exchange rate then settled in a range of
around US$1.09 to US$1.15 against the euro, in which it remained
until about the beginning of November. This was followed by a brief
phase of appreciation by the U.S. dollar, although it corrected downward again at the end of the year. One euro was worth US$1.09
at the end of 2015, representing 9.9% growth in the value of the
U.S. dollar. The average for the year was US$1.11 to the euro,
after US$1.33 in 2014, which highlights the depreciation of the
euro against the U.S. dollar. Due to the regional positioning of our
business, a stronger U.S. dollar generally has a positive effect on
our earnings. Centralized hedging activities limit any impact that
cannot be neutralized by ensuring that production and sales take
place in the same currency area.

Evolution of major user industries

Compared with the end of 2014, the price level for raw materials
dropped appreciably by the end of the reporting year. The marked
downward trend in the first quarter was interrupted by a period of
rising prices in the second quarter, followed by a sharp decline in
the price level up to the end of the year. We are particularly affected
by the prices of petrochemical raw materials as they have a material
impact on our production costs. The price of our most important
strategic raw material, butadiene, declined over the course of the
year. Reflecting the development of the oil price, the prices of feedstocks such as benzene and toluene also decreased.

Global automotive production recovered toward the end of
2015 and rose by a slight 0.8%. NAFTA proved to be an anchor of
­stability, with growth of 3.7%. Latin America, on the other hand, saw
a very considerable contraction of 19%. Growth in EMEA (including
Germany) was uneven, but came in nonetheless at 3.7% overall.
In Europe, growth was substantial although it was held back by a
decline in production in Russia. Germany recorded slight expansion
of 0.6%. Production in Asia-Pacific stagnated. China saw slight
growth toward the end of the year as a result of tax relief, while the
trend in Japan was downward.

The chemical industry
The chemical industry increased global production in 2015 by
3.9%, although the picture varied regionally. Asia-Pacific continued
to expand rapidly at 6.0%, but production in China grew more
slowly. Growth in NAFTA was also dynamic, at 3.6%, owing to
low energy prices and the favorable raw materials situation. By
­contrast, ­production in Latin America was impacted by the economic
­environment and contracted by 2.3%. The expansion in production
in EMEA (including Germany) was 1.6%, with dynamic growth in
Russia. In Germany, on the other hand, production declined by 0.9%.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

The global tire industry recorded growth of 2.2% in 2015, with
sharp differences between the regions. EMEA (including Germany)
­registered a healthy 5.5% increase in production. Only demand
in the original equipment business in Russia was very weak. In
­Germany, production rose by 0.6%. NAFTA saw an increase of
3.2%, driven by higher demand for replacement tires; imports fell
slightly at the same time. Production in Latin America declined
by 3.2% due to the general recessionary environment. Increased
­demand for ­replacement tires failed to compensate for the ­decline
in the original equipment business. Asia-Pacific posted slight growth
of 1.0%. Falling exports in conjunction with a significant rise in local
demand for replacement tires led to a small increase in production
in China.

126

Combined Management Report

With the prices for agricultural products falling, global ­production of
agrochemicals rose by a modest 1.0% in the reporting year. Asia-­
Pacific recorded growth of 2.3%. EMEA (including Germany) likewise trended positively overall, with expansion of 1.9%. ­Production
in Germany declined by 0.8%. NAFTA posted only weak growth at
0.2%, while Latin America recorded a significant decline of 7.1%.
The construction industry worldwide posted growth of 3.1%.
NAFTA was the driver of this development, with robust expansion
of 5.8%. Latin America, on the other hand, was unable to escape
the effects of recession in this sector as well, which resulted in a
contraction of output of 2.5%. Asia-Pacific proved to be a growth
driver with expansion of 3.3%, even if momentum weakened in
China in particular. EMEA (including Germany) achieved growth of
1.6%, which was held back by the sharp downward trend in Eastern
Europe. Production in Germany fell by a slight 0.7%.

Key events influencing the
company’s business
Fiscal 2015 was characterized by the persistently difficult
­competitive situation in our synthetic rubber businesses. The decline
in procurement costs for key raw materials, especially butadiene,
­resulted in corresponding adjustments to selling prices. Exchange
rate developments, particularly for the U.S. dollar, had a positive
effect.
During the reporting period, we brought the new plants for our Tire &
Specialty Rubbers and High Performance Elastomers business
units in the Asia-Pacific region on stream. The underutilization of
these and other world-scale plants in Asia led to rising costs for
idle capacities.
In the year under review, we continued to implement our extensive
realignment program. In connection with the “Let’s LANXESS again”
program, we intend to discontinue production of ethylene propylene
diene monomer (EPDM) rubber at the site in Marl, Germany, at
the end of the first quarter of 2016. In the reporting year, earnings
were impacted by adequate provisions for this purpose that were
recognized in the balance sheet.
As a further key component of the realignment program,
LANXESS and Saudi Aramco agreed a strategic alliance – named
­ARLANXEO – for the synthetic rubber business. We believe this
alliance will give the business units concerned – Tire & Specialty
Rubbers and High Performance Elastomers – competitive and
reliable access to s­ trategic raw materials in the medium term. The
transaction has been approved by all relevant antitrust authorities
and financial completion is expected on April 1, 2016. This agreement had no direct impact on business performance in the reporting
year. Further information about the alliance can be found in the
“Strategy” section of this combined management report.
As of January 1, 2015, we reorganized our business structure as part
of the realignment. The Butyl Rubber and Performance Butadiene
Rubbers business units were merged to form the Tire & ­Specialty
Rubbers business unit. Also, the antioxidants and ­accelerators
product lines of the Rubber Chemicals business unit – which was
then dissolved – were integrated into the portfolio of the Advanced
Industrial Intermediates business unit. For more detailed information,
please see the “Business” and “Strategy” sections of this combined
management report.

In the combined management report for fiscal 2014, we ­predicted
that EBITDA pre exceptionals for 2015 would be about on a comparable level to 2014. Influences were expected to have a largely
offsetting effect on the individual segments. We narrowed this
guidance over the course of the year and, in our interim report
for the third quarter of 2015, forecast EBITDA pre exceptionals
of between €860 million and €900 million. The actual result of
€885 million was within this range and exceeded 2014 earnings
of €808 million by 9.5%.
All segments posted earnings which were in some cases significantly above those recorded in 2014. While the Performance
Polymers and Advanced Intermediates segments increased
EBITDA pre ­exceptionals from €392 million to €502 million and
from €308 ­million to €339 million, respectively, our Performance
­Chemicals segment improved earnings from €269 million in 2014
to €326 million.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

Lower selling prices across all segments resulted from the decline in
raw material prices. The overall positive development of earnings in
the reporting year was attributable to exchange rates, especially in
the Performance Polymers segment, which trended more favorably
than we had anticipated in our original guidance for 2015. Volumes
as a whole were flat with the prior year. While they expanded in the
Performance Polymers and Advanced Intermediates segments, a
decline was posted in the Performance Chemicals segment.
As expected, the tax rate for the LANXESS Group was 42.0% in
the reporting year, thus exceeding the 30% threshold.
We had expected the earnings position of LANXESS AG in the
reporting year to be substantially better than in 2014. Due mainly
to a significant improvement in income from investments in affiliated
companies, net income in 2015 amounted to €91 million after a
net loss of €85 million in 2014.

Sales and earnings
In 2015, LANXESS Group sales declined by 1.3% from €8,006 million
in the prior year to €7,902 million. Lower selling prices, which
resulted particularly from passing on lower procurement prices for
raw materials, diminished sales by 9.8%. Moreover, portfolio effects
had a marginally negative impact of 0.1%. Changes in exchange
rates improved sales by 7.7%. In addition, higher volumes added
0.9% to sales. After adjustment for currency and portfolio effects,
operational sales decreased by 8.9%.

2014

Price

Volume Currency

Our Performance Polymers segment recorded a decline in sales
of 4.5%. Lower selling prices resulted particularly from lower
­procurement prices for raw materials and the challenging competitive situation in the synthetic rubber business. There was a ­slightly
negative portfolio effect from the sale of the shares in Perlon-­
Monofil GmbH, Dormagen, Germany, in the previous year. Sales
volumes were slightly above the prior-year level. Exchange rate
developments had a positive effect on sales.
Sales in our Advanced Intermediates segment fell by 1.1%. They
were diminished by lower selling prices caused by passing on
lower procurement prices for raw materials. On the other hand,
shifts in exchange rates had a positive impact on sales. In addition,
good ­demand for agrochemicals and from broad areas of our other
­customer markets resulted in a positive effect from higher volumes.
Sales in our Performance Chemicals segment advanced by 4.8%.
A decline in volumes was more than compensated by the positive
development of exchange rates. Selling prices were level with the
prior year.

zation and associated higher idle time costs, especially in ­connection
with the start-up of our new plants in Asia. Due to factors including
the low utilization of these plants, total capacity utilization at the
LANXESS Group was 2 percentage points below the prior-year
level at around 77%.
Gross profit was €1,748 million, up by €160 million or 10.1% against
the prior year. The gross profit margin increased from 19.8% to
22.1%. The expansion of volumes and shifts in exchange rates had
a positive impact on gross profit. Higher manufacturing costs had
a negative effect.

2014 figures restated

EBITDA and operating result (EBIT)
In the North America region, we achieved a slight increase in sales
of 2.2% due to the effects of exchange rates. The EMEA region
(excluding Germany) remained stable with growth of 1.3%. In all
other sales regions, sales were down. Germany saw a decline in
sales of 5.2%. The Latin America and Asia-Pacific regions posted
sales declines of 3.4% and 2.8%, respectively. Development in the
Performance Polymers segment was the key element of business
performance in the various regions.

Order book status
Most of our business is not subject to long-term agreements on
fixed volumes or prices. Instead, our business is characterized by
long-standing relationships with customers and revolving master
agreements. Our activities are focused on demand-driven orders
with relatively short lead times which do not provide a basis for
forward-looking statements about our capacity utilization or volumes. The business is managed primarily on the basis of regular
Group-wide forecasts of the Group operating target. For additional
information, please see “Company-specific lead indicators.”
Any disclosure of the Group’s order book status at a given reporting date therefore would not be indicative of the Group’s short- or
medium-term earning power. For this reason, no such disclosure
is made in this report.

Gross profit
The cost of sales showed a decline of 4.1%, to €6,154 million, that
was disproportionately large compared with sales. Cost relief was
chiefly attributable to lower raw material and energy prices. This
was countered particularly by the development of exchange rates,
above all for the U.S. dollar, the expansion in volumes and higher
manufacturing costs. The latter was partly due to lower capacity utili-

Our operating result before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)
pre exceptionals increased by €77 million, or 9.5%, to €885 million
in 2015, after €808 million in the prior year. At Group level, the
impact of lower raw material prices was passed on to the market
in the form of selling price adjustments. Furthermore, the ­persistently
challenging competitive situation in the synthetic rubber business
had a diminishing effect. The overall positive development was
principally attributable to favorable currency effects. Earnings were
also buoyed by a positive volume effect. Selling expenses rose by
2.3% to €759 million, due especially to a volume-driven increase
in freight costs and exchange rate developments. Research and
development costs were down €30 million, to €130 million. ­General
administration expenses increased by €6 million to €284 million.
The Group’s EBITDA margin pre exceptionals improved from 10.1%
to 11.2%. Our realignment programs generated cost savings in all
functional areas. However, they were countered by cost increases
resulting from exchange rate developments.
EBITDA pre exceptionals in our Performance Polymers segment
advanced by €110 million from the prior-year level of €392 million,

to €502 million. This increase was attributable in particular to the
­favorable exchange rate movements. Earnings were a­ dditionally
buoyed by a positive volume effect and lower research and
­development costs. The positive influence of lower procurement
prices for raw materials was more than offset by lower selling prices
due to the persistently difficult competitive situation in the synthetic
rubber business. Earnings were additionally diminished by higher
manufacturing costs.

increased by €31 million to €339 million. Earnings were improved
by positive exchange rate effects. Continued good demand for
­agrochemicals and from other customer markets increased volumes
and earnings. A positive net effect resulted from lower raw material
prices and the adjustment of selling prices.
The Performance Chemicals segment generated EBITDA pre
­exceptionals of €326 million, up €57 million or 21.2% on the
­prior year. Favorable exchange rate developments and lower raw
­material prices resulted in improved earnings. Lower volumes had
an o
­ pposing effect.

The operating result (EBIT) increased substantially from €218 ­million
to €415 million in fiscal 2015. Depreciation and amortization
amounted to €474 million. Of this total, write-downs accounted
for €25 million (2014: €32 million). In turn, €11 million (2014:
€20 million) of these write-downs were exceptional items. On the
other hand, reversals of impairment charges totaling €56 million
were recognized as exceptional items.
The other operating result, which is the balance between other
operating income and expenses, improved by €30 million to minus
€160 million. Adjusted for exceptional items, the other operating
result came to minus €153 million, which was €147 million lower
than in 2014. This decline was largely due to currency hedging
transactions.
Net negative exceptional items of €7 million for the reporting
year resulted from negative exceptional items of €106 million and
­positive exceptional items of €99 million. The negative exceptional
items, €96 million of which impacted EBITDA, resulted mainly
from ­expenses in connection with the planned discontinuation of
EPDM rubber production at the Marl site in Germany at the end
of the first quarter of 2016 and from further measures associated
with the “Let’s LANXESS again” program. The negative exceptional
items which did not impact EBITDA were accounted for by writedowns recognized in connection with the planned discontinuation
of ­production at the Marl site in Germany. The positive exceptional
items, €44 million of which impacted EBITDA, were mainly related
to the sales of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.
The positive exceptional items that did not impact EBITDA were
primarily the result of reversing impairment charges recognized in
previous years, amounting to €56 million. €37 million of the reversals related to our High Performance Elastomers business unit and
€19 million to the Advanced Industrial Intermediates business unit.
In the prior year, net negative exceptional items of €184 million
were incurred, €164 million of which impacted EBITDA and mainly
related to the “Let’s LANXESS again” and “Advance” programs as
well as to expenses associated with the design and implementation
of IT projects. The negative exceptional items of €20 million that
had no impact on EBITDA in the prior year were due above all to
write-downs recognized on a pilot plant in what is now the Tire &
Specialty Rubbers business unit.

The LANXESS Group posted net earnings of €165 million, an
increase of €118 million year on year. A profit of €2 million was
attributable to non-controlling interests, compared with a loss of
€3 million in the previous year.
Earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of LANXESS shares in circulation during
the reporting period. The number of shares in circulation rose by
the shares issued for the capital increase in May 2014. Earnings per
share were €1.80, ahead of the €0.53 recorded for the prior year.
Earnings per share pre exceptionals were €1.80, against €1.98
the year before. This value was calculated from the earnings per
share adjusted for exceptional items and attributable tax effects.
In the reporting year, the net negative exceptional items came to
€7 million after €184 million in 2014.

Financial result

Business trends by region

The financial result came in at minus €127 million in fiscal 2015,
compared with minus €138 million for the prior year. The pro-­
rated income from the investment in Currenta GmbH & Co. OHG,
Leverkusen, Germany, which is accounted for using the equity
method, came to €0 million, against €2 million the previous year.
Net interest expense was €66 million, which is €3 million lower
than in the previous year because of repayments made and loans
which fell due in the reporting period. The reduced capitalization of
a portion of borrowing costs, a consequence of the completion of
the new plants in Asia, had a negative effect on the financial result.
The improvement in other financial income and expense items
resulted mainly from reduced exchange losses. In addition, in the
prior year they included expenses incurred for the early repayment
of long-term loans.

Combined Management Report

EMEA (excluding Germany)

Latin America

Sales in the EMEA region (excluding Germany) increased by
€29 million, or 1.3%, to €2,325 million. After adjustment for
­currency changes and minor portfolio effects from the sale of the
shares in Perlon-Monofil GmbH, Dormagen (Germany) in March
2014, sales were on a level with the prior year with growth of 0.1%.
The Performance Polymers segment posted a marginal sales decline
in the low-single-digit percentage range. Our Performance Chemicals and Advanced Intermediates segments, on the other hand,
achieved a slight increase in sales of a ­similar m
­ agnitude. While the
Group’s performance in the region as a whole was b
­ alanced, sales
declined in Italy, Ireland, Poland and the Netherlands in particular.
However, sales were bolstered by p
­ ositive growth in demand in
other countries such as Belgium, Turkey, P
­ ortugal and Hungary.

In the Latin America region, sales dropped by €29 million, or 3.4%,
to €830 million. After adjusting for positive currency effects, which
­resulted from the development in the U.S. dollar exchange rate and
the fact that most sales are denominated in that currency, sales
declined by 13.7%. The crucial factor in business performance
here was the development of the Performance Polymers s­ egment,
where sales declined by a low-double-digit percentage. The
­Advanced Inter­mediates segment likewise registered a ­decrease
in business in the low-double-digit percentage range, while sales
of the Per­formance Chemicals segment moved back by only a
low-single-digit percentage. Business development in the region
was mainly a­ ttributable to the contraction of sales in Brazil. Slightly
positive impetus came from Mexico.

With a 29.4% share of total sales, after 28.7% in the prior year,
EMEA (excluding Germany) remained the largest of the LANXESS
Group’s regions in terms of sales.

We generated 10.5% of Group sales in Latin America, compared
with 10.7% in the prior-year period.

Asia-Pacific
Germany
In Germany, our sales came to €1,365 million in 2015, down
€75 million, or 5.2%, on the previous year. Adjusted for slight
­exchange rate and portfolio effects, sales were down by 5.7%.
The Advanced Intermediates and Performance Polymers segments
posted sales declines in the mid-single-digit percentage range,
while our Performance Chemicals segment recorded a decrease
in sales in the low-single-digit percentage range.
Germany’s share of Group sales fell slightly from 18.0% to 17.3%.

North America
Sales in this region came to €1,368 million, up €30 million, or
2.2%, from the previous year. On the other hand, after adjustment
for positive exchange rate effects, sales were down 13.9%. This
was largely attributable to the decline in sales in the Performance
Polymers segment, which was in the low-double-digit percentage
range. Sales also moved back by a low-double-digit percentage
and a low-single-digit percentage in the Advanced Intermediates
and Performance Chemicals segments, respectively.
At 17.3%, North America’s share of Group sales was 0.6 percentage
points higher than in the prior year.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

Sales in the Asia-Pacific region declined by €59 million, or 2.8%, to
€2,014 million in 2015. Adjusted for positive currency effects and
slight portfolio effects, sales were down by 16.1%. This ­decline was
mainly attributable to the business performance of the ­Performance
Polymers segment, which posted a decrease in sales in the low-­
double-digit percentage range. Business in the Advanced Inter­
mediates and Performance Chemicals segments was likewise down
by percentages just into double digits. Declining sales in China,
Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan contributed significantly to
operational performance in the region.
Asia-Pacific’s share of Group sales was 25.5%, slightly down on
the prior-year figure of 25.9%. Thus, it confirmed its position as
the second-strongest region behind EMEA (excluding Germany)
in terms of sales.

Business trends by region
Segment information

Segment information

Sales in our Performance Polymers segment declined by 4.5%
year on year in fiscal 2015, to €3,944 million. A negative price
effect of 14.9% was attributable in particular to lower procurement
prices for raw materials being passed on to customers. Favorable
exchange rate effects improved sales by 8.9%, with support from
slightly higher volumes. All business units in this segment were
impacted by lower selling prices. The Tire & Specialty Rubbers
and High Performance Materials business units posted volume
growth, but volumes declined in the High Performance Elastomers
business unit. Shifts in exchange rates had a positive effect in all
business units. While business in this segment was positive in the
EMEA region (excluding Germany), sales in the other regions were
below the prior-year level.

Performance Polymers: challenging competitive situation for
synthetic rubbers; lower selling prices impact sales; earnings

The segment posted net positive exceptional items of €31 million,

exceptional items of €48 million. The positive exceptional items,
€43 million of which impacted EBITDA, related in particular to
­income from the sale of intangible assets and property, plant and

not impact EBITDA were mainly attributable to the reversals of
­impairment charges recognized by the High Performance

items were made up of €38 million that impacted EBITDA and
€10 million that did not. The negative exceptional items that

i­mpacted EBITDA resulted mainly from expenses in connection
with the planned discontinuation of EPDM rubber production at
the Marl site in Germany and from measures associated with the
“Let’s LANXESS again” program. The negative exceptional items
that did not impact EBITDA resulted from write-downs recognized
in connection with the planned discontinuation of production at the
Marl site in Germany.
In the prior year, negative exceptional items amounted to €61 million,
of which €41 million impacted EBITDA. The negative e
­ xceptional
items of €20 million that had no impact on EBITDA were due above
all to write-downs recognized on a pilot plant in the Tire & S
­ pecialty
Rubbers business unit. The negative exceptional items that impacted
EBITDA were related to measures associated with our realignment
programs.

While both of the segment’s business units grew volumes, selling
prices in the Advanced Industrial Intermediates business unit were
below the prior-year level, reflecting raw material prices. Continued
good demand for agrochemicals and from other customer markets
resulted in a positive effect from higher volumes. Exchange rate
developments had a positive influence in the Advanced Industrial
Intermediates business unit in particular. In the Germany region,
the segment’s sales were below the prior-year level. In the other
regions, the segment posted a positive business performance.

the adjustment in selling prices, through which lower purchase
prices for raw materials were largely passed on to customers, led to
a negative price effect of 9.0%, exchange rate developments added
4.8% to sales. Volumes were up 3.2% compared with the prior year.

EBITDA pre exceptionals in the Advanced Intermediates segment
increased by €31 million, or 10.1%, to €339 million. Earnings were
improved particularly by positive exchange rate movements and
higher volumes. While lower raw material prices brought cost relief,
earnings were diminished by these price effects largely being passed

up from 16.7% in the prior year.
In fiscal 2015, net positive exceptional items amounted to €18 ­million,
resulting from positive exceptional items of €20 million and negative
exceptional items of €2 million. The positive ­exceptional items, of
which €19 million did not impact EBITDA, were ­mainly the result of
reversing impairment charges recognized in pre­vious years on a­ ssets
of the former Rubber Chemicals business unit. The negative exceptional items of €1 million that impacted EBITDA were the b

Sales in the Performance Chemicals segment in fiscal 2015 rose
by €96 million, or 4.8%, to €2,085 million. With a share of 8.2%,
positive exchange rate developments were the main contributor to
this increase. While lower volumes reduced sales by 3.1%, selling
prices nearly matched the prior-year level.
Development varied across the individual business units in this
segment. While selling prices in the Material Protection Products
and Inorganic Pigments business units were above the prior-year
level, the other business units saw a slight decline in selling prices.
With the exception of the Liquid Purification Technologies business unit, all business units posted lower volumes. All business

EBITDA pre exceptionals for the Reconciliation came to minus

This change was mainly due to expenses incurred in currency
hedging. The negative exceptional items of €43 million reported
in the Reconciliation, which fully impacted EBITDA, mainly related
to the “Let’s LANXESS again” program. The prior-year negative
exceptional items of €79 million shown in the Reconciliation, which
impacted EBITDA, mainly related to measures associated with the

Structure of the statement of financial position
Total assets of the LANXESS Group amounted to €7,219 million
as of ­December 31, 2015, a decrease of €31 million, or 0.4%, on
the prior­- year figure. This was primarily due to the reduction in
­inventories and trade receivables. The development of property,
plant and equipment had an opposing effect. The ratio of non-­
current assets to total assets increased from 56.6% to 57.9%. On
the equity and liabilities side, equity increased mainly due to net
comprehensive income. At the end of fiscal 2015, the equity ratio
was 32.2%, after 29.8% in the previous year.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

Non-current assets rose by €79 million to €4,180 million, with i­ntangible
assets and property, plant and equipment increasing by €94 million
to €3,747 million. Cash outflows for purchases of property, plant
and equipment and intangible assets in the reporting period were
€434 million, below the prior-year level of €614 million. Depreciation
and amortization totaled €474 million, which was €48 million above the
prior-year level of €426 million. They were partially set off by reversals
of impairment charges recognized in previous years on the assets of
cash-generating units, amounting to €56 million. The carrying amount
of investments accounted for using the equity method was €0 million,
the same as in the prior year. Deferred taxes decreased by €19 million
to €361 million. The ratio of non-current assets to total assets was
57.9%, up from 56.6% on December 31, 2014.
Current assets decreased by €110 million or 3.5% compared with
December 31, 2014, to €3,039 million. Inventories were down by
€35 million, or 2.5%, to €1,349 million, principally due to the lower
prices for certain key raw materials. The development of exchange
rates and a slight increase in volumes had an opposing effect. Days of
inventory outstanding (DIO) increased from 79.1 to 84.3. By contrast,
trade receivables were €59 million, or 5.8%, lower at €956 ­million,
despite opposing currency effects. Days of sales outstanding (DSO)
were virtually unchanged at 47.6. Cash and cash equivalents decreased €52 million, to €366 million. Near-cash assets amounted to
€100 ­million, as in the prior year. The ratio of current assets to total
assets was 42.1%, against 43.4% as of December 31, 2014.
The LANXESS Group has internally generated intangible assets
that are not reflected in the statement of financial position in light
of accounting rules. These include the brand equity of LANXESS
and the value of other brands of the Group.

Non-current liabilities as of December 31, 2015, fell by €511 ­million
to €2,936 million. Provisions for pensions and other post-­
employment benefits declined by €75 million compared with the
end of 2014, to €1,215 million. This was primarily due to increased
discount rates, particularly in Germany. Other non-current financial
liabilities amounted to €1,258 million, down by €440 million against
December 31, 2014. This was because a bond that is due to mature
in 2016 and a loan were reclassified to current financial liabilities.
The ratio of non-current liabilities to total assets was 40.7%, up
from 47.6% as of December 31, 2014.
Current liabilities came to €1,960 million, up by €318 million or
19.4% from December 31, 2014. At €779 million, trade payables
were €20 million below the prior-year figure, due mainly to ­lower
raw material prices. Shifts in exchange rates had an ­opposing
­effect. Current derivative liabilities were on a level with the prior
year at €100 million. The reclassification of the bond and loan
from non-current to current financial liabilities was the main
­reason for the €261 million increase in current financial liabilities
to €443 million. Other current liabilities decreased by €24 ­million
to €142 ­million, while other current provisions increased by
€61 million to €411 ­million. This was attributable to additions for
­restructuring measures and for variable compensation. The ratio
of current ­liabilities to total assets was 27.1% as of December 31,
2015, against 22.6% at the end of 2014.
At €1,211 million, net financial liabilities were substantially below
the figure of €1,336 million at December 31, 2014.

Equity amounted to €2,323 million, up by €162 million or 7.5%
compared with December 31, 2014, primarily due to the net comprehensive income posted in the reporting period. The ratio of
equity to the Group’s total assets was 32.2% as of December 31,
2015, after 29.8% as of December 31, 2014.

Capital expenditures
In 2015, capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets came to €457 million, compared with €692 million
the year before, and led to cash outflows of €434 million (2014:
€614 million). Depreciation and amortization in the same period
totaled €474 million (2014: €426 million). They were c­ ounteracted
by reversals of impairment charges amounting to €56 million. The
figure for depreciation and amortization included €11 million in
write-downs reported as exceptional items (2014: write-downs of
€20 million). After adjustment for these exceptional items, c­ apital
expenditures were approximately level with depreciation and amortization (2014: 70% above depreciation and amortization).

In regional terms, 36% of our capital expenditures in the reporting
period were made in Germany, 20% in the EMEA region (excluding
Germany), 17% in North America, 5% in Latin America and 22%
in Asia-Pacific. Capital expenditures in Germany mostly comprised
our investments to increase capacities and modernize facilities in
all segments, especially investments in the Saltigo and Liquid Purification Technologies business units. The continued large share of
capital expenditures made in the Asia-Pacific region is due primarily
to the construction of a new production plant for EPDM rubber for
our High Performance Elastomers business unit in Changzhou,
China, completed in the reporting year, and to the construction of
a new plant for iron oxide red pigments for the Inorganic Pigments
business unit in Ningbo, China.

In the reporting year, capital expenditures focused on the following
areas:
Expansion and maintenance of existing facilities, construction
of new facilities
nn Measures to increase plant availability
nn Projects to improve plant safety, enhance quality and comply
with environmental protection requirements
nn

Around two-thirds of the capital expenditures in 2015 went to
maintain existing facilities, while the rest went toward expansion
or efficiency improvement measures.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

In the Performance Polymers segment, capital expenditures totaled €190 million (2014: €472 million), €184 million (2014:
€428 ­million) of which were cash outflows. Depreciation and amortization less reversals of impairment charges stood at €227 million (2014: €231 million). The major capital expenditures in this
­segment were made in the Tire & Specialty Rubbers business
unit. Capital expenditures in the Advanced Intermediates segment
­amounted to €99 ­million (2014: €100 million). Cash outflows stood
at €87 ­million (2014: €90 million), which exceeded depreciation
and ­amortization less reversals of impairment charges of €80 million
(2014: €93 million). These included a number of smaller capital
­expenditure projects, as well as initial cash outflows in connection
with the construction of two multi-purpose production lines for the
Saltigo business unit at the Leverkusen site in Germany, which will
­begin in 2016. Production is due to start at the end of 2017. In the
Performance Chemicals segment, capital expenditures came to
€144 million (2014: €94 million), €139 million (2014: €71 million)
of which were cash outflows. Depreciation and amortization stood
at €88 million (2014: €82 million). A major investment project is the
construction of a state-of-the-art plant for iron oxide red pigments
in Ningbo, China, for the Inorganic Pigments business unit.

Cash provided by operating activities, before changes in net working
capital, decreased by €51 million to €599 million in fiscal 2015.
The starting point was the €208 million increase in income before
income taxes to €288 million. Depreciation and amortization of
€474 million, less reversals of impairment charges of €56 million,
were €48 million higher than the figure of €426 million for the prior
year. The other items in the reporting year included tax payments,
effects from currency hedging transactions and cash outflows for
variable compensation. Moreover, cash outflows associated with
the realignment program were much higher than in the prior year.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

Combined Management Report

The decrease in net working capital against December 31, 2014,
resulted in a cash inflow of €93 million compared with €147 ­million
in the prior year. The inflow in the reporting period resulted in
­particular from the decline in inventories and trade receivables,
with the r­ eduction in trade payables having an opposing effect.
Therefore, the net cash provided by operating activities totaled
€692 million, against €797 million in 2014.
LANXESS’s investing activities in fiscal 2015 resulted in a cash
outflow of €400 million, down from €587 million in the previous
year. Disbursements for intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment came to €434 million, which was below the prior-year
level of €614 million. The sale of intangible assets and property,
plant and equipment resulted in a cash inflow of €45 million (2014:
€8 million).
Free cash flow – the difference between the cash inflows from
­operating activities and the cash used in investing activities –
­increased by €82 million to €292 million.
Net cash used in financing activities came to €333 million, against
€222 million the year before. A significant effect in 2015 was the
net repayment of borrowings amounting to €220 million. In the
prior year, a major effect came from the cash inflow of €433 ­million
­resulting from the capital increase, although it was more than offset
by the cash outflow of €478 million attributable to the net ­repayment
of borrowings. Interest payments and other financial disbursements of €76 million were well below the previous year’s amount
of €131 million. As in 2014, an outflow of €46 million was ­accounted
for by the dividend paid to the stockholders of LANXESS AG for
fiscal 2014.
The net change in cash and cash equivalents from business activities
in fiscal 2015 was minus €41 million, against minus €12 million the
previous year. After taking into account currency-related and other
negative changes in cash and cash equivalents of €11 ­million, cash
and cash equivalents at the closing date amounted to €366 million, against €418 million at the previous year’s closing date.

Taken ­together with near-cash assets (short-term investment of
liquid ­assets in money market funds) of €100 million, which were
­unchanged against the prior year, the Group retained a solid liquidity
position of €466 million as of December 31, 2015, compared with
€518 million at the end of 2014.

Principles and objectives of financial management
LANXESS pursues a conservative financial policy characterized
by the forward-looking management of financial risks. Our aim is
to be able to provide sufficient liquidity to our business operations
at all times, regardless of cyclical fluctuations in the real ­economy
or ­financial markets. The debt level is largely aligned with the
­ratio ­systems of the leading rating agencies for investment-grade
­companies and, along with free cash flow, is the focus of financial
management. In addition to liquidity risk, financial management also
covers other financial risks, such as interest and foreign exchange
risks. Here too, we aim to mitigate the financial risks that arise and
increase planning reliability, partly by using derivative financial instruments. Detailed information about the management of these risks
is contained in the “Opportunity and risk report” in this combined
management report and under Note [36], “Financial instruments,”
to the consolidated financial statements.

LANXESS Group ratings
Access to the capital markets and good relations with German
and international commercial banks are essential for achieving our
financial management objectives. Accordingly, ongoing dialogue
and communication with banks, investors and rating agencies are
of crucial importance. In fiscal 2015, the rating agencies Standard
& Poor’s and Moody’s confirmed their ratings for LANXESS of
BBB– and Baa3, respectively. On March 11, 2015, Fitch confirmed –
and then subsequently discontinued – its unsolicited rating of
BBB–. Following the announcement of the partnership with Saudi
­Aramco in September 2015, Standard & Poor’s raised its outlook
from “­stable” to “positive,” while Moody’s kept its outlook at “­stable.”
Both rating agencies gave a positive opinion of the planned transaction and emphasized the improved debt situation along with
additional financial flexibility resulting from the expected proceeds.

Statement of financial position and financial condition

Financing analysis
In fiscal 2015, LANXESS retained a balanced financing structure
and a very solid liquidity position.
The CNH 500 million renminbi bond that matured in February 2015
was redeemed from available cash funds. Ahead of schedule, we
repaid two tranches totaling €114 million on a development bank
loan in order to further reduce gross indebtedness and the interest
burden. We repaid debts and funded current investments, business
operations and the “Let’s LANXESS again” restructuring program
from operating cash flow and existing liquidity.
In March 2009, LANXESS launched a debt issuance program
with a current volume of €2.5 billion. On this basis and aligned
with the prevailing market conditions, bonds can be placed on the
capital market very flexibly with respect to timing and volume. As
of ­December 31, 2015, just under €1.5 billion of the €2.5 ­billion
­financing facility had been utilized to issue bonds and private placements. The volume of the debt issuance program can be adjusted
flexibly in line with future requirements so as to ensure financial headroom. As of March 20, 2015, LANXESS Finance B.V. was replaced
as the issuer of the bonds and private placements under the debt
issuance program by LANXESS AG, which is the original guarantor
of the bonds. Capital market financing is a central ­component in
LANXESS’s financing mix, which is subject to regular review to
ensure the adequate ­diversification of our financing sources and
our strategic alignment.
Current financial liabilities increased from €182 million in 2014
to €443 million at December 31, 2015, largely due to the reclassification from non-current financial liabilities of the bond that will
mature in 2016 and of a loan.
We made only limited use of finance leases, which are reported
as financial liabilities in the statement of financial position. As of
­December 31, 2015, the financial liabilities from finance leases
were on a level with the prior year at €71 million. The LANXESS
Group uses operating leases mainly for operational reasons and
not as a means of financing. Minimum non-discounted future
­payments r­ elating to operating leases totaled €341 million (2014:
€390 ­million).

As of December 31, 2015, LANXESS had no material financing
items not reported in the statement of financial position in the form of
factoring, asset-backed structures or project financing, for example.
LANXESS’s total financial liabilities, net of accrued interest, declined
from €1,854 million in 2014 to €1,677 million at December 31,
2015. Net financial liabilities – the total financial liabilities net of cash,
cash equivalents and near-cash assets – declined by €125 million
to €1,211 million.
Of the total financial liabilities, 90% bear a fixed interest rate over
the term of the financing, which is above the prior-year ­level of 86%.
This resulted especially from the reduction in gross i­ndebtedness
achieved by repaying variable-rate loans, which made good
­economic sense. Interest rate changes do not have a material
­effect on LANXESS’s financial condition considering the current
­financing structure. The proportion of loans and bonds ­denominated
in euros averaged 90% in the reporting year, which was above the
prior-year level of 79%. The weighted average interest rate for our
financial liabilities was 3.8% at year end 2015, which was level
with the prior year.
The following overview shows LANXESS’s financing structure as
of December 31, 2015, in detail, including its principal liquidity
reserves.

Combined Management Report

In 2015, in the context of our realignment and with a view to liabilities that are due to mature in the years ahead, we made targeted
debt repayments as a means of actively managing our financing
structure – which has been continuously improved in past fiscal
years – and safeguarding our long-term liquidity. No refinancing
risks existed at the time these financial statements were prepared.
In particular, the redemption of the €200 million bond that is due
to mature in September 2016 is assured on the basis of existing
liquidity and credit lines. The other loans related mainly to the use of
credit facilities by subsidiaries in Brazil, China, India and Argentina,
most of which mature in 2016 and are extended on a regular, e.g.
annual, basis.

Thanks to our good liquidity position, our solvency was assured at all
times in fiscal 2015. This is an aspect that was assessed positively
by the rating agencies in their credit ratings in 2015.
By far the most important of LANXESS’s credit lines is the ­syndicated
credit facility of €1.25 billion, which has not been significantly drawn
upon to date. In February 2015, we extended this facility by one
year until February 2020. This credit facility is designed as an
­operating line of credit and to provide funds for capital investment.
It ­corresponds to market requirements in the European syndicated
loan market for investment-grade companies with a BBB rating.
Another important credit line is the €150 million facility we agreed
with the European Investment Bank in fiscal 2014. None of our
major loan agreements contains a financial covenant. LANXESS had
unused credit lines totaling around €1.5 billion as of December 31,
2015, unchanged against the end of the previous year.
The total of liquid assets and undrawn credit lines gives us a ­liquidity
scope of around €2.0 billion, as in the prior year. This liquidity
­reserve secures our entrepreneurial flexibility and serves as back-up
financing for our global realignment program; it is an expression of
our conservative financial policy. Our solvency is safeguarded for
the short and long term.

Liquidity analysis
In addition to cash and cash equivalents of €366 million and investments in highly liquid AAA money market funds of €100 million,
LANXESS has additional sizeable liquidity reserves in the form of
undrawn credit facilities. The investments in money market funds are
undertaken only at European Group companies that are not subject
to restrictions on foreign exchange and capital transfers. We can
therefore freely dispose of the funds. Around 90% of our cash, cash
equivalents and highly liquid money market funds is held in Group
companies in countries with no restrictions on foreign exchange and
capital transfers. The remaining some 10% is held in companies
in regulated capital markets where cash transfers are restricted.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

An important indicator for corporate bonds, apart from the ­absolute
change in price, is the relative valuation of the risk specific to the
issuer in comparison with a reference interest rate. This credit risk
premium is expressed in what is known as the credit spread. Due
to the higher default risk associated with longer bond maturity,
long-term bonds generally feature a wider credit spread. This and
factors such as liquidity and trading volume also apply to the v­ arious
LANXESS bonds. The following chart shows the evolution of the
credit spreads of our bonds and the average credit spread of corporate bonds with a BBB rating and a five-year maturity in comparison
with the interest rate swap curve.

Statement of financial position and financial condition
Management’s summary of business development and the fiscal year

At €7,902 million, LANXESS Group sales in 2015 declined by 1.3%
from €8,006 million in the prior year. Our Performance Polymers
segment posted a decrease in sales, due especially to price pressure
resulting from lower procurement prices for raw materials and to
the persistently challenging competitive situation. In the Advanced
Intermediates segment, sales were more or less flat with the previous year thanks to good demand for agrochemicals and from
other customer markets. Business in our Performance Chemicals
segment was characterized by lower volumes and selling prices at
about the same level as the prior year.

The credit risk premiums on BBB corporate bonds declined further
in the first quarter of 2015 from a comparatively low level. They then
increased in the second half of 2015. By contrast, the credit risk
premiums on LANXESS bonds remained stable in 2015 despite
their slightly lower rating of BBB–. They were most recently at a
comparable level to those of other companies with BBB ratings.
The development of our credit spreads underscores the fact that we
retain very competitive access to capital market financing.

Management’s summary
of business development and
the fiscal year
In 2015, the LANXESS Group’s business continued to be characterized by the persistently difficult competitive environment
for synthetic rubbers. Against this background, we continued to
­successfully drive forward our global realignment program. Volumes
across the Group remained at around the prior-year level. In view
of the generally lower raw material prices, selling prices had to be
adjusted in all segments. The efficiency measures that have been
implemented and the favorable exchange rate effects more than
offset the impacts of the challenging business environment. We
view the development of earnings as positive overall.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

EBITDA pre exceptionals in 2015 increased by 9.5% to €885 ­million
from €808 million in the prior year. This was principally attributable
to favorable currency effects, cost savings and efficiency improvements.
Net income and earnings per share improved significantly in comparison to the prior year, rising from €47 million to €165 million
and €0.53 to €1.80, respectively.
We upheld our conservative accounting and financing policy in 2015
as well. In accordance with the consistency principle, we essentially
applied the same measurement methods and exercised the same
discretion as in the previous year. Our equity ratio improved from
29.8% to 32.2%, which was mainly attributable to net income. Total
assets were at the level of the prior year.
Our statement of financial position shows that our liquidity position
remains solid. Additional substantial liquidity reserves in the form of
undrawn credit lines are also available. Of the total financial liabilities,
90% bear a fixed interest rate over the term of the financing, which
is above the prior-year level of 86%. Our financial liabilities are free
of financial covenants.
Our net financial liabilities declined by €125 million to €1,211 million.
In fiscal 2015, the rating agencies Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s
confirmed our ratings of BBB– and Baa3, respectively. Following the
announcement of the partnership with Saudi Aramco, Standard &
Poor’s raised its outlook from “stable” to “positive,” while Moody’s
kept its outlook at “stable.”
We continue to regard our business situation as positive. We are
responding to the changes and challenges confronting the European
chemical industry especially with our program for the global realignment of the LANXESS Group. Through its new strategic alignment,
LANXESS aims to become a less cyclical specialty chemicals group
with a strong cash flow and a more balanced portfolio.

Earnings, asset and
financial position of ­LANXESS AG
LANXESS AG serves primarily as the management holding company for the LANXESS Group. The principal management functions for the entire Group are performed by the Board of Management. The Board of Management shapes Group strategy and
manages resource allocation, infrastructure and organization. The
Group management company is also responsible for financing and
­communication with LANXESS’s key stakeholders. The ­economic
performance of LANXESS AG depends principally on the ­operating
business entities in the LANXESS Group and on the development

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

of the chemical industry. The balance of income and losses from
investments in affiliated companies resulting from profit or loss
­t ransfers and dividends from affiliated companies is of key im­
portance for the future ability of LANXESS AG to pay a dividend.
Therefore, especially the statements made in the “Opportunity and
risk report” in this combined management report apply in principle
to LANXESS AG as well.
The financial statements of LANXESS AG are prepared in accordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB) and the German
Stock Corporation Act (AktG).

Carryforward to new account

The earnings of LANXESS AG are largely determined by profit
or loss transfers from LANXESS Deutschland GmbH. Following
the merging of LANXESS International Holding GmbH, Cologne,
Germany, with LANXESS Deutschland GmbH, Cologne, Germany,
the latter holds the shares of all other subsidiaries and affiliates both
in Germany and elsewhere.
Sales at LANXESS AG stood at €4 million, which was slightly ­lower
than the prior-year level of €5 million. They related to ­services
­provided to LANXESS Deutschland GmbH. A balanced result
­remained after deducting the cost of sales, which consisted ­mostly
of personnel expenses and appropriate shares of the general administration expenses.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

General administration expenses increased against the prior
year, up €1 million, or 2.3%, to €44 million. They principally comprised personnel and other business expenses not directly related
to the services provided to Group companies. The decrease in
­other operating income was primarily due to the reversal of fewer
­provisions. Other operating expenses decreased by €10 million,
or 71.4%, to €4 million, mainly because of the lower costs for the
“Let’s LANXESS again” program. The operating result improved
by €7 million to minus €16 million.
The financial result, which comprises the balance of income and
­losses from investments in affiliated companies, the net ­interest
position, income from other securities and loans included in ­financial
non-­current assets, and other financial income and ­expense,
­increased by €245 million to €208 million. This change was
­primarily due to the profit transfer of €252 million from LANXESS
Deutschland GmbH, which was €185 million higher than in the
prior year. A major effect came from, for example, the distribution of
historical profits. The financial result was also positively influenced
by the €13 million improvement in the net interest position to minus
€44 million, which was mainly brought about by bundling external
finance at LANXESS AG.
Income before income taxes came to €192 million, after minus
€60 million in the prior year. Income taxes resulted in expenses of
€101 million. These were comprised of tax expenses of €63 ­million
for fiscal 2015 and €38 million for previous years. Net income
for 2015 was €91 million after a net loss of €85 million in the
previous year.
Taking into account the profit carryforward of €7 million, the
­d istributable profit as of December 31, 2015, increased to
€98 ­million from €53 million at the end of 2014.

In view of its function as a strategic holding company, the statement
of financial position of LANXESS AG is dominated by financial assets
and liabilities and by receivables from, and payables to, subsidiaries.
LANXESS AG had total assets of €3,432 million as of December 31,
2015, which was €548 million, or 19.0%, above the ­prior-year figure.
Non-current assets were €956 million and primarily included the
carrying amount of the investment in LANXESS D
­ eutschland GmbH,
which stands at €739 million, and loans of €198 ­million to subsidiaries. The share of non-current assets in total assets increased
from 26.3% to 27.9%. Current assets increased by €345 million,
or 16.3%, to €2,467 million and accounted for 71.8% of total
­assets, compared with 73.6% in 2014. Receivables from subsidiaries accounted for 59.3% of total assets and related principally to
short-term loans, financial transactions and claims to profit or loss
transfers. The share of bank balances and securities in total assets
decreased from 12.1% to 11.9%.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

Equity increased by €45 million to €1,518 million, largely due to
net income of €91 million, which was partly offset by the dividend
payment for 2014. The equity ratio was 44.2%, after 51.1% at the
end of 2014.
Liabilities increased by €461 million to €1,769 million, mainly
because of the takeover of bonds amounting to €1,400 million
and the reduction in payables to affiliated companies, which was
€1,078 ­million below the prior-year figure at €219 million. These
two opposing changes resulted from LANXESS AG assuming
­responsibility for the external financing of LANXESS companies
from LANXESS Finance B.V., Sittard-Geleen, Netherlands. The provisions increased by €42 million to €145 million and related mainly
to commitments to employees and to statutory and ­contractual
obligations.

Employees
As of December 31, 2015, the LANXESS Group had a total of
16,225 employees, against 16,584 at the closing date of the prior
year. Our global headcount continued to reflect the measures taken
to realign the company. Some 1,000 positions in administration and
service units, marketing, and research and development worldwide
were identified for reduction by the end of 2015 as part of the first
phase of our realignment (competitiveness of the business and
administrative structure).
In the EMEA region (excluding Germany), the number of employees
as of December 31, 2015, was 3,143, down from 3,267 in the pre­
vious year. In Germany, the headcount declined from 7,747 to 7,523.
The number of employees in the North America region amounted
to 1,312, after 1,371 as of December 31, 2014, while Latin America
saw its workforce shrink from 1,467 at the end of last year to 1,412.
At the reporting date, we employed 2,835 people in the Asia-Pacific
region, which is 103 more than a year ago. This increase is related
to the start-up and construction of production facilities.
A total of 13,345, or 82.2%, of our employees were men and
2,880, or 17.8%, were women. The number of employees who
were non-German nationals was 9,165. In addition, 969 employees
worldwide worked on temporary contracts for the Group. LANXESS
AG had 127 employees as of the reporting date, versus 139 the
year before.

Employees

As of the end of 2015, the Group had a total of 500 trainees in
19 different career paths and six combined vocational training and
study programs. LANXESS thus continues to train more young
­people than it needs to meet its own requirements. In 2015, despite
our realignment program, we hired 80% of those who completed
their vocational training with us in Germany.

an interactive approach to develop a new value model which they
discussed with employees in numerous workshops held at almost
all our sites around the world. Other focal points of HR strategy
were implementing and supporting global restructuring activities
and designing the organization of ARLANXEO, our new partnership
with Saudi Aramco.

Part-time employees accounted for 6.8% of the workforce at our
German core companies as of the reporting date. Individuals with
severe disabilities made up 5.5% of the workforce at our German
companies. In addition, we routinely award contracts to work ­centers
for the disabled.

In addition to developing and implementing innovative ­concepts
for addressing the challenges resulting from d
­ emographic change,
our top long-term strategic human resources goal is to attract and
cultivate a range of talented employees for LANXESS worldwide.
We aim to strengthen our d
­ iversity, particularly in terms of age,
national origin and gender.

Indicators for the assessment of occupational safety at LANXESS
are the recordable incident rate (RIR) and injuries for every million
hours worked (MAQ). In 2015, the MAQ was 2.2 and thus slightly
below the prior-year level. The RIR, which was recently introduced
at LANXESS to enhance international comparability, was 0.8 in
both 2015 and 2014.
Personnel expenses for the LANXESS Group in fiscal 2015 ­totaled
€1,432 million (2014: €1,457 million). Wages and salaries, at
€1,124 million (2014: €1,106 million), accounted for the greater part
of this figure. Social security contributions were €198 m
­ illion (2014:
€202 million), while pension plan expenses totaled €97 ­million
(2014: €136 million) and social assistance benefits €13 million
(2014: €13 million).

HR strategy
Our long-term entrepreneurial success is fundamentally based on
our employees’ sense of responsibility, professionalism and focus
on finding solutions. We as a company will only be able to continue
successfully exploiting the opportunities presented by evolving
markets if we constantly invest in employee training and development – in particular in their ability to act on the basis of values, to
take a fresh approach and swiftly implement ideas, and to work as
part of a team in developing solutions.
In 2015, our HR strategy continued to support the realignment
of the Group. In order to shape and steer the cultural shift we are
seeking, the Board of Management and senior executives used

Combined Management Report

Compensation report

Annual base salary

Compensation of the Board of Management
The structure of the compensation system and the level of compensation for the members of the Board of Management are determined
by the Supervisory Board. The appropriateness of the compensation
is regularly reviewed. The criteria for determining the appropriateness of the compensation for an individual Board of Management
member include, in particular, his duties, his personal performance,
the economic situation, and the success and sustainable growth of
the LANXESS Group. Consideration is also given to compensation
at comparable companies and the company’s overall compensation
structure, including as well the ratio between the compensation of
the Board of Management and that of LANXESS’s senior executives
and the rest of the workforce, both overall and as a function of time.
The compensation structure is also designed to be competitive in
the international market for highly qualified executives and provide
the motivation to successfully work toward sustainable corporate
development.
The compensation system that was introduced for members of
the Board of Management in 2010 was approved by the Annual
Stockholders’ Meeting of LANXESS AG on May 28, 2010. This
compensation system was applied when concluding the service
contracts with all Board of Management members.
The components of the compensation for members of the Board of
Management are the annual base salary; the variable components,
which are the Annual Performance Payment, the Long-Term Stock
Performance Plan and the Long-Term Performance Bonus; and a
retirement pension. The three variable components are linked to
LANXESS’s annual performance and, particularly, to its corporate success over a number of years. The average compensation
mix of 31% annual base salary and 69% variable compensation
­components, assuming 100% target attainment, is strongly aligned
with the company’s performance and long-term value creation. The
present service contracts for members of the Board of Management set out the annual base salary and caps on the amounts for
the variable compensation components. They do not provide for
a separate cap on total compensation, even taking into account a
possible discretionary bonus.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

The fixed compensation comprises the annual base salary and
compensation in kind, the latter consisting mainly of the tax value
of perquisites, such as the use of a company car. The annual base
salary of the members of the Board of Management is market-­
oriented and in line with that paid at other comparable companies.

Variable compensation
The annual performance-based component of the variable compensation, known as the Annual Performance Payment (APP), is
based on corporate business targets and other conditions, such as
the attainment of certain Group EBITDA targets, which are defined
by the Supervisory Board before the beginning of the respective
fiscal year. In the case of 100% target attainment, the individual
APP budget for 2015 for Mr. Zachert is 125% and for the other
members of the Board of Management 100% of their respective
annual base salaries. The maximum payment is defined on an annual
basis by the Supervisory Board. For fiscal 2015 and 2016, it has
been capped at 150% of the individual budgets for the members
of the Board of Management - assuming 100% target attainment.
Actual payments may differ from the amount calculated in advance.
The Long-Term Stock Performance Plan (LTSP) is another element
of variable compensation. This compensation component is based
on the performance of LANXESS stock against a reference index,
the Dow Jones STOXX 600 ChemicalsSM. The LTSP responds to
the call by legislators for a stronger focus on long-term company
performance. The LTSP is divided into four four-year tranches. The
possible payment per tranche is 30% of the individual target income,
assuming 100% target attainment. The condition for participation
in the LTSP is a prior personal investment each year in LANXESS
shares to a value of 5% of the annual base salary. These shares are
subject to an average vesting period of five years (LTSP 2010 –
2013) and four years (LTSP 2014 – 2017). The LTSP 2014 – 2017
program uses the MSCI World Chemicals Index as a new reference
index. There were no further material changes compared to the
LTSP 2010 – 2013.
For more information, particularly regarding the valuation
­parameters applied, please see Note [15] to the consolidated
­financial statements.
The personnel expenses in fiscal 2015 for share-based compensation for active members of the Board of Management were
€450 thousand for Mr. Zachert (2014: €100 thousand) and
€245 thousand for Dr. van Roessel (2014: €428 thousand). As in
the prior year, there were no expenses for Dr. Fink or Mr. ­Pontzen
in the current fiscal year. The personnel expenses for former

149

Compensation report

members of the Board of Management were €0 thousand for
Dr. ­Heitmann (2014: €564 thousand), €0 thousand for Dr. Breuers
(2014: €1,056 thousand) and €755 thousand for Dr. Düttmann
(2014: €20 thousand).
The Long-Term Performance Bonus (LTPB), which is the third
­variable compensation component, is likewise aligned with longterm corporate performance. It rewards target attainment only after
two successive fiscal years. The basis for calculating the LTPB is
the individual APP target attainment for the fiscal years in question.
The exact amount of the LTPB results from the average individual
APP target attainment for the two fiscal years. Assuming an average
APP target attainment of 100%, the LTPB amounts to 45% of the
annual base salary. Actual payments in 2016 and 2017 may differ
from the amounts calculated in advance.

Combined Management Report

The aggregate compensation of the entire Board of Management
totaled €9,360 thousand (2014: €9,982 thousand), comprising
€2,641 thousand (2014: €4,940 thousand) in non-performance-­
related components, €5,651 thousand (2014: €3,641 thousand)
in performance-related components and €1,068 thousand (2014:
€1,401 thousand) in components with a long-term incentive effect.
In 2014, Mr. Zachert received a one-time payment of €2,000 thousand in partial recompense for the variable compensation for several
years originally agreed under his previous employment contract
but not paid out because of his move to LANXESS AG. His total
compensation therefore amounted to €5,174 thousand in 2014.
The table shows the total compensation of the other members of
the Board of Management.

Retirement pensions
On termination of their service contracts, the members of the Board
of Management receive benefits under the company pension plan.
These benefits are paid when the beneficiary reaches age 60 or
if the beneficiary is permanently unable to work. They are paid to
surviving dependents in the event of the beneficiary’s death.
The pension plan for the members of the Board of Management is a
defined contribution plan stipulating a basic contribution to be made
by the company equal to 25% of the annual base salary and APP.
The maximum amount taken into account for calculating the APP
contribution is that due on 100% target attainment, irrespective of
the actual target attainment. Moreover, the members of the Board
of Management must themselves pay an amount from deferred
compensation amounting to 12.5% of the APP. The members of
the Board of Management may increase their personal contribution
to up to 25% of the APP. From the date of entitlement, up to 30%
of the accumulated capital – including the interest thereon – may
be converted to a pension benefit. There are claims arising from
provisions in place before 2006 that are granted as vested rights
to individual members of the Board of Management. If the service
contract ends before the beneficiary reaches the age of 60, the
company pays certain additional benefits up to a defined ceiling.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

LANXESS has established provisions for the future claims of Board
of Management members. The total service cost recognized under
IFRS accounting rules in the 2015 consolidated financial statements
for this purpose was €1,640 thousand (2014: €2,496 thousand).
The present value of the obligations for the members of the Board of
Management serving as of December 31, 2015, was €11,903 thousand (2014: €9,994 thousand). Under IFRS accounting p
­ rinciples,
the service cost for pension entitlements earned in 2015 and the
present value of the obligations, including acquired rights, as of
December 31, 2015, amounted to, respectively, €597 thousand
and €2,716 thousand (2014: €1,574 thousand and €1,993 thousand) for Mr. Zachert, €43 thousand and €2,322 thousand for
Dr. Fink, €432 thousand and €1,018 thousand for Mr. Pontzen,
and €151 thousand and €5,847 thousand (2014: €148 thousand
and €5,906 thousand) for Dr. van Roessel. The service cost for
Dr. Düttmann for his service on the Board of Management in 2015
came to €417 thousand.
The net expense for pension entitlements recognized under HGB
accounting rules in the 2015 annual financial statements for this
purpose was €2,628 thousand (2014: €109 thousand). This amount
includes expenses in connection with pension entitlements for
Dr. Düttmann of €295 thousand. The present value of the obligations
for the members of the Board of Management serving as of December 31, 2015, was €10,307 thousand (2014: €7,787 thousand).
Under HGB accounting rules, the present value of the obligations,

thousand for Dr. Fink, €802 thousand for Mr. Pontzen and €5,341
thousand for Dr. van Roessel (2014: €4,856 thousand).
As of December 31, 2015, obligations to former members of the
Board of Management totaled €30,318 thousand (2014: €27,921
thousand) under IFRS accounting rules and €26,682 thousand
(2014: €21,215 thousand) under HGB accounting rules. In 2015,

Compensation report

Benefits associated with and following termination
of service on the Board of Management
The members of the Board of Management have indemnification
rights should their service contracts be terminated for defined reasons at the instigation of the company or in the event of a m
­ aterial
change of control over the company. The terms depend on the
­respective circumstances and include severance payments amounting to up to two times the annual base salary or, in the event of a
change of control, three times the annual base salary, plus the APP
and LTPB assuming 100% target achievement and compensation pro rata temporis of LTSP rights. On the basis of agreements
­existing with Dr. Fink and Mr. Pontzen, the calculation of severance
­payments to be made in the event of early termination of their service
­contracts does not include the LTPB and LTSP variable compensation components.

Dr. Breuers left the company on expiration of his service contract
effective May 31, 2015. He had already resigned from the Board of
Management effective August 5, 2014. The contractually agreed
terms of his compensation remained applicable until he left the
company. At that time, existing LTSP rights were evaluated at €1.00
per right and compensation paid pro rata, depending on the length
of the vesting period that had already elapsed. This resulted in an
entitlement of €729 thousand in 2014. In addition, Dr. Breuers
was granted and paid a severance payment of €1,690 thousand
comprising a target income, which was the annual base salary plus
the APP and LTPB assuming 100% target attainment.
In 2015, compensation of former members of the Board of Management totaled €3,673 thousand (2014: €1,983 thousand).

Other benefits
No additional benefits have been pledged to any member of the
Board of Management in the event of termination of their service.
Dr. Düttmann resigned from the Board of Management by mutual
agreement effective March 31, 2015, and left the company. Up to
this time, the contractually agreed benefits were granted and paid,
including the variable compensation for fiscal 2015 that had already
been earned. At that time, existing LTSP rights were evaluated at
€1.00 per right and compensation paid pro rata, depending on the
length of the vesting period that had already elapsed. This resulted
in an entitlement of €857 thousand. In addition, Dr. Düttmann was
granted a severance payment of €3,380 thousand comprising two
times the target income, which was the annual base salary plus the
APP and LTPB assuming 100% target attainment.
In the prior year, Dr. Heitmann resigned from the Board of Management by mutual agreement effective February 21, 2014, and left the
company. Up to this time, the contractually agreed benefits were
granted and paid, including the variable compensation for fiscal
2013 that had already been earned. Dr. Heitmann waived further
claims, i.e. to variable compensation (APP and LTPB) pro rata,
compensation for existing LTSP rights or other severance payments.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

In 2015, no member of the Board of Management received benefits
or assurances of benefits from third parties in respect of their duties
as members of the Board of Management.
No loans were granted to members of the Board of Management
in fiscal 2015.

Compensation report

Compensation of the Supervisory Board
The compensation of the Supervisory Board is governed by Section
12 of the company’s articles of association. The members of the
Supervisory Board of LANXESS AG receive fixed compensation
of €80 thousand per year. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board
receives three times, and the Vice Chairman one and a half times,
this amount. Serving as the chair or a member of Supervisory Board
committees is compensated separately in accordance with the
German Corporate Governance Code. Supervisory Board members
who belong to a committee receive one half of the fixed compen­
sation amount in addition. The chair of the Audit Committee receives
a further half. Supervisory Board members who chair a committee
other than the Audit Committee receive a further quarter. However,
no member may receive in total more than three times the fixed
compensation amount.
Supervisory Board members are reimbursed for their expenses in
addition and also receive an attendance allowance of €1.5 thousand
for each Supervisory Board meeting and each committee meeting
they attend, with the exception of meetings of the ­Committee formed
pursuant to Section 27, Paragraph 3 of the German ­Codetermination
Act and meetings of the Nominations Committee. With respect to
their membership on the supervisory boards of LANXESS Group
companies, the members of the Supervisory Board are r­ emunerated
only for their service on the Supervisory Board of LANXESS
Deutschland GmbH in the amount of €5 thousand each.
The Supervisory Board members also receive a long-term incentive
based on the company's performance during the standard term of
an individual’s membership on the Supervisory Board (five years).
Unlike the fixed compensation component, this variable compen­
sation component is not paid every year, but only once at the end of
the standard term of office. If a Supervisory Board member serves
a shorter term, the amount is prorated.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

Payment of the variable compensation depends on how LANXESS’s
stock performs relative to the Dow Jones STOXX 600 C
­ hemicalsSM
index during a member’s five-year term. The average price of
LANXESS stock and the average level of the index during the
90 trading days prior to the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting at
which the Supervisory Board members were elected are each
compared with the respective average for the 90 trading days
prior to the ­A nnual Stockholders’ Meeting at the conclusion of
which the ­members’ terms end. The variable compensation is only
payable if the stock has outperformed the benchmark index. The
exact amount of the variable compensation depends on the extent
to which the stock price outperformed the benchmark index in
the preceding five years. If LANXESS stock has outperformed the
Dow Jones STOXX 600 Chemicals SM by up to ten percentage
points, the variable compensation amounts to €50 thousand for
this five-year period; if it has outperformed the index by between
10 and 20 percentage points, €100 thousand is paid, and if the
degree of outperformance is greater than this, the compensation
is €150 thousand.
The terms of office of eleven Supervisory Board members came
to an end with the conclusion of the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting
on May 13, 2015. The variable compensation was not paid out
because LANXESS stock had underperformed the benchmark
index. The expected compensation payable for the current terms
of office of Supervisory Board members was valued at €1,200
thousand (2014: €0 thousand) as of December 31, 2015, and
recognized as a provision.
None of the members of the Supervisory Board received benefits
for services provided personally during the reporting period. No
loans or advances were granted to members of the Supervisory
Board during the reporting year.
The following table breaks down the compensation received by each
member of the Supervisory Board for their work on the Supervisory
Board in fiscal 2015.

Report pursuant to Section 289, Paragraph 4 and Section 315, Paragraph 4 of the German Commercial Code

Report pursuant to Section 289, Para�
graph 4 and Section 315, Paragraph 4
of the German Commercial Code
Pursuant to Section 289, Paragraph 4, Nos. 1 to 9 and Section
315, Paragraph 4, Nos. 1 to 9 of the German Commercial Code,
we hereby make the following declarations:
1.	The capital stock of LANXESS AG amounted to €91,522,936 as
of December 31, 2015, and is composed of 91,522,936 no-par
bearer shares. All shares carry the same rights and obligations.
One vote is granted per share, and profit is distributed per share.
The rights and obligations arising from the shares are governed
by the German Stock Corporation Act.
2.	We are not aware of any restrictions affecting voting rights or the
transfer of shares. However, shares allocated under employee
stock plans are subject to a lock-up period before they may be
sold.
3.	We received no reports of direct and indirect equity investments
in the capital of LANXESS AG exceeding 10% of total voting
rights.
4. No shares carry special rights granting control authority.
5.	Employees hold a direct interest in the capital of LANXESS AG
through employee stock programs. There are no restrictions on
directly exercising the control rights arising from these shares.
6.	Sections 84 and 85 of the German Stock Corporation Act and
Section 31 of the German Codetermination Act apply to the
appointment and dismissal of Board of Management members.
Under the provisions of these sections, Board of Management
members are appointed by the Supervisory Board for a term
not exceeding five years. Such appointment may be renewed
or the term of office may be extended, provided that the term
of each such renewal or extension shall not exceed five years.
Appointments require a majority of at least two-thirds of the
­Supervisory Board members’ votes. Section 6, Paragraph 1 of
the articles of association states that the Board of Management
must c­ onsist of at least two members. The number of members
of the Board of Management is determined by the S
­ upervisory
Board. The Supervisory Board may appoint a chairman of the
Board of Management and a vice chairman of the Board of
Management. Alternative members of the Board of Management may be appointed. The Supervisory Board may revoke
the appointment of a member of the Board of Management
or the appointment of a member as Chairman of the Board of
Management for cause (Section 84, Paragraph 3 of the German
Stock Corporation Act).

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

	Section 179 of the German Stock Corporation Act provides that
a resolution of the Stockholders’ Meeting is required for any
amendment to the articles of association. Pursuant to Section
17, Paragraph 2 of the articles of association, resolutions of the
Stockholders’ Meeting require a simple majority of the votes
cast and, if a capital majority is required, a simple majority of
the capital stock, unless otherwise required by law or provided
by the articles of association. The articles of association contain
no further provisions in this regard. Section 10, Paragraph 9
of the articles of association of LANXESS AG authorizes the
Supervisory Board to resolve on amendments relating solely to
the form of the articles of association.
7.	The Board of Management of LANXESS AG has been authorized
to issue or repurchase shares as follows:

Own shares
The Annual Stockholders’ Meeting of LANXESS AG on May 18,
2011, authorized the Board of Management until May 17, 2016, to
acquire shares in the company representing up to 10% of the capital
stock and to utilize them for any purpose permitted by law. This
authorization may also be utilized by subsidiaries of the company
or by third parties on behalf of the company or its subsidiaries. At
the discretion of the Board of Management, such shares may be
acquired either in the market or via a public tender offer. The Board
of Management is authorized to use them for any purpose permitted
by law. In particular, it can retire the shares, sell them other than
via the stock exchange or an offer to the stockholders, or transfer
them against consideration in kind for the purpose of acquiring
companies, parts of companies or equity interests in companies
or in order to conclude mergers. It is also authorized to use them
to satisfy conversion rights from convertible or warrant bonds and/
or profit-participation rights or income bonds (or a combination of
these instruments) issued by the company and to grant holders of
convertible or warrant bonds and/or profit-participation rights or
income bonds (or a combination of these instruments) issued by
the company or its direct and indirect affiliates that grant a warrant
or conversion right or stipulate the performance of exercise or conversion obligations the number of shares for which such parties
would be entitled to subscribe upon exercise of their warrants or
conversion rights or performance of their exercise or conversion
obligations. The stockholders shall not have subscription rights in
such cases, except where the shares are retired.

Conditional capital
­ he Annual Stockholders’ Meeting of LANXESS AG on May 13,
T
2015, authorized the Board of Management until May 22, 2018,
with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to issue – in one or
more installments – warrant bonds and/or convertible bonds, ­profitparticipation rights and/or income bonds or a combination of
these instruments (collectively referred to as “bonds”) – as either
registered or bearer bonds – with a total nominal value of up to

157

158

Combined Management Report

€1,000,000,000, with or without limited maturity, and to grant
option rights to, or impose exercise obligations on, the holders or
creditors of warrant bonds, profit-participation rights with warrants
or income bonds with warrants, and/or to grant conversion rights to,
or impose conversion obligations on, the holders or creditors of convertible bonds, convertible profit-participation rights or ­convertible
income bonds in respect of bearer shares of the company representing a total pro rata increase of up to €18,304,587 in the
company’s capital stock on the terms to be defined for these bonds.
Pursuant to Section 4, Paragraph 4 of the articles of association,
the capital stock of LANXESS AG is thus conditionally increased
by up to €18,304,587 (Conditional Capital).
The conditional capital increase shall only be implemented to the
extent that the holders or creditors of, or persons obligated to
­exercise, warrants or conversion rights pertaining to bonds issued
by the company or a dependent company against cash contributions, or issued against cash contributions and guaranteed by the
­company or a dependent company, on or before May 22, 2018, on
the basis of the authorization granted to the Board of Management
by the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on May 13, 2015, exercise
their warrants or conversion rights or, where they are obligated
to do so, fulfill such obligation, or to the extent that the company
elects to grant shares in the company in place of all or part of the
cash amount due for payment. The conditional capital increase
shall not be implemented if cash compensation is granted or if the
company’s own shares, shares issued out of authorized capital or
shares in another listed company are used to service the warrant
or conversion rights.
When issuing bonds, the Board of Management is authorized, with
the approval of the Supervisory Board, to exclude subscription rights
in the following cases:
For residual amounts resulting from the subscription ratio
Insofar as is necessary to grant to holders of previously i­ssued
warrants or conversion rights or obligations subscription
rights to the number of new shares to which they would be
entitled to subscribe as stockholders upon exercise of their
warrants or conversion rights or fulfillment of their option or
conversion obligations
nn In the case of issuance against cash contributions, if the issue
price is not significantly below the theoretical market value of
the bonds with warrants or conversion rights or conversion
obligations, as determined using accepted pricing models;
if bonds are issued by application of Section 186, Paragraph 3,
Sentence 4 of the German Stock Corporation Act, in which
case the issued shares may not exceed a total of 10% of the
capital stock either at the time this authorization takes effect
or at the time it is utilized

nn

If profit-participation rights or income bonds without option
or conversion rights or conversion obligations are vested with
bond-like characteristics

The Board of Management can only use the authorization to issue
convertible bonds and/or warrant bonds, profit-participation rights
and/or income bonds (or combinations of these instruments) in
the maximum amount of 20% of the capital stock that exists at the
time the resolution is passed. When deciding on the exclusion of
the subscription rights of stockholders, the Board of Management
will also take into consideration the issue of shares on the basis of
other authorizations granted by the Annual Stockholders’ ­Meeting
of May 13, 2015, under exclusion of the subscription rights of
stockholders (see proposed resolution on agenda item 7; see also
Authorized Capital II in accordance with Section 4, Paragraph 3 of
the articles of incorporation), with the proviso that it will only use
the authorizations granted by the Annual Stockholders’ M
­ eeting of
May 13, 2015, for capital measures under exclusion of the stockholders’ subscription rights in the maximum amount of 20% of the
capital stock that exists at the time the resolution is passed. The
Board of Management will be bound by this condition until a future
Annual Stockholders’ Meeting again resolves to authorize the Board
of Management to implement capital measures under exclusion of
stockholders’ subscription rights.

Authorized Capital I and II­
Pursuant to Section 4, Paragraph 2 of LANXESS AG’s articles of
association, the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on May 23, 2013,
authorized the Board of Management until May 22, 2018, with the
approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the capital stock
on one or more occasions by issuing new no-par shares against
cash or contributions in kind up to a total amount of €16,640,534
­( Authorized Capital I). Stockholders are generally entitled to
subscription rights when Authorized Capital is utilized. With
the ­approval of the Supervisory Board, subscription rights can
be e
­ xcluded for residual amounts and in order to grant holders
of warrants or ­convertible bonds issued by the company and its
­affiliates s­ ubscription rights to the number of new shares for which
such parties would be entitled to subscribe upon exercise of their
warrants or conversion rights. Moreover, subscription rights can
be excluded with the approval of the Supervisory Board when the
company’s capital stock is increased against contributions in kind,
particularly for the acquisition of companies. Subscription rights
can also be excluded with the approval of the Supervisory Board in
order to grant holders of convertible and/or warrant bonds issued
by the company or its affiliates new shares upon exercise of their
rights. Finally, subscription rights can also be excluded with the
approval of the Supervisory Board if the issue price of the new
shares is not significantly lower than the stock market price at the
time the issue price is fixed and the issued shares do not exceed
10% of the company’s capital stock. The upper limit of 10% of the
capital stock is reduced by the proportionate interest in the capital

stock attributable to those shares issued or sold during the term
of this authorization while excluding stockholders’ rights in direct
or analogous application of Section 186, Paragraph 3, Sentence 4
of the German Stock Corporation Act. Further details are given in
Section 4, Paragraph 2 of the articles of association.
In addition, pursuant to Section 4, Paragraph 3 of LANXESS AG’s
articles of association, the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on May 13,
2015, authorized the Board of Management until May 22, 2018,
with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the company’s capital stock on one or more occasions by issuing new no-par
shares against cash or contributions in kind up to a total amount of
€18,304,587 (Authorized Capital II). Stockholders are generally
entitled to subscription rights when Authorized Capital is utilized.
With the approval of the Supervisory Board, subscription rights
can be excluded for residual amounts and in order to grant holders
of warrants or convertible bonds issued by the company and its
affiliates subscription rights to the number of new shares for which
such parties would be entitled to subscribe upon exercise of their
warrants or conversion rights. Moreover, subscription rights can
be excluded with the approval of the Supervisory Board when the
company’s capital stock is increased against contributions in kind,
particularly for the acquisition of companies. Subscription rights
can also be excluded with the approval of the Supervisory Board in
order to grant holders of convertible and/or warrant bonds issued
by the company or its affiliates new shares upon exercise of their
rights. Finally, subscription rights can also be excluded with the
approval of the Supervisory Board if the issue price of the new
shares is not significantly lower than the stock market price at the
time the issue price is fixed and the issued shares do not exceed
10% of the company’s capital stock. The upper limit of 10% of the
capital stock is reduced by the proportionate interest in the capital
stock attributable to those shares issued or sold during the term
of this authorization while excluding stockholders’ rights in direct
or analogous application of Section 186, Paragraph 3, Sentence 4
of the German Stock Corporation Act. Further details are given in
Section 4, Paragraph 3 of the articles of association.
The Board of Management can only utilize the authorization to
issue shares from Authorized Capital II in the maximum amount of
20% of the capital stock at the time the resolution is passed. When
deciding on the exclusion of the subscription rights of stockholders,
the Board of Management will also take into consideration an issue
of bonds with warrants or conversion rights and/or obligations,
which is issued on the basis of other authorizations granted by the
Annual Stockholders’ Meeting of May 13, 2015, under exclusion
of the subscription rights of stockholders (see proposed resolution on agenda item 8; see also conditional capital in accordance
with Section 4, Paragraph 4 of the articles of association), with
the proviso that it will only use the authorizations granted by the
Annual Stockholders’ Meeting of May 13, 2015, for capital measures under exclusion of the stockholders’ subscription rights in

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

the maximum amount of 20% of the capital stock that exists at the
time the ­resolution is passed. The shares issued from Authorized
Capital II under exclusion of subscription rights by way of capital
increases against contributions in kind shall not exceed 10% of the
capital stock that exists at the time the resolution is passed. The
Board of Management will be bound by this condition until a future
Annual Stockholders’ Meeting again resolves to authorize the Board
of Management to implement capital measures under exclusion of
stockholders’ subscription rights.
8.	The service contracts between the company and the members
of the Board of Management of LANXESS AG contain provisions
regarding the potential departure of the members of the Board of
Management in the context of a change of control. These are outlined in the compensation report in this combined ­management
report. Such agreements, albeit with different terms, also exist
between the company and members of the first level of upper
management. In addition, the terms for placing bonds under
the company’s existing debt issuance program may contain a
change-of-control clause which gives bondholders the right to
­redeem the bond should certain events occur that affect its rating.
This applies to the €200 million Eurobond issued by LANXESS
Finance B.V. in fiscal 2009, the €500 million Eurobond issued
by LANXESS Finance B.V. in fiscal 2011 and the €500 million
Eurobond issued by LANXESS Finance B.V. in fiscal 2012, all of
which were taken over by LANXESS AG in 2015. The terms for
two private placements with a volume of €100 million each made
by LANXESS Finance B.V. under the debt issuance program in
fiscal 2012 likewise contain corresponding change-of-control
clauses. These placements have now also been ­taken over by
LANXESS AG. In fiscal 2011 and 2014, LANXESS Finance B.V.
and LANXESS AG signed agreements with an investment bank
for loans of €200 million and €150 million, respectively. The loan
agreement signed by LANXESS Finance B.V. was transferred
to LANXESS AG in January 2015. These agreements may be
terminated without notice or repayment of the outstanding loans
may be required if another company or person gains control of
more than 50% of LANXESS AG. The company also entered
into an agreement with a syndicate of banks concerning a credit
facility with a current volume of €1,250 million. This agreement
can also be terminated without notice if another company or
person takes control of more than 50% of LANXESS AG. Furthermore, according to agreements between the company and
LANXESS Pension Trust e.V., the company is obligated to make
considerable payments to LANXESS Pension Trust e.V. in the
event of a change of control.

Economic outlook
General business conditions
In the following economic outlook, apart from presenting our
forecast of global development, we restrict our statements to our
expectations for economic performance in the Americas (NAFTA
and Latin America), EMEA (including Germany) and Asia-Pacific.
Where appropriate, we also look more closely at parts of these
regions or individual countries.
With regard to economic performance in 2016, we expect various
challenges. As well as the effects of the interest rate turnaround
initiated in the United States, slowing growth in China and ongoing
recession in the emerging economies of Brazil and Russia represent
components of risk. A further escalation of the crises in Africa and
the Middle East and of the conflict in Ukraine may also impede
global economic growth. A recurrence of the euro crisis would also
have a dampening effect. Although the low oil price is stimulating
growth, there are also negative aspects acting as a brake on growth.
We expect global economic growth of 3.0% in 2016, driven once
again by robust expansion of 4.5% in Asia-Pacific, even if growth
momentum in China continues to weaken. In the Americas, we
­anticipate growth of 2.5% based mainly on higher consumer spending and lower energy prices in NAFTA. Economic performance in
Latin America is likely to remain weak. At 2.0%, growth in EMEA
(including Germany) should be slightly higher than in the reporting
year.

Future performance of the chemical industry
We continue to take a positive view of global development in the
chemical industry, with production growing by 3.5%. The Asia-­
Pacific region is again expected to be the focus of this growth and
we anticipate expansion of 5.0%, to which China should make a
significant contribution. The chemical industry in the Americas
should post robust growth of 3.0%. In the EMEA region (including
Germany), we anticipate production gains of 2.0%.

Future perspectives

Future evolution of selling markets
The outlook for the global tire industry in 2016 will be shaped
by the general economic situation. Overall, we are assuming that
production will increase by 3.0%. We believe that the Asia-Pacific
region will be the main focus of growth with expansion of 4.0%,
even if the pace of growth in China is likely to slow significantly
due especially to a decline in exports to the United States. For the
Americas we anticipate solid growth of 2.0%, although imports to
NAFTA are likely to decrease slightly. In the EMEA region (including
Germany), too, we are assuming a slight increase in production of
1.0%, with much of this growth expected in Central and Eastern
Europe.
We anticipate that global automotive production will grow by
3.0%. Our expectations for Asia-Pacific are positive with growth of
3.0%. Here, China is expected to remain a focal point. The Americas
should also develop well with expansion of 2.5%. In the EMEA region
(including Germany), we are assuming an increase in production
of 2.5% coupled with a slight recovery of production in Russia.
We anticipate growth of 2.0% in the global agrochemicals
­market resulting from the expected revenue situation for agricultural products. We are assuming gains of 2.5% other than for
fertilizers. Asia-Pacific and the Americas should see growth of 3.5%
and 1.5%, respectively, while EMEA (including Germany) is likely
to expand by 2.0%.
With anticipated growth of 4.5%, the construction industry
should continue its good development. For the Asia-Pacific region
we are forecasting expansion of 5.0%. In the Americas, we expect
even stronger growth of 5.5%. EMEA (including Germany) should
see gains of 3.0%.

Expected earning position of the LANXESS Group
We anticipate that our earnings in fiscal 2016 will again be in­
fluenced by the persistently challenging competitive environment,
especially for our synthetic rubber businesses. We do not expect
any significant momentum for our earnings from the slight growth
forecast for the global economy.
We assume the following development for our segments. The
­assumptions made for each segment are based especially on the
differing market and competitive situations faced by the business
units and the customer industries they serve.
For the Performance Polymers segment, we expect business to
decline slightly overall in 2016. This development is likely to be more
pronounced in the second half of the year. Although demand from
the main customer industries – tires and automotive – is
­­ expected
to improve slightly compared with the prior year, our business
units that produce synthetic rubbers, particularly EPDM and butyl
­rubber, will be exposed to ongoing price pressure against a backdrop of additional capacities. Following the start-up of our plants for
Nd-PBR rubber in Singapore and EPDM rubber in Changzhou,
China, we expect to continue incurring idle costs arising from the
additional capacities provided by these two new plants. Both plants
will move progressively toward full utilization in line with the evolution of d
­ emand. In the current year, we are predicting continued
positive development in the various markets of our business with
plastics for lightweight construction applications in the automotive
industry. The main currency for our rubber businesses is the U.S.
dollar. If this remains at the same strong level as in the prior year, we
do not anticipate any significant positive effects for our businesses
compared with 2015.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

For the Advanced Intermediates segment, we expect business
to be stable overall in 2016. The Advanced Industrial Inter­mediates
business unit should achieve a stable performance due to the broad
diversification of its customer markets. We are assuming slower
growth in the agricultural business of our Saltigo business unit in
2016.
For our Performance Chemicals segment, we also expect stable
business development overall in the current year. The additives
business should likewise achieve a relatively stable performance
overall. According to our expectations, our business with inorganic
pigments for the construction industry is likely to develop well. In the
leather business, we see the persistently low price level for chrome
ore products as a continuing challenge. We expect solid development by our Liquid Purification Technologies business unit with its
technologies for water treatment. Our expectations are similar for the
biocides activities of our Material Protection Products business unit.

Combined Management Report

In our non-operational segment, we anticipate significantly lower
expenses for currency hedging than in the prior year.
In the coming year, we will continue to drive forward our threephase “Let’s LANXESS again” program for the realignment of the
LANXESS Group. The rapid implementation of this realignment
meant that we were already able to realize the predicted annual
cost savings of around €150 million from the first phase of the
program – aimed at improving the efficiency of the business units
and administrative structures – in the reporting year and thus a
year earlier than anticipated. We expect the second phase of the
­program, which is intended to strengthen operational competitiveness, to deliver cost savings of €20 million in the current year.
Overall, we assume that Phase II will generate annual savings of
around €150 million by the end of 2019.
In the current year, higher costs are also to be expected as a result
of the increase in wages and salaries associated with the pending
negotiations on the collective bargaining agreement in Germany.
Against the background of the anticipated influences, which are
expected to largely offset each other within the individual segments,
we predict EBITDA pre exceptionals for the full year 2016 to be at
around the prior-year level. This takes account of the anticipated
cost savings from our realignment.
We expect little change to the low procurement cost level in 2016
compared with the reporting year – especially for the petro­chemical­
raw materials used in the synthetic rubber products of our Performance Polymers segment. We foresee a continuation of the volatility
in raw material prices that has been ongoing for several years and
is in some cases substantial.
The U.S. dollar will remain the key currency for our businesses.

Expected financial position of the LANXESS Group
Liquidity situation
LANXESS will continue to pursue a forward-looking and conservative financial policy in the current year. With about €2.0 billion in
cash and undrawn credit lines, unchanged at year end 2015 and
as described under “Financial condition,” we have a very good
liquidity and financing position. We also expect our liquidity position
to be strengthened further by the planned partnership with Saudi
Aramco. Thus, the entrepreneurial flexibility required to implement
our strategy is assured for the long term.
Capital expenditures
In the future, as in the past fiscal year, our capital expenditures will be
increasingly directed toward the maintenance of existing production
facilities as well as efficiency improvements and the expansion of
existing plants. Following the start-up of our two large Nd-PBR and
EPDM rubber plants in Asia in 2015, we have no further plans for
major investments in the construction of new production facilities
in the coming years. In the current year, we therefore expect cash
outflows for capital expenditures of around €450 million, most of
which are earmarked for the maintenance of facilities, for efficiency
improvements and for the expansion of plants, as mentioned above.
A substantial amount of this is intended for capital expenditures by
our Saltigo business unit at the Leverkusen site in Germany. In this
way, we are still seeking to achieve a balanced investment cycle to
ensure our financial headroom.
Financing measures
LANXESS is in a good position due to the long-term nature of its
financing. In 2016, we anticipate that LANXESS will be able to
cover capital expenditures and maturing financing instruments from
liquidity. The same applies to the expected dividend payment and
the intended share buyback that has been announced. Additional
financial headroom will be provided by the expected proceeds of
around €1.2 billion from the sale of 50% of our synthetic rubbers
business.
Other than the redemption of a €200 million bond in September
2016, there will be no further significant financing instruments
maturing in fiscal 2016. LANXESS will continue to actively manage
its financing portfolio as demonstrated by the early repayment of a
development bank loan of €138 million in January 2016. Moreover,
we will continue our ongoing efforts aimed at securing long-term
funding as part of a conservative financing policy.

Report on future perspectives, opportunities and risks

Expected earnings position of LANXESS AG
In the current fiscal year, we expect the financial statements of
LANXESS AG to show substantially higher net income than in 2015.
The implementation of the transaction for the synthetic rubbers
business planned for April 1, 2016, and the anticipated changes
to commercial law concerning the valuation of post-employment
benefit obligations will have a material influence on the company’s
earnings position. This is impacted by the administration expenses
the company incurs in performing its tasks as a management holding
company and by the financial result, especially the net interest position
and the balance of income and losses from investments in affiliated
companies. We expect the net interest position to be negative on
account of the financing structure. The balance of income and losses
from investments in affiliated companies and the corresponding ability
of LANXESS AG to pay a dividend will depend in large measure on
the profit transfers and dividends paid by the other companies of the
LANXESS Group. We will maintain our consistent dividend policy and
expect LANXESS AG to report a distributable profit that will enable
our stockholders to adequately participate in the LANXESS Group’s
earnings in the coming year.

Dividend policy
LANXESS follows a consistent dividend policy. As in the past, our
future dividend proposals will take into account the business performance of the relevant fiscal year, the Group’s financing goals and
development trends in the new fiscal year.

After transferring our synthetic rubber businesses from the Performance Polymers segment to a partnership with Saudi Aramco
effective April 1, 2016, as part of our realignment, we will in the
future focus on strengthening our Advanced Intermediates and
Performance Chemicals segments as well as the High Performance
­Materials business unit.

Opportunity and risk report
Opportunity and risk management system
Our success is significantly dependent on identifying opportunities
and risks in our business activities and actively managing them. The
goal of the opportunity and risk management system is to safeguard
the company’s existence for the long term and ensure its successful ongoing development by identifying opportunities and risks
and, d
­ epending on their nature, appropriately considering these in
strategic and operational decisions. Opportunities and risks are understood as possible future developments or events that may result
in either positive or negative deviations from business objectives.
Our management system is based both on internal o
­ rganizational
workflows that are managed by way of control and monitoring
mechanisms and on early warning systems that are used to closely
observe changes in external conditions and systematically implement the appropriate measures. This approach applies equally to
opportunities and risks.

Summary of the Groupʼs projected performance
We anticipate that our business development in the current year will
again be influenced by the persistently challenging competitive environment, especially for our synthetic rubber businesses. We do not
expect any significant momentum for our business development from
the slight growth forecast for the global economy.
We predict EBITDA pre exceptionals for the full year 2016 to be at
around the prior-year level.
In fiscal 2015, we systematically drove forward and already implemented large parts of our three-phase global realignment program for the
Group. In this way, we took a significant step toward strengthening
the competitiveness of our business and administrative structure,­our
operational competitiveness and the competitiveness of our business
portfolio on a lasting basis, and achieved the first substantial cost
savings. In the current year, we will continue to work on implementing
our realignment and particularly on strengthening our operational
competitiveness.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

Like all methods intended for dealing with business risk, this system
does not offer absolute protection. However, it is intended to prevent
business risks from having a material impact on the company with
a sufficient degree of certainty.
Structural basis
The principles of our opportunity and risk management system are
set forth in a Group directive. The management system, which uses
the COSO model as the enterprise risk management framework,
comprises many different elements that are incorporated into business processes through the company’s organizational structure,
its workflows, its planning, reporting and communication systems,
and a set of detailed management policies and technical standards.

164

Combined Management Report

The system is based on an integration concept. In other words, the
early identification of opportunities and risks is an integral part of the
management system and not the object of a separate organizational
structure. The management of opportunities and risks is therefore
a primary duty of the heads of all business units, as well as of those
people in Group companies who hold process and project responsi­
bility. This is why our opportunity and risk management is based
on clearly defined business processes, the precise assignment of
responsibilities, and reporting systems that ensure the timely provision of the information required for decision-making for the Board
of Management or other management levels.
Roles of key organizational units
Our business units each conduct their own operations, for which
they have global profit responsibility. Group functions and service
companies support the business units by providing financial, legal,
technical and other centralized services. Complementing this global
alignment of the business units and group functions, the country organizations ensure the required proximity to markets and the necessary
organizational infrastructure.
In line with this division of duties, we have assigned responsibility to
risk owners for the following:
Identification and assessment of opportunities and risks
Implementation of control measures (measures taken to exploit or enhance opportunities and to avoid or minimize risks)
nn Monitoring the development of opportunities and risks (e.g.
on the basis of performance indicators and, perhaps also,
early warning indicators)
nn Risk mitigation (measures to minimize damage upon occurrence of a risk event)
nn Communication of the key opportunities and risks to the
management committees of the business units and group
functions
nn
nn

The Corporate Controlling Group Function is responsible for collecting and aggregating key information across the Group at the
following intervals:
nn
nn

Twice per year during the intrayear forecasting process
Once per year as part of the budget and planning process for
the subsequent year and the medium-term forecast horizon

The Corporate Development Group Function systematically analyzes
and measures significant and strategic opportunities and risks with
the goal of ensuring the Group’s long-term strategy.
Transactions particularly for the transfer of financial but also
­operating risk (hedging transactions or insurance) are managed
centrally by the Treasury & Investor Relations Group Function. This
is explained in “Opportunities and risks of future development.”

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

Due to the highly integrated nature of our general business ­processes,­
we have specialized committees composed of r­ epresentatives of the
business units and group functions who deal with issues concerning
the Group’s opportunities and risks. This enables us to react quickly
and flexibly to changing situations and their influence on the company.
In addition, a Risk Committee chaired by the Chief Financial ­Officer
analyzes the material risks and their development for their potential
impact on the company as a whole. The Risk Committee brings
together representatives from selected group functions to analyze
existing measures to counter risks, initiate additional measures,
define Group-wide risk management standards and guidelines and,
if necessary, initiate further analyses of individual opportunities
and risks.
The duty to report opportunities and risks to the Corporate Controlling Group Function is based on the anticipated impact on Group
net income or EBITDA pre exceptionals. All opportunities and risks
must be reported if their anticipated impact is more than €1 million
following the implementation of countermeasures. In addition, those
risks must be reported which have an anticipated impact that was
reduced by more than €10 million through the implementation of
countermeasures. These minimum thresholds guarantee that the
information gathered about opportunities and risks is comprehensive
and that the collection of information is not just limited to material
risks or risks that could jeopardize the future of the company as a
going concern. The Corporate Controlling Group Function centrally
determines the top opportunities and risks only after the information
has been gathered.
There is also provision for immediate internal reporting on specific
risk issues such as unexpected operational events with an impact of
more than €10 million after the implementation of countermeasures.
In 2015, there was no cause for immediate reporting of this kind.
The reported opportunities and risks are collected in a central
database and regularly analyzed for the Board of Management and
Supervisory Board. This ensures that when new opportunities and
risks arise or when existing ones change substantially, the necessary
information can be communicated in a timely manner to the Board
of Management and therefore also be specifically integrated into
the general management of the company.

165

Report on future perspectives, opportunities and risks

Opportunity and risk assessment
Opportunity and risk management is integrated into the planning
and forecasting process and identifies opportunities and risks as
potential deviations from planned or forecast EBITDA pre exceptionals or Group net income.
Depending on the type of opportunity or risk, different calculation
methods are applied in their assessment. Distribution opportunities
and risks are described by scenario-based fluctuations in planning
parameters (exchange rates, raw material prices, energy prices and
economic development assumptions). Changes in these variables
may result in either positive or negative deviations from planned
or forecast figures.
Event-based opportunities and risks (such as the failure of a ­supplier
or the occurrence of an insured event) that would only impact earnings if they actually occur are evaluated on the basis of the expected
probability of their occurrence and effect on EBITDA pre exceptionals or Group net income.
Significance of the Group-wide planning process
Corporate planning is a core element of our opportunity and risk
management. Events with a high probability of occurrence flow
directly into the planning process. The processes for corporate
planning and intrayear forecasting as well as the corresponding
analyses and suggestions for action are steered by the Corporate
Controlling Group Function, which works closely in this regard with
the business units. Certain Board of Management meetings are
dedicated to discussing and adopting corporate planning outcomes,
including the associated opportunities and risks. We monitor, and
if necessary adjust, the annual budget in any given fiscal year by
regularly updating our expectations for business development.
Compliance as an integral component
Risk management also includes preventing illegal conduct by our
employees. To this end, we obtain extensive legal advice concerning business transactions and obligate employees by means of our
compliance code to observe the law and to act responsibly. The
compliance code is part of a comprehensive compliance management system (CMS) that has been structured in accordance with the
principles of an internationally recognized framework for enterprise
risk management (COSO). This CMS is supported by the compliance
organization, which is made up of the Group Compliance Officer
and a network of local Compliance Officers in the countries in which
we have subsidiaries. The objective of the CMS is to ensure the
observance of our compliance principles. The Compliance function,
which includes the compliance organization, reports directly and
regularly to the Board of Management.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

(Group) accounting aspects of the internal control
and risk management system
The aspects of the internal control and risk management system
relating to the (Group) accounting process include the ­principles,
procedures and measures required to ensure the effectiveness, ­efficiency and propriety of the company’s accounting, and
­compliance­with applicable legal regulations. To this end, clear
organizational, control and monitoring structures have been
­established. The distinctive features of the chemical industry and
the risk management tools we regularly use in this regard are taken
into account. In addition to the (Group) accounting process in its
narrower sense, this also includes the aforementioned structured
budget and forecasting process, and extensive contract management. However, the effectiveness and reliability of the internal control
and risk management system can be restricted by discretionary
decisions, criminal acts, faulty controls or other circumstances. Thus,
even if the system components used are applied Group-wide, the
correct and timely recording of (Group) accounting issues cannot
be guaranteed with full assurance.
The Accounting Group Function, which reports to the Chief F
­ inancial
Officer, is responsible for the (Group) accounting process and therefore for preparing the annual financial statements of LANXESS AG
and the consolidated financial statements of the LANXESS Group.
It is also responsible for ensuring the uniform preparation of the
single-entity financial statements of the subsidiaries that are included
in the consolidated financial statements. The Board of Management
prepares the annual financial statements and the consolidated
financial statements, which are then forwarded to the Supervisory
Board’s Audit Committee without delay. Upon recommendation
by the Audit Committee, the annual financial statements and the
consolidated financial statements are adopted and approved by
the Supervisory Board at its financial statements meeting. The
Supervisory Board, and especially its Audit Committee, deal with
major questions relating to LANXESS’s accounting, opportunity and
risk management, the audit mandate and the areas of focus for the
auditor’s audit of the annual financial statements.
Consolidated interim financial statements are prepared each ­quarter.
The condensed consolidated half-year financial statements are reviewed, while the annual financial statements and the c­ onsolidated
financial statements are subjected to a full audit by the auditor of the
company’s annual financial statements and consolidated financial
statements.

166

Combined Management Report

Our accounting in compliance with the German Commercial Code
is based on a structured process with appropriate organizational
structures and workflows, including the related working instructions.
In addition to the segregation of duties, the dual-control principle and
continual plausibility testing serve as fundamental monitoring tools
during the financial statement preparation process. On the IT side,
the accounting process is supplemented by an integrated IT system
that is based largely on off-the-shelf software and is protected by
security measures against unauthorized access. The correctness of
the automatically generated postings and the master data required
for them is regularly reviewed. Manual postings are based on a
systematic voucher system, documented to the necessary extent
and verified downstream.
The foundation for uniform and IFRS-compliant consolidated
­financial reporting at LANXESS is the Group Financial Statements
Guideline. This governs the way the provisions of the International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) applicable to the Group are
applied by the subsidiaries as reporting entities. Moreover, the
guideline also defines the chart of accounts that is binding throughout the Group. On the IT side, the guideline is supplemented by
a uniform, Group-wide delivery and consolidation system that is
based largely on off-the-shelf software and is protected by security
measures against unauthorized access.
By controlling and monitoring LANXESS’s (Group) accounting process, we ensure that generally accepted accounting practices in line
with the applicable laws and standards are applied and guarantee
reliable financial reporting. The (Group) accounting-related internal
control system we use is based on generally accepted standards
(COSO model). There were no material changes to this system
during the period under review. Corresponding standards also
apply to the single-entity financial statements of the subsidiaries.
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements is based on a
detailed process that includes specifying a financial statement calendar containing deadlines for the delivery of certain data. A further
component is regular reviews of the correctness and completeness
of the scope of consolidation. The principle of the segregation of
duties as expressed in structured authorization and approval procedures and the dual-control principle as well as continual plausibility
testing on data is applied end-to-end throughout the preparation
and consolidation process.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

For the consolidated financial statements, all subsidiaries subject to
reporting requirements transmit their Group reporting data using
the above-mentioned consolidation system. Validation rules integrated into the system ensure on delivery that the data reported
by the subsidiaries are consistent. The accounting departments
of the subsidiaries are responsible for ensuring the correctness of
the reported data content, which is also tested by the Corporate
Accounting Department within the Accounting Group Function.
To this end, the department evaluates standardized reports in
which the companies explain material facts relevant to financial
reporting. After the process-based controls have been applied,
consolidation including currency translation is carried out in the
same system, without additional interfaces, utilizing both automated
and m
­ anual procedures. The correctness of the automated consoli­
dation steps and of the master data necessary for this purpose is
reviewed ­regularly. Consolidation information that must be entered
­manually is posted separately, documented to the extent required
and verified downstream. This is supplemented by validation rules
that are integrated into the system.
Regular coordination with other financial group functions, ­particularly
the Treasury & Investor Relations, Tax & Trade Compliance and
Controlling group functions, assists the financial reporting process.
A continual exchange of information with the operating business
units and other group functions makes it possible for the Accounting
Group Function to identify and deal with issues arising outside of
accounting processes. These include litigation risks, projections
for impairment testing and special contractual agreements with
suppliers or customers. In addition, third-party service providers
are consulted on special issues, particularly relating to the valuation
of pensions and other post-employment benefits.

Monitoring of risk management system and internal
control system (ICS)
LANXESS’s Corporate Audit Department within the Legal &
­Compliance Group Function oversees whether the internal control
and monitoring system works and whether organizational safeguards are being observed. The planning of audits (selection of
audit s­ ubjects) and the audit methods applied are correspondingly
aligned with risks. To assess the effectiveness of the ICS, an annual
self-­assessment is also carried out in major Group companies,
­operating units and group functions. The Supervisory Board exercises control functions, including regular monitoring of the efficiency
of the management systems described above by the full Supervisory
Board and by its Audit Committee. The Audit Committee reviews
reports about the Compliance function’s activities and findings,
the work of the Corporate Audit Department, and the status of the
risk management and internal control system. In addition, the early
warning system is evaluated by the external auditor as part of the
audit of the consolidated and annual financial statements.

Report on future perspectives, opportunities and risks

Opportunities and risks of future development
Full identification of the LANXESS Group’s opportunities and risks
is performed on the basis of a catalog of categories, which are
summarized in the table below:
Categories ������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
Procurement markets
Human resources
Plant operations and hazards
Corporate strategy
Sales markets
Finance
Legal, regulatory and political environment

Subsequent reporting in respect of the main categories is based
on a planning horizon of one year.
Procurement markets
On the procurement side, the principal opportunities and risks
lie in the high volatility of raw material and energy prices. An
increase or decrease in the price of the materials we use d
­ irectly
results in higher or lower production costs. If prices decrease,
write-downs may have to be recognized on inventories. In addition, changes in raw material prices result in higher or lower selling
prices – either immediately or after a delay. We mitigate situations
like this by following a sensible inventory and procurement policy.
Most of the company's raw material and energy needs are met by
long-term supply contracts and contracts containing price escalation clauses. Many agreements with customers also contain price
­escalation clauses. We also have the option of hedging this risk via
derivatives transactions if liquid futures markets are available for
hedging raw material and energy price risks (see also “Financial
markets”). ­Additionally, we are constantly looking for ways to use
our r­ esources more efficiently so that we can offset higher costs by
raising p
­ roductivity. The volatility of raw material prices, especially for
our key raw material butadiene, impacts our Performance Polymers
segment in particular.

To guard against possible supply bottlenecks due to factors such
as the failure of a supplier or of an upstream operation at a networked site, we pursue an appropriate inventory strategy and line
up alternative sources of supply. If we were to be forced to utilize an
alternative source of supply, this could result in, for example, higher
procurement prices or additional transportation costs.
Human resources
The risk of industrial actions resulting from disputes in connection
with negotiations concerning future collective pay agreements or
associated with restructuring measures cannot be ruled out. We
also face increases in our personnel expenses because of future
wage increases. Such an increase in the cost of human resources
can be just as detrimental to earnings as increases in raw material
prices, as described above, but in the case of human resources
we cannot hedge the risk in futures markets or pass it on to our
customers. We counter this risk by fostering open communication
with our employees and their representatives in a culture of active
labor relations. The employee representatives in various countries
have been consulted especially with regard to our “Let's LANXESS
again” program, the effects of which are still becoming visible in
2015/2016 in individual countries such as France. Continuous and
increased use is being made of existing dialogue platforms such as
the European Forum, which brings together the works councils in
Europe. We also actively seek dialogue with the representatives of
our employees, the trade unions and other interest groups in the
other regions in which we operate.
Our employees’ expert knowledge of internal processes and
­issues relating to their areas of specialization is a critical factor in the
­efficiency of our business operations. We take various ­approaches
to mitigate the risk of losing this expertise and to i­ncrease our
­employees’ loyalty to the company, including attractive compensation models, challenging jobs and international career options.
We continue to invest in the next generation of employees by
­increasing the number of training opportunities in Germany. We
have also launched and expanded regional internship and trainee
programs and scholarships for gifted students. The regional focal
points, besides Germany, are North America, Brazil, India, China
and South Africa.
The growing lack particularly of skilled employees in our global
markets is becoming tangible in individual cases. However, this
effect has been mitigated for the time being by the “Let’s LANXESS
again” program launched in April 2014, which in the first instance
substantially reduced our specific need for skilled employees in the
reporting period. Nonetheless, in light of the first growth trends, we
anticipate an increased need for recruitment in specific functions so

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

168

Combined Management Report

the issue of employer branding will again become more important.
A forward-looking and sustainable HR policy will therefore remain
one focus, which is evidenced by our regular HR development
conferences, for example. In line with our needs, we are expanding
our cooperations with research institutes, universities, colleges
and high schools in Germany, as well as with public-sector entities
both in Germany and all other key target markets. At many events
and conferences around the world, we have positioned our company as an attractive employer and continue to seek early contact
with highly talented young people. In Germany, where we have the
largest headcount, we have established a LANXESS program to
provide both financial and expert support for undergraduate and
postgraduate students. We also have a loyalty program for particularly outstanding interns. Both these programs focus on the natural
and engineering sciences. Similar programs are being established
not only in Germany but increasingly also in other major regions,
where they always take account of local requirements.
In the reporting year, the Board of Management established a
­demographic initiative that takes up issues such as function-critical
activities which were identified in the wake of the “Let’s LANXESS
again” program, the transfer of specific expertise and the securing
of succession chains. The initiative builds on the results of Xcare,
the first demographic project dating from 2011.
We are tackling issues pertaining to employee performance – also
against the backdrop of the restructuring activities of recent years –
through a performance culture program, which was established by
the Board of Management and will assist in the realignment of the
Group. It is intended, among other things, to use binding corporate
values and management guidelines in creating a framework which
allows managers to provide even greater support to their employees
in making full use of their potential.
We are seeking to mitigate the potential loss of individual knowledge
holders in connection with the agreed partnership for the ­synthetic
rubbers business by providing the employees concerned with
­targeted information and highlighting potential career opportunities.
There are a number of other HR risks which, because of their longterm nature, will have virtually no impact on the relevant earnings
indicators for fiscal 2016.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

Plant operations and hazards
A lack of plant availability and disruptions of plant and process safety
can make it impossible for us to meet production targets and adequately service demand, resulting in a loss of marginal income. We
use a comprehensive range of measures to counter this scenario.
These include proactive facility maintenance, regular compliance
checks, the preparation of risk assessments and systematic training
of employees to improve standards and safety. We also counter the
risk of unplanned production stoppages by manufacturing certain
products at various sites worldwide.
Although LANXESS applies high technical and safety standards
to the construction, operation and maintenance of production
facilities, interruptions in operations, including those due to
external factors, such as natural disasters or terrorism, cannot be
ruled out. These can lead to explosions, the release of materials
hazardous to health, or accidents in which people, property or the
environment are harmed. In addition to systematically monitoring
compliance with quality standards in order to avoid such stoppages
and accidents, we are also insured against the resulting damage to
the extent usual in the industry.
Our product portfolio includes substances that are classified as
hazardous to health. In order to prevent possible harm to health,
we systematically test the properties of our products and draw our
customers’ attention to the risks associated with their use. We also
carry product liability insurance that is customary in our industry.
In line with our forward-looking approach, product monitoring
­enables us to identify and evaluate potential hazards associated
with our product portfolio and initiate suitable measures if applicable.
Our information technology (IT) supports our business activities
worldwide, including the processes from receiving an order to
receiving payment and from placing an order to paying a vendor.
It is important that the people who use the systems receive correct
and meaningful information when they need it. We support this by
developing a uniform, integrated system architecture and investing
in the expansion of IT services worldwide.

169

Report on future perspectives, opportunities and risks

The operation and use of IT systems entails risks. For example,
networks or systems may fail, or data and information may be compromised or destroyed because of operator and programming errors
or external factors. In particular, we are observing a growing threat
to our IT infrastructure resulting from outside attack. All of these
can cause serious business interruptions. To mitigate such risks,
we invest in suitable data protection systems designed to prevent
the loss of data and information. Various security and monitoring
tools and access restriction and authorization systems are used
to ensure the integrity, confidentiality and availability of data and
information and the trouble-free operation of systems. With a view
to improving the security of our IT infrastructure, we evaluate security measures for their suitability in defending against current
attack scenarios. Where necessary, these measures are upgraded.
Additional security systems are being established worldwide and
existing ones adapted to current needs as defense against new
and specific threats.
Corporate strategy
We actively pursue the strategic optimization of the enterprise. Our
efforts include ongoing efficiency enhancement, strengthening of
core businesses, active portfolio management and proactive partici­
pation in industry consolidation through partnerships, divestments
and acquisitions. Further information can be found in the "Strategy"
section of this combined management report.
The success of the decisions associated with these efforts is naturally subject to forecasting risk in respect of predicting future
(market) developments and the feasibility of planned measures.
For example, the entry into or exit from a business segment could
be based on profitability or growth expectations that prove to be
unrealistic over time. We mitigate this risk by carefully and systematically analyzing the information that is relevant to decision-making.
During this process, the business units affected and the Board of
Management receive support from departments with the requisite
expertise and, if necessary, from external consultants.
Our product portfolio is systematically aligned with key global
trends that promise continuous growth in the coming years. With
our products, we offer innovative solutions for these trends and
generate recognizable added value for our customers. We are
successfully positioned in those markets in which our product
portfolio will enable us to particularly benefit from these trends in
the medium and long term. Here, the focus will be on China, North
America and Southeast Asia.
When gathering information in the context of acquisitions, it is
possible that certain facts required to assess an acquisition candidate’s future performance or to determine the purchase price are
not available or are not correctly interpreted. We address this risk

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

by conducting well-structured due diligence analyses and, where
possible, by concluding appropriate agreements with the sellers.
Insufficient integration of acquired companies or businesses can
result in expected developments not materializing. For this reason,
we have processes in place with which full integration of acquired
businesses is assured. If assumptions concerning future developments – such as the realization of synergies – do not materialize,
this might result in a write-down on assets. We monitor this risk by
carrying out impairment testing at least once a year.
Unlocking and exploiting operational opportunities is an important
aspect of our entrepreneurial activities. We are committed to using
existing products and new solutions to advance our growth and
sustainably strengthen our position in global markets. Investing
in new plants as well as expanding the capacities and increasing
the productivity of existing ones are key elements in these efforts.
The anticipated effects are taken into account in our planning or are
reported as opportunities. In principle, we expect investments to
yield benefits but they are also coupled with risks. Thus, for example, the success of our investments in Asia has been substantially
impacted by the challenging competitive situation in the synthetic
rubber businesses. The preparatory work for investments that exceed a specified significance threshold is the responsibility of the
relevant business units. After review by an Investment Committee
set up for this purpose, the information is presented to the Board of
Management for a decision. By following this procedure, we ensure
that investments are in line with our corporate strategy and satisfy
our profitability and security requirements.
Sales and earnings effects expected from our investments and
acquisitions are already considered in our forecasts. These targeted
investments may also generate further operational opportunities
because they enable us to unlock new potential and improve our
positioning in key markets.
Sales markets
Our company is inherently exposed to general economic develop�
ments and political change in the countries and regions in which
we operate. Regional differences in economic performance and the
associated demand trends can affect the Group’s pricing and sales
potential in its various geographical markets, with corresponding
positive or negative effects on its earnings. Our global presence,
which we are continuing to expand in growth markets, enables us
to participate in favorable regional developments and, at the same
time, reduce our dependence on certain regions. This approach is
discussed in further detail in the “Strategy” section of this combined
management report.

170

Combined Management Report

The volatility and cyclicality that are typical of the global chemical
and polymer markets and their dependence on developments in
customer industries harbor uncertainties for our business. As well
as the influence of general economic development, the particular
dependence of the rubber business on customers in the tire and
automotive industries can result in sales volatility. Additional and
unplanned sales opportunities may arise through access to new
markets or the acquisition of new customers. In addition to being
subject to these demand-side market influences, our earning power
can be impacted by structural changes in markets, such as the exit
of existing competitors or the entry of new ones and the availability
of additional capacities, regional shifts, the migration of customers
to countries with lower cost levels, and product substitution or
market consolidation trends in some sectors. We counter such
trends by systematically managing costs and continually adjusting
our product portfolio, sharpening its focus and aligning our offering
with innovative customer segments, which will enable us to operate
successfully in the long term.
In our Performance Polymers segment, the synthetic rubber
­businesses continue to face intense competition, partly from new
manufacturers entering the market. In some business units, this
may result in further overcapacities and stronger competition on
prices. We are pursuing a product-specific strategy in these areas
based on factors such as product and process differentiation and
global positioning. Through the partnership with Saudi Aramco we
intend to achieve a strategic strengthening of our synthetic rubbers
business in this competitive environment in the medium term.
Finance
The Treasury & Investor Relations Group Function has the task of
centrally recording and managing financial opportunities and
risks. Chief among these are:

Currencies Since the LANXESS Group undertakes transactions
in various currencies, it is exposed to fluctuations in the relative
value of these currencies. Fixed exchange rates were used in our
planning for fiscal 2016. The development of the U.S. dollar against
the euro is of particular relevance. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar
compared with the exchange rate used in planning would have a
positive effect on our planned EBITDA pre exceptionals. We have
already entered into hedging transactions for 2016, 2017 and 2018
to mitigate the effects of currency fluctuations.
Currency risks from potential declines in the value of financial
instruments due to exchange rate fluctuations (transaction risks)
arise mainly when receivables and payables are denominated in a
­currency other than the company’s functional currency. These risks
and the currency risks arising on financial transactions, including
the interest component, are generally fully hedged through forward
exchange contracts. In the short term, therefore, the appreciation
or depreciation of the euro against other major currencies can have
no material impact on future cash flows.
The opportunities and risks relating to operating activities are
­systematically monitored and analyzed. To this end, both sales and
costs are planned in foreign currencies. In the long term, exchange
rate fluctuations could adversely affect future cash flows should
the LANXESS Group not be able to counter them, for example, by
pricing its products in the respective local currencies. This risk is
minimized by partial hedging with derivative financial instruments.
Hedging is performed in line with principles determined by the Board
of Management and is subject to continuous monitoring.

171

Report on future perspectives, opportunities and risks

Interest rates Market interest rate movements can cause fluctuations
in the fair value of a financial instrument. They affect both financial
assets and financial liabilities.

generally based on the customary payment terms for the business
or country. Reminders are sent out at regular intervals if payments
are overdue.

Since the majority of financial liabilities were entered into at fixed
interest rates, changes in interest rates in the coming years will have
only a limited impact on the LANXESS Group.

Credit risk relating to receivables from customers is covered by
opening letters of credit in favor of the LANXESS Group for some
customers and by agreeing prepayment with contractual partners.
In addition, LANXESS has a contractually agreed title to goods until
the contractual partner has paid the full purchase price. The vast
majority of receivables relate to customers with very high credit
standing.

Raw materials/energies Where certain market-price risks for
­energies and raw materials cannot be passed on to customers
in their entirety, they may be hedged on a case-by-case basis by
­forward commodity contracts in order to reduce the volatility of cash
flows. As in the previous year, LANXESS had no forward commodity
contracts as at the reporting date.
Liquidity and refinancing We ensure our access to the ­capital
markets and our solvency through a conservative financing p
­ olicy
and a target capital structure that is largely based on the ratio
­systems used by leading rating agencies. Our conservative financing policy takes into account the risk of a change to our rating and
the associated effects on financial risk management, even though
LANXESS has no direct influence on the assessments by independent rating agencies.
Our main liquidity reserve is a €1.25 billion syndicated credit facility, which remained largely undrawn on the reporting date. In
­February­2015, its original term was extended by one year to February 2020. We have a further material credit line of €150 million
with the ­European Investment Bank. In addition to credit facilities,
the Group has short-term liquidity reserves of €466 million in the
form of cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid investments
in AAA-rated money market funds. Accordingly, the LANXESS
Group has a liquidity position based on a broad range of financing
instruments.
Counterparty risks Counterparty risks (credit risks) arise from
trade relationships with customers and dealings with banks and
other financial partners, especially with regard to the investment
business and financial instrument transactions.
Customer risks are systematically identified, analyzed and managed
using both internal and external information sources. Customer
portfolios may be insured against credit risks, especially where the
risk profile is elevated.
The objective of receivables management at LANXESS is to collect
all outstanding payments punctually and in full, and thus to minimize
the risk of default. Continuous monitoring is computer-assisted
based on the payment terms agreed with the customers. These are

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

The creditworthiness of the counterparty is a key criterion in the
financial policy and credit risk management of the LANXESS
Group, especially in the selection of banks and financial partners
for ­capital investments and transactions involving financial instruments. LANXESS therefore endeavors to undertake transactions
with banks and other financial counterparties that have at least
an investment-grade rating. The derivatives and financial assets
outstanding as of the closing date were almost all concluded with
banks with an investment-grade rating.
Credit risk management also includes global management of the
counterparty risk relating to all existing relationships with banks and
financial partners. The LANXESS Group pays particular attention to
risk diversification to prevent any cluster risks that could jeopardize
its continued existence. Through master agreements, the market
values of open trading positions can be netted if a partner becomes
insolvent, thereby further reducing risks.
Capital investments Opportunities and risks associated with
the investment of pension assets are monitored by the Pension
Committee, which is made up of the Chief Financial Officer and
representatives from the Treasury & Investor Relations, Accounting
and Human Resources group functions.
Insurance The LANXESS Group carries insurance cover against
material risks such as those arising from property damage, business
interruption and product liability. If a loss event occurs, LANXESS
must therefore pay only those damages in excess of the deductible.
However, there is a residual risk of events that are not covered by
the insurance or which result in damages in excess of the cover
guaranteed by the insurer.
Additional information on our financial risks can be found in
Note [36], “Financial instruments,” to the consolidated financial
statements.

172

Combined Management Report

Legal, regulatory and political environment
Companies in the LANXESS Group are subject to legal risks and
are parties to various litigations. The outcome of individual proceedings cannot be predicted with assurance due to the uncertainties
always associated with legal disputes. To the extent necessary in
light of the known circumstances in each case, we have set up risk
provisions for the event that the outcome of such proceedings is
unfavorable to LANXESS. Taking into account existing provisions
and insurance, as well as agreements reached with third parties
in respect of liability risks arising from legal disputes, it is currently
estimated that none of these proceedings will materially affect our
planned EBITDA pre exceptionals.
As an approach to avoiding legal risks, LANXESS has established
an extensive compliance management system incorporating a
range of preventive organizational measures. Among the main risks
LANXESS has identified are those relating to antitrust legislation,
plant safety and environmental protection, foreign trade legislation and corruption. In connection with risks relating to antitrust
legislation, for example, LANXESS has developed a program that
combines classroom training and e-learning to ensure compliance
with competition law. In this way, our employees and managers are
schooled in the particular risks pertaining to their areas of business
and made aware of their significance. This training is performed and
documented at regular intervals. Our employees can also contact
designated experts in the Legal & Compliance Group Function if
they have any specific questions. Further information about compliance can be found in the Corporate Governance Report and in the
“Compliance as an integral component” section of this opportunity
and risk report.
Regulatory measures may lead to the tightening of safety, quality
and environmental regulations and standards in different areas.
These may result in additional costs and liability risks. P
­ articularly
noteworthy in this regard is the implementation of the E.U.
­Regulation concerning the Registration, Evaluation, ­Authorization
and R
­ estriction of Chemicals (REACH). As well as direct costs that
could arise due to additional measures necessary to comply with
these standards, market structures could change to our disadvantage as a result of a shift by suppliers and customers to regions
outside Europe. Additional requirements imposed by energy
and environmental policy, such as the new emission trading
­regulations, new environmental taxes and the redistribution of costs
associated with the German Renewable Energy Act, could result in
higher costs and in part substantial disadvantages in international
competition. With a view to mitigating this risk, we are discussing
the economic consequences of increasing energy prices with the
authorities and government - either directly or in cooperation with
other energy-intensive companies via industry organizations.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

LANXESS was and is responsible for numerous sites at which
chemicals have been produced for periods that in some cases
exceed 140 years. This responsibility also extends to waste disposal
facilities. The possibility cannot be ruled out that ground pollution
occurred during these periods that has not been identified to date.
We are committed to the Responsible Care® initiative and pursue
active environmental management and proactive environmental
protection management. This includes constant monitoring and
testing of the soil, groundwater and air and of various emissions.
We have set up sufficient provisions for necessary containment
or remediation measures in areas with identified contamination.
Additional information on our environmental provisions can be
found in Note [15], “Other non-current and current provisions,” to
the consolidated financial statements.
Tire-labeling initiatives can lead to stronger than anticipated demand
for higher-quality tires and thus for synthetic high-performance
rubbers. This would particularly benefit our Performance Polymers
segment with its global production network and customer relationships spanning many years.
Any violations of foreign trade regulations may result in prohibitions
and restrictions on LANXESS’s export activities and the loss of its
privileges in respect of export procedures. In individual cases, this
may also result in fines, trade sanctions and loss of reputation. The
LANXESS Group ensures compliance in foreign trade and export
control through the global implementation and optimization of
­appropriate and stable control instruments and automated screening
processes. By proactively monitoring trade policy developments,
timely information is provided to both the operating units and the
management organs concerning changes to foreign trade and the
associated opportunities and risks, and appropriate recommendations for action are made.
Tax matters are subject to a degree of uncertainty in terms of their
assessment by the tax authorities in Germany and other ­countries.
Even if we believe that all circumstances have been reported
­correctly and in compliance with the law, the possibility cannot be
ruled out that the tax authorities may come to a different conclusion
in individual cases.

173

Report on future perspectives, opportunities and risks

Significance of opportunities and risks and result of
opportunity and risk assessment
The opportunities and risks of future development that we have
identified are categorized and grouped, as already described. Their
significance lies in their potential impact on planned EBITDA pre
exceptionals. Individual categories in which the opportunity or
risk may produce a deviation of more than 5% from our projected
­EBITDA pre exceptionals in the planning year are considered to be
of medium to high significance. This also applies to groups in which
this threshold is exceeded only on a cumulative basis across all the
categories assigned to each group.
Within the context of opportunity and risk management for the
planning year, the economic developments, raw material ­prices
and currency categories as well as the legal, regulatory and
­political environment group were considered to be of medium to
high ­significance. Based on the scenarios applied or the assumed
probability of occurrence, these categories and this group could
produce a positive or negative deviation of up to 14% from our
projected EBITDA pre exceptionals, which is our key controlling
parameter. The legal, regulatory and political environment group
was particularly influenced by opportunities and risks in the energy
and environmental policy category. Opportunities and risks in other
categories – such as legal risks – are of very little significance.
In 2014, the currency category was not significant in itself but only
as part of the finance group. Furthermore, the energy price category
was significant.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015

In light of its extensive global activities and its dependence on raw
materials characterized by volatile price trends, our Performance
Polymers segment especially may be vulnerable to these risks,
which we seek to mitigate by means of suitable countermeasures.

Summary of overall opportunities and risks
The chemical industry worldwide is in a phase of radical change,
which naturally entails economic opportunities and risks. However,
the three-phase “Let’s LANXESS again” program for the global
realignment of the LANXESS Group initiated in 2014 gives us the
headroom that will enable us to remain effective and competitive
even in the evolving operating environment (see the “Strategy”
section in this combined management report). In addition, the
­realignment will allow us to leverage strategic and operational
­opportunities and to make maximum use of growth potential.
Despite mixed economic developments across regions and ­sectors,
our risk exposure during the reporting year was in general not
­materially different from our risk exposure during the previous year
due to our broadly diversified product and customer portfolios. We
continue to point to the intense competitive pressure still facing
our synthetic rubber businesses. As part of the realignment, we
will strengthen our future competitiveness through the partnership
with Saudi Aramco agreed in the reporting year.
All planning is subject to a certain degree of forecasting risk, which
could necessitate flexible adjustments to rapidly changing business
conditions over the course of the year. This is particularly true in
view of the fact that planning and forecasts in general have become
somewhat less reliable due to the changes in our procurement and
customer markets.
In light of our present financing structures, our sound liquidity
­position and the headroom created by our realignment and in
particular by the partnership agreed with Saudi Aramco, we are
confident of mastering risks that arise in the future.
Based on an overall evaluation of risk management information,
the Board of Management at the present time cannot identify any
sufficiently likely risks or risk combinations that would jeopardize
the continued existence of LANXESS.

Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements

General information
LANXESS AG is entered as a stock corporation in the C
­ ommercial
Register of the Cologne District Court under HRB 53652. Its
­registered office is at Kennedyplatz 1, 50569 Cologne, Germany.
The annual financial statements of LANXESS AG and the consoli­
dated financial statements of the LANXESS Group, to which the
auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers Aktiengesellschaft Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main, have issued unqualified
auditor’s reports, are published in the German Federal Gazette
(Bundesanzeiger).
The consolidated financial statements of the LANXESS Group
for fiscal 2015 were prepared by the Board of Management of
LANXESS AG and authorized for submission to the Supervisory
Board on February 26, 2016. It is the responsibility of the Super­
visory Board to examine the consolidated financial statements and
declare whether or not it approves them.

Structure and components of the
consolidated financial statements
The consolidated financial statements comprise the statement of
financial position, the income statement and statement of comprehensive income, the statement of changes in equity, the statement
of cash flows and the notes, which include the segment information.
The consolidated financial statements were prepared in euros (€).
Amounts are stated in millions of euros (€ million) except where
otherwise indicated. Assets and liabilities are classified in the statement of financial position as current or non-current. Further details
of their maturities are provided below in certain cases.
The consolidated financial statements were prepared on the basis of
historical acquisition, generation, construction or production costs
of the assets. Where different valuation principles are prescribed,
these are used. They are explained in the section on accounting
policies and valuation principles.

L ANXE S S Annual Report 2015

The income statement was prepared using the cost-of-sales method.
The fiscal year for these consolidated financial statements is the
calendar year.

Financial reporting standards
and interpretations applied
The consolidated financial statements of the LANXESS Group as
of December 31, 2015, were prepared in accordance with the
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by
the European Union (E.U.) and the corresponding interpretations,
together with the additional requirements of Section 315a, Paragraph 1 of the German Commercial Code (HGB).
The mandatory first-time application of the following financial
­reporting standards and interpretations in 2015 currently has no
impact, or no material impact, on the LANXESS Group:
IFRIC 21 Levies: This interpretation addresses ­accounting
for government levies that are not income taxes w
­ ithin the
­meaning of IAS 12 and sets out, in particular, when an
­obligation to pay such levies is to be accounted for as a liability.
nn Annual Improvements to International Financial Reporting
Standards, 2011–2013 cycle: This comprises minor amendments to IFRS 1 “First-time Adoption of International ­Financial
Reporting Standards,” IFRS 3 “Business Combinations,”
IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement” and IAS 40 “Investment
Property.”

Consolidated Financial Statements

Financial reporting standards
and interpretations issued but
not yet mandatory
In 2015, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)
and the IFRS Interpretations Committee issued financial ­reporting
­s tandards and interpretations, whose application was not yet
­mandatory for that year and which the LANXESS Group thus did
not yet apply. The application of these standards and interpretations
is in some cases contingent upon their endorsement by the E.U. It
is therefore possible that the dates for mandatory application may
ultimately be later than indicated below.

Financial instruments
In November 2009, the IASB published IFRS 9. The new require­
ments this standard introduced for classifying and ­measuring
­financial assets were supplemented in October 2010 by
­requirements for the measurement of financial liabilities and the
­derecognition of financial instruments. In November 2013, the IASB
published amendments to IFRS 9 containing new rules on hedge
accounting. These amendments created the option, if p
­ articular
criteria are met, of presenting changes in the credit risk of fi­ nancial
liabilities that are measured at fair value in ­comprehensive income
rather than in profit or loss. It was possible to apply this ­principle
at an earlier date, i.e. without implementing the other provisions of
IFRS 9. In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9.
This contains revised regulations for classifying and measuring
financial assets and, for the first time, rules on impairment charges
for ­financial instruments. The expected loss model is now used
to anticipate and recognize future losses as well as losses that
have already been incurred. The new standard is to be applied
for annual periods ­beginning on or after January 1, 2018. ­Earlier
­application is ­permitted. It has not yet been endorsed by the E.U.
The LANXESS Group is currently evaluating the impact that the
­application of this standard will have on its earnings, asset and
financial ­position.

L ANXE S S Annual Report 2015

Revenue from contracts with customers
The IASB published the new standard IFRS 15 on May 28, 2014.
It supersedes IAS 11 and IAS 18 and introduces a five-step model
containing basic principles for revenue recognition. These basic
principles relate, in particular, to the identification of the services
performed and the associated revenues and rules on the timing of
revenue recognition. The standard also contains further rules on
specific issues and requires additional disclosures in the notes on
the type, level, timing and uncertainties relating to revenues from
contracts with customers. As a result of the amendment to IFRS 15
published in September 2015, the date of initial application has been
postponed from January 1, 2017, to annual periods beginning on or
after January 1, 2018. The amendment has not yet been endorsed
by the E.U. The LANXESS Group will only be able to evaluate the
impact that the application of this standard will have on its earnings,
asset and financial position once the present examination of the
substance and contractual basis has been completed.

Leasing
On January 13, 2016, the IASB published the new standard IFRS 16,
which supersedes IAS 17. Under IFRS 16, lessees will recognize all
leases as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability in the statement
of financial position on the basis of the present ­value of the lease
payments. Depreciation and amortization on the ­capitalized right-ofuse asset and interest expense for compounding the lease ­liabilities
are recorded in the income statement. For lessees, therefore the
distinction between operating and finance leases is abolished. The
new standard also contains options for the treatment of short-term
leases and leases of low value. If these options are applied, the
costs of these leases are recognized as current expenses. There
are no significant changes for lessors. The new standard is to be
applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019.
Earlier application is permitted if IFRS 15 is applied. It has not yet
been endorsed by the E.U. The LANXESS Group will evaluate the
impact that application of this standard will have on its earnings,
asset and financial position.

Consolidation
The financial statements of the consolidated companies were
­prepared using uniform accounting policies and valuation principles.
If the fiscal year of a consolidated company does not end on
­December 31, interim financial statements are prepared for the
purpose of consolidation.
Intra-Group profits, losses, sales, income, expenses, receivables
and payables are eliminated.

Scope of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of the LANXESS Group
include LANXESS AG and all subsidiaries under the control of
LANXESS AG. Control exists if LANXESS AG is exposed to ­variable
returns from the relationship with a company and has power over
the company. Power means that LANXESS AG has existing rights
that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the

L ANXE S S Annual Report 2015

c­ ompany and thus exert a significant influence over the variable
­returns. The ability to control another company generally d
­ erives
from direct or indirect ownership of a majority of the voting rights.
In the case of structured entities, control normally derives from
­contractual agreements. A company is consolidated as of the
date from which LANXESS AG is able to exercise control and
­deconsolidated when this is no longer the case.
Interests in associates in which the LANXESS Group exerts a
­significant influence, generally through an ownership ­interest
­b etween 20% and 50%, and interests in joint ventures are
­accounted for using the equity method.
Entities that are in aggregate immaterial to the Group’s earnings,
asset and financial position are not consolidated, but are included
in the consolidated financial statements at cost of acquisition.
Changes in the scope of consolidation are stated in the section
headed "Companies consolidated," which also contains a list of
companies.

184

Consolidated Financial Statements

Fully consolidated companies
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition
­method. The cost of a business combination is stated as the
­aggregate of the fair values, at the date of acquisition, of the
­assets transferred, liabilities incurred or assumed, and any e
­ quity
­instruments issued in exchange for control of the acquiree. It
also contains the fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from
­contingent consideration contracts.
For the first-time consolidation, the assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities identified in the course of the acquisition are measured at
fair value as of the acquisition date.
For each business combination, there is an option to include any
shares not acquired either at their fair value or at the pro rata share
of the fair value of the acquiree’s net assets. They are reported in
the statement of financial position as equity attributable to non-­
controlling interests.
Acquisition-related costs – except those incurred to issue debt or
equity securities – are recognized in profit or loss.
Goodwill is measured as of the acquisition date as the excess of
the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling
interests and the fair value of any previously held equity interest
over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Negative goodwill is
immediately recognized in profit or loss after the purchase price
allocation has been re-examined.

Investments accounted for using
the equity method
The cost of acquisition of an entity accounted for using the equity
method is adjusted annually by the percentage of any change in
its equity corresponding to LANXESS’s percentage interest in the
entity. If any decline in value exceeds the carrying amount of the
entity, write-downs are recognized on the associated non-current
assets. If the carrying amount of the entity and the associated assets
are reduced to zero, liabilities would be recognized if the owner has
entered into a legal or substantive obligation, e.g. to offset pro rata
losses, or has made payments for the entity.

L ANXE S S Annual Report 2015

Differences arising from the first-time accounting for investments
using the equity method are determined according to the same
principles as for consolidated subsidiaries. Any goodwill is included
in the carrying amount of the entity.

Joint operations
Joint operations are joint arrangements in which the parties that
exercise joint control have rights to the assets and obligations for
the liabilities relating to the arrangement. LANXESS a­ ccounts for its
share of the joint assets and joint liabilities of such joint operations
and its share of the revenues and expenses, i­ncluding its share of
any jointly incurred expenses.

Currency translation
In the financial statements of the individual consolidated companies
that form the basis for the consolidated financial statements of the
LANXESS Group, all foreign-currency assets and liabilities are
translated at closing rates, irrespective of whether they are hedged.
Forward contracts serving as economic hedges against fluctuations
in exchange rates are reflected at fair value. Exchange differences
resulting from currency translation are reflected in profit or loss in
the net exchange result within other financial income and expense.
The financial statements of each foreign entity are valued on the
basis of the currency of the primary economic environment in
which the entity operates (functional currency concept). By far the
majority of foreign companies are financially, economically and
­organizationally autonomous and their functional currencies are
therefore the respective local currencies. The assets and liabilities
of these companies are translated at closing rates, while income
and expense items are translated at average rates for the year.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity is recorded
in the currency of the acquired entity and translated at the closing
rate, irrespective of the date on which it arose.

185

Consolidation
Currency translation
Accounting policies and valuation principles

Equity is translated at historical rates, while income, expenses and
other changes during the year are translated at average rates. The
differences between the resulting amounts and those obtained
by translating at closing rates are reported separately in other
­comprehensive income as exchange differences on translation of
operations outside the eurozone.
If a company is deconsolidated, the relevant exchange differences
are reversed and recognized in profit or loss.
The principal exchange rates used for currency translation in the
LANXESS Group were:

assets with a definite useful life are recognized at cost and ­amortized
over their respective useful lives using the ­straight-line method.
The amortization period for intangible assets other than goodwill
is between 3 and 20 years. Amortization in the r­ eporting period
is allocated to the respective functional areas. Any further ­decline
in value is recognized by means of a write-down. ­Write-downs are
reversed in the following year if the reasons for them no longer
exist, provided that this does not cause the ­carrying amounts of
the assets to exceed either the amortized cost at which they would
have been carried if the write-downs had not been r­ ecognized or
their current recoverable amount. The lower of these two amounts
is recognized. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and goodwill are not amortized. They are tested for impairment annually
or more often if events or a change in circumstances i­ndicate a
possible ­impairment. Any impairment charges are recognized in
other ­operating e
­ xpenses. Impairment charges on goodwill are
not reversed.
The costs incurred for in-house software development at the
­application development stage are capitalized and amortized over
the expected useful life of the software from the date it is completed.
Emissions allowances are recognized at cost. Allowances allocated free of charge by the German Emissions Trading Authority
(­DEHSt) or comparable authorities in other European countries are
­capitalized at a value of zero.

Accounting policies and
valuation principles
The accounting policies and valuation principles are the same as
those used in the previous fiscal year and have been consistently
applied. However, certain changes have resulted from the mandatory
first-time application in 2015 of new or amended financial reporting
standards and interpretations. These changes are explained in the
section headed “Financial reporting standards and interpretations
applied.”

Intangible assets
Intangible assets comprise goodwill and other intangible ­assets such
as software, concessions, industrial property rights, ­similar rights and
assets, and licenses to such rights and assets. ­Acquired intangible

Property, plant and equipment is carried at the cost of acquisition
or construction less depreciation for wear and tear. LANXESS does
not use the revaluation model. Write-downs are recognized for
any reduction in value that goes beyond normal depreciation. In
compliance with IAS 36, impairment charges are measured by
comparing the carrying amounts with the discounted cash flows
expected to be generated by the assets in the future. Where it is not
­possible to allocate future cash flows to specific assets, the impairment charge is assessed on the basis of the discounted cash flows
for the cash-­generating unit to which the asset belongs. W
­ rite-downs
are reversed accordingly if the reasons for them no longer apply,
provided that this does not cause the carrying amounts of the
­assets to exceed either the amortized cost at which they would
have been recognized if they had not been written down or their
current ­recoverable amount.

186

Consolidated Financial Statements

The cost of self-constructed property, plant and equipment
­comprises the direct costs, as well as an appropriate share of the
necessary material and manufacturing overheads. It also includes
the shares of depreciation, of expenses for company pension
plans and discretionary employee benefits that are attributable
to ­production.
Where an obligation exists to decommission or dismantle assets at
the end of their useful life or to restore a site to its original ­condition,
the present value of the obligation is capitalized along with the cost
of acquisition or construction and a provision in the same amount
is recognized.
If the construction phase of property, plant or equipment extends
over a long period, the directly attributable borrowing costs incurred
up to the date of completion are capitalized as part of the cost of
acquisition or construction.
Expenses for current maintenance and repairs are recognized
­directly in profit or loss. Subsequent acquisition or construction
costs are capitalized if they will result in future economic benefits
and can be reliably determined.
Expenses for general overhauls of major large-scale plants are
recognized separately at the cost of the overhaul as part of the
­related assets and depreciated over the period between one general
overhaul and the next using the straight-line method.
Where assets comprise material components with different
­p urposes, different properties, or different useful lives, the
­components are capitalized individually and depreciated over their
useful lives.
When property, plant or equipment is sold, the difference between
the net proceeds and the carrying amount is recognized as a gain
or loss in other operating income or expenses.

Assets are depreciated by the straight-line method based on the
following useful lives, which are applied uniformly throughout the
Group:

Leasing
In accordance with IAS 17, leased assets where substantially all
risks and rewards incidental to ownership are transferred (finance
leases) are capitalized at the lower of their fair value and the present
value of the minimum lease payments at the date of addition. They
are depreciated over their useful lives. If subsequent transfer of title
to the leased asset is uncertain, it is depreciated over the shorter
of its estimated useful life and the lease term.
The future lease payments are recorded as financial liabilities.
­Liabilities under finance leases are recognized at the fair value of
the leased asset at the inception of the lease or the present value
of the minimum lease payments, whichever is lower. Thereafter
the minimum lease payments are divided into financing costs and
the portion representing repayment of the principal. In the case of
leasing contracts that do not include the transfer of substantially
all risks and rewards incidental to ownership (operating leases),
the lessee recognizes the lease payments as current expenses.
Property, plant and equipment also include assets that LANXESS
leases or rents out to third parties under agreements other than
finance leases. However, if the lessee is to be regarded as the
­economic owner of the assets, a receivable is recognized in the
amount of the discounted future lease or rental payments.
Leasing arrangements may be embedded in other contracts. Where
IFRS stipulates separation of the embedded leasing arrangement,
the components of the contract are recognized and measured
separately.

Accounting policies and valuation principles

Financial instruments
Financial instruments are contracts that give rise simultaneously
to a financial asset for one party and a financial liability or equity
instrument for another. These include primary financial instruments,
such as trade receivables or payables and other financial assets or
liabilities, as well as derivative financial instruments, which are used
to hedge risks arising from changes in currency exchange rates,
raw material prices or interest rates.
Financial instruments are recognized as soon as the LANXESS
Group becomes the contracting party to them. Financial assets are
derecognized when the contractual rights to receive payments from
them expire or the financial assets are transferred together with all
significant risks and rewards. Financial liabilities are derecognized
when the contractual obligations are met or canceled, or when
they expire.
In the case of regular-way purchases and sales, the settlement
date is the relevant date for first-time recognition or derecognition
of financial assets in the financial statements.
Trade receivables and other financial receivables are initially
­recognized at fair value and subsequently accounted for at a­ mortized
cost using the effective interest method. Where write-downs are
necessary as a result of impairment testing, they are recognized
using separate accounts.
Investments in affiliated companies and the equity instruments
included in non-current assets are classified as available-for-sale
financial assets and recognized at fair value, except where their
fair value cannot be reliably determined, in which case they are
­recognized at cost. Where objective evidence exists that such assets
may be impaired, an impairment charge is recognized on the basis
of an impairment test.
Investments in companies accounted for using the equity method
are recognized at the amounts corresponding to LANXESS’s shares
in their equity in accordance with IAS 28.
Financial assets held for trading are recognized at fair value. Any
gain or loss arising from subsequent measurement is reflected in
the income statement.

L ANXE S S Annual Report 2015

All other primary financial assets are classified as available for
sale and recognized at fair value, except if they are allocable to
loans and receivables. Any gain or loss resulting from ­subsequent
­measurement, with the exception of write-downs and of gains
and losses from currency translation, is recognized in other
­comprehensive income until the asset is derecognized.
Primary financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value less
any transaction costs. In subsequent periods, they are measured
at amortized cost using the effective-interest method.
LANXESS does not utilize the option of designating non-derivative
financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss upon
initial recognition.

Derivative financial instruments and
hedging transactions
The LANXESS Group recognizes derivative financial instruments
as assets or liabilities at their fair value on the closing date. Changes
in fair value are recognized in profit or loss. Where foreign currency
derivatives or forward commodity contracts used to hedge future
cash flows from pending business or forecast transactions qualify for
hedge accounting under the relevant financial reporting standard,
changes in the value of such instruments are recognized separately
in other comprehensive income until the underlying transactions are
realized. The amounts recognized here are subsequently reclassified
to other operating income or cost of sales, as appropriate, when
the hedged transaction is recognized in profit or loss. Any portion
of the change in value of such derivatives deemed to be ineffective
with regard to the hedged risk is recognized directly in profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives used to hedge
long-term liabilities with variable interest rates – provided such
derivatives qualify for hedge accounting – are recognized in other
comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified to profit or
loss as interest income or expense at the same time as the income
from the hedged transaction is recognized in profit or loss.

188

Consolidated Financial Statements

Contracts concluded for the purpose of receiving or delivering
non-financial items based on expected purchases, sales or utilization
and held for this purpose are recognized not as financial derivatives
but as pending transactions. If the contracts contain embedded
derivatives, the derivatives are accounted for separately from the
host contract, provided that the economic characteristics and risks
of the embedded derivative are not closely related to those of the
host contract.

Most of the derivative financial instruments used by LANXESS
are traded in an active, liquid market. The fair values as of the end
of the reporting period pertain exclusively to forward exchange
contracts and are derived from their trading or listed prices using
the “forward method.” Where no market price is available, values
are determined using recognized capital market pricing methods
based on observable market data. In determining the fair values,
adjustments for LANXESS’s own credit risk and counterparty credit
risk are made on the basis of the respective net positions.

Determination of fair value
Inventories
The principal methods and assumptions used in measuring the fair
value of financial instruments are outlined below:
Trade receivables, other receivables and cash and cash e
­ quivalents
are generally due within one year. Their carrying amount is ­therefore
their fair value. Receivables due in more than one year are d
­ iscounted
using current interest rates to determine their fair value.
The fair value of securities is determined from their market price
on the closing date, disregarding transaction costs.

Inventories encompass assets held for sale in the ordinary course of
business (finished goods and merchandise), assets in the ­process of
being manufactured for sale (work in process) and ­assets ­consumed
during the production process (raw materials and supplies). They
are valued by the weighted-average method and ­recognized at
the lower of cost and net realizable value, which is the estimated
selling price in the ordinary course of business less the ­estimated
­ roduction costs and selling expenses.
­remaining p

The bonds are traded in an active, liquid market. Their fair values
are the prices determined and published by the market. If no liquid
market price is available for a bond, its fair value is determined on
the basis of observable inputs, using a risk-related discount rate.

The cost of ­production ­comprises the direct cost of materials, direct
­manufacturing ­expenses and appropriate allocations of fixed and
variable material and manufacturing overheads at normal ­capacity
utilization, where these are attributable to production. It also ­includes
expenses for company pension plans, corporate welfare facilities and
discretionary employee benefits that can be allocated to ­production.
Administrative costs are included where they are attributable to
production.

The fair value of trade payables and other primary financial liabilities
due within one year is normally their carrying amount. That of all
other liabilities is determined by discounting them to present value
where feasible.

Borrowing costs incurred in the course of production are not
­included in the acquisition or production cost of inventories as
the products are not manufactured using long-term production
processes.

The fair values of receivables and liabilities relating to finance leases
are the present values of the net lease payments calculated using
the market rate for comparable lease agreements.

Given the production and distribution sequences characteristic
of the LANXESS Group, work in process and finished goods are
grouped together.

The fair value of loans and liabilities to banks is calculated from
discounted future interest payments and capital repayment amounts.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise checks, cash and balances
with banks. Securities with maturities of up to three months from
the date of acquisition are recognized in cash and cash equivalents
in view of their high liquidity.

increases. Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability are
fully recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in
which they occur. They are not reclassified to profit or loss in a
subsequent period.
Personnel-related provisions mainly include those for annual bonus
payments, payments under multi-year compensation programs and
other personnel costs.

Non-current assets and liabilities held for sale
Material assets are recognized as held for sale if they can be sold
in their current condition and a sale is highly probable. Such assets
may be individual non-current assets, groups of assets (disposal
groups) or complete business entities. A disposal group may also
include liabilities if these are to be divested together with the assets
as part of the transaction.
Assets classified as held for sale are no longer depreciated. They
are recognized at the lower of fair value less costs to sell and the
carrying amount.

Provisions
Provisions are recognized and measured in accordance with IAS 37
and, where appropriate, IAS 19 and IFRS 2, using the best estimates
of the amounts of the obligations. Non-current portions of material
provisions due in more than one year are discounted to present
value if the extent and timing of the obligation can be assessed
with reasonable certainty. Where the projected obligation alters as
the time of performance approaches (interest effect), the related
expense is recognized in other financial expense.
If the projected obligation declines as a result of a change in the
estimate, the provision is reversed by the corresponding amount
and the effect is recognized in the income or expense item(s) in
which the provision was originally recorded.
Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits are
established for defined benefit pension plans. The provision is
­measured according to the actuarial present value of the ­obligation,
calculated using the projected unit credit method. This takes into
account not only the known pensions and pension entitlements
as of the closing date, but also expected future salary and benefit

L ANXE S S Annual Report 2015

The stock-based employee compensation programs (Long-Term
Stock Performance Plan – LTSP) provide for cash settlement.
­Provisions are established for the obligations entered into under
such programs on the basis of the proportionate fair value of the
rights allocated to employees. The fair value is determined using
the Monte Carlo method, in which future returns are simulated and
the expected payment is calculated from the value of the rights
based on a two-dimensional standard distribution of returns. The
fair value of the rights is reflected in a pro rata provision during the
vesting period.
The stock-based compensation program for members of the
­Supervisory Board provides for variable cash settlement, p
­ rovided
that LANXESS stock has outperformed a defined index during
their term of office. Provisions are established for the expected
obligations.
Provisions are established for restructuring if there is a legal or constructive obligation to do so on the basis of a detailed restructuring
plan adopted at the management level authorized to decide on this,
and the employees affected or their representatives have been
informed. Such provisions contain the expenses that are directly
allocable to the restructuring measures, are necessary to implement
these measures and not related to the future operating business.
The LANXESS Group also records provisions for current or pending
legal proceedings where the resulting expenses can be reasonably
estimated. These provisions include all estimated fees and legal
costs and the cost of potential settlements. However, litigation
­expenses are only included if it is assumed that they will have to
be borne by LANXESS. The amounts of such provisions are based
upon information and cost estimates provided by the Group’s legal
advisers. The provisions are regularly reviewed together with the
Group’s legal advisers and adjusted if necessary.

Contingent liabilities

Research and development expenses

Contingent liabilities are potential obligations to third parties or
existing commitments, the extent of which cannot be reasonably
­estimated or which are unlikely to lead to an outflow of r­ esources.
They are not recognized in the statement of financial position
­unless they have been entered into in connection with a business
­combination.

According to IAS 38, research costs cannot be capitalized, w
­ hereas
development costs must be capitalized if, and only if, specific
­narrowly defined conditions are fulfilled. Development costs must
be capitalized if it is sufficiently certain that the development activity
will generate future economic benefits which will also cover the
associated development costs. However, since the development
and optimization of products and processes frequently involves
uncertainty with regard to the ability to realize future economic
benefits, the conditions for capitalization of development costs are
generally not met.

Liabilities
Other current liabilities are recognized at repayment or redemption
amounts. Other non-current liabilities are recognized at amortized
cost.
Subsidies received from third parties for the acquisition or
­construction of property, plant and equipment are reflected in o
­ ther
liabilities and released to the respective functional area of the income
statement over the underlying period or expected useful life of the
assets to which they relate.

Sales and other revenues
Revenues are recognized as soon as delivery has been made or the
service rendered and are reported net of sales taxes and deductions.
This is normally the case when the significant risks and rewards
associated with ownership of the goods pass to the purchaser. It
must also be sufficiently probable that the economic benefits will
be obtained and the costs incurred must be reliably determinable.
Customer rebates are reflected in the period in which the revenues
are realized. Revenues such as license fees, rental income, interest
income or dividends that are attributable to a subsequent fiscal
year are accrued.
The LANXESS Group does not have long-term production orders.
Accordingly, the percentage-of-completion method is not applied
to determine when revenues are realized.

Income taxes
This item comprises the income taxes paid or accrued in the
­individual countries, plus deferred taxes. Income taxes are ­computed
on the basis of local tax rates.
Income tax receivables and liabilities relate to both the respective
fiscal year and previous years. They are assessed on the basis of
the applicable legislation, taking into account present legal practice
judgments and prevailing opinion. Uncertain income tax items
are recognized at their expected value provided that payment or
reimbursement is considered probable.
In accordance with IAS 12, deferred taxes are calculated for
­temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or
liabilities in the statement of financial position and the tax base and
for differences arising from consolidation measures or realizable
tax loss carryforwards. The calculations are based on tax planning
calculations and customary and realizable tax strategies. Deferred
taxes are calculated at the rates which are expected to apply in the
individual countries at the time of realization, taking into account the
period for which deferred taxes may be used and any constraints
on the utilization of loss carryforwards. These are based on the
statutory regulations in force, or already enacted in relation to future
periods, as of the closing date.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each
closing date and only the amount likely to be realizable due to
­future taxable income is recognized. Deferred tax assets from loss
­carryforwards are recognized if it is probable that the carryforwards
can be utilized.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are netted if they relate to income
taxes levied by the same tax authorities.

Statement of cash flows
The statement of cash flows shows how cash inflows and outflows during the year affected the cash and cash equivalents
of the LANXESS Group. Cash flows are classified by operating,
­investing and financing activities in accordance with IAS 7. The
liquidity ­reported in the statement of cash flows comprises cash
and cash equivalents.
The cash flow from operating activities is calculated using the
­indirect method. This involves eliminating the translation effects
and the effects of changes in the scope of consolidation from the
­changes recognized in the items on the statement of financial
­position. Therefore, the cash flows calculated by the indirect method
cannot be directly derived from the statement of financial position.
Disbursements for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment are included in the cash flows for investing activities after
deducting any third-party subsidies. Investments involving finance
leases, along with capitalized borrowing costs, are not included.
Comparison therefore should not be made between these items
and the capital expenditures shown in the schedule of changes in
property, plant and equipment.
Payments relating to operating leases are included in cash flows
from operating activities. Disbursements made under finance leases
where LANXESS is the lessee are recognized as cash outflows
for financing activities, while cash inflows under finance leases
where LANXESS is the lessor are recognized as cash inflows from
investing activities.
Cash outflows relating to the financing of pension obligations are
allocated to cash flows for operating activities.
Purchase prices paid or received in connection with acquisitions or
divestments of subsidiaries or other business entities are included in
the investing cash flow after deducting cash and cash equivalents
acquired or divested.
Interest and dividends received are also included in investing cash
flow, while interest and dividends paid are reflected in financing
cash flow.

Global impairment testing procedure
and impact
In the LANXESS Group, the impairment testing of non-current assets
starts with an analysis to determine whether impairment charges
need to be recognized or previously recognized impairment charges
reversed. If there are indications that this is the case, the residual
carrying amount of each cash-generating unit is compared with its
recoverable amount. In the LANXESS Group these analyses are
performed at least once a year.
For impairment testing of assets, the LANXESS Group defines its
business units as cash-generating units. The LANXESS Group
was reorganized effective January 1, 2015. The Butyl Rubber and
­Performance Butadiene Rubbers business units were combined
to form the Tire & Specialty Rubbers business unit and the High
Performance Elastomers and Keltan Elastomers business units
were combined as High Performance Elastomers. As in previous
years, impairment tests on their assets were performed at the
level of the Butyl Rubber, Performance Butadiene Rubbers, High
Performance Elastomers and Keltan Elastomers cash-­generating
units. Further, effective January 1, 2015, the antioxidants and
­accelerators product lines of the former Rubber Chemicals ­business
unit were integrated into the portfolio of the Advanced Industrial
­Intermediates ­business unit. The impairment test in this business
unit is performed at the level of the two cash-generating units
­Advanced ­Industrial I­ntermediates and Antioxidants & Accelerators.
In 2014, the i­mpairment test was based on the Advanced Industrial
­Intermediates business unit and the antioxidants and accelerators
product lines were included in the impairment test for the Rubber
Chemicals business unit. The specialty chemicals product line of
the Rubber Chemicals business unit, the Functional Chemicals
business unit and the Rhein Chemie business unit were combined
in a new R
­ hein Chemie Additives business unit as of January 1,
2015 and will form a cash-generating unit in the future. In 2014,
the impairment test on their assets was performed at the level of
the business units in existence in that year. If there is reason to
suspect impairment of non-current assets below the level of the
cash-generating units, impairment testing is also performed at this
level and impairment charges or reversals of impairment charges
are recognized in profit or loss where necessary.

192

Consolidated Financial Statements

Cash-generating units to which goodwill is allocated are tested
annually for impairment – or more frequently if events or c­ hanges
in circumstances indicate a possible impairment. The residual
­carrying amount of each cash-generating unit, including the goodwill
­allocated to it, is compared with its recoverable amount. For the
impairment test on goodwill in the Tire & Specialty Rubbers business
unit in 2015, the Butyl Rubber and Performance Butadiene Rubbers
cash-generating units were tested as a group of cash-generating
units. In 2014, goodwill was tested at the level of the Performance
Butadiene Rubbers cash-generating unit. Moreover, the Advanced
Industrial Intermediates and Antioxidants & Accelerators cash-­
generating units form a group for the purpose of the impairment
test on goodwill in the Advanced Industrial Intermediates Business
Unit. In the prior year, the goodwill of the Rhein Chemie Additives
business unit, which since January 1, 2015, has comprised the
former specialty chemicals product line of the Rubber Chemicals
business unit as well as the Functional Chemicals and Rhein Chemie
business units, was tested at the level of the Functional Chemicals
and Rhein Chemie business units.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s fair value
less costs of disposal and the value in use. If the carrying amount
of a cash-generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount, an
­impairment charge is recognized in certain circumstances. The fair
value less costs of disposal – which represents the best estimate of
the potential sale proceeds at the time of the respective impairment
test – is the amount obtainable from the sale of a cash-generating
unit in an arm’s-length transaction between knowledgeable, willing
parties, less the costs of disposal. The value in use is defined as
the present value of future cash flows based on the continuing use
of the asset and its retirement at the end of its useful life. The first
step in an impairment test is to determine the fair value less costs
of disposal. If this is less than the carrying amount of the cash-­
generating unit, the value in use is then determined. The fair value
less costs of disposal is generally calculated using a capital value
method which is allocated to Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy (see
under “Fair value measurement” in Note [36]).

L ANXE S S Annual Report 2015

Determination of the recoverable amount based on the fair v­ alue
less costs of disposal generally relies on a forecast of f­uture
net cash flows. This is based on the planning approved by the
­m anagement of LANXESS AG, which contains estimates of
­expected market c­ onditions and other factors such as future raw
material ­prices, e
­ nergy costs, functional costs, exchange rates and
capital ­expenditures. The interactions between these factors are
reflected in the expected net cash flows. The estimates are based
on manage­ment’s past experience, taking account of internal and
external economic and industry-specific sources of information.
Capacity expansions, reorganization projects and the resulting
synergies, provided these can also be used by a third party, are
reflected in future net cash flows through estimates. Determination of the value in use is based on a corresponding forecast of
future net cash flows. However, cash inflows and outflows relating
to expansion projects that have not yet commenced, restructuring
that is planned but has not yet been approved, and the associated
synergies are not taken into account. The forecasts used to calculate
the fair value less costs of disposal and to determine the value in
use cover a five-year period. The perpetual annuity calculation is
generally based on the last year in the planning period and does
not reflect growth rates. Where necessary, adjustments are made
to reflect the so-called steady state of the perpetual annuity. Future
net cash flows are discounted using the weighted average cost of
capital, which is derived according to IAS 36 from capital market
models, taking into account the capital structure and business risks
specific to the chemical industry, and is extrapolated from external
market information.
If a decline in value is determined, an impairment charge is first
­recognized for any goodwill assigned to the respective cash-­
generating unit. Any remaining impairment amount is allocated
among the other non-current assets of the cash-generating unit in
proportion to the carrying amounts on which the impairment test
was based. The recoverable amount of any non-current assets
below the level of the cash-generating unit is assessed and the loss
is allocated, but only up to the recoverable amount of these assets.
Any further impairment charge that would have been allocated to
these assets is allocated proportionately to the other assets in the
cash-generating unit.

Accounting policies and valuation principles
Estimation uncertainties and the exercise of discretion

Impairment charges are fully recognized in the income statement under
other operating expenses and reflected in the segment reporting in
the expenses of the respective segments.

the economic circumstances at the time of the impairment test.
Manage­ment’s expectations of future net cash flows therefore
­indirectly affect the measurement of goodwill and other assets.

If the impairment test indicates a need to reverse impairment charges
recognized on the assets of cash-generating units in previous years
­because the reasons for the impairment no longer exist or have
changed, the impairment charge is reversed only up to the amount that
would have existed after depreciation or amortization if the ­impairment
had not been recognized. Impairment charges on goodwill are not
­reversed. Reversals of impairment charge are fully recognized in the
income statement under other operating income and reflected in the
segment reporting in the income of the respective segments.

The assumptions and estimates used for the impairment test
­conducted on assets in fiscal 2015 could differ from the actual
­values in subsequent periods, necessitating subsequent v­ aluation
adjustments. The annual impairment tests are based on a discount
rate after taxes of 6.6% (2014: 7.4%). Calculation of the perpetual
annuity is generally based on the final year in the planning ­period.
Adjustments are made if the final year in the planning period does
not represent the so-called steady state. Growth rates are not
reflected in the perpetual annuity calculation. The calculation is
generally based on a capital value method which is allocated to
Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 13.
The testing of the cash-generating units showed no need for the
­recognition of ­impairment charges in fiscal 2014 and 2015. In
2015, reversals of impairment charges recognized for assets in
previous years ­comprised €37 million for the High Performance
Elastomers cash-generating unit (the former High Performance
Elastomers ­business unit prior to merging with the Keltan Elastomers
business unit) and €19 million for the Antioxidants & ­Accelerators
cash-­generating unit (formerly part of the Rubber Chemicals
­cash-­generating unit). No need to reverse impairment charges
was identified in 2014.

The results of the global impairment tests in fiscal 2014 and 2015
are outlined in the following section.

Estimation uncertainties and
the exercise of discretion
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS entails the selection of accounting policies and
valuation principles and the use of forward-looking assumptions
and estimates that may affect the measurement of assets and
liabilities, income and expenses, and contingent liabilities.
All assumptions and estimates used in the consolidated financial
statements are based on management’s expectations. Information
that could alter these estimates is reviewed continually and may
result in adjustments to the carrying amounts of the respective
assets and liabilities.
Assumptions and estimates that could materially impact the
­measurement of the LANXESS Group’s assets and liabilities are
explained below.
The LANXESS Group tests its cash-generating units for impairment
at least once a year by determining the respective recoverable
amount (for further information see the section headed “­Global
­impairment testing procedure and impact”). The test is based
on forecasts of future net cash flows, derived from reasonable
­assumptions representing the management’s best assessment of

On September 22, 2015, LANXESS and Saudi Aramco agreed to
enter into a strategic partnership for synthetic rubber, in which each
will hold a 50% interest. This strategic partnership will be named
ARLANXEO and headquartered in the Netherlands. ARLANXEO’s
activities will comprise the development, production, marketing and
sale of synthetic rubber. The Butyl Rubber, Performance Butadiene
Rubbers, High Performance Elastomers and Keltan Elastomers
cash-generating units are components of this strategic partnership, which is valued at €2.75 billion. To determine the recoverable
amount of the cash-generating units that belong to the strategic
partnership, the proceeds from the sale were allocated among the
four cash-generating units on the basis of the respective fair value
less costs of disposal.

­Elastomers cash-generating unit resulted in a recoverable amount
of €464 ­million based on the expected future business development. This corresponds to the fair value less costs of disposal and
is allocated to Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy in accordance
with IFRS 13. The impairment test as of the closing date therefore
­resulted in a reversal of less than €1 million of the impairment charge
on intangible assets and of €37 million of the impairment charge on
property, plant and equipment. The reversal of these impairment
charges is limited to the carrying amount that would have existed
if the impairment had not been recognized and is reflected in other
operating income in the income statement and in the Performance
Polymers segment in the segment reporting.
The Antioxidants & Accelerators cash-generating unit was
formed as a result of the reorganization of the LANXESS Group
­effective January 1, 2015, through the integration of the ­antioxidants
and accelerators product lines of the former R
­ ubber Chemicals
­business unit into the Advanced Industrial Inter­mediates business
unit. As a result of the reorganization, the cost structures were
optimized, leading to a reversal of the impairment charge on
­assets recognized in 2013. A recoverable amount of €154 ­million
was ­calculated. This corresponds to the fair value less costs of
­disposal and is allocated to Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy
in ­accordance with IFRS 13. The business activities of the Anti­
oxidants & ­A ccelerators cash-generating unit comprise the
­production and m
­ arketing of specialty rubber chemicals sold mainly
to m
­ anufacturers of tires and technical rubber products. The impairment test as of the ­closing date led to a reversal of €19 million of
the impairment charges recognized in previous years on the assets
of the former Rubber Chemicals cash-­generating unit. €2 million
of this amount pertained to intangible assets and €17 million to
property, plant and equipment. The reversal of these impairment
charges is limited to the carrying amount that would have existed
if the impairment had not been recognized and is reflected in other
operating income in the income statement and in the Advanced
Intermediates segment in the segment reporting.
There has been no material change in the estimates used for the
impairment charges recognized in previous years for the Keltan
Elastomers cash-generating unit.

L ANXE S S Annual Report 2015

The annual impairment test for the principal goodwill items is
­performed on the basis of fair value less costs of disposal. The calculation is generally based on a capital value method which is allocated
to Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 13.
Impairment tests are performed on goodwill items in local currency
if triggering events occur and at least once ­yearly on the regular
impairment testing date. Significant goodwill of €62 million relates
to the Tire & Specialty Rubbers business unit, which was formed
on January 1, 2015, by combining the former Butyl Rubber and
Performance Butadiene Rubbers business units. In 2014, this goodwill amounted to €80 million and was carried by the ­Performance
Butadiene Rubbers business unit. Goodwill of €28 ­million was
allocated to the Material Protection Products business unit in
2015 (2014: €27 million). Goodwill of €21 ­million pertained to
the Rhein Chemie Additives business unit, which was formed in
2015 by ­combining the specialty chemicals product line of the
former ­Rubber C
­ hemicals business unit, the F
­ unctional ­Chemicals
business unit and the R
­ hein Chemie business unit. In 2014, the
combined goodwill of the ­Rhein Chemie and ­Functional Chemicals
business units totaled €19 m
­ illion. The High ­Performance Materials
business unit carries goodwill of €18 million (2014: €18 million).
­Information on ­calculating the net cash flows can be found in this
chapter and the previous c­ hapter. All c­ hanges in goodwill ­compared
with the ­previous year are a
­ ttributable to ­currency effects. The
Tire & ­Specialty Rubbers ­business unit (2014: Butyl Rubber and
­Performance Butadiene R
­ ubbers business units) is dependent
in large part on market developments in the tire and automotive
industries, the Material Protection P
­ roducts business unit on the
performance of various industries and the Rhein ­Chemie ­Additives
­business unit primarily on development in various ­processing
­industries. The High Performance Materials business unit is ­mainly
dependent on market development in the automotive ­industry. The
estimates of future market developments on which ­detailed planning
is based are dependent on the respective ­customer industries and
draw on management’s past experience, taking account of internal
and external economic and industry-­specific sources of information.
The five-year planning ­period for the group of cash-­generating
units that comprises the Tire & Specialty R
­ ubber business unit
assumes average annual business growth of 2% (2014: 5% for
Butyl Rubber and Performance ­Butadiene R
­ ubbers together).
­Average annual business growth of 4% (2014: 5%) is assumed for
the ­Material Protection Products cash-­generating unit, 4% for the
Rhein ­Chemie Additives cash-­generating unit (2014: 4% for the

195

Estimation uncertainties and the exercise of discretion

specialty ­chemicals product line of the former Rubber Chemicals
business unit, the Functional Chemicals business unit and the Rhein
Chemie ­business unit together) and 1% (2014: 4%) for the High
Performance Materials cash-generating unit. No growth rates were
reflected in the perpetual annuity calculation. In the Tire & Specialty
Rubbers business unit, in view of the overcapacities for synthetic
rubbers in the detailed planning period, it is assumed that higher
EBITDA will be achieved for the perpetual annuity in the long term
than in the last planning year on account of the anticipated increase
in demand, especially for higher-quality rubber products. This is
factored in accordingly.
The impairment test performed on goodwill items in 2014 and 2015
did not indicate any need for recognition of impairment charges.
Neither a one-percentage-point increase in the discount rate nor
a 10% reduction in expected future net cash flows would have
led to the recognition of an impairment charge on goodwill items.
The recognition and measurement of provisions are also affected by
assumptions as to the probability of utilization, timing, the underlying
discount rate and the absolute level of risk. The LANXESS Group
performed sensitivity analyses on all provisions existing as of
­December 31, 2015 as required by the IFRS. These involved
­calculating the impact of isolated variations in the ­parameters used,
especially the probability of occurrence, discount rate and absolute
level of risk. The outcome of these sensitivity analyses shows that
variations in the assumptions described above would not have a
material impact on the level of other provisions reported in the
consolidated financial statements of the LANXESS Group. For
further information on the sensitivity analyses relating to provisions
for pension and other post-employment benefits, see Note [14].
Defined benefit pension plans also necessitate actuarial computations and measurements. The section on provisions for pensions
and other post-employment benefits contains information on the
assumptions on which the actuarial calculations and estimates were
based (see Note [14]).

L ANXE S S Annual Report 2015

Further, the LANXESS Group is affected by legal disputes. As an
international chemicals company, the LANXESS Group is exposed
to administrative or court proceedings in the normal course of
business and may be again in the future. Administrative and court
proceedings generally involve complex technical and/or legal
­issues and are therefore subject to a number of imponderables. The
­outcomes of any current or future proceedings cannot be ­predicted
with ­certainty. It is therefore possible that legal judgments could
give rise to e
­ xpenses that are not covered, or not fully covered,
by recognized provisions or equivalent insurance and that could
­materially affect the business operations, revenues, earnings or
cash flows of the LANXESS Group.
The establishment of provisions for environmental protection
and remediation measures also involves uncertainty and requires
­calculations and estimates of future costs. Information about this
can be found in the section headed “Other non-current and current
provisions” (see Note [15]).
There is also uncertainty surrounding the assessment of certain
tax situations by the tax authorities. Although the LANXESS Group
believes it has presented all tax-relevant information correctly and
in compliance with the law, it is possible that the tax authorities
may ­occasionally reach different conclusions. Provisions have been
­established where changes in tax assessments are ­probable. In
­addition, charges from tax risks from previous years are not
­considered to be likely. In the event of unfavorable developments,
LANXESS could be faced with additional charges in the low-­doubledigit millions of euros. The calculations are principally based on
experience of the outcome of previous tax audits and their impact
on the subsequent periods and the applicable legislation, taking
into account present legal practice and prevailing opinion.
Other significant estimates and discretion are used to assess the
useful lives of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment,
the capitalization of development costs, the probability of c­ ollecting
receivables and other assets, the valuation of inventories and the
ability to realize tax claims and deferred tax assets recognized
for temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards. The firsttime consolidation of business operations also involves estimation
­uncertainties and the exercise of discretion in determining the fair
values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities.

Also consolidated in the EMEA (excluding Germany) region are the
structured entities Dirlem (RF) (Pty) Ltd., Modderfontein, South
Africa, and Rustenburg Chrome Employees Empowerment Trust,
­Modderfontein, South Africa. The purpose of these structured
entities is to ensure employee participation in the company in
­accordance with South Africa’s Black Economic Empowerment
­legislation. LANXESS exercises control because the principal
­business activities were defined by LANXESS when the structured
entities were established. LANXESS guarantees the value of the
interests in LANXESS Chrome Mining (Pty.) Ltd., Modderfontein,
South Africa, held and managed by these structured entities. This
does not entail any material risks for the LANXESS Group.

DuBay Polymer GmbH, Hamm, Germany, is included in the consoli­
dated financial statements as a joint operation on a pro rata basis
in accordance with IFRS 11 because the partners exercise joint
control and purchase its entire output between them. The interest
held by LANXESS in this company’s capital is 50%. The purpose of
the company is to produce polybutylene terephthalate base resins
and blends for the joint owners and their affiliated companies. This
business relationship does not involve any material risks.

Companies consolidated

Further, Currenta GmbH & Co. OHG, Leverkusen, Germany, is an
associate accounted for in the consolidated financial statements
using the equity method (see Note [3]). LANXESS’s share in its
capital is 40%. Given its ability to contribute to material aspects of
financial and business policy decisions, LANXESS is able to ­exert a
significant influence. Currenta GmbH & Co. OHG principally provides
site services in the areas of energy, infrastructure and logistics for
LANXESS’s production sites in Germany. In view of its status as
a personally liable partner, LANXESS may be required to inject
further capital in the future. Transactions with this company are
outlined in Note [34].

Chardon, United States, was merged with LANXESS Corporation,
Pittsburgh, United States, and LANXESS Finance B.V., Sittard-­
Geleen, Netherlands, was merged with LANXESS Accounting
GmbH, Leverkusen, Germany.

LANXESS-TRSC (Nantong) Chemical Industrial Co., Ltd., Nantong,
China, is a producer of nitrile rubber. LANXESS’s share in its capital
is 50%. This company is fully consolidated because LANXESS
can determine key aspects of its financial and business policy. The
non-controlling interests in this company have a negligible influence
on the activities and cash flows of the LANXESS Group.

Europigments, S.L., Barcelona, Spain, and Rhein Chemie (­Qingdao)
Co., Ltd., Qingdao, China, are production companies in which
LANXESS has a stake of 52% and 90%, respectively. These
­companies are fully consolidated because LANXESS holds the
majority of the voting rights and therefore exercises control. The
non-controlling interests in these companies have a negligible
­influence on the activities and cash flows of the LANXESS Group.
Cash transfers from companies in China, Brazil, India, South Africa,
South Korea, Argentina and Russia are subject to restrictions as
a result of regulated capital markets. These affect approximately
10% (2014: 14%) of the LANXESS Group’s cash, cash equivalents
and near-cash assets.
Non-consolidated companies are accounted for at cost. These
companies are immaterial to the LANXESS Group’s earnings, asset
and financial position, since together they account for less than
0.1% of Group sales and less than 0.1% of equity.
In the reporting period LANXESS Chemicals, S.L., Barcelona, Spain,
was merged with LANXESS Holding Hispania, S.L., B

financial statements
Investments accounted for using
the equity method

The carrying amount of the investment in Currenta GmbH & Co. OHG
was unchanged from the previous year at €0 million. As of the
­reporting date, a share of the losses amounting to €54 million
(2014: €86 million) was not recognized in the consolidated ­financial
­statements. This loss declined by €32 million in the reporting period
due to income of €11 million and a gain of €21 million, which is
reflected in other comprehensive income. In the previous year, the
losses recognized in other comprehensive income resulted in a pro
rata loss of €86 million, which did not have to be recognized in the
consolidated financial statements.

4 | Investments in other affiliated companies
This item contains interests in other affiliated companies totaling
€12 million (2014: €13 million).
As of December 31, 2015, all the other investments classified as
available-for-sale financial assets – apart from the shares in Gevo
Inc., Englewood, United States, and BioAmber Inc., Minneapolis,
United States – comprised unlisted equity instruments. Since the fair
values of these instruments at the closing date could not be reliably
determined, they were recognized at cost. There are currently no
plans to dispose of these investments.

Consolidated Financial Statements

5 | Derivative financial instruments
The derivative financial instruments held by the LANXESS Group
comprise forward exchange contracts and are capitalized in the
consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2015 at a total fair value
of €15 million (2014: €19 million). Instruments with a negative fair
value totaling €119 million (2014: €121 million) are recognized
as liabilities.

The LANXESS Group expects that, of the unrealized losses on
currency hedges recognized in other comprehensive income in
2015, €54 million will be reclassified from equity to profit or loss
in 2016 and €8 million in 2017 (2014: €42 million in 2015 and
€8 million in 2016).
Information on the maturity structure of derivative assets and

Currency hedging contracts concluded to hedge future sales in
foreign currencies had a total notional amount of €1,268 million
(2014: €1,017 million). As of December 31, 2015, these contracts
had positive fair values of €4 million (2014: €3 million) and n
­ egative

Authorized capital
As of December 31, 2015, the company’s authorized capital
­comprised the following:
Authorized Capital I and II
Pursuant to Section 4, Paragraph 2 of LANXESS AG’s articles of
association, the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on May 23, 2013,
authorized the Board of Management until May 22, 2018, with the
approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the capital stock
on one or more occasions by issuing new no-par shares against
cash or contributions in kind up to a total amount of €16,640,534
(­Authorized Capital I). Stockholders are generally entitled to
­subscription rights when Authorized Capital is utilized. With
the approval of the Supervisory Board, subscription rights can
be e
­ xcluded for residual amounts and in order to grant holders
of warrants or convertible bonds issued by the company and its
­affiliates s­ ubscription rights to the number of new shares for which
such parties would be entitled to subscribe upon exercise of their
warrants or conversion rights. Moreover, subscription rights can
be excluded with the approval of the Supervisory Board when the
company’s capital stock is increased against contributions in kind,
particularly for the acquisition of companies. Subscription rights
can also be excluded with the approval of the Supervisory Board in
order to grant holders of convertible and/or warrant bonds issued
by the company or its affiliates new shares upon exercise of their
rights. Finally, subscription rights can also be excluded with the
approval of the Supervisory Board if the issue price of the new
shares is not significantly lower than the stock market price at the
time the issue price is fixed and the issued shares do not exceed
10% of the company’s capital stock. The upper limit of 10% of the
capital stock is reduced by the proportionate interest in the capital
stock attributable to those shares issued or sold during the term
of this authorization while excluding stockholders’ rights in direct
or analogous application of Section 186, Paragraph 3, Sentence 4
of the German Stock Corporation Act. Further details are given in
Section 4, Paragraph 2 of the articles of association.

Notes to the statement of financial position

In addition, pursuant to Section 4, Paragraph 3 of LANXESS AG’s
articles of association, the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on May 13,
2015, authorized the Board of Management until May 22, 2018, with
the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the ­company’s
capital stock on one or more occasions by issuing new no-par
shares against cash or contributions in kind up to a total amount of
€18,304,587 (Authorized Capital II). Stockholders are generally
entitled to subscription rights when Authorized Capital is utilized.
With the approval of the Supervisory Board, subscription rights
can be excluded for residual amounts and in order to grant holders
of warrants or convertible bonds issued by the company and its
affiliates subscription rights to the number of new shares for which
such parties would be entitled to subscribe upon exercise of their
warrants or conversion rights. Moreover, subscription rights can
be excluded with the approval of the Supervisory Board when the
company’s capital stock is increased against contributions in kind,
particularly for the acquisition of companies. Subscription rights
can also be excluded with the approval of the Supervisory Board in
order to grant holders of convertible and/or warrant bonds issued
by the company or its affiliates new shares upon exercise of their
rights. Finally, subscription rights can also be excluded with the
approval of the Supervisory Board if the issue price of the new
shares is not significantly lower than the stock market price at the
time the issue price is fixed and the issued shares do not exceed
10% of the company’s capital stock. The upper limit of 10% of the
capital stock is reduced by the proportionate interest in the capital
stock attributable to those shares issued or sold during the term
of this authorization while excluding stockholders’ rights in direct
or analogous application of Section 186, Paragraph 3, Sentence 4
of the German Stock Corporation Act. Further details are given in
Section 4, Paragraph 3 of the articles of association.
The Board of Management can only utilize the authorization to
issue shares from Authorized Capital II in the maximum amount
of 20% of the capital stock at the time the resolution is passed.
When deciding on the exclusion of the subscription rights of stockholders, the Board of Management will also take into consideration an issue of bonds with warrants or conversion rights and/
or o
­ bligations, which is issued on the basis of other authorizations
granted by the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting of May 13, 2015,
under e
­ xclusion of the ­subscription rights of stockholders (see
­proposed ­resolution on ­agenda item 8; see also conditional capital
in accordance with Section 4, Paragraph 4 of the articles of association), with the ­proviso that it will only use the authorizations granted
by the A
­ nnual Stockholders’ Meeting of May 13, 2015, for capital

L ANXE S S Annual Report 2015

­ easures under exclusion of the stockholders’ subscription rights in
m
the ­maximum amount of 20% of the capital stock that exists at the
time the ­resolution is passed. The shares issued from Authorized
Capital II under exclusion of subscription rights by way of capital
increases against contributions in kind shall not exceed 10% of the
capital stock that exists at the time the resolution is passed. The
Board of Management will be bound by this condition until a future
Annual Stockholders’ Meeting again resolves to authorize the Board
of Management to implement capital measures under exclusion of
stockholders’ subscription rights.

Conditional capital
As of December 31, 2015, the company’s conditional capital
­comprised the following:
Conditional capital
The Annual Stockholders’ Meeting of LANXESS AG on May 13,
2015, authorized the Board of Management until May 22, 2018,
with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to issue – in one or
more installments – warrant bonds and/or convertible bonds,
­profit-participation rights and/or income bonds or a combination
of these instruments (collectively referred to as “bonds”) – as ­either
registered or bearer bonds – with a total nominal value of up to
€1,000,000,000, with or without limited maturity, and to grant
option rights to, or impose option obligations on, the h
­ olders or
creditors of warrant bonds, profit-participation rights with warrants
or income bonds with warrants, and/or to grant conversion rights
to, or impose conversion obligations on, the holders or creditors
of ­convertible bonds, convertible profit-participation rights or
­convertible income bonds in respect of bearer shares of the ­company
representing a total pro rata increase of up to €18,304,587 in the
company’s capital stock on the terms to be defined for these bonds.
Pursuant to Section 4, Paragraph 4 of the articles of association,
the capital stock of LANXESS AG is thus conditionally increased
by up to €18,304,587 (Conditional Capital).
The conditional capital increase shall only be implemented to the
­extent that the holders or creditors of, or persons obligated to
­exercise, warrants or conversion rights pertaining to bonds issued by
the company or a dependent company against cash ­contributions, or
issued against cash contributions and guaranteed by the ­company
or a dependent company, on or before May 22, 2018, on the basis of
the authorization granted to the Board of Management by the Annual
Stockholders’ Meeting on May 13, 2015, exercise their warrants or
conversion rights or, where they are obligated to do so, fulfill such

206

Consolidated Financial Statements

obligation, or to the extent that the company elects to grant shares
in the company in place of all or part of the cash amount due for
payment. The conditional capital increase shall not be implemented
if cash compensation is granted or if the company’s own shares,
shares issued out of authorized capital or shares in another listed
company are used to service the warrant or conversion rights.
When issuing bonds, the Board of Management is authorized, with
the approval of the Supervisory Board, to exclude subscription rights
in the following cases:
For residual amounts resulting from the subscription ratio
Insofar as is necessary to grant to holders of previously i­ssued
warrants or conversion rights or obligations subscription
rights to the number of new shares to which they would be
­entitled to subscribe as stockholders upon exercise of their
warrants or conversion rights or fulfillment of their option or
conversion obligations
nn In the case of issuance against cash contributions, if the issue
price is not significantly below the theoretical market value
of the bonds with warrants or conversion rights or ­conversion
obligations, as determined using accepted pricing m
­ odels; if
bonds are issued by application of Section 186, Paragraph 3,
Sentence 4 of the German Stock Corporation Act, in which
case the issued shares may not exceed a total of 10% of the
capital stock either at the time this authorization takes effect
or at the time it is utilized
nn If profit-participation rights or income bonds without option
or conversion rights or conversion obligations are vested with
bond-like characteristics
nn
nn

The Board of Management can only use the authorization to issue
convertible bonds and/or warrant bonds, profit-participation rights
and/or income bonds (or combinations of these instruments) in
the maximum amount of 20% of the capital stock that exists at the
time the resolution is passed. When deciding on the exclusion of
the subscription rights of stockholders, the Board of Management
will also take into consideration the issue of shares on the basis of
other authorizations granted by the Annual Stockholders’ M
­ eeting
of May 13, 2015 under exclusion of the subscription rights of
stockholders (see proposed resolution on agenda item 7; see also

L ANXE S S Annual Report 2015

Authorized Capital II in accordance with Section 4, Paragraph 3 of
the articles of incorporation), with the proviso that it will only use
the a­ uthorizations granted by the Annual Stockholders’ M
­ eeting of
May 13, 2015, for capital measures under exclusion of the stockholders’ subscription rights in the maximum amount of 20% of the
capital stock that exists at the time the resolution is passed. The
Board of Management will be bound by this condition until a future
Annual Stockholders’ Meeting again resolves to authorize the Board
of Management to implement capital measures under exclusion of
stockholders’ subscription rights.

Share buyback and retirement
The Annual Stockholders’ Meeting of LANXESS AG on May 18,
2011, authorized the Board of Management until May 17, 2016, to
acquire shares in the company representing up to 10% of the capital
stock and to utilize them for any purpose permitted by law. This
authorization may also be utilized by subsidiaries of the company
or by third parties on behalf of the company or its subsidiaries. At
the discretion of the Board of Management, such shares may be
acquired either in the market or via a public tender offer. The Board
of Management is authorized to use them for any purpose permitted
by law. In particular, it can retire the shares, sell them other than
via the stock exchange or an offer to the stockholders, or transfer
them against consideration in kind for the purpose of acquiring
companies, parts of companies or equity interests in companies
or in order to conclude mergers. It is also authorized to use them
to satisfy conversion rights from convertible or warrant bonds and/
or profit-participation rights or income bonds (or a combination of
these instruments) issued by the company and to grant holders of
convertible or warrant bonds and/or profit-participation rights or
income bonds (or a combination of these instruments) issued by
the company or its direct and indirect affiliates that grant a ­warrant
or conversion right or stipulate the performance of exercise or
­conversion obligations the number of shares for which such parties
would be entitled to subscribe upon exercise of their warrants or
conversion rights or performance of their exercise or conversion
obligations. The stockholders shall not have subscription rights in
such cases, except where the shares are retired.

Notes to the statement of financial position

Capital reserves
The capital reserves of LANXESS AG are unchanged from the
previous year at €1,225,652,280.

Other reserves
The €60 million increase in other reserves to €1,313 million was
principally attributable to the increase in retained earnings from
€1,094 million to €1,154 million.

14 | Provisions for pensions and other
post-employment benefits
Most employees in the LANXESS Group are entitled to retirement benefits on the basis of contractual agreements or statutory
­regulations. These are provided through defined contribution or
defined benefit plans.

Defined contribution plans
Retained earnings comprise prior years’ undistributed income of
companies included in the consolidated financial statements. They
also contain remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability from
post-employment benefit plans and the related tax effects.

Other equity components
The other equity components mainly comprise exchange differences from the translation of operations outside the eurozone and
remeasurements of derivatives for purposes of cash flow hedge
accounting.

Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests comprise the interests held by other stockholders in the equity of Europigments, S.L., Barcelona, Spain; Rhein
Chemie (Qingdao) Co., Ltd., Qingdao, China; and LANXESS TSRC
(Nantong) Chemical Industrial Co., Ltd., Nantong, China.

Capital management
The main purpose of capital management in the LANXESS Group
is to maintain the long-term viability of the business operations
and achieve an attractive return on capital compared to the
­chemical industry average. LANXESS’s financial policy ­defines an
­additional condition for capital management, which is to ­maintain
an i­nvestment-grade rating. To achieve this goal, the Group has
to meet indicators set by the rating agencies. Most of these are
derived from the statement of financial position, the income
­statement or the statement of cash flows. Details can be found in
the section headed “Value management and control system” in the
­combined management report for fiscal 2015. Capital management
in the LANXESS Group entails decisions by the relevant internal
­bodies on the capital structure shown on the statement of financial
­position, the appropriateness of the company’s equity, the use of
the ­distributable profit, the amount of the dividend, the financing
of capital e
­ xpenditures, and thus on issuances or repayments of
debt. The articles of association of LANXESS AG do not contain
any specific capital requirements.

L ANXE S S Annual Report 2015

In the case of defined contribution plans, the company pays
­contributions into separate pension funds. These contributions are
included in the functional cost items as expenses for the ­respective
year, and thus in the operating result. Once the contributions have
been paid, the company has no further payment obligations.
­Payments to defined contribution plans in 2015 totaled €48 ­million
(2014: €49 million).

Multi-employer plans
The pension plan in Germany financed through Bayer-Pensions­
kasse is also accounted for in the consolidated financial ­statements
as a defined contribution plan. The above amounts include
­contributions of €26 million (2014: €28 million) to Bayer-Pensions­
kasse. ­Contributions of about the same amount are expected for
the ­following fiscal year.
Bayer-Pensionskasse is a legally independent private insurance
company and is therefore subject to the German Insurance Super­
vision Act. Since the obligations of the participating entities are
not ­confined to payment of the contributions for the respective
fiscal year, Bayer-Pensionskasse constitutes a defined benefit
­multi-­employer plan and therefore would generally have to be
­accounted for pro rata as a defined benefit plan.
Bayer-Pensionskasse is financed not on the principle of coverage
for individual benefit entitlements, but on the actuarial ­equivalence
­principle, based on totals for the whole plan. This means that
the sum of existing plan assets and the present value of future
­contributions must be at least equal to the present value of the future
benefits payable under the plan. The LANXESS Group is therefore
exposed to the actuarial risks of the other entities participating in
Bayer-Pensionskasse. Thus no consistent or reliable basis exists for
allocating the benefit obligation, plan assets and costs that would
enable LANXESS to account for Bayer-Pensionskasse as a defined
benefit plan in accordance with IAS 19. As contributions are based
on future coverage of the total obligation, all participating entities

208

Consolidated Financial Statements

pay contributions at the same rates based on the employee income
levels on which social security contributions are payable. Bayer-­
Pensionskasse is therefore accounted for as a defined contribution
plan and not as a defined benefit plan.
There are no minimum funding requirements, nor is there any
­information that could be used to estimate the future c­ ontributions
on the basis of current under- or overfunding. The statutes do not
provide for the sharing of any surplus or shortfall in the event
that ­Bayer-Pensionskasse is wound up or LANXESS ceases to
­participate.
LANXESS’s share of the total contributions to Bayer-Pensions­
kasse was slightly lower than in the previous year at approximately
16% (2014: 17%). Bayer-Pensionskasse has been closed to new
­members since January 1, 2005.

In Canada, the defined benefit obligations comprise, in ­particular,
lifelong pension benefits, which are payable in the event of ­disability
or death or when the employee reaches retirement age. The ­level
of these benefits is determined from the total annual pension
­increments earned during the period of employment, depending
on the employee’s individual salary and the actual date of retirement. The existing defined benefit pension plans are closed to
new members.
In Brazil, the defined benefit obligations comprise lifelong benefits,
principally in the event of death or disability or when the employee
reaches retirement age. The benefits are calculated according to
the total annual pension increments earned during the period of
employment and also depend on individual salary, the number of
years for which statutory social insurance contributions have been
paid, and comparable statutory pension benefits. The principal
defined benefit pension plans are closed to new members.

Defined benefit plans
The global post-employment benefit obligations are calculated at
regular intervals – at least every three years – by an independent
actuary using the projected unit credit method. Comprehensive
actuarial valuations are generally undertaken annually for all major
post-employment benefit plans.
Contractually based defined benefit pension plans exist primarily
in Germany, Canada and Brazil.
The defined benefit pension obligations in Germany mainly relate to
lifelong benefits payable in the event of death or disability or when
the employee reaches retirement age. Benefits are determined on
the basis of the total annual pension increments earned during the
period of employment and vary according to employees’ individual
salaries. Additional pension entitlements exist that are related to
salary components set aside by employees and are payable when
they reach retirement age. Alongside direct commitments, the
pension adjustment obligation assumed by Bayer-Pensionskasse
is accounted for in a separate defined benefit plan in accordance
with Section 16 of the German Occupational Pensions Improvement
Act (BetrAVG).

L ANXE S S Annual Report 2015

Only limited defined benefit pension obligations exist on the basis
of statutory regulations. These principally comprise obligations to
make a lump-sum payment if employment is terminated. The amount
of this payment mainly depends on years of service and final salary.
The other post-employment benefit obligations primarily relate to
the reimbursement of retirees’ healthcare costs in North and South
America. The other post-employment benefit obligations in ­Germany
comprise other long-term benefits payable to ­employees and
­benefits payable upon termination of employment. These are mainly
early-retirement benefits and collectively agreed salary ­components
granted in the form of pension benefits. They are ­included in pension
provisions as they are by nature pension e
­ ntitlements.

209

Notes to the statement of financial position

Financing of the defined benefit pension obligations is achieved
both internally through provisions and externally through legally
independent pension funds. The pension obligations in Germany
are partly covered on a voluntary basis via LANXESS Pension Trust
e.V., Leverkusen, Germany. The allocation of funds to the LANXESS
Pension Trust e.V. is dependent on future decisions by the company.
In Canada and Brazil, it is mandatory to primarily finance pension
obligations through pension funds. Allocations to pension funds
in these countries are determined by the regulatory environments
and the need to comply with funding regulations. Contributions are
paid mainly by the employer. The investment strategy is determined
principally by the LANXESS Corporate Pension Committee and
is designed to protect the capital, optimally manage risks, take
into account changes in pension obligations and ensure the timely
availability of pension assets. At the regional level, the strategy is
generally directly coordinated and monitored by representatives of
LANXESS via the relevant committees of the pension funds or of
LANXESS Pension Trust e.V., taking regulatory requirements into
account. In Brazil, the investment of plan assets forms an integral
part of the pension fund’s overall investment strategy and is basically
managed and supervised by the pension fund.
Minimum funding requirements may have to be met for ­defined
benefit obligations in both Brazil and Canada. These depend on
the local regulatory framework and are reflected in additional
­pension provisions. Funding surpluses from defined benefit plans
are r­ ecognized as receivables relating to pension obligations to
the extent that they can be used to reduce future contributions,
taking into account the asset ceiling. These mainly relate to defined
benefit plans in Brazil. The respective calculations are based on
actuarial valuations.

from the investment of assets that are not directly attributable to
the earning of income on plan assets. The costs of managing the
plan assets that are directly attributable to the earning of income
on plan assets are recognized in other comprehensive income.
The actuarial gains and losses relate to other non-current e­ mployee
benefits or termination benefits that are included in pension
­provisions because they are by nature retirement benefits.

Of the defined benefit obligation for pensions, Germany accounts
for 61% (2014: 58%), Canada for 22% (2014: 22%) and Brazil for
11% (2014: 15%).

L ANXE S S Annual Report 2015

The other post-employment benefit obligations comprise €58 ­million
(2014: €74 million) for the reimbursement of health care costs and
€73 million (2014: €92 million) for miscellaneous other ­benefit
commitments. The actuarial gains and losses from changes
in d
­ emographic assumptions in 2014 mainly resulted from the
­application of new mortality tables in Canada.
Remeasurements of the defined benefit liability due to changes
in actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in financial
­assumptions are mainly attributable to changes in the discount rates
for defined benefit obligations in the main countries of relevance
for LANXESS.
In 2014, the past service cost for pension obligations and the ­current
service cost for the other post-employment benefit obligations
resulted mainly from the “Advance” and “Let’s LANXESS again”
programs in Germany and related to early-retirement agreements,
to improvements to existing benefit entitlements for employees
taking early retirement, and to severance agreements.
Gains from settlements result from the closure of defined benefit
pension plans in Spain as a result of their conversion into defined
contribution plans.
The business combinations and disposals in the prior year related
to the divestment of Perlon-Monofil GmbH, Dormagen, Germany.
The exchange differences pertaining to defined benefit obligations
mainly resulted from changes in the exchange rates for the Canadian
dollar and the Brazilian real.

The assumptions are weighted on the basis of the defined ­benefit
obligation at year end. The discount rates used for Germany and
Canada are derived from high-quality fixed-interest corporate
bonds with the same maturities. In Brazil, however, there is no
­liquid market for such bonds so the discount rate is based on those
for g
­ overnment bonds with the same maturities. This method of
­deriving the discount rates is unchanged from the previous year in
the principal countries.
The long-term cost increase for medical care is expected to take
place within 16 years (2014: 13 years).
The Heubeck mortality tables 2005 G form the biometric basis for
the computation of pension obligations in Germany. Current national
biometric assumptions are used to compute benefit obligations at
other Group companies.

The sensitivity of the mortality rates was calculated for the ­countries
with significant pension obligations. A reduction in ­mortality
­increases the individual life expectancy of insurees. A 10% ­reduction
would increase the average life expectancy of employees of retirement age in the countries of importance for LANXESS by about
one year.
Sensitivity is calculated by altering one parameter while leaving
all the others unchanged. The method used is the same as for
the actuarial valuation of benefit obligations. However, ­sensitivity
­calculations depend on interest rate effects and the absolute change
in the parameter. Moreover, it is unlikely in practice that only one
­parameter would change, so the change in a parameter could
­correlate with other assumptions. Where the expected development of the ­parameter used in the sensitivity calculation was based
on a different variation in the parameter, the stated change in the
benefit obligation was approximated using the straight-line method.

Multi-year compensation programs
Stock-based compensation
LANXESS AG offers a stock-based compensation program to
members of the Management Board and top-level managers. The
program provides for cash settlement. The two present Long-Term
Stock Performance Plans (LTSP) were introduced in 2010 and
2014. Under the LTSP 2010–2013 program introduced in 2010,
rights were granted for the years 2010–2013. Awards are based
on the performance of LANXESS stock relative to the Dow Jones
STOXX 600 Chemicals SM Index. The LTSP 2014–2017 program
introduced in 2014 is largely identical with the LTSP 2010–2013.
The main difference is that awards are based on the performance
of LANXESS stock relative to the MSCI World Chemicals Index.
The base price of the stock and the benchmark index for the
LTSP programs are calculated using a volume-weighted average
of the closing prices on the first ten trading days in January of
the year of issue of the tranche. The date of issue of the rights
granted and still outstanding and the rights from the outstanding
tranches is ­February 1 each year. Participation in the programs is
conditional upon each manager making a personal investment in
LANXESS stock, d
­ epending on his/her base salary.
If LANXESS stock outperforms the index, a payment of at least
€0.75 per right is made. For each percentage point by which
the stock outperforms the index, €0.125 is paid in addition. The
­maximum possible payment per right, however, is €2.00.

Obligations arising from the stock-based compensation are valued

Outstanding rights as of

LANXESS shares were trading at €42.68 at year end 2015. The
Dow Jones STOXX 600 Chemicals SM benchmark index stood
at 825.49 points, while the MSCI World Chemicals Index was
250.34 points.
Due to the granting of rights and the settlement of rights in ­connection
with the Group realignment program, net expense of €9 ­million was
recorded in 2015 (2014: €16 million). The net e
­ xpense in the prior
year was due to the exercise of the rights from the 2010 tranche
of the LTSP 2010–2013 at maximum value and the ­settlement of
rights in connection with the realignment program. A provision of
€8 million existed as of December 31, 2015 (2014: €3 million). In
2015 and 2014, the rights exercisable as of the closing date had
no intrinsic value.

L ANXE S S Annual Report 2015

Environmental provisions
The Group’s activities are subject to extensive legal requirements
in the jurisdictions in which it does business. Compliance with
­environmental laws may require LANXESS to remove or mitigate
the effects of the release or disposal of chemical substances at
various sites. Under some of these laws, a current or previous site
owner or plant operator may be held liable for the costs of removing
hazardous substances from the soil or groundwater on its ­property
or neighboring areas, or rendering them harmless, without regard to
whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of
the contaminants, and often regardless of whether the ­practices that
resulted in the contamination were legal at the time they o
­ ccurred. As
many of LANXESS’s production sites have a long history of ­industrial
use, it is not always possible to accurately ­predict the ­effects such
situations may have on the LANXESS Group in the future.

218

Consolidated Financial Statements

Since LANXESS is a chemical company, the possibility therefore
cannot be excluded that soil or groundwater contamination may
have occurred at its locations in the past. Claims in this regard
could be brought by government agencies, private organizations
or individuals. Such claims would then relate to the remediation of
sites or areas of land owned by the LANXESS Group where products
were manufactured by third parties under contract manufacturing
agreements or where waste from production facilities operated by
the LANXESS Group was treated, stored or disposed of.
Potential liabilities exist with respect to various sites under legislation
such as the U.S. environment law commonly known as Superfund.
At locations in the United States, numerous companies, including
LANXESS, have been notified that the U.S. authorities or private
individuals consider such companies to be potentially responsible
parties under Superfund or related laws. At some sites, LANXESS
may be the sole responsible party. Remediation measures have
already been initiated at most of the sites concerned.
The existing provisions for environmental remediation costs relate
primarily to the rehabilitation of contaminated sites, recultivation of
landfills, and redevelopment and water protection measures. The
provisions for environmental remediation costs are stated at the
present value of the expected commitments where environmental
assessments or clean-ups are probable, the costs can be reasonably
estimated and no future economic benefit is expected to arise from
these measures. Costs are estimated based on significant factors
such as previous experience in similar cases, environmental assessments, current cost levels and new circumstances affecting costs,
our understanding of current environmental laws and regulations,
the number of other potentially responsible parties at each site and
the identity and financial position of such parties in light of the joint
and several nature of the liability, and the remediation methods
likely to be employed.

L ANXE S S Annual Report 2015

It is difficult to estimate the future costs of environmental protection
and remediation because of many uncertainties concerning the legal
requirements and the information available about conditions in the
various countries and at specific sites. Subject to these factors, but
taking into consideration experience gained to date with matters of
a similar nature, we believe our provisions to be adequate based
upon currently available information. However, the possibility that
additional costs could be incurred beyond the amounts accrued
cannot be excluded. LANXESS nevertheless estimates that such
additional costs, should they occur, would not materially impact the
Group’s earnings, asset and financial position.

Trade-related commitments
Provisions for trade-related commitments mainly comprise those
for rebates, customer discounts, product returns, impending losses
and onerous contracts.

Provisions for restructuring
Provisions for restructuring totaled €64 million on December 31,
2015 (2014: €47 million), comprising €29 million (2014:
€25 ­million) for human resources measures, €17 million (2014:
€6 ­million) for environmental protection measures and €18 ­million
(2014: €16 million) for other expenses.

Sundry provisions
The sundry provisions contain provisions for guarantees and product
liability, and provisions for other liabilities.

The weighted average interest rate for all of the LANXESS Group’s
financial liabilities denominated in euros and other currencies at
year end was 3.8% (2014: 3.8%).
Liabilities under lease agreements are recognized if the leased
assets are capitalized under property, plant and equipment as the
economic property of the Group (finance leases). Lease payments
totaling €95 million (2014: €94 million), including €24 million
(2014: €22 million) in interest are to be made to the respective
lessors in future years.
Other primary financial liabilities include accrued interest of
€24 ­million (2014: €26 million) on financial liabilities. Of this amount,
€22 million (2014: €24 million) relates to the above-mentioned
bonds.

The increase in provisions for income tax liabilities was mainly due to
provisions for taxes for fiscal 2015 that have not yet been assessed
and for prior-year tax audits. The income tax liabilities increased
to €13 million (2014: €2 million), mainly due to improved pre-tax
earnings.

Other tax liabilities include not only Group companies’ own tax
liabilities, but also taxes withheld for payment to the authorities on
behalf of third parties.
Social security liabilities include, in particular, social insurance
­contributions that had not been paid by the closing date.
The miscellaneous liabilities principally comprise accruals for outstanding invoices relating to the reporting period. As of December 31, 2015, there were no such liabilities to C

The actual tax expense for 2015 was €121 million (2014:
€36 ­million). This was €29 million (2014: €11 million) more than
the expected tax expense of €92 million (2014: €25 million).

The deferred tax assets and liabilities are allocable to the various
items of the statement of financial position as follows:
Deferred Taxes �������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������

In calculating the expected tax expense for the LANXESS Group,
the aggregated income tax rate of 32.1% (2014: 31.8%) for the
German tax entity was applied. This comprises a corporation tax
rate of 15.0%, plus a solidarity surcharge (5.5% of corporation tax)
and trade tax. The increase in the aggregated income tax rate was
mainly due to a trade tax multiplier.

Consolidated Financial Statements

The deferred taxes recognized in other comprehensive income
comprised minus €23 million (2014: €91 million) relating to remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability for post-employment
benefit plans and €5 million (2014: €20 million) relating to financial
instruments. In addition, other comprehensive income contains
current taxes of minus €1 million (2014: €4 million).
Deferred tax assets of €324 million (2014: €337 million), which
exceed the reversal of taxable temporary differences, relate to tax
jurisdictions in which losses were recorded in 2015 or 2014. They
include deferred tax assets of €224 million (2014: €231 million)
for the German tax entity, which reported a loss in the previous
year, primarily due to the exceptional items in connection with the
“Advance” and “Let’s LANXESS again” realignment programs.
The deferred tax assets for the German tax entity mainly relate to
differences in the valuations of pension provisions for tax purposes.
LANXESS assumes that it will generate sufficient taxable income
in the future to realize the deferred tax assets.
Based on tax planning calculations and strategies, deferred tax
assets of €68 million (2014: €111 million) were recognized on the
€231 million (2014: €380 million) in tax loss carryforwards that
represent income likely to be realized in the future. This amount
included deferred taxes of €45 million (2014: 82 million) on loss
carryforwards with an unlimited carryforward period.
Deferred taxes were not recognized for €226 million (2014:
€158 million) of tax loss carryforwards. Of this amount, €105 ­million
(2014: €100 million) can theoretically be used over more than five
years. Further, deferred tax assets were not recognized in 2015
for tax-deductible temporary differences of €49 million (2014:
€43 million). Accordingly, deferred taxes on loss carryforwards
of €57 million (2014: €39 million) and deferred tax assets on tax-­
deductible temporary differences of €18 million (2014: €15 million)
were not recognized.

30 | Earnings and dividend per share
The calculation of earnings per share for 2015 includes only
­earnings from continuing operations and is based on the weighted
average number of shares outstanding during the reporting period.
As of December 31, 2015, 91,522,936 shares were outstanding.
Since there are currently no equity instruments in issue that could
dilute earnings per share, basic and diluted earnings per share are
identical. Further information on equity instruments that could
dilute earnings per share in the future is contained in Note [13].

Total personnel expenses decreased slightly in 2015, mainly as a
result of lower expenses for pension provisions. The higher figure
for the previous year mainly related to expenses in connection with
the “Let’s LANXESS again” program. The personnel expenses
shown here do not contain the interest expenses for compounding
personnel-related provisions, especially pension provisions, which
is reflected in the financial result (see Note [28]).

32 | Employees
The average number of employees in the LANXESS Group in 2015
was 16,310 (2014: 16,807). The decline compared with the pre­
vious year was mainly due to employees who left the company as
a result of the “Let’s LANXESS again” program. It was countered
by effects relating to the start-up of new facilities in Asia.

As explained in the section on recognition and valuation principles,
operating leases are those which – unlike finance leases – do not
transfer substantially all risks and rewards incidental to the owner­
ship of the leased assets to the lessee. In the LANXESS Group,
operating leases are mainly used for operational reasons and not
as a means of financing.
The minimum non-discounted future lease and rental payments
­relating to operating leases totaled €341 million (2014: €390 ­million).
The respective payment obligations mature as follows:

33 | Contingent liabilities and other
financial commitments
Contingent liabilities result from guarantees and similar instruments
assumed on behalf of third parties. They represent potential future
commitments in cases where the occurrence of certain events
would create an obligation that was uncertain at the closing date.
An obligation to perform under such contingent liabilities arises in
the event of delayed settlement or insolvency of the debtor.
Contingent liabilities as of December 31, 2015, amounted to
€1 ­million (2014: €7 million). There are no contingent liabilities
relating to Currenta GmbH & Co. OHG, Leverkusen, Germany,
which is accounted for using the equity method. As a personally
liable partner in Currenta GmbH & Co. OHG, LANXESS may be
required to inject further capital into this company in the future.
Apart from provisions, liabilities and contingent liabilities, financial
commitments also exist under operating leases.

L ANXE S S Annual Report 2015

Payments under operating leases in 2015 amounted to €65 ­million
(2014: €67 million). Future lease and rental payments include agreements relating to the Group’s headquarters in Cologne, to which it
relocated in 2013, and to the production site in Singapore.
Financial commitments resulting from orders already placed
­under purchase agreements relating to planned or ongoing capital
­expenditure projects in the area of property, plant and equipment
and intangible assets totaled €90 million (2014: €171 million). All of
these payments are due in fiscal 2016. The decline was ­principally
due to the completion of major capital expenditure projects in China
and Singapore.

Consolidated Financial Statements

Description of the master agreement
Under the master agreement that was concluded between B
­ ayer AG
and LANXESS AG together with the Spin-Off and Takeover
­Agreement, Bayer AG and LANXESS AG agreed, among other
things, on commitments regarding mutual indemnification for
­liabilities in line with the respective asset allocation and on special
arrangements allocating responsibility to deal with claims in the
areas of product liability, environmental contamination and antitrust
violations. The master agreement also contains arrangements for the
allocation of tax effects relating to the spin-off and to the preceding
measures to create the subgroup that was subsequently spun off.

34 | Related parties
In the course of its operations, the LANXESS Group sources
­materials, inventories and services from a large number of ­business
partners around the world These include companies in which
LANXESS AG has a direct or indirect interest. Transactions with
these companies are carried out on an arm’s-length basis.
Transactions with Currenta GmbH & Co. OHG, Leverkusen, G
­ ermany,
which is accounted for in the consolidated fi­ nancial statements
­using the equity method, and its subsidiaries mainly comprised the
purchase of site services in the fields of ­utilities, ­infrastructure and
logistics totaling €436 million (2014: €423 ­million). As of December 31, 2015, payables of €120 ­million (2014: €109 million) and
receivables of €38 million (2014: €3 ­million) existed as a result of
these transactions. In the previous year, a provision of €5 ­million
was also recorded as of the reporting date in respect of the claim by
Currenta GmbH & Co. OHG to offset the loss for 2014. There were
also payment obligations to Currenta GmbH & Co. OHG amounting to €9 million (2014: €1 million) under operating ­leases and
­obligations of €4 million (2014: €4 million) under purchase agreements. Contingent liabilities relating to Currenta GmbH & Co. OHG
are outlined in the previous section.
Information on the compensation of the Board of Management and
Supervisory Board can be found in the next section.

35 | Compensation of the Board of Management
and the Supervisory Board
For fiscal 2015, total compensation of €9,360 thousand (2014:
€9,982 thousand) was paid to the members of the Board of
Manage­ment of LANXESS AG, comprising €6,728 thousand (2014:
€7,649 thousand) in short-term compensation (fixed compensation,
annual bonus, benefits in kind and other), minus €62 thousand
(2014: €0 thousand) in adjustments for previous years, and other
long-term compensation components totaling €1,626 thousand
(2014: €932 thousand) as part of the Long-Term ­Performance
Bonus (LTPB). The total also includes compensation paid under
the stock-based Long-Term Stock Performance Plan (LTSP), ­under
which 1,200,000 compensation rights were granted in 2015
(2014: 1,648,500 rights). The fair value of these rights at the grant
date was €1,068 thousand (2014: €1,401 thousand). Personnel
­expenses for the stock-based compensation programs amounted
to €1,450 ­thousand in fiscal 2015 (2014: €2,168 thousand).
Details of the compensation system for members of the Board of
Management and an individual breakdown of the compensation
are given in the “Compensation report” section of the combined
management report for fiscal 2015.
In addition, service costs of €1,640 thousand (2014: €2,496 thousand) relating to defined benefit pension plans were incurred in
2015 for members of the Board of Management as part of their
compensation package. The present value of the defined benefit
obligation as of December 31, 2015 was €11,903 thousand (2014:
€9,994 thousand).
The total net expense for the compensation of the members
of the Board of Management in 2015 was €14,762 thousand
(2014: €14,935 thousand). This amount included expense of
€3,380 ­thousand for the severance payment made to Dr. ­Düttmann.
Together with settlement of his LTSP rights amounting to
€857 ­thousand, benefits granted to a former member of the Board
of Management who stepped down during the fiscal year totaled
€4,237 thousand and were paid during the fiscal year. In the previous year, this item included expense of €1,690 thousand for the
severance payment made to Dr. Breuers. Together with settlement
of his LTSP rights amounting to €729 thousand, benefits granted
in 2014 to a former member of the Board of Management who
stepped down during the fiscal year totaled €2,419 thousand and
were paid during fiscal 2014.

­total obligation toward former members of the Board of Management as of December 31, 2015 was €30,318 thousand (2014:
€27,921 ­thousand). Payments totaling €3,673 thousand were
made to former members of the Board of Management in fiscal
2015 (2014: €1,983 thousand).

These risks could impair the earnings and financial position of the
LANXESS Group. The various risk categories and the risk management system for the LANXESS Group are outlined below.

The members of the Supervisory Board received total compen­
sation of €3,122 thousand in 2015 (2014: €1,936 thousand).
This compensation is generally paid at the start of the following
year. The provisions established for stock-based compensation for
­Supervisory Board members as of December 31, 2015 amounted
to €1,200 thousand (2014: €0 thousand).
In addition, the employee representatives on the Supervisory Board
who are on LANXESS’s payroll received remuneration under their
employment contracts. The amounts of these salaries represented
appropriate compensation for the employees’ functions and tasks
within the Group.
Details of the compensation system for members of the Super­
visory Board and an individual breakdown of the amounts paid
are contained in the section headed “Compensation report” in the
combined management report for fiscal 2015.
No loans were granted to members of the Board of Management
or the Supervisory Board in fiscal 2015 or 2014.

36 | Financial instruments
Primary financial instruments are reflected in the statement of
­financial position. In compliance with IAS 39, financial assets
are c
­ ategorized as “loans and receivables,” “held at fair value
through profit or loss,” “held to maturity” or “available for sale” and,
­accordingly, recognized at cost or fair value. Liability ­instruments that
are ­neither held for trading nor constitute derivatives are ­recognized
at ­amortized cost.

L ANXE S S Annual Report 2015

The global alignment of the LANXESS Group exposes its business
operations, earnings and cash flows to a variety of market risks.
Material financial risks to the Group as a whole, such as currency,
interest rate, counterparty, liquidity and raw material price risks,
are centrally managed.

The principles of risk management are defined by the Board of
Management. At the regular strategy meetings of the Financial
Risk Committee, which are chaired by the Chief Financial Officer,
reports on the outcome of financial risk management and on current
risk levels are presented and any further action is decided upon.
Simulations are performed to assess the impact of market trends.
The implementation of the Financial Risk Committee’s decisions
and ongoing risk management are undertaken centrally by the
Treasury & Investor Relations Group Function. The aim of financial
risk management is to identify and evaluate risks and to manage
and limit their effects as appropriate.
Currency risks
Since the LANXESS Group undertakes transactions in various
currencies, it is exposed to fluctuations in the relative value of these
currencies. The development of the U.S. dollar against the euro is
of particular relevance.
Currency risks from potential declines in the value of financial
­instruments due to exchange rate fluctuations (transaction risks)
arise mainly when receivables and payables are denominated in
a currency other than the company’s functional currency. Such
risks and the currency risks arising from financial transactions,
including the interest component, are generally fully hedged using
forward exchange contracts. Due to hedging, in the short term
the appreciation or depreciation of the euro against other major
currencies can have no material impact on future cash flows. The
results realized from the use of derivative financial instruments are
reflected in the financial result.

228

Consolidated Financial Statements

The risks relating to operating activities are systematically m
­ onitored
and analyzed. To this end, both sales and costs are planned in
­foreign currencies. In the long term, exchange rate fluctuations could
adversely affect future cash flows should the LANXESS Group not
be able to absorb them, for example, by pricing its products in the
respective local currencies. This risk is minimized by partial hedging
with derivative financial instruments. Changes in the fair values of
these instruments are recognized in the financial result or, in the
case of cash flow hedges, in other comprehensive income. Realized
income or expense from the effective portion of cash flow hedges
is recognized in other operating income or expenses. Hedging
is performed in line with principles determined by the Board of
­Management and is subject to continuous monitoring.
If the exchange rate for the euro had been 5% higher against the
hedged currencies on the reporting date, this would have had a
€33 ­million (2014: €23 million) effect, mainly on other comprehensive income, which would have reduced the reported loss. This
effect mainly relates to the U.S. dollar. A correspondingly lower rate
for the euro would have had basically the opposite effect.
Many companies in the LANXESS Group are based outside the
­eurozone. Since the Group prepares its consolidated financial
­s tatements in euros, the annual financial statements of these
subsidiaries are translated into euros for consolidation purposes.
Changes in the average exchange rate for a given currency from
one period to the next can materially affect the translation of both
sales and earnings reported in this currency into euros (translation
risk). Unlike the effect of exchange rate fluctuations in the case of
transaction risk, translation risk has no impact on Group cash flows
in the local currency.

The LANXESS Group has material assets, liabilities and businesses
outside the eurozone that are reported in local currencies. The
­related long-term currency risks are estimated and evaluated on
a regular basis. In view of these risks, however, foreign currency
transactions are only concluded if consideration is being given
to ­withdrawing from a particular business and it is intended to
­repatriate the funds released by the withdrawal. The effects of
exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of net positions into
euros are reflected in other comprehensive income.
Interest rate risks
Market interest rate movements can cause fluctuations in the fair
value of a financial instrument. These interest rate changes affect
both financial assets and financial liabilities.
Since the majority of financial liabilities were entered into at fixed
interest rates, changes in interest rates in the coming years will have
only a limited impact on the LANXESS Group.
The financial liabilities with variable interest rates are covered by
­investments with short-term fixed interest rates from available
­liquidity so that the LANXESS Group will incur slightly higher interest
costs if interest rates rise. A general change of one percentage point
in interest rates as of December 31, 2015 would have altered Group
net income by €0 million (2014: reduced net income by €1 million).
Counterparty risks
Counterparty risks (credit risks) arise from trade relationships with
customers and dealings with banks and other financial partners,
especially with regard to the investment business and financial
instrument transactions.
Customer risks are systematically identified, analyzed and managed
using both internal and external information sources. Customer
portfolios may be insured against credit risks, especially where the
risk profile is elevated.

L ANXE S S Annual Report 2015

229

Other information

The objective of receivables management at LANXESS is to collect
all outstanding payments punctually and in full, and thus to minimize
the risk of default. Continuous monitoring is computer-assisted,
based on the payment terms agreed with the customers. These
are generally in line with the customary payment terms for the
business or country. Reminders are sent out at regular intervals if
payments are overdue.

Liquidity risks
Liquidity risks arise from potential financial shortfalls and the resulting increase in refinancing costs. The aim of liquidity management
in the LANXESS Group is to ensure that the Group has sufficient
liquidity and committed credit facilities available at all times to enable
it to meet its payment commitments, and to optimize the liquidity
balance within the Group.

The maximum risk of default on receivables, cash and cash equi­
valents, near-cash assets, derivatives and other financial assets is
reflected in their carrying amounts in the statement of financial
position (disregarding netting arrangements not reflected in the
statement of financial position).

Our main liquidity reserve is a €1.25 billion syndicated credit ­facility,
which remained largely undrawn on the reporting date. In February
2015, its term was extended by one year to February 2020. There
is a further material credit line of €150 million with the ­European
Investment Bank. In addition to credit facilities, the Group has shortterm liquidity reserves of €466 million (2014: €518 million) in the
form of cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid AAA-­rated
­money market funds. Accordingly, the LANXESS Group has a
­liquidity position based on a broad range of financing instruments.

Material credit risk relating to receivables from customers is covered
by obtaining letters of credit in favor of the LANXESS Group for
certain customers and by agreeing prepayment with contractual
partners.
In addition, LANXESS has a contractually agreed title to goods until
the contractual partner has paid the full purchase price. The vast
majority of receivables relate to customers with very high credit
standing.
The creditworthiness of the counterparty is a key criterion in the
financial policy and credit risk management of the LANXESS Group,
especially in the selection of banks and financial partners for ­capital
investments and transactions involving financial ­instruments.
LANXESS therefore endeavors to undertake transactions with
banks and other financial counterparties that have at least an
­investment-grade rating. The derivatives and financial assets outstanding as of the closing date were almost all concluded with banks
with an investment-grade rating.
Credit risk management also includes global management of the
counterparty risk relating to all existing relationships with banks and
financial partners. The LANXESS Group pays particular attention to
risk diversification to prevent any cluster risks that could jeopardize
its existence. Through master agreements, the market values of
open trading positions can be netted if a partner becomes insolvent,
thereby further reducing risks.

The LANXESS Group is exposed to changes in the market prices
of energies and raw materials used for its business operations.
­Increases in energy and raw material procurement costs are
­generally passed on to customers. Where such risks cannot be
passed on in their entirety, the related risks may be hedged on a
case-by-case basis by forward commodity contracts in order to
reduce the volatility of cash flows. Where cash flow hedges qualify
for hedge accounting, changes in their fair values are recognized
in other comprehensive income until the hedged transaction is
realized.
LANXESS had no forward commodity contracts at year end 2015
or 2014.

Consolidated Financial Statements

Fair value measurement of the bonds is allocated to Level 1 of the
hierarchy outlined in the section “Fair value measurement.” However, two bonds with a fair value of €240 million are allocated to
Level 2 as there is no liquid market for them. As of December 31,
2014, three bonds with a fair value of €311 million were allocated
to Level 2 of the hierarchy. The fair value of liabilities allocated to
Level 2 is calculated using discounted cash flows and taking account
of observed market interest rates.

Fair value measurement
The measurement of fair value is based on a hierarchy reflecting the
significance of the measurement inputs. The fair value measurement
hierarchy for an asset or liability comprises three levels:
Level 1 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities on the measurement date
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
or indirectly
Level 3 Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability

The following table shows the volumes of assets and liabilities that
were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of the end of
the reporting period and the levels of the fair value hierarchy into
which the measurement inputs were categorized. Reclassification
between the levels is reviewed as of each reporting date. There
were no reclassifications in fiscal 2014 or 2015.

Level 1

Non-current assets

The investments in other affiliated companies measured at fair value
pertain to shares in the listed companies Gevo, Inc., Englewood,
United States, and BioAmber Inc., Minneapolis, United States. The
item “Investments in other affiliated companies” in the statement

of financial position also includes €10 million in non-listed equity
instruments, the fair values of which at the end of the reporting
period could not be reliably measured and which are therefore
reocgnized at cost. There are currently no plans to dispose of these
investments.

In addition, fees of €8 million were incurred in fiscal 2015 (2014:
€14 million) in connection with financial instruments.

Collateralization of financial liabilities
There were no financial liabilities collateralized by mortgages or
other property claims in fiscal 2015 or 2014.

Mezzanine financing
Mezzanine instruments such as profit participation rights, convertible
bonds or warrant bonds have not been issued. Information on the
possible issuance of such instruments is given in Note [13].

37 | Notes to the Statement of Cash Flows
Explanation of the method used to calculate
and present cash flows
For a general explanation, please see the comments on the statement of cash flows in the section headed “Accounting policies and
valuation principles.”

Net cash flow provided by operating activities
The net cash flow from operating activities is determined by
­deducting the financial result, depreciation, amortization, writedowns, reversals of impairment charges and non-cash items from
income before income taxes. A further adjustment is then made
for the change in other assets and liabilities. Income before income
­t axes, which is the starting point for the statement of cash flows,
­amounted to €288 million (2014: €80 million) after ­depreciation,
amortization and write-downs of €418 million (2014: €426 m
­ illion),

L ANXE S S Annual Report 2015

including reversals of impairment charges recognized in previous
years on the assets of cash-­generating units amounting to €56 million (2014: €0 ­million). ­Income taxes paid in 2015 amounted to
€98 ­million (2014: €31 ­million). The change in net working capital resulted in a cash inflow of €93 million (2014: €147 million).
Taking into account the reduction in other assets and liabilities
of €33 million (2014: increase of €103 million), the cash inflow
provided by operating activities amounted to €692 million in 2015
(2014: €797 million).

Net cash used in investing activities
Purchases of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment led
to a cash outflow of €434 million in 2015 (2014: €614 million).
Cash inflows from investment subsidies reduced cash outflows for
capital expenditures by €8 million (2014: €25 million). The cash
inflow from and outflow for financial assets in 2015 comprised
an outflow of €11 million for loans to a site service provider in the
­Netherlands. By contrast, the cash inflow of €8 million in 2014
mainly comprised proceeds from the sale of units in money market
funds. Cash inflows from interest and dividends received amounted
to €5 million (2014: €6 million). In addition, in fiscal 2015 there was
a cash outflow of €5 million for the assumption of a loss at Currenta
GmbH & Co. OHG, Leverkusen, Germany, which is recognized at
equity, compared with a profit transfer of €2 million in 2014. The
net cash outflow for investing activities was €400 million (2014:
€587 million).

Net cash used in financing activities
The capital increase at the subsidiary LANXESS-TSRC (Nantong)
Chemical Industrial Co., Ltd., Nantong, China, in which LANXESS
has a 50% interest, resulted in a cash inflow of €9 million (2014:
€433 million from an increase in the capital stock of LANXESS AG).
Outflows included €220 million (2014: €478 million) for the
­repayment of borrowings, particularly €70 million for the ­redemption
of the CNY bond and €114 million for partial repayments of the U.S.
dollar loan from the European Investment Bank. Interest payments
and other financial disbursements accounted for cash outflows of
€76 million (2014: €131 million). In 2015, as in 2014, outflows for
dividend payments amounted to €46 million, comprising €46 million
(2014: €46 million) paid to the stockholders of LANXESS AG. A net
cash outflow of €333 million (2014: €222 million) was recorded
for financing activities. Details of unused credit facilities are given
in Note [36].

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents, which comprise cash, checks and bank
balances, amounted to €366 million (2014: €418 million). In accordance with IAS 7, this item also includes securities with maturities
of up to three months from the date of acquisition.

Notes to the segment reporting
The valuation principles applied in segment reporting correspond
to the uniform recognition and valuation principles used for the
consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with
IFRS. As part of the global realignment, Group structures were
reorganized in 2015. Effective January 1, 2015, the antioxidants
and accelerators product lines of the dissolved Rubber Chemicals
business unit (Performance Chemicals segment) were integrated
into the Advanced Industrial Intermediates business unit (Advanced
Intermediates segment). In addition, employees were assigned to
various business units in connection with the dissolution of ­Aliseca
GmbH. The prior-year figures have been restated ­accordingly,
­resulting in reallocations from the Performance Chemicals s­ egment
to the Advanced Intermediates segment, and changes in the overall
headcount.

L ANXE S S Annual Report 2015

On December 31, 2015, the LANXESS Group comprised the

Consolidated Financial Statements

The reconciliation eliminates inter-segment items and reflects assets
and liabilities that are not directly allocated to the core segments
including, in particular, those pertaining to the Corporate Center.
The reconciliation also includes €0 million (2014: €0 million) ­relating
to Currenta GmbH & Co. OHG, Leverkusen, Germany, which is
­accounted for using the equity method, and the income of €0 ­million
(2014: €2 million) from this investment (see Note [3]).
The transfer prices used for inter-segment business transactions are
calculated using the OECD rules as if they had been agreed upon
between independent third parties in comparable circumstances
(arm’s-length principle).
The majority of employees reflected in the reconciliation provide
services for more than one segment. They include technical ­service
staff.
The reporting regions are those into which LANXESS’s activities
are organized: EMEA (Europe [excluding Germany], Middle East,
Africa), Germany, North America, Latin America and Asia-Pacific.

In view of the Group’s central financial management, interest income
and expense and income tax income and expense are not reported
at segment level. The write-downs recognized in the previous fiscal
year mainly related to a pilot facility of the Butyl Rubber business
unit (Performance Polymers segment).
In fiscal 2015, impairment charges recognized in previous years
on assets in the cash-generating units were reversed. Further information is provided in the section headed “Estimation uncertainties
and exercise of discretion.”
The exceptional items that impacted EBITDA in 2015 mainly related
to the “Let’s LANXESS again” program initiated in the previous year
and include the costs associated with the closure of the site in Marl,
Germany. The corresponding exceptional items in the previous year
mainly related to measures associated with the “Let’s LANXESS
again” and “Advance” programs.
Reconciliation of Segment Sales ������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������

€ million

Regional sales are calculated according to the recipient’s
place of business. In fiscal 2015, no individual customer of the
LANXESS Group accounted for more than 10% of Group sales.
The earnings indicator used for internal management purposes in
the LANXESS Group is the operating result before d
­ epreciation
and amortization (EBITDA) pre exceptionals (see the section
headed “Value management and control system” in the combined
management report for 2015). This is disclosed as the “segment
result.” The starting point for calculating EBITDA pre e
­ xceptionals
is the operating result (EBIT), which comprises gross profit, s­ elling
­expenses, general administration expenses, research and develop­
ment expenses and other operating income and expenses. EBITDA
pre exceptionals is calculated from EBIT by adding back depreciation
and impairments of property, plant and equipment, amortization
and impairments of intangible assets, disregarding exceptional
items. The latter are effects of an unusual nature or magnitude.
They may include write-downs, reversals of impairment charges
­recognized in ­previous years, restructuring expenses, expenses
for the ­design and implementation of IT projects and expenses for
portfolio ­adjustments.

Auditor’s Report

We have audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by
the LANXESS Aktiengesellschaft, Cologne, comprising the statement of financial position, the income statement and the statement
of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, cash flow
statement and the notes to the consolidated financial statements,
together with the group management report, which is combined
with the management report of the company, for the business year
from January 1 to December 31, 2015. The preparation of the
consolidated financial statements and the combined management
report in accordance with the IFRSs, as adopted by the E.U., and
the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant
to § (Article) 315a Abs. (paragraph) 1 HGB (“Handelsgesetzbuch”:
German Commercial Code) are the responsibility of the parent
company’s Board of Management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the combined
management report based on our audit.
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements
in accordance with § 317 HGB and German generally accepted
­standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the
­Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in ­Germany)
(IDW). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
such that misstatements materially affecting the presen­t ation of
the net assets, financial position and results of operations in the
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the ­applicable
financial reporting framework and in the combined manage­ment
report are detected with reasonable assurance. Knowledge of the
business activities and the economic and legal environment of the
Group and expectations as to possible misstatements are taken into
account in the determination of audit procedures. The effectiveness
of the accounting-related internal control system and the evidence
supporting the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements
and the combined management report are examined primarily on

L ANXE S S Annual Report 2015

a test basis within the framework of the audit. The audit includes
assessing the annual financial statements of those entities included
in consolidation, the determination of the entities to be included in
consolidation, the accounting and consolidation principles used and
significant estimates made by the company’s Board of Management,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial statements and the combined management report. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Our audit has not led to any reservations.
In our opinion based on the findings of our audit the ­consolidated
financial statements comply with the IFRSs as adopted by the E.U.
and the additional requirements of German commercial law p
­ ursuant
to § 315a Abs. 1 HGB and give a true and fair view of the net assets,
financial position and results of operations of the Group in accordance with these provisions. The combined management report
is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and as a
whole provides a suitable view of the Group’s position and suitably
presents the oppor­tu­nities and risks of future development.

Reporting methodology
and data collection
GRI
G4–22
G4–23

The full report made here is aligned to national and international
standards for financial and sustainability reporting: the International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the Global Reporting Initiative
(GRI) and the principles of the Global Compact. It thus combines
financial and sustainability reporting by the LANXESS Group.
The reporting period is 2015. In compiling the data, we applied the
principles of balance, comparability, accuracy, timeliness, clarity
and reliability. The report covers the Group companies that are
included in the consolidated financial statements.
Environmental protection data are gathered only at those production
sites in which the company has a holding of more than 50%. By
contrast, the lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR), known as MAQ
(injuries for every million hours worked) in Germany, applies to all
sites in which LANXESS has a holding of more than 50%. In the
case of other indicators which do not refer to the LANXESS Group,
the areas of scope are explicitly defined in the report.
We use an electronic data capture system for the systematic global
recording of key performance indicators (KPIs) in the areas of safety
and environmental protection. With regard to data collection, we
have additionally taken the following recommendations into consideration: Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol), International
Energy Agency (IEA).
In 2010, we set ourselves the target of reducing both the ­specific
energy consumption and specific CO 2e emissions of each of
our business segments by 10% through the end of fiscal 2015.
In a­ ssessing target attainment, we additionally made a adjusted
description of one scenario to take account of factors including
portfolio changes since 2010 (see “Analysis of adjusted values”
on page 70).
We use a standardized corporate information system for reporting
HR data worldwide.

GRI
The report is produced according to the GRI G4 guidelines and
complies with the core option. However, in order to satisfy the
information needs of rating agencies and other stakeholders, we
go beyond these requirements in our reporting and compile a
more extensive GRI index. GRI reporting is performed annually.
The last report for fiscal 2014 was published in March 2015.
The contents of the report for fiscal 2015 are based on a materi­ality
analysis that also included a stakeholder survey. This materiality
analysis is based on the four principles formulated by GRI: sustainability context, materiality, completeness and stakeholder inclusiveness. The following table identifies the boundaries ­between
the key issues and the GRI aspects they cover.

Assurance Report

Independent Practitioner’s
Limited Assurance Report

Audit Firm’s Independence
and Quality Control

To ­L ANXESS AG, Cologne

We have complied with the German professional provisions regarding
independence as well as other ethical requirements.

We have been engaged to perform a limited assurance engagement on environmental and safety performance data in the
­“ Environmental and Safety Performance Data” table included in
the “Health, safety, environment and climate protection along the
value chain” section of the “Corporate Responsibility” chapter in
the Annual Report 2015 of LANXESS AG, Cologne (hereafter the
Company) for the period January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015
(hereafter “Environmental and Safety Performance Data” table).

Management’s Responsibility
Company’s Management is responsible for the preparation and
presentation of the “Environmental and Safety Performance Data”
table in accordance with the criteria as set out in the G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)
(hereafter the “GRI-Criteria”) and for the selection of the information
to be assessed.
This responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the “Environmental and Safety Performance Data” table as well as the use of assumptions and estimates
for individual sustainability disclosures which are reasonable in the
circumstances. Furthermore, the responsibility includes designing,
implementing and maintaining systems and processes relevant for
the preparation of the “Environmental and Safety Performance Data”
table which is free of material misstatements due to intentional or
unintentional errors.

L ANXE S S Annual Report 2015

The audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional standards – in particular the Professional Code for German
Public Auditors and German Chartered Auditors (“Berufssatzung
für Wirtschaftsprüfer und vereidigte Buchprüfer“: “BS WP/vBP”) as
well as the joint opinion of the Wirtschaftsprüferkammer (Chamber
of German Public Auditors; WPK) and the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany; IDW): Requirements
to quality control for audit firms (“Gemeinsamen Stellungnahme der
WPK und des IDW: Anforderungen an die Qualitätssicherung in der
Wirtschaftsprüferpraxis”: “VO 1/2006”) – and accordingly maintains
a comprehensive system of quality control including documented
policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory
requirements.

Practitioner’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the sustainability
information in the “Environmental and Safety Performance Data”
table based on our work performed.
Within the scope of our engagement we did not perform an audit
on external sources of information or expert opinions, referred to in
the “Environmental and Safety Performance Data” table.
We conducted our work in accordance with the International
­Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised):
“Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical
Financial Information” published by IAASB. This Standard requires
that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance whether any matters have come to our attention that
cause us to believe that the sustainability information in the “Environmental and Safety Performance Data” table has not been prepared,
in all material respects, in accordance with the GRI-­Criteria. In a
limited assurance engagement the evidence-gathering procedures

246

HSEQ: Independent Assurance Report
GRI Content Index

are more limited than for a reasonable assurance engagement and
therefore significantly less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance engagement. The procedures selected depend on
the practitioner’s judgement. This includes the assessment of the
risks of material misstatements of the sustainability information in
the “Environmental and Safety Performance Data” table with regard
to the GRI-Criteria.
Within the scope of our work we performed amongst others the
following procedures:
Interviews with employees who are responsible for reporting the environmental and safety performance data regarding the processes and controls in place when collecting the
­environmental and safety performance data;
nn Documentation of the processes and inspection of the
systems and processes regarding the collection calculation,
analysis, verification and aggregation of the environmental
and safety performance data as well as sample testing;
nn Analytical evaluation of the environmental and safety
performance data;
nn Assessment of the presentation of selected sustainability
­information regarding the sustainability performance.
nn

Emphasis of Matter – Recommendations
Without qualifying our conclusion above, we make the following
recommendations:
Consistently, annually update process descriptions and apply
defined controls
nn Apply quality criteria for Scope 2 market-based greenhouse
gas emissions more stringently to fully conform with GHG
­Protocol, and to support target setting process
nn Implement a process for a systematic updating of the
­site-specific CO2 emissions factors.
nn

Restriction on Use and Distribution
We issue this report on the basis of the engagement agreed with
LANXESS AG. The audit has been performed for p
­ urposes of
LANXESS AG and is solely intended to inform LANXESS AG about
the results of the audit. The report is not ­intended for any third
parties to base any (financial) decision thereon. We do not assume
any responsibility towards third parties.

Cologne, February 26, 2016

Conclusion
Based on our limited assurance engagement, nothing has come
to our attention that causes us to believe that the sustainability
information in the “Environmental and Safety Performance Data”
table of the Company for the period January 1 to December 31,
2015 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance
with the GRI-Criteria.

On March 13, 2015, a plant fault resulted in the release of a small amount of
acidic vapor at the site in Jinshan, China. This caused odor formation in close
vicinity to the site.

On October 6, 2015, sulfur dioxide was released as the result of an unplanned
build-up of pressure in a spent acid incinerator at the site in Leverkusen,
Germany. The impact was restricted by the immediate shutdown of the facility.
Also in Leverkusen, failure of the thermal waste air purification facility on
November 11, 2015, resulted in the release of very odorous substances, which
were clearly discernible outside the site.
On November 21, 2015, some 130 m² of a reaction mixture spilled from a
container at the Kallo site in Belgium. While most of the spill was contained,
small amounts reached the wastewater treatment plant.
No personal injury occurred in any of the aforementioned cases.

G4-HR1

Investment agreements and contracts that
have undergone human rights screening

All acquisitions of companies or interests in companies are subject to a careful
due diligence process to ensure that human rights are also respected by the
target company. Significant suppliers of goods and services are regularly the
subject of supplier assessments that include aspects such as compliance with
our Supplier Code of Conduct, which also covers human rights. In fiscal 2015,
we received no reports or other indications of human rights violations by our
suppliers.

2

G4-HR2

Training on human rights aspects

We do not implement training dedicated to the topic of human rights. In our
view, human rights principles are so firmly anchored in LANXESS’s corporate
culture that no further training appears to be necessary. Our Code of
Conduct includes unambiguous instructions regarding the respect of human
rights. This Code of Conduct is a central element of our training programs.
There was no statistical measurement of the amount of time devoted to the
topic of human rights in general compliance training.

1

We have received no reports nor are we aware of any systematic discrimination
of employees by LANXESS with regard to race, skin color, age, gender, sexual
orientation, ethnicity, religion, disability, union membership or political opinion.
In individual cases, misconduct by employees in respect of colleagues or third
parties was reported. We will never tolerate such misconduct, if verifiable,
and it will always result in disciplinary sanctions up to and including dismissal.
Such incidents are processed decentrally at LANXESS and there is no central
reporting system.

suppliers of goods and services are regularly the subject of supplier assessments that include aspects such as compliance with our Supplier Code of
Conduct. We have received no reports or other indications of the use of child
labor by our suppliers.

The LANXESS Group does not use forced or compulsory labor. By accepting
our Supplier Code of Conduct, suppliers also undertake not to use forced or
compulsory labor. Significant suppliers of goods and services are regularly the
subject of supplier assessments that include aspects such as compliance with
our Supplier Code of Conduct. We have received no reports or other indications
of the use of forced or compulsory labor by our suppliers.

LANXESS employs its own security personnel at its sites in certain individual
cases. We primarily procure security services from specialized external providers. They, like all our suppliers, are subject to our Supplier Code of Conduct,
which also covers human rights. In addition, professional security providers
contracted by LANXESS are subject to the relevant security legislation in each
country. In South Africa, for example, security personnel undergo regular training which is documented and complies with the requirements of the Private
Security Industry Regulatory Authority of South Africa (PSIRA).

Business units analyzed for risks related
to corruption

The analysis of risks related to corruption is the responsibility of our Corporate Audit Function. Various analytical approaches and scopes are applied:
1. A
 ssessment of the risk of exposure to corruption and general monitoring
of the internal control system: all business units
2. T
 ransaction monitoring to ensure compliance with company regulations
with an influence on the prevention of corruption in the standard SAP
system: at least 80% of all transactions
3. D
 edicated corruption scans in seven countries which Transparency
International deems to be particularly at risk: approximately 20% of all
transactions

G4-SO4

Percentage of employees trained in

LANXESS applies a risk-oriented training concept. Corruption training
targets exposed professional groups and countries. The proportion of
employees from the total workforce who have received classroom-based
training is around 15%.

G4-SO5

Incidents of corruption and actions taken

In fiscal 2015, we received no reports or other indications of cases of active
corruption by LANXESS employees. In individual cases of verifiable corruption
of LANXESS employees (passive corruption), we take disciplinary action
­(usually dismissal) and, if the legal chances of success are high enough, initiate
civil damage claims (damages and criminal litigation). In fiscal 2015, we
recorded a single-digit number of cases of passive corruption.

Glossary

Industry-specific terms
CLP and GHS CLP is the abbreviation for classification, labeling
and packaging. The E.U. CLP Regulation contains provisions for the
classification, labeling and packaging of substances and mixtures.
It is based on the Globally Harmonized System of Classification
and Labeling of Chemicals – or GHS for short – which ensures that
hazards are labeled in the same way all over the world. The use of
internationally agreed classification criteria and labeling elements
is aimed at making things easier for distributors and at protecting
people and the environment worldwide from the hazards that may
be caused by chemicals.
Commodities This is the collective term for economic goods such as
fuels, agricultural products, precious metals and chemical products,
the quality of which can be identified on the basis of unambiguous
criteria and does not differ from one supplier to the next. In virtually
transparent markets for these goods, price and volume are the only
differentiators that sellers can use.
Compounding facility A facility for processing and finishing
­engineering plastics to enhance their functional properties.
ISO 14001 International standard which supports organizations
in introducing an environmental policy, formulating environmental
targets and implementing these with the aid of an environmental
management system.
ISO 50001 International standard which defines requirements for
systematic energy management to help organizations reduce energy
costs, greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts.

Networked site Production site where many different production
processes and value chains are integrated as a highly efficient network; for example, the by-products from one production plant are
used by another facility are the same site to manufacture another
product. The network principle results in lower energy and raw
material consumption while ensuring high production output. It is
thus resource-friendly and reduces logistics costs at the same time.
OSHA Occupational Safety and Health Administration: an ­agency of
the United States Department of Labor that is authorized to adopt
occupational safety standards. OSHA also enforces these standards
with the aim of reducing the number of work-related accidents and
their consequences.
Polyamide A synthetic polymer with very good mechanical and
electrical properties and high resistance to chemicals and wear.
REACH Abbreviation for the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization
and Restriction of Chemicals; the E.U. REACH Regulation stipulates the registration, assessment and approval of chemicals before
marketing. It imposes a duty on manufacturers and importers to
determine the hazardous characteristics of substances and estimate
their impact on health and the environment.
Synthetic rubber Synthetic rubber is the term used for ­elastic polymers produced from petrochemical raw materials. It is the starting
product for rubber production. Styrene-butadiene r­ ubber is the
most important of the synthetic rubbers and is used especially in
the manufacture of car tires.
VOC emissions Volatile organic compounds is the collective term
for organic carbon compounds that evaporate easily or already
become gaseous at low temperatures.

Financial glossary
