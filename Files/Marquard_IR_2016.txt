As the Chairman of the Marquard & Bahls AG
Supervisory Board, it is important to me to continue
governing the company in our family tradition. This means
progress, not stagnation. Every day, we have to set forth
and pursue our goals with persistence and courage.
Not least because we are committed to the well-being
of our employees, the surrounding communities and the
environment. Adherence to our goals and the continuous
development of our sustainability management are
therefore personal concerns of mine.

Foreword by the Executive Board

Executive Board (from left): Claus-Georg Nette, Julio Tellechea, Anke Schouten, Christian Flach

Dear Readers,
2016 was a year of political surprises. A year that taught us that what may have been accepted as
true yesterday no longer applies to today – and that surveys seldom accurately consider all variables. Reliable values are indispensable in such an environment. Living by values and upholding
them applies to all parts of society, and our company is no exception. One of our five corporate
values is sustainability. But what does a sustainable business conduct mean for a company whose
core business is the trading and handling of finite fuels?
We have designated “environmental protection” as one of our six strategic action areas, with a
special focus on saving energy and reducing our carbon footprint – for the effects and dangers
of climate change are already clearly felt today. Most countries in the world have recognized the
need for taking measures to counter climate change, and even the new political stance in the
United States will not change this. The new global climate treaty, which took effect on November 4,
2016, includes commitments for all industrialized, newly industrializing and developing countries
to drastically reduce CO2 emissions. While this gives a strong boost to the development of renewable energies, it by no means heralds an end to fossil fuels.

The fact is that fossil fuels currently account for almost 80 percent of world energy consumption.
This mix will change. The importance of fossil fuels will gradually decline, but they will continue to
form the backbone of global energy supply for the next few decades. This recognition confirms our
resolution to continue focusing on our core business areas of trading, tank terminal logistics and
aviation fuelling, while also pursuing renewable energies and the opportunities offered in adjacent
areas with an entrepreneurial view to the long term. We will conduct our core business in a way
that minimizes negative environmental impacts. In addition, we assume social responsibility for
our employees and local communities.
We intend to remain on a sustainable course. That is why, in 2016, we started to develop a
comprehensive sustainability strategy that will enable us not only to tackle environmental and
social challenges long term, but also to seize opportunities. We have set ambitious sustainability
targets, adopting a far-sighted view and taking into account our stakeholders’ interests. Our six
strategic action areas serve as a guide in this regard. The strategy is to be finalized and successively
implemented in 2017. There is still a lot of work ahead – we have set forth on the path and will
provide continual updates on our progress.
We wish you an enjoyable read!
Hamburg, July 2017

in 2016. The report, published yearly, covers all Marquard & Bahls companies, including joint
ventures and even minority holdings. natGAS is the only company we have not included – except
for its revenues and headcount – as under company law we have no appreciable influence on its
activities. The appendix contains a list of all companies included in the report.

New Company Headquarters
G4-5

In August 2016, employees in Hamburg moved into the new company headquarters in the HafenCity. In its construction, environmental aspects were taken into account, as well as various aspects
that promote health and communication, resulting in a pleasant working environment and
improved collaboration between the Group Functions and the business divisions.

The building was designed and built in accordance with three criteria of the “Sustainable Construction in
the HafenCity” certification process to achieve the GOLD standard.

A combined heat and power plant in the
HafenCity provides the building with heat.
Cooling is generated by highly efficient
chillers. We buy electricity from the Hamburgbased green electricity provider LichtBlick,
which buys at least one square meter of
rainforest per customer per month.

The interior architecture creates a flexible, accessible
working environment featuring rooms flooded with
daylight, individual meeting zones, and conference
areas with state-of-the-art technology.

The entire lighting system is based on LED technology
and is controlled by means of sensors, depending on
the presence of people and daylight.

For employees who
cycle to work, there
are 180 bicycle stands,
ventilated lockers, and
changing facilities.

In the TIDE bistro, our offerings for employees include coffee specialties from
a Hamburg roasting plant, which maintains fair trade directly with farmers and
cooperatives and thus ensures fair pay. In addition, paper cups were abolished
and the water supply changed to semi-carbonated tap water in the kitchens
and the company restaurant.

The landscaped, sunny DECK balcony with city views
offers 500 square meters of space for conversation and
relaxation.

Almost all workstations are equipped with electrically
height-adjustable desks. Because working while
standing relieves the back and strengthens the spine.

The WATERKANT company restaurant offers
employees a daily menu that includes freshly
cooked dishes made from local ingredients,
and there is always at least one vegetarian
alternative.

There are two kitchenettes with meeting points on
nearly every standard floor. They are decorated in
the style of different regions / countries we are
active and are the ideal setting for short meetings
in a relaxed atmosphere.

The KLABAUTERMANN
childcare room features two
bunk beds, games and two
fully equipped workstations so
that in an emergency, parents
can bring their children to
work.

The 300-square meter TAKELAGE fitness area offers extensive fitness
and training opportunities. Its core features are the ergo room,
equipped with professional fitness equipment, and a room for sports
classes. The equipment can be used at no charge under expert supervision during opening times, or without supervision and at your own
risk after an induction session. A diverse program of courses – ranging
from yoga and pilates to lunchtime gym sessions – offers relaxation
and balance through exercise before, during or after work.

Responsible Corporate Governance

Our activities are not only economically relevant for our companies, they
also have ecological and social effects. Therefore, for us, responsible
corporate governance means ensuring our company’s future viability and
strong reputation by pursuing a “beyond-compliance” approach and integrating the expectations of our stakeholders into our business activities.

Corporate Strategy
Marquard & Bahls has seen rapid growth in recent years. Not only has our portfolio undergone a
transformation, the market environment has also changed profoundly. These developments are
reflected in our business strategy 2020, which was revised at the end of 2015.
This strategy defines the future direction of Marquard & Bahls. It centers on concentrating on our
core business of trading, tank storage logistics and aviation fuelling, which we intend to continue
expanding systematically. This includes keeping an eye open for opportunities in our traditional
and emerging markets.
Other themes in our strategy process are a more balanced distribution of the profit contribution
of our business areas, and active portfolio management that is designed among other things to
initiate a turnaround by improved profitability in economically difficult business areas such as the
dry bulk handling business of UBT. In view of the difficult market situation and in lines with this
strategy, the upstream business of Newsco was sold in march 2017 to a well-established company
in this market.
We also focus on strengthening our organizational structure in line with the objective of having
the Group Functions (formerly the central departments) provide even better support for the
operating business in the future. By the middle of 2016, we had equipped the project teams with
the necessary resources for this. We are confident that we will be able to quickly advance the
ongoing change process, and achieve most of its objectives by the end of 2017.

Organizational Structure
Marquard & Bahls is governed by an Executive Board, which is supported by a Supervisory Board
as an advisory and monitoring body. The Executive Board determines the company’s strategy
and regularly updates the Supervisory Board on the company’s situation and performance. A
lively, consultative exchange on all major matters at hand takes place between the two bodies.
The Supervisory Board also approves key corporate decisions, such as major investments. The
Group Management Committee (GMC) is a further body that supports the Executive Board in an
advisory capacity in selected areas. Besides the members of the Executive Board, the Managing
Directors of Oiltanking, the Directors of the three Mabanaft Divisions, and the Managing Directors

of Skytanking and UBT sit on the GMC, as do the heads of important Group Functions at
Marquard & Bahls. The Executive Board is comprised of the Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
(CEO; Christian Flach), the Chief Financial Officer (CFO; Claus-Georg Nette), the Chief Operating
Officer (COO; Julio Tellechea), and the Chief Change Officer (CCO; Anke Schouten).
Our shareholders follow our development attentively – as well as with experience and enthusiasm.
After 46 years of meritorious service, 14 of them as Chairman of the Supervisory Board and
before that 18 years as Chairman and CEO of the Marquard & Bahls AG Executive Board, Hellmuth
Weisser left the company in March 2017 at his own request and after a long period of planning
and preparation. Daniel Weisser, who has been a member of the Supervisory Board since 2015,
was appointed as the new Chairman of the Supervisory Board, having previously held various
management positions in the company.

Integrating Sustainability
We are aware of the potential impact of our business activities on people and the environment,
and therefore try to integrate the principle of sustainable development in all our activities and to
promote the welfare of our employees, the environment, and the surrounding communities. Our
sustainability management focuses on Health, Safety, Security & Environment (HSSE), and is therefore based on the activities coordinated by the Group Function HSSE. All of the larger Marquard &
Bahls companies, especially Oiltanking and Skytanking, have a designated local HSSE manager to
supervise all HSSE-related topics and questions. A separate Team Sustainability within the Group
Function HSSE pools all related activities and further develops them in close coordination with the
divisions and the local HSSE managers.
Sustainability issues are reported directly to the CEO via the Head of the Group Function HSSE.
Fig. 3 shows how sustainability is integrated in Marquard & Bahls’ overall management approach.
Our long-term goal is to more firmly mainstream our centrally defined sustainability management
worldwide, and to lend a greater impact to sustainability activities developed at local level. In Asia
Pacific and Latin America we have already appointed the first coordinators to advance the issue
locally. We will gradually transfer this model to other regions.

Sustainability Strategy
To keep improving our sustainability performance and more strategically direct our efforts in the
areas that are material for us, the Team Sustainability started to develop a comprehensive sustainability strategy in 2016. This strategy is based on six action areas: “Responsible Corporate Governance,” “Sustainable Growth,” “Environmental Protection,” “Our Employees,” “Health & Safety,” and
“Corporate Citizenship.” The concept includes long-term goals to be achieved by 2025, as well as
corresponding measures. Initial programs and concepts have been developed for certain areas, for
example in the “Corporate Citizenship” action area. In the 2017 financial year, the strategy will be –
after approval by the Executive Board – gradually implemented.
On the following pages we describe our long-term goals in the action areas and what was achieved
in 2016 and present an initial excerpt from our sustainability strategy.

Agenda 2030
In 2015, by ratifying the Agenda 2030, the global community for the first time agreed on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that apply equally for all UN member states. The international
community will now implement, monitor and review the Agenda’s sustainability objectives in a new
global partnership characterized by shared responsibility of all states, as well as the involvement
of business and civil society. In addition to the fight against hunger, poverty and discrimination,
the Agenda’s 17 goals and 169 sub-goals are dedicated to equal education opportunities, the
protection of biodiversity and the climate, and a commitment to peace and the rule of law.

Fig. 4: The 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the Agenda 2030
We, too, are committed to the implementation of Agenda 2030. In a first step, we have identified

Guidelines and Standards
We develop our internal policies and standards based on internationally recognized principles of
responsible entrepreneurship. The basis for this is our Code of Conduct, which is binding for all
employees. We also respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as well as the four basic
principles of the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the eight core labor standards derived
from it.

The four basic principles of the ILO are:
1. Freedom of association and the right of collective bargaining
2. Elimination of forced labor
3. Abolition of child labor
4. Elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation
We will further embed the ten principles of the UN Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises as well as the principles of the German Corporate Governance Code in our
processes, even if we are not yet an active signatory. Since 2011, we have reported in accordance
with the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), which have become established internationally as the standard for sustainability reporting. Since 2015, we have also applied the German
Sustainability Code (DNK).

Audits
We use internal HSSE audits to continually improve our performance and review our progress
in the areas of Health, Safety, Security & Environment. The Group Function HSSE monitors
Oiltanking, Skytanking and UBT locations worldwide for their compliance with company standards.
In 2016, Oiltanking and Skytanking underwent a total of 101 internal (2015: 62) and 273 external (2015: 262) HSSE-relevant audits – the latter included audits by authorities, customers, and
insurance companies.

Key Performance Indicators
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are another tool used to audit and improve the system. We
publish most of our sustainability indicators annually in the Sustainability Report. As part of
the sustainability strategy, we have defined further key indicators, to allow us to measure and
evaluateour performance even more accurately. In addition, detailed HSSE statistics are prepared with “leading” (forward-looking) and “lagging” (retrospective) indicators for the Group, all
of the divisions, and their profit centers. Indicators such as near misses, relative frequency of
accidents, and product releases are also a bonus-affecting element of management remuneration
at Oiltanking.

Certified Management Systems
In all, 51 percent of the Oiltanking locations operating worldwide in 2016 are certified for quality
management (ISO 9001), 25 percent for environmental management (ISO 14001), 18 percent
for energy management (ISO 50001), and 25 percent for health and safety management (OHSAS
18001). Our Indian subsidiary, IOT Infrastructure & Energy Services Ltd., is also certified in
accordance with ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001. At Skytanking, 15 percent of sites are
ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certified, 10 percent of them are additionally certified in accordance
with OHSAS 18001. Since last year, Mabanaft Deutschland and GMA are also ISO 50001 certified.
Mabanaft Deutschland additionally holds an ISO 14001 certification. These management systems
were developed to steadily increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the business processes.
Several other Marquard & Bahls companies have organized their management processes in a
very similar way, but have not had their quality, environmental, or health and safety management
systems certified.

Stakeholders
We have identified our most important stakeholders through internal discussions, workshops,
external analyses, and industry comparisons. The frequency of contact with interest groups and
the relevant issues vary, depending on the stakeholder. While contact with employees, shareholders, customers or business partners usually takes place on a daily or weekly basis, with other
stakeholders it is less frequent.

Fig. 6: Marquard & Bahls stakeholders
An internal Stakeholder Management Guideline serves to make our stakeholder dialog more
systematic. In the spring of 2017, we conducted our second web-based stakeholder survey, which
all Marquard & Bahls employees and employees of the subsidiaries worldwide were invited to
participate in. The results were incorporated in the materiality analysis for the compilation of this
report, as well as in our sustainability strategy.

Materiality Analysis
G4-18,
G4-27

In addition to surveying our stakeholders, we monitor changes in legal requirements and relevant
standards, such as the GRI guidelines, to identify and prioritize the issues that are relevant for
our sustainability efforts. At least every two years, we carry out a materiality analysis to evaluate
the significance of the aspects identified, and thus determine the issues we focus on in our sustainability strategy and our reporting. Apart from identifying significant expectations and requirements, the future opportunities and risks for our business and the affected stakeholders are an
important focus.
In 2017, we re-evaluated the relevance of the listed sustainability themes from the company’s
perspective and based on the second stakeholder survey, and updated the materiality matrix.
Because all issues identified as being of particular significance are on average within the range of
“relatively important” to “very important” – no issue was rated as unimportant – the x- and y-axes
are shown adjusted.
An invitation to participate in the anonymous online survey in March 2017 was sent to all employees who can be reached by email, and to 227 external stakeholders. A total of 704 stakeholders
participated in the survey, of whom 640 were internal (response rate: 10 percent) and 64 external, mainly customers and business partners (response rate: 28 percent). Stakeholders from the
capital markets, from the public sector, the media, NGOs and research were each represented in
the survey with less than one percent. The participants predominantly replied from the regions
of Germany and Europe (outside Germany), followed by India, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. To
ensure a balanced weighting for our employees’ opinions, they were given a 50 percent share in
the stakeholder perspective shown in the matrix.
Issues that are particularly relevant can be seen in the upper right quadrant of the matrix. “Health
and safety”, as well as “environmental protection”, especially the “avoidance of product releases”,
are classified as very important both from a stakeholder and company point of view. In addition
to these topics, from a stakeholder perspective “our employees”, the “prevention of fires and
explosions”, and “occupational safety” are most important. In comparison with stakeholders, from
a company perspective the “implementation of a growth strategy that takes sustainability aspects
into account”, as well as “innovation potential” and “sustainable business development”, are rated
as very important.
The results have been incorporated into the contents of this Sustainability Report and provide
valuable input for our strategic sustainability management.

Comments from the Stakeholder Survey

“An energy company’s first
priority should clearly
be the environmental
implications.”

“We should think outside
the box and keep an eye
open for new business
models.”

“For a company like ours,
the employees are the crucial
part of our business. […]
We need smart employees
who work together in teams
– not intelligent loners.”

“We need a transparent
sustainability strategy
with clearly defined
targets and timelines.”

”I think it’s important to
look after our employees –
with a view to a good work
environment, in order to be
able to work happily and
efficiently, but also in terms
of health, as many of our
employees handle dangerous
substances on a daily basis.“

“Our company should promote
our employees’ commitment to
the community, for example
through leave of absence and
financial support.”

“We should set ourselves
realistic growth targets.
Growth should not be more
important than quality of
service and customer
satisfaction.”

“With regard to sustaina
bility, it is important
to make Marquard & Bahls
a change partner for
a zero-emissions world.”

“We should have the
moral
courage to do the rig
ht
thing – even if it cos
ts
more money in the end
.”

Compliance
Our good reputation and its protection is very important for us. To safeguard it and ensure
correct, law-compliant behavior, we have developed various guidelines and procedures. These

G4-DMA,
G4-56

include our Code of Conduct and the group-wide internal whistleblowing system, along with a
Code of Conduct team and e.g. procurement guidelines. The tasks of the new Group Function
Compliance include identifying compliance risks, developing appropriate compliance programs,
and implementing them through practical measures such as training. The focus here is on the
prevention of corruption, bribery, and fraud, as well as on competition law and sanction-related
topics. Many compliance topics have already been covered by various Group Functions and
departments on Group level for years. The Group Function Compliance coordinates all the
relevant topics and specifies interfaces. In the summer of 2016, a cross-functional Compliance
Committee was set up, consisting of the Heads of the Group Functions HSSE, Compliance, Legal,
Internal Audit, Treasury, Human Resources (HR) and IT. The committee’s objective is to identify
compliance risks, clarify responsibilities, and monitor the establishment of compliance programs.

Code of Conduct
Our Code of Conduct covers 16 topics, divided into four chapters (Fig. 8). The principles of the
Code of Conduct provide a uniform set of values, along with guidance for how individuals are

G4-LA16,
G4-SO5

expected to behave in the context of the Marquard & Bahls philosophy. In 2014, the Code of Conduct was amended to include the strategic approach of Marquard & Bahls, and made accessible
to all employees worldwide. It can be downloaded from our website (www.marquard-bahls.com)
in 20 languages.

Reporting Misconduct
Our group-wide internal whistleblowing system intervenes in cases of non-compliance with the
code. This central system, which is administered by the Code of Conduct team, gives all employees
worldwide a tool for reporting violations of the Code of Conduct, while allowing them to remain
anonymous if they wish. Each reported incident is investigated thoroughly. The Executive Board
is informed of the nature of reported incidents and the status of the investigation, but is not given any personal data. Since April 2017, there has been another option for reporting suspected
cases of misconduct. Under the slogan Care & Share, the Group Function Compliance has globally
rolled out an online platform called CARE (Concerns And REporting). It offers all employees and
business partners an additional secure and uncomplicated way of reporting suspected cases of
misconduct. At marquard-bahls.integrityplatform.org, for example, incorrect, deceptive, or even
corrupt behavior can be reported in the country’s respective language, anonymously and 24/7.
The Group Function Compliance assumes independent case management in all cases, and commissions appropriate investigators.
Two whistleblowing reports were received by the Code of Conduct team in 2016:

>

The case that was still open at the end of December 2015, in which an anonymous
whistleblower reported the alleged personal advantage-taking and enrichment of three
employees in purchasing and procurement, was concluded in 2016. In a complex external investigation, no misconduct could be proven. However, the location’s procurement
systems were further optimized.

>

An employee from an operational unit complained about disrespectful behavior by a manager
and that contractual agreements on overtime surcharges were not being adhered to. The
situation was resolved after involving HR and the management, and outstanding payments
were made.

Behavioral Guidelines
In addition to the Code of Conduct, there are other specific guidelines. For instance, our social
media guideline helps employees to communicate on social media effectively and in line with legal
requirements.
We want to ensure fair competition, even in very competitive markets, by defining basic values,
codes of behavior and responsibilities. In accordance with our formal procurement guidelines at
Oiltanking, staff is obliged to promote fair and transparent competition, avoid any kind of personal
obligations to vendors, act honestly, and report all forms of malpractice to their supervisors and/
or the company management. As a further tool to ensure fair competition, an international procurement and contracting training program has been carried out with the relevant employees at
Oiltanking for many years.

37

R e sp o n si ble C o r po r ate G o ver nance

Anti-Corruption
Marquard & Bahls does not tolerate corruption and bribery. In our Code of Conduct, we inform
employees about our principles in this matter and call on them to report specific cases of – or
concerns about – possible corruption to our Code of Conduct team. To further build employee
awareness regarding matters of corruption and bribery, a new training program was launched and
rolled out in 2016. It is targeted primarily at employees who work in particularly vulnerable positions, i.e. mainly employees in management positions and those in direct contact with customers
or the authorities.
To preclude corruption from the outset, we subject our sites to an annual risk analysis. In countries with a high risk of corruption, we are stepping up our activities against corruption, although
our revenues are largely generated in low-risk countries. In 2016, no cases of corruption were
reported beyond the whistleblowing cases described earlier.

Legal Compliance
G4-DMA,
G4-EN29,
G4-EN34,
G4-SO8,
G4-PR9

We see compliance with the law as a matter of course. This applies to both national and international laws and regulations. Legal developments are monitored and reviewed for their relevance
for Marquard & Bahls. One important indicator of regulatory compliance is the number of fines
and penalties. In 2016, we were fined a worldwide total of 156,279 euros (2015: 175,728 euros)
for non-compliance with laws and regulations. Most of the fines totaling 143,632 euros had an
ecological background. For example, a 90,000-euro fine was incurred due to a product release.
The products traded, transported, handled, and stored by our Group are subject to national and
international or European legislation, and must therefore comply with hazard communication provisions, including accurate product labeling and the provision of safety data sheets at Mabanaft.
Most of the products traded by Mabanaft are classified as hazardous and are therefore subject to
strict product information requirements. In addition, Oiltanking maintains a central database for
product information, which now contains data for more than 1,000 products.

Transparency
The comprehensive disclosure of relevant information to our employees and other stakeholders is a high priority. At Group level, this task is the responsibility of the Group Functions
Corporate Communication and HSSE, in close coordination with the Executive Board and the
respective Managing Directors. All progress in the area of our sustainability management is
transparently reported in the annual sustainability reports. New developments and important
company information are regularly communicated through the “Logbook,” a monthly newsletter
for employees, as well as emailings and notices posted on our bulletin boards. Beyond this, we
communicate with our employees through in-house magazines like COMPASS (Marquard & Bahls),
connections (Oiltanking), Skytanking Life (Skytanking), and OIL! INSIDE (OIL! Tankstellen), and on
digital employee portals. Press releases and other publications can be found on the company
websites that are also accessible to external users. In January 2017, 570 employees from all parts
of the world, including the Marquard & Bahls headquarters, chose “connect” as the name for the
Group’s new global communications and collaboration platform, which is currently being finalized
and will be rolled out in fall 2017.
Data protection is another important issue. At Marquard & Bahls, this topic is the responsibility
of the Group Function HSSE. Important measures in Germany in this area include providing an
extensive Data Protection Manual, and carrying out staff training, topical consultation and audits.
In addition, the latest legislative initiatives are continually monitored to ensure present and future
compliance with data protection laws.

39

R e s p o n sible C o r po r ate G o ver nance

At an international level, the country-specific data protection laws relevant to us are being
analyzed, with a special focus on the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that will enter
into force as from May 2018. Extensive IT security systems ensure high-grade protection of
employee, customer, supplier, and other business data.

monitors policymakers’ decisions regarding legal regulations, evaluates them, actively participates
in debates with decision-makers, and works closely with the relevant associations. Important
topics in 2016 included the winter package for the EU’s energy policy, the drafts for the 37th and
38th Federal Emission Control Ordinance, the amendment of the Energy Taxation Act, the Climate
Protection Plan, and the Payment Service Directive.

Overall, the Marquard & Bahls Group looks back on a good year, during the course of which we
expanded our core business areas – trading, tank storage logistics, aviation fuelling – and further
strengthened our organizational structure. By the end of the year, our activities had generated
pre-tax profits of 203 million euros, based on Group revenues (including energy taxes) of 11.5

activities mainly encompass the midstream and downstream area of this value chain, namely trading, transport,

subsidiary Newsco, which offers horizontal directional drilling services and drilling technology. In view of the
difficult market situation, the shares in Newsco International Energy Services and its subsidiaries were sold.
The decision to sell the upstream business to a company well-established in this market was made in line with

Many of our subsidiaries are active along the oil and gas value chain. We are aware of the risks to
our employees, the environment, and society. It is thus our goal to identify risks at an early stage
and to minimize the negative impacts of our business activities in the areas we can influence along
our value chain. In the following, we give an overview of the potential environmental and social
challenges of the oil and gas value chain, and show the areas where we are involved through our
subsidiaries.

Exploration, Production & Crude Oil Storage
Exploration & production includes the search for deposits, the development of oil and gas fields,
and the extraction of crude oil and natural gas. Exploration and production activities generally
impact nature and therefore represent a potential threat to ecosystems. In addition, technical
defects, human error, and natural disasters can lead to serious accidents such as fires. Deepwater drilling represents a particular challenge, because it is associated with considerable technical
effort and requires elaborate safety measures due to the serious environmental consequences of
oil spills and difficult extraction conditions. Terrorism and military conflicts also involve high risks,
e.g. when oil fields are deliberately set on fire. Crude oil is mainly transported from the fields to
the refineries by pipeline and seagoing vessel. The main risks here are from potential transport
accidents, which may lead to oil spills from pipelines or tanker accidents. The greenhouse gases
emitted during extraction and maritime transport also contribute to global warming.

>

We were previously active in this sector through our subsidiary Newsco (sold in March 2017),
a provider of horizontal directional drilling services and developer of drilling technology for
exploration companies. Our location in Açu Port, Brazil, offers crude oil transshipping facilities,
and e.g. our tank terminals in Argentina and Colombia offer crude oil logistics.

Refining
In refinery plants, oil is distilled, purified and refined to produce fuels, lubricants, or chemical
feedstocks for the plastics industry. Handling hazardous materials and work processes at high
pressure and temperature ranges at refineries involves the risk of spills and fires, which can have
negative effects on the environment, the health and safety of employees and the surrounding
communities. In addition, the processes are very energy intensive, which contributes to global
warming. In politically unstable countries, there are risks from small illegal refineries, where gasoline, kerosene and diesel for the black market are produced from drawn-off oil, and which pose
a threat to people and nature e.g. due to disregard for occupational health and safety standards.

S us tainable G r o wth

Transport to and from the refinery is usually conducted by pipeline, seagoing vessels or railcars.
In addition to the potential risk of accidents, in some countries there are risks from drilling into
pipelines, which can result in environmental pollution through product releases or emissions.

>

Marquard & Bahls does not own or operate any refineries or petrochemical plants. However,
residues from refineries, such as pet coke, are stored and handled at our two United Bulk
Terminals dry-bulk storage facilities in the U.S.

Trade
Trade in petroleum products involves the physical trading business as well as speculative trading
with foreign currency or securities on petroleum stock exchanges. The trading business is closely
linked with the transport of goods and hence carries transport-related environmental risks.

>

Our subsidiaries under the Mabanaft umbrella are independent suppliers that concentrate on
the physical trading of oil products such as heating oil, diesel, gasoline, jet fuel, marine fuels
and biofuels. One core activity is regional trading and wholesale in Singapore and Northwest
Europe. Mabanaft charters ships and contracts tank trucks and railcars for its product transports. To avoid petroleum products being transported by ships that do not meet our standards, we have defined detailed minimum acceptance criteria in a Ship Charter Policy for
Mabanaft. To evaluate our own impact on climate change, each year we calculate our carbon
footprint, including commissioned transport, in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol
(GHG Protocol).

Product Storage
Storage plays an important role as petroleum products move from oilfields around the world to
consumers. The main risk here arises from working with highly flammable substances, as well as
environmentally hazardous, and sometimes toxic products. Preventing accidents, spills and fires
is therefore a special focus in tank storage. Tank terminals receive the products to be stored from
seagoing vessels, barges, pipelines, railcars and tank truck. The transport-related risks are the
same as those already mentioned in the other areas.

>

Our subsidiary Oiltanking is especially active in the area of storage. Skytanking also operates
airport tank terminals for storing jet fuel. In-house standards, which often far exceed the statutory requirements, are part of our HSSE management system. To ensure professional support
in the event of major oil spills, Marquard & Bahls is a shareholder in Oil Spill Response Limited,
the world’s largest oil spill response organization. To evaluate the environmental impact of
greenfield projects, extensive environmental impact assessments are carried out.

Distribution & End-Consumer Business
The distribution & end-consumer business involves supplying customers with fuels to produce
heat and motion, as well as lubricants. The fuelling and consumer business that is part of this area
is closely linked with the transport of the products, and therefore involves transport-related risks.
Moreover, the process of bunkering ships and fuelling road tankers and aircraft, for example,
involves the risk of accidents and spills.

>

Skytanking offers aviation fuelling services. In addition our Mabanaft subsidiaries are active
in the distribution & end-consumer business, namely in ship bunkering, service stations, and
the end-consumer business with heating oil. In order to reduce the ecological footprint of
filling stations, for example, OIL! Tankstellen is switching its service stations to LED lighting. To
reduce the emissions of company-owned vehicle fleets at the Petronord companies, investments are being made in late-model vehicles with more efficient engines, and tutorials for
fuel-efficient driving are given.

Subsequent Value Creation
At the various steps along the value chain, waste and wastewater are produced, which must be
properly disposed of. And downstream of this, products are usually consumed or combusted,
which contributes to global warming by releasing greenhouse gases.

>

Because waste is generated in our activities, our subsidiaries are indirectly involved. Hazardous waste, e.g. from oil-water separators and tank-cleaning residues, is treated by licensed
contractors. However, our aim is to prevent waste, and we are continuously working on this.

>

Emissions from the combustion of petroleum products can be offset with emission certificates
from our subsidiary Carbonbay’s climate protection projects.

Risk Management
G4-2

One of the greatest challenges as we pursue our strategy of controlled, long-term growth is to limit
the manifold financial, operational and HSSE risks. That is why we work based on a permanent
and thorough risk management scheme that individually rates all risks and defines tailor-made
mandates, tasks, and responsibilities. To further ensure a healthy mix of risk, all risks – including
social and environmental ones – are evaluated in the context of the entire group of companies.
Many challenges were already addressed in the previous section, but are summarized again below
as key risks that could impact our future business performance:

>
>
>
>
>
>
>

Currency fluctuation
Another international financial crisis flare-up and/or sustained economic downturn
Political conflict in oil-producing countries and the resultant tensions on the oil markets
Rising prices for natural resources and purchased energy
Environmental and natural disasters as well as effects of the climate change
Higher risks in countries we are active in
Unreasonably stricter environmental laws

Trading Risks
For Mabanaft, the relevant trading risks are those caused by the high level of volatility in commodity prices, currency exchange rates, and interest rates. As in the previous year, in 2016 the
oil market was characterized by an oversupply of crude oil, which led to a relatively low prices.
The production cut in 2017 agreed by OPEC – and some non-OPEC members as well – resulted
in more stable prices at the end of the year. Despite the pronounced contango situation – a price
situation in which the price for future delivery is above the current price – strong competition as
well as political and economic uncertainties impacted the trading business, which practices strict
risk management. Trading risks are hedged by the systematic use of financial instruments such as
derivatives and forward transactions. Mabanaft protects itself against bad debt through credit insurance, banking securities, and the settlement of commodity futures transactions via segregated
brokerage accounts. Our controlling ensures that the rules laid down are adhered to.

Sus tainable G r o wth

HSSE-Risks
As outlined in the previous section “Ecological and Social Challenges Along the Oil & Gas Value
Chain,” main risks for us arise from working with highly flammable substances, as well as environmentally harmful and sometimes toxic products. The tank storage and aviation fuelling divisions
are especially exposed to these hazards, as are the service station and end-consumer business.
The prevention of any potential hazards resulting from this, such as accident, leakage and fire
risks, is therefore a special focus of risk management at Marquard & Bahls. This falls within the
remit of the Group Function HSSE. Based on detailed regulations, site-specific operating instructions for which regular training is carried out, clear communications, and detailed reporting, the
HSSE teams ensure a proactive safety culture to avoid HSSE hazards. The central HSSE team
therefore works closely with the local HSSE managers.

Supplier & Customer Relations
We treat our suppliers with respect, maintain an honest relationship with everyone involved in
the business processes, and strive to establish a long-term cooperative partnership. For us, this
means not only acting responsibly on our own premises, but along the entire supply chain. The
diversity of our company is reflected in the broad spectrum of our suppliers, ranging from vendors
of technical equipment for our tank terminals to office equipment suppliers. Internal supplier lists
increase transparency in the quality and performance of our business partners, with the ultimate
goal of giving our customers excellent services and products. At our sites we also place great
importance on safe working procedures for employees from sub-contractors. At Oiltanking, an
integrated contractor management program has been in place since 2014. It is described in more
detail in the section on the “Occupational Health & Safety” action area.
Building long-term cooperative partnerships with our customers is another key strategic priority.
Our employees play a central role in ensuring the satisfaction of our customers. Responsible and
dedicated teams guarantee excellent services, which in turn lead to customer loyalty. We therefore feel it is important that our employees can make decisions autonomously, enabling them to
respond flexibly to customer requests.

We always strive to prevent product
releases, minimize our environmental
footprint and use resources efficiently.
At the same time, we aim to reduce
our relative energy consumption as
well as water consumption, reduce
ozone-depleting emissions and further
optimize our waste and wastewater
management.

55

Envir o nmental Pr otectio n

Environmental Protection
Our activities impact the environment both directly and indirectly. Our
sites use energy, water, various raw materials and building materials,
and generate airborne emissions, waste and wastewater. In addition, the
storage and transportation of petroleum products and chemicals carry
a risk of spillage. At the same time, we are confronted with global
mega trends such as climate change and increasing environmental
degradation. We therefore want to make every effort to position
ourselves as an environmentally friendly company within our business
activities – a company that keeps its negative impact on the environment to an absolute minimum.

Environmental Management
Environmental issues are an integral part of the HSSE management system throughout Marquard &
Bahls. According to the HSSE Policy signed by the Marquard & Bahls Executive Board and the
management of all subsidiaries worldwide, we are committed to making efficient use of energy

G4-2,
G4-14,
G4-DMA

and resources, avoiding pollution and advancing the environmental awareness of employees in
order to minimize harmful effects. For example, for several years now, we have been recording
the amount of energy and water used, the frequency of product releases and their volume, as well
as the volume of waste produced at our sites and have established key indicators for doing so.

Spill Prevention
Spills
Preventing spills is a key for any company that handles petroleum, gas and chemical products.
Modern facilities and efficient workflows, combined with preventive maintenance programs, serve
to minimize the risk of spills. If there are still product releases nevertheless, we are prepared to
recover the product quickly and effectively, and not to leave it to pollute the environment. We
document every product release, no matter how small.
Despite all our efforts, there were 53 product releases of more than 100 liters across the whole
company. Nearly all of these incidents occurred at Oiltanking. Overall, the number of incidents
with more than 100 liters of released product per million tons throughput in 2016 was down by
30 percent year-on-year, to 0.22 (2015: 0.32).

However, the total volume of product released on our premises rose from 371 m³ in 2015 to
557 m³, of which 61 m³ of product could not be recovered. 65 percent of the released product was
caused by an ethanol leak at Oiltanking, but here the entire quantity was recovered.

Precautions in Case of Spills in Water
G4-15

To ensure professional support in the event of major oil spills, Marquard & Bahls is a shareholder
in Oil Spill Response Limited, the world’s largest oil spill response organization. Oil Spill Response
Limited was founded in 1984 and is wholly owned by international oil companies. At Oiltanking,
scenario-specific contingency plans have been developed for all relevant sites, and practical
training and drills have been carried out. Marquard & Bahls is also an active member of the Oil
Companies International Marine Forum (OCIMF), a voluntary association of oil companies that
works to ensure a safe and ecologically responsible operation of oil tankers and tank terminals.

Ship Charter Policy
To prevent petroleum products being transported by ships that do not meet our standards,
Mabanaft has a Ship Charter Policy that defines detailed minimum requirements for the clearance
of chartered or accepted ships (C-term purchases). Its overriding goal is to ensure safe transport
of the products at all times, and strict adherence to the changing requirements and rules of international tanker shipping – e.g. the requirements of the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

57

Envir o nmental Pr otectio n

The criteria in the requirements exceed the statutory minimum standard and therefore result in
improved environmental protection through prevention of oil spills. To enable a quick and upto-date assessment of ships in accordance with this policy, we have commissioned a customized
web-based information system which has already been used for many years. The Ship Charter
Policy is updated regularly; for example, a fine-tuning of the charter requirements for LPG tankers
was carried out for 2017.

Energy Saving & Climate Protection
Climate change is currently regarded as the world’s most serious megatrend, as well as one of
the greatest global risks. Extreme weather events such as prolonged high temperatures and
droughts, severe storms and floods, and a rise in the sea level are just a few examples of possible
consequences that can severely affect Marquard & Bahl’s business as well. According to the Paris
Climate Agreement of 2015, the increase in global average temperatures is to be limited to a maximum of 2° C compared to pre-industrial levels. The challenge, around the world, is to meet rising
energy demand while also meeting this ambitious goal – and we are no exception.

Energy Consumption
Marquard & Bahls uses direct and indirect energy sources to operate its facilities, sites, and vehicles. In 2016, direct energy consumption totaled 1,196,514 gigajoules (GJ). This includes natural
gas, heating oil and fuel for the operation of our pumps, boilers, owned bunker ships, operational
vehicles, and road tankers (2015: 1,117,389 GJ). Indirect energy – mainly electricity – is used among
other things for product pumps and lighting at our tank terminals and for the hydrant systems at
our aviation fuelling sites. The servers and computers in our offices are also constant consumers
of energy. Other indirect sources of energy that we use include district heating and, to a lesser extent, imported steam. In 2016, indirect energy consumption totaled 955,404 GJ (2015: 851,413 GJ),
bringing the total amount of direct and indirect energy to 2,151,919 GJ (2015: 1,968,801 GJ), which
means an increase. Due to the diversity of our Group, there is limited comparability between our
companies’ consumption figures. That is why, for purposes of comparison, we cite the consumption figures of our tank storage activities, which are our largest, per tons of throughput. Fig. 12
shows that the megajoules (MJ) required to transship a ton of product have risen from 8.9 to
9.5 MJ compared to the previous year. After several years of reduction, this means we have not
come any closer to our long-term goal of reducing relative energy consumption, but we will

service stations reported a proportion of more than 20 percent green energy in their energy mix.
Since the move to the new company headquarters, the subsidiaries’ holding offices as well as
Marquard & Bahls AG itself also contract green electricity. However, significant on-site power generation takes place in only a few cases, for example at the Mabagas biogas plant in Namakkal, India.
For further information, please see the section on “Renewable Energies & Alternative Products.”
G4-EN4

Total energy consumption includes the consumption at all subsidiaries. Besides natGAS,
Petronord’s approx. 250 automated service stations, 45 automated stations operated under the
name OIL! tank & go (formerly Haahr Benzin) in Denmark, 13 Skytanking and two Oiltanking tank
terminals are an exception to this rule. Their data is not or only partly included because their
energy consumption cannot be measured separately as they share sites with other owners, or the
energy costs are covered in the rental agreement. Where possible, missing information on energy
consumption is included as estimates. In order to show a complete picture, we have also included all
of our joint ventures. Outside the organization, fuel is mainly used for product transports. Usually,
we do not get absolute consumption figures from external service providers, but calculate the
CO2 emissions as stated in the “Emissions Related to Product Transport” section, based on the
quantities and distances transported.

* After publication of the Sustainability Report 2015, Oiltanking’s relative energy consumption in 2015 had to be corrected from
8.4 to 8.9

Envir o nmental Pr otectio n

Reducing Energy Consumption
The most energy-consuming activity at Marquard & Bahls is the pumping that takes place at the
Oiltanking tank terminals. To identify potential savings and take measures to improve energy
efficiency, the sites can refer to a detailed Energy Saving Guideline with background information
and practical recommendations. While putting it into action at various sites, further potential
for savings was identified and general recommendations were derived also sentence not in the
german version in 2016. We will continue to document our energy saving measures and support
our subsidiaries in establishing energy saving programs.

Local energy saving projects
> Many of our sites are gradually shifting to LED lighting – like our tank terminal in Oman, which was able to save 56,628 kWh
of electricity by converting to LED.

> The Oiltanking tank terminal in Varna, Bulgaria, continued its energy efficiency program, and saved 48,000 kWh of electricity
by retrofitting its air-conditioning system, converting to LED lighting, and implementing various insulation measures.

> The Skytanking site in Vienna relies on dispenser vehicles with automatic start/stop, which causes the engine to switch
off during refuelling. Last year, the four vehicles in use were able to save about 3,850 liters of diesel compared to
traditional-type dispensers.

Calculating the Carbon Footprint and Other Emissions
To assess our own influence on the climate, we calculate the carbon footprint of the entire group
of companies each year. In accordance with the GHG Protocol, we define our carbon footprint as
the total amount of the six greenhouse gases listed in the Kyoto Protocol, measured in tons of CO2
equivalent (CO2e), caused directly or indirectly by our company. The relevant greenhouse gases
resulting from our operations are CO2, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Other air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2) emitted by third-party shipping, or volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) from our tank terminals, are recorded separately.

G4-EN21

60

M a r q u a r d & B a h l s S u s ta i n a b i l i t y R e p o r t 2 0 1 6

The greenhouse gas emissions were calculated using the latest Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) emission factors and the GHG Protocol. In the case of emission factors for
electricity, the energy mix of various countries was also taken into consideration. As collecting the
data and calculating the emissions of trading-related product transport is very complex, we devote
a separate section to this topic.

Direct and Indirect Greenhouse Gas Emissions
G4-EN15,
G4-EN16,
G4-EN17,
G4-EN19

Since 2010, we have calculated our corporate carbon footprint according to the GHG Protocol, by
first determining reporting scopes for each company. To get a complete picture, we decided to
include 100 percent of emissions from all subsidiaries and joint ventures. It was also not possible
to take the sites already mentioned in the “Energy Consumption” section into account.

Emissions generated by third parties fall within Scope 3, where we have included emissions arising
from the transport of fuel by third-party logistics companies, and from business trips by air. We
have not included emissions generated during the production of building materials (e.g. steel for
our storage tanks), the construction of facilities, or the energy required for waste disposal (Fig. 13),
as these should be reported by the respective suppliers and service providers.

an increase in Scope 2 emissions, while emissions from chartered vessels in the trading sector
declined. Although more ships were chartered here, they often sailed shorter distances with lower
product volumes. As before, our goal is to minimize our emissions, albeit bearing our company’s
growth in mind.

Emissions Related to Product Transport
G4-DMA,
G4-EN30

Marquard & Bahls subsidiaries use tank trucks, railcars, barges and seagoing vessels to transport
their products. We try to identify and use the types of transport with the least impact on the
climate and continue to place a strong focus on transportation by water, since this is the most
efficient option. We calculate the emissions of our own ships and time-chartered ships, and our
fleet of road tankers under Scope 1, and the emissions of service providers that transport our
products under Scope 3.To reduce emissions from our own road-tanker fleets at Petronord subsidiaries and Thomas Silvey, our logistics policy is to invest in latest-model vehicles with energy-efficient engines and to carry out training programs for fuel-efficient driving. At OIL! Tankstellen, road
tankers from reputable third-party companies with fuel-efficient fleets are contracted to deliver
fuel to the service stations.
With regard to marine transport at Mabanaft, we have included emissions from chartered
vessels, but not from vessels that were chartered by third parties, as these are beyond our scope
of influence.
In 2016, Mabanaft chartered 94 seagoing vessels (2015: 60), 2,141 barges (2015: 1,873), 18,138
tank trucks (2015: 13.388), and 366 railcars (2015: 266). When chartering seagoing vessels,
Mabanaft takes the energy efficiency of the ships into consideration.

Fig. 17: Transport-related CO2e emissions by mode of
transportation
The annual CO2e emissions arising from the transport of our products are shown in Fig. 17. To
calculate the CO2e emissions, emission factors were used wherever data on total consumption
was available. For transport using third parties, we chose the business solution of the Ecological
Transport Information Tool (EcoTransIT) as the most informative and detailed procedure. The tool
allows a calculation based on the cargo volume and the loading and unloading ports. EcoTransIT
was developed by the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research (IFEU) in Heidelberg, the
Öko-Institut (Institute for Applied Ecology) in Berlin, and the Ingenieurgesellschaft für Verkehr und
Eisenbahntechnik (IVE mbH, a consulting company for traffic and railway engineering) in Hannover.

Emissions from Business Travel
Due to the international nature of our business, our employees sometimes have to travel by air.

G4-EN19

Our goal is to plan the safest and fastest possible routes and to keep air travel to a minimum. In
2016, employees of Marquard & Bahls and its subsidiaries circumnavigated the earth 777 times
by airplane (2015: 836 times).
CO2 emissions from air travel were calculated by Atmosfair gGmbH based on data provided by
Marquard & Bahls. This comprehensive method takes into account the effects of different air
pollutants at high altitudes, as well as the aircraft, engine types, and booking class. In 2016, groupwide emissions from air travel amounted to 11,025 tons of CO2e (2015: 11.592*). This is a reduction of 4.9 percent compared to 2015. Last year’s CO2 emissions from unavoidable air travel from
by Marquard & Bahls employees and subsidiary employees in the headquarters are being offset

* After publication of the Sustainability Report 2015, air travel emissions had to be corrected from 9,886 to 11.592 tons. Thereby,
emissions in 2015 did not decrease but increase compared to 2014 (10,959 tons). The same applied to circumnavigations of
the earth, which had to be corrected to 836.

by purchasing Certified Emission Reduction (CER) certificates from the Marquard & Bahls subsidiary Carbonbay.
Company cars used primarily for business purposes, such as those of the OIL! Tankstellen field
staff, are included in Scope 1. Company cars that are predominantly used privately were not
included in our emissions calculations. We are also reviewing measures to further reduce the CO2e
emissions caused by business travel. One possibility is to further expand the video-conferencing
systems that were installed in many of the conference rooms at the new Marquard & Bahls headquarters.

Ozone-depleting Emissions
G4-EN20

Apart from volatile organic compounds (VOCs), our activities do not cause significant emissions of
nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides or ozone-depleting substances, which are mainly emitted upstream
in the value chain during cooling or flaring processes. VOCs at our tank terminals are mainly
produced through evaporations from tanks (tank breathing) and during loading and unloading.
Because of their negative impact on human health and the environment, we care about minimizing VOCs emissions. For this reason, internal floating roofs have been installed on the vast majority
of tanks containing volatile products. The floating roofs prevent evaporation by covering the surface of the liquid. Other techniques used by Oiltanking to reduce emissions are vapor balancing,
vapor treatment, and vapor recovery systems, which have been installed at many sites. The engineering team at Oiltanking is currently developing a new specification for the construction of new
tank terminals and extensions, with an even stronger focus on reducing VOCs.
The emission of VOCs was calculated at 27 Oiltanking sites in 2016. The measured quantity of
VOCs emitted in relation to the tank terminal activity was 37.2 g per ton of throughput (2015:
35.2 g/ton). The data is based on complex calculations, as the emissions are highly dependent
on various factors such as the vapor pressure of the product, the size, paint, and insulation of
tanks, the average ambient temperature, and the efficiency of the vapor recovery system. A special
infrared gas detection camera has been purchased by the Group Function HSSE, and can be used
by the European tank terminals to detect escaping VOCs. Our German tank terminals in particular
used the camera regularly in 2016. In this way, even the smallest gas leaks can be identified and
repaired, further minimizing emissions.

Ships are often the most environmentally friendly mode of transport. Nevertheless, since ships

G4-EN21

often use sulfurous bunker fuel, transport generates significant volumes of nitrogen oxides (NOx)
and sulfur oxides (SOx). NOx and SOx can significantly contribute to environmental problems such
as acidification, eutrophication (nutrient enrichment) and summer smog, and are among the substances that are toxic for humans. In 2016, the ships we chartered emitted 1,022 tons of nitrogen
oxides (NOx) (2015: 2,050 tons) and 677 tons of Sulphur dioxide (SO2) (2015: 1,110 tons). In addition, 64 tons of non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) (2015: 114 tons) and 97 tons of particulate
matter (PM) (2015: 132 tons) were emitted during the marine transport of products, meaning that
the emissions of all of these substances have been reduced. These figures are based on the IFEU
Ecotransit method, which was also used to calculate the CO2e emissions caused by third-party
transport.

Climate Protection Initiatives
Fuel cards that contribute to climate protection
We are aware that petroleum products have a negative impact on the environment, and therefore
work to develop alternatives and to improve energy efficiency. That is why, for customers who

G4 DMA,
G4-EN27

are willing to contribute to protecting the environment, we have already introduced the option
of supporting afforestation projects and CO2 capture. Customers can , for example, use the OIL!
KlimaCard to support the ProKlima initiative and its reforestation projects in Germany with every
liter of fuel they buy. The customer’s contribution (1.25 cents per liter) is matched by OIL! to
double the impact. Our subsidiary BWOC has also set up a program that offers customers with a
fuel card the ability to capture emissions from fuels they have purchased by making a contribution
to reforestation projects. In any case, 10 percent of the emissions bought with a BWOC Green
Card are captured in carbon capture projects, paid for by BWOC customers can decide whether
they want to pay extra to capture an additional 40 percent or 90 percent of the CO2. Since 2010,
BWOC has reforested a total of 155 hectares of land with 200,000 trees, thereby compensating
43,000 tons of CO2. At mid-year, BWOC sold a large part of its customer base in the fuel-card business, including Green Card customers. As a new customer base is currently being built, no further
trees were financed and planted in 2016 via the Green Card.

Initiative Pro Klima
In 2008, Mabanaft, Petronord, and OIL! Tankstellen launched the Initiative Pro Klima. Its efforts
focus on three areas: offering energy-efficient products; providing consultation on environmental
and energy issues; and promoting projects to protect the climate. Its projects concentrate on two
activities – reforestation and climate research. In collaboration with the Schleswig-Holstein State
Forestry and the Schutzgemeinschaft Deutscher Wald e. V. (German Forest Protection Association), more than 147,000 trees have already been planted in recent years. In addition to producing oxygen and capturing CO2, forests improve the water storage capacity of the soil, prevent
erosion, and are home to a great diversity of plants and animals. The sustainable cultivation of

G4-EN27

the areas is ensured by the German Federal Forest Act and by participation in the leading forest
certification systems of the Program for Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes (PEFC) and
the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC).

New trees for Klövensteen forest in Schleswig-Holstein
As part of the Initiative Pro Klima, a planting day was organized in Klövensteen forest on November 4, 2016, during which
a total of 10,000 saplings were planted. Numerous representatives from the companies involved, as well as children from
surrounding kindergartens, grabbed a spade to plant the first saplings under the instruction of foresters. At the instigation
of the subsidiaries OIL! Tankstellen and Klindworth-Kronol Energie, 5,000 of the 10,000 deciduous trees were financed by the
Initiative Pro Klima (IPK). The planting action took place under the slogan “Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein plant drinking
water” by Klimapatenschaft GmbH in cooperation with Trinkwasserwald e.V. and the Klövensteen district forest service. The
aim is to support the formation of groundwater by planting deciduous trees, which do not have leaves in winter, allowing
larger quantities of water to enter the forest floor.

Renewable Energy & Alternative Products
Biogas
Mabagas produces biogas from organic residues and waste. The focus is on operating the biogas
plant in Namakkal, India. This facility exclusively uses organic waste, chicken manure, and agricultural residues. In 2016 alone, approx. 14,000 tons of chicken manure and more than 40,000 tons
of residues from sugar starch production were used to produce biogas for energy generation,
covering the energy needs of more than 3,000 households. The fermentation residues produced
in the process are separated, dried in the sun and then marketed as fertilizer under the brand
AYSWARYAM. Productivity at the biogas plant in Namakkal increased significantly in 2016. To
increase both electricity and fertilizer production, Mabagas invested in increasing the efficiency of
the gas engines and new feed-in technology for loading the fermenters.

Biofuels
In Germany, Bio-CNG is sold at OIL! service stations. The Bio-CNG is made from 100 percent residual and waste materials and was available at 11 OIL! stations in 2016.

Envir o nmental Pr otectio n

Wood Pellets
Wood pellets have been part of Mabanaft’s product portfolio for several years. Burning wood for
energy is CO2-neutral and therefore has less impact on climate change than fossil fuels, as it only
emits the CO2 that was previously stored in the tree. Mabanaft decided to discontinue sales of
wood pellets at the end of 2016 in its wholesale branch of Mabanaft Deutschland, while it is still
part of the product portfolio in the end-consumer business of Petronord.

Premium KlimaPlus Heating Oil
Since 2016, with the Premium KlimaPlus fuel oil, our subsidiary Petronord has been offering
a product that ensures CO2 emissions from heating plants are reduced by the use of climate-friendly
technologies elsewhere. The volume of CO2 produced by the combustion of the quantity of
Premium KlimaPlus heating oil ordered is calculated, and a corresponding number of carbon credits
is purchased to offset it. The proceeds from the purchase of the carbon credits are used to support climate-protection projects to reduce emissions. These funds are decisive in operating and
maintaining these climate protection projects. For our Petronord Premium KlimaPlus heating oil,
the certificates are issued for our Mabagas biogas plant in the Namakkal region of India.

Our waste based biogas plant in Namakkal, South India
Carbon trading makes it possible for CO2 emissions-reducing technologies to be
used where it makes most economic sense, as in Namakkal, India, pictured here.

Carbon Trading
Mabanaft’s portfolio of carbon-offsetting projects, developed as part of emissions trading, was
pooled in the subsidiary Carbonbay at the end of 2013. The company further increased the
annual emissions reductions of its portfolio. At the end of 2016, the total volume of CO2 saved was
200,000 tons. The certificates traded on the market were generated by hydropower plants in Peru,
the solar water heater program in India, the wind farm in Costa Rica, and – for the first time – the
IOT Mabagas biogas plant in Namakkal, India.

Conservation of Natural Water Resources
G4-EN8

Water is a precious resource whose value becomes even more evident in view of climate change
and the droughts it has brought, especially in the poorest countries of the world. That is why
it is important to us to use the water required for our operational processes efficiently, and to
minimize our negative impact on the water quality. In 2016, the company’s water consumption
amounted to 930,732 m³ (2015: 857,061 m³*). The increase is due, among other things, to the
commissioning of new sites and increased hydrostatic testing of storage tanks at Oiltanking.

G4-DMA

Most of the water used is attributable to tank terminal activities. Our tank terminals use fresh
water for the cleaning of tanks, hydrostatic tank tests, steam, and sanitary facilities in the offices.
At 28.9 l/m³ in 2016, the relative water consumption for tank storage activities per m³ of storage
capacity (Fig. 18) reflected a significant year-on-year increase of 30.6 percent (2015: 22.1 l/m³). The
reason is, as already stated above, an increase in the industrial process water and surface water
used by hydrostatic testing of new tanks at some tank terminals, which, however, do not lead to
any additional pollution because the water can be reused as industrial water after completion of
the tests. Measures for operational maintenance, including cleaning and painting of tanks, as well
as fire protection measures, such as fire extinguishing, and filling low-water tanks, also contributed

69

Envir o nmental Pr otectio n

Unfortunately, this means that we once again failed to progress towards our goal of further
reducing relative water consumption at Oiltanking, especially drinking water, but we will continue
to work on this in the future. To do this, we have integrated water management into Oiltanking’s
Energy Saving Program. Areas where water consumption can be minimized include tank cleaning,
vapor production in boiler operations, and sanitary facilities. At local level, e.g. in India, we are also
examining the possibility of replacing the drinking water currently used for industrial activities
with rainwater, and recycling our cleaning or cooling water. At OIL! Tankstellen service stations,
older car-washing facilities – usually owned by the station operator – are gradually being replaced
by water-saving models. The following section on “Waste & Wastewater Management” contains
information about the disposal of wastewater.

Waste & Wastewater Management
We encourage our employees around the world to produce as little waste and wastewater as
possible. Our basic principle of waste and wastewater management is based on the “4 Rs”:
reduce, reuse, recycle and recover.

Reduce

Generate less waste

Reuse

Reuse material in its original form

Recycle

Convert waste into usable material

Recover

Extract materials or energy from waste
Unavoidable residual waste

Waste Production
Since office waste plays a minor role at our company, two types of waste are generally relevant
for us: hazardous waste and industrial waste. Under hazardous waste, we include all waste with
physical properties such as flammability, toxicity or corrosiveness, which require special recycling
and disposal, usually in accordance with country-specific requirements. Under industrial waste we
include all waste not normally found in households, such as scrap metal and rubble.
In 2016, total waste generated by the Group amounted to 50,653 tons, of which 50.2 percent was
industrial waste and 49.8 percent hazardous waste (Fig. 19). The significant year-on-year increase
in waste volume of 32.6 percent (2015: 38,203 tons*) is mainly due to the tank terminal activities
at Oiltanking.

* After publication of the Sustainability Report 2015, the company‘s waste had to be corrected from 39,761 to 38,203 tons.

Fig. 19: Total waste by type (in tons)
At Oiltanking, a significant relative increase is also seen in the ratio of hazardous waste in relation
to total storage capacity in our tank storage activities, from 2015 (0.98 kg/m³) to 2016 (1.39 kg/m³).
This increase is explained by the fact that the tank cleaning described above primarily affects the
amount of hazardous waste generated. The number of tank cleanings can vary widely from year to
year, which is reflected in fluctuating annual values.

Handling and Disposal of Waste
G4-DMA

Most of the hazardous waste at our plants consists of contaminated water from oil-water
separators and residues from tank cleaning. It is collected and processed by us or by licensed
contractors. In the case of soil contamination by products, the soil must be excavated and treated
as hazardous waste. In 2016, over 20 percent of the hazardous waste was recycled. Our industrial
waste is mainly caused by construction activity. Since this often consists of packaging and metals,
the recycling rate is usually higher. In 2016 the rate was 35 percent.

Wastewater Production
G4-EN22

The total amount of industrial wastewater discharged in 2016 was 601,026 m³ (2015: 589,549 m³)
and was therefore stable. Apart from hydrostatic testing, wastewater is produced by tank
cleaning. This figure also includes the rainwater collected from the tank pits, so there can be

Envir o nmental Pr otectio n

meteorological fluctuations. Residues from wastewater processing are classified as hazardous waste and are pumped out by vacuum trucks, treated by external companies, and usually
recycled.
At our dry bulk terminal in Davant, where pet coke and coal are stored, large quantities of rainwater are collected and discharged into public drainage channels after their pH is automatically
monitored, and improved as needed. For this reason, we do not include these volumes in the
overall statistic.

Wastewater Treatment and Disposal
All of our service stations and our tank terminals use oil-water separators or complex wastewater

G4-DMA

treatment systems to process wastewater. Samples are regularly taken to monitor the functioning of the wastewater systems and to ensure that safety values are adhered to. At some tank
terminals, gravity oil-water separators are combined with coalescing filters, skimmers, activated
charcoal filters, or strippers to fulfill all requirements. After treatment and testing, the water at
Oiltanking is mainly disposed of in the surface water, and discharged into the public sewage
system at OIL! Tankstellen.

Biodiversity
Biodiversity encompasses the diversity of species as well as genetic diversity and the diversity of ecosystems. Humankind threatens biodiversity in a variety of ways. Habitat destruction,
over-exploitation, introduction of alien species, and climate change are just some of the reasons
for the decline in the diversity of species and genes. Industrial usage can also inﬂuence or diminish
biodiversity in many ways. In our core business, we potentially impact it mainly through the
construction of new tank terminals. Our HSSE management system requires a site-specific environmental assessment before the start of construction of new tank terminals or major expansions.
The environmental impact assessments, which are required by law in most countries, include a
thorough assessment of the direct and indirect impact on biodiversity. As another preventive
measure, the groundwater is checked monthly with corresponding measurement technology
at all relevant Oiltanking tank terminals. The data obtained in this way is analyzed centrally by
environmental experts.

Our Employees
Our employees are our greatest asset because they enable our company’s
success. We strive to be a fair employer and support continued business
growth by recruiting qualified employees and offering them a varied,
healthy work environment.

Priorities in HR
We encourage our employees to take responsibility, promote equal opportunities and diversity,

G4-DMA

and invest in our employees’ professional development. Short decision paths and entrepreneurial
thought and action set us apart. Although we act as independent business areas, we are linked in
a strategic network. We strive to cultivate a shared “Marquard & Bahls feeling” while still preserving
the companies’ respective cultures. These priorities are anchored in Marquard & Bahls’ strategic
approach and are fleshed out with specific measures and programs in our HR work. The tasks and
responsibilities involved are divided between the regional and central HR teams. One important
task of HR is to support the operating divisions in all personnel-related matters.

Shaping Change
We continue to focus on future-oriented, active HR work and the building of skills to keep up
with the company’s strong growth in recent years. We are always on the lookout for talented
employees with new ideas, whom we seek to retain and support long-term. The Group Function HR
supports change within the organization with custom-made projects, programs and management
development. Last year, in addition to the group-wide FUEL trainee program and the dual-study
program, further development programs for managers were carried out; succession planning was
also expanded. International cooperation and cross-departmental and cross-company projects
are reflected in an increased number of international assignments.

Our Employees in Numbers
Mirroring the strong operational growth at Marquard & Bahls, the number of employees has
increased steadily in the past, though headcount has fallen slightly in the past three years due,
among other things, to restructuring in the EPC sector and the sale of companies. In 2016 – including employees from all non-consolidated and affiliated companies – we employed 8,081 people at
year-end, and 8,198 employees on average (2015: 8,417). The average number of employees per
calendar year was used as a basis for calculating the indicators in this chapter.

Employee Turnover
As a family-owned business that cherishes tradition, we greatly value long-term relationships. This
is also reflected in our commitment to retain talented employees long-term whenever possible.
Continuous education and training are therefore an integral part of our HR work. Our company’s
growth strategy and natural turnover through retirement or other changes in employees’ personal
lives also require systematic recruitment of new employees from the labor market.
In accordance with the requirements of the GRI, we define the turnover rate as the number of
employees who left the company voluntarily, were dismissed, or retired, in proportion to the
average number of employees during the reporting period. In 2016, a total of 1.497 employees
left the company, representing a turnover rate of 18.3 percent (2015: 20.8 percent). Of these,
541 employees left the company due to dismissal or company sales, 165 due to an expiring contract, 705 at their own request, 40 due to retirement, and 46 on other grounds. Meanwhile, 1,286
new employees were hired. By company (Fig. 22), the highest turnover rate last year was seen at
Newsco (38.9 percent), reflecting a sharp reduction in drilling activity in North America.
Business-related adjustments were also necessary in the bulk-materials handling business, the

of incapacity of any kind, including work-related injury or illness. Permitted leave absences such as
holidays, study, maternity or paternity leave and compassionate leave are excluded.
In 2016, the overall absence rate was 2.3 percent (2015: 1.6 percent), an increase compared to
the previous year. The highest rates of absence were recorded in Germany and Europe. Since
we regard this value as an indicator of our employees’ health and satisfaction, we will continue
to monitor it closely and derive measures, if necessary. The section on “Equal Opportunity,” for

Education & Training
To ensure that the right employees are available at the right sites at the right time, we systematically promote our employees’ professional expertise and abilities, and train next-generation
talent. We intend to further expand and systemize our training programs in the future. In 2016, for
instance, Marquard & Bahls held its first junior staff workshop on the integration of sustainability
aspects into the daily routine, for junior staff.

Personal and Professional Development
We care about the personal and professional development of all employees. That is why we feel it
is very important to learn by performing practical tasks in the workaday routine, supplemented by
deep-dive activities, e.g. in projects as well as by participating in seminars and coaching. The latter
range from professional corporate training to IT seminars and language classes, to workshops on
intercultural communication or time management.

We also offer our executives group-wide management development opportunities. These include
the three programs “GMC” for members of the Group Management Committee, “GLUE” for the
management level below the GMC across the group, and “PILOT”, which is targeted at first-line
leaders around the world. Collaboration at Group level and leadership are of great importance in
times of change. Other key elements of the three programs are the introduction to management
tools, organizational development and change management, exercises to deepen the Group’s
shared understanding of leadership and values, as well as measures to promote the feedback
culture. In 2016, the programs for top management and new leaders (first-line leaders) were
further rolled out. A total of 79 employees participated in the three different programs GMC, GLUE
and PILOT.

Training Junior Staff
G4-LA10

Training the next generation of staff is important to us for two reasons: We see it as part of our
social responsibility to offer young people sound training in a family business and to accompany
them in the first steps of their professional life. At the same time, we ensure that we regularly
attract motivated young people. At the end of their training, our young talents possess valuable
know-how that new employees from the outside have to spend many years acquiring. We deliberately do not train according to a quota, but according to the needs of our business areas. We train
young people in three forms: apprenticeship, dual-study program and the FUEL trainee program.
In the course of 2016, we had 17 trainees under contract (2015: 15 trainees), and 12 dual-study
participants in Germany (2015: 12). Our international trainee program FUEL – my FUture in Energy
& Logistics – offers university graduates hands-on vocational training in various professions and
across national borders. In 2016, 15 FUEL trainees started worldwide, three of them in Germany.
Our subsidiaries had 40 trainees in training, of which our subsidiary IOT alone accounted for
17 as part of a local trainee program (2015: 94 trainees). The decline results from fewer trainees
that started in 2016 due to the fact that the programs are perennial.

Labor Standards
G4-11,
G4-DMA

We abide by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN protocols, protecting human
rights within our sphere of influence. Compliance with the standards of the ILO is laid down in our
Code of Conduct. We respect employee rights and guarantee our employees both freedom of
association and the right to collective bargaining. Our employees are organized in trade unions in
various countries, including Argentina, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Malta. In the event
of changes in our operations, we work closely with the relevant social partners.
As an international company, our working hours reflect local requirements and best practices. We
usually hire our employees under full-time contracts for indefinite periods.

Fair Wages and Salaries
One of our fundamental interests is to employ the best employees, so it is a matter of course for
us to pay our employees fairly. This remuneration practice applies to all employees, whether they
are employed full-time or on a temporary basis. We also operate in low-wage countries. Here, a in
other countries, no rules for minimum wages have been set at a regional level.

81

Our Em ployees

We pay competitive salaries combining fixed and variable components. The Marquard & Bahls
Code of Conduct specifies that salaries shall be regulated based solely on qualifications, performance, and other work-related factors such as responsibility, skill, and experience. Factors such
as gender, nationality, or age have no influence on salaries. In addition to the base salary, we
voluntarily offer supplementary benefits, which are calculated on the basis of the basic salary.
These supplementary benefits are partly dependent on performance.

Company Pension
The state pension is one of the main pillars of people’s retirement arrangements, but it rarely fully
covers their financial needs in old age. Our employees’ future is very important to us, so at many
subsidiaries and in many countries we offer a voluntary, additional employer-financed company
pension.

Sound family finance
Oiltanking in Cartagena, Colombia, organized a workshop for its
employees to encourage awareness in handling money and to provide
practical tips for families.

Equal Opportunity
We see diversity as a key to success, both in our lines of business and among our employees.
We aim to further increase diversity within our company by employing both male and female
employees from many different cultures. Employees from 62 nations work for us around the
world. With a rate of 0.75 percent, we do not meet Germany’s quota requirements for the
employment of disabled people as set out in the Social Security Statutes Book (SGB IX), and therefore make appropriate compensation payments.

Although more and more women are choosing careers in our industry, the oil and energy sector
is still largely dominated by men, especially in operational areas of activity. In 2016, the proportion
of female employees in our workforce was 15.7 percent, which represents a 9.7-percent yearon-year increase (2015: 14.3 percent). We still receive far more applications from men than from
women for technical positions. When recruiting junior employees, the Group Function HR tries to
maintain a balance between male and female candidates. At job fairs we specifically try to encourage female talent to join us. We also take care to ensure a balanced ratio in our executive training
programs.
All employees can anonymously report cases of discrimination, harassment or other violations of
the Code of Conduct to the Code of Conduct team and via the new CARE platform at any time. In
2016, no whistleblowing cases were reported that related to discrimination or harassment.

Work-Life Balance
We believe that a good work-life balance contributes to the wellbeing and performance of our
employees. We are aware that this balance can sometimes be difficult to achieve. That is why we
provide targeted offers to promote a healthy work-life balance – primarily in Germany to date.

Working-Time Models
G4-LA3

To enable more flexible working hours and promote a healthy work-life balance, some countries use various models such as part-time, working-time accounts and trust-based working
time. Worldwide, part-time contracts accounted for 3.8 percent of all employment contracts in
2016 (2015: 2.8 percent). There are also working-time models to encourage employees to return
to work after parental leave. On average, a total of 49 employees at the German sites were on
parental or maternity leave in 2016 (2015: 47); 43 percent of them were men. Our sites worldwide
indicated that 59 employees were on parental leave.

Employee Assistance Program
Five years ago, as part of our efforts to offer employees support in various life situations,
Marquard & Bahls signed a contract for an external Employee Assistance Program (EAP). These
consultants can be contacted 24/7 regarding practical, legal or emotional matters, professional or
personal. The consultants analyze the situation and support employees with further steps – strictly
confidentially and anonymously, of course. This service is available to all employees in Germany as
well as to family members living in the household.

Our Em ployees

A total of 49 new cases were recorded last year, which corresponds to a utilization rate of
6.4 percent (2015: 11.8 percent). This figure is still slightly above the provider’s average. The proportion of work-related topics was 28 percent (2015: 13 percent); the remaining requests related
to personal matters.

Family-friendly Employer
For employees in Hamburg, we offer a variety of attractive measures to encourage a healthy
work-life balance. These include vacation care for the children of employees, a cooperation with a
children’s day-care center, and parties for children and families. Many of our worldwide locations
have also carried out events, projects and measures to promote a healthy work-life balance.

Fun for kids
The Marquard & Bahls children‘s party on November 12, 2016 took place at the Schwarze Berge Animal Park, where
children of Hamburg-based employees spent an exciting afternoon scouting out wolves, lynxes, deer and other animals.
Oiltanking Antwerp also hosted a family event. The Kidz Playground holiday-care program in Hamburg helps parents
cope during the school holidays.

Employee Satisfaction
To regularly review employee satisfaction, staff talks and surveys are performed at a local level.
In 2016, many of our Oiltanking, Skytanking and Mabanaft sites conducted employee surveys on
paper, electronically, or via formal staff talks. We encourage all of our companies to carry out
employee surveys, as they are a good tool for measuring the employees’ commitment and job
satisfaction.
In March 2017, we invited all of our employees around the world to participate in our latest
stakeholder survey on sustainability issues for the first time. Many of them used the survey to
give valuable feedback to the company. We see this as an indicator to introduce further surveys,
beyond established channels such as the whistleblowing system for breaches of the Code of
Conduct, and the feedback box at the company headquarters in Hamburg.

We give priority to health & safety,
identify potential risks and take
measures to monitor, limit and
prevent hazards. We promote a
proactive safety culture and
optimize all our activities with
regard to technical, organizational
and behavioral safety.

87

Occupatio nal He alth & S afety

Occupational Health & Safety
Excellence in occupational health and safety is one of our five company
values, and therefore a fundamental component of our strategic
approach. As part of our sustainability strategy, it is our declared goal
to continually improve all our activities in connection with technical,
organizational, and behavioral safety and to be a model for the industry
in the area of occupational health and safety.

Instruments & Measures
Due to the variety of activities in the Group, it is important to evaluate the associated risks individually. Based on this analysis, systematically customized solutions are developed and implemented.
One important measure is the creation of comprehensive HSSE manuals that are specifically
tailored to the respective subsidiaries. The manuals also serve as a basis for the sites to develop
appropriate local management systems. One central instrument for learning from accidents is a
global incident database across all subsidiaries. To prevent incidents and their reoccurrence, all
accidents, incidents, near misses and unsafe acts and conditions are carefully analyzed. If necessary, HSSE alerts are being prepared, distributed worldwide and discussed with employees and,
if necessary with contractors. To be able to respond even quicker to developments in HSSE key
performance indicators in the future, a dashboard application is currently being programmed
that provides daily data and enables even more detailed analyses. We monitor compliance with
our internal standards by regularly performing internal HSSE audits at our sites, especially at
Oiltanking, Skytanking and UBT. Detailed HSSE statistics with “leading” (forward-looking) and
“lagging” (retrospective) KPIs are also prepared for each Oiltanking and Skytanking site. Communications measures that increase risk awareness in the daily work support our proactive approach.
To promote a constructive HSSE discourse, once a year HSSE managers from Oiltanking locations worldwide convene for a week to discuss current matters, exchange ideas and experiences,
and create synergies. HSSE is also a fixture on the agenda of Oiltanking’s annual Management
Meeting. Skytanking also holds international HSSE meetings as part of its annual global management meetings.

Annual HSSE meeting
In September 2016, Oiltanking’s HSSE managers from around the world met in Hamburg for
three days of HSSE exchange and networking.

Since 2008, we have given out awards for Best HSSE Performance (Golden Lighthouse) and Best
HSSE Improvement (White Lighthouse), to honor our Oiltanking sites’ efforts to work in a safe and
environmentally friendly way. The award criteria include workplace accidents, fires & explosions,
product releases, product contaminations, material damages, and reporting (quality, timeliness,
and near misses). In 2016, both awards went to Singapore, the Golden Lighthouse to Oiltanking
Helios Singapore again, and the White Lighthouse to the joint venture chemical tank terminal
Oiltanking Odfjell Singapore.

Preventive Healthcare
G4-LA2

In addition to the statutory health checkups, many of our sites around the world offer preventive
medical checkups. Beyond this, in 2016 many Oiltanking and Skytanking sites conducted health
and education campaigns on a variety of topics. The Marquard & Bahls headquarters also has a
wide range of health-promoting offers, including a free fitness area, ergonomic office equipment,
and nutritionally balanced choices in the company restaurant.

Occupatio nal He alth & S afety

HSSE Training
Our company HSSE Policy requires that all employees receive job-related training and tutorials.
This includes tutorials on the risks inherent in dealing with the products that are stored and
handled at our sites. New employees as well as contractors are instructed in matters of HSSE before
taking up their work. Any persons who have to perform potentially dangerous tasks receive specific
training. OIL! Tankstellen has produced a comprehensive training video that covers all aspects
of HSSE at service stations and provides practical guidelines for meeting the requirements. The
video is made available to all station partners. At Oiltanking and Skytanking, a total of 544,208
HSSE training hours were completed in 2016 (2015: 327,871 hours). For example, at Oiltanking in
2016, all operational employees received an average of 78 hours of HSSE training (2015: 71 hours).
The increase in training hours is owed in part to an intensive training program carried out last year
for our employees at selected terminals.

Trainings for oil spill preparedness
Employees on the tank terminal in Kotka South, Finland, practice an emergency oil spill and
deployment of an oil boom.

Workplace Accidents
G4-LA6

In 2016, across the group there were 80 accidents resulting in lost work days that involved our own
employees (2015: 85). These accidents resulted in a total of 1,828 lost work days (2015: 2,118).
Absences due to commuting accidents or non-work-related illnesses are not included in these
figures. Another 33 accidents, which were reported to us, involved employees of contracted
external companies (2015: 34). The relative frequency of accidents that resulted in lost work days
could therefore be further reduced last year, and the global average was 4.0 hours per 1 million
hours worked (2015: 4.7; Fig. 26). Most of the accidents in 2016 occurred during loading and
unloading operations at tank terminals, and while aircraft fuelling. Additional reviews (“deep dives”)
are performed by the Group Function HSSE and Oiltanking Assets & Operations at locations with
a below-average HSSE performance, and specific short-term and long-term measures are derived.
In this connection, we have launched various initiatives at Oiltanking to improve the safety culture,
e.g. workshops with senior executives and HSSE managers, the introduction of a worldwide “Safety
Day” in March 2017, safety walks by the management, and Personal Safety Plans. In addition, the
“Golden HSSE Rules” for Oiltanking were developed in 2016, which were rolled out at the beginning
of 2017. Skytanking introduced “Golden Safety Rules” in 2016, which were presented at an HSSE

Fig. 26: Number of accidents resulting in lost work days that
involved our own employees, per 1 million working hours
We define the severity of accidents based on the average number of lost work days per employee
incident. Across the Group, the average severity of accidents in 2016 was 22.9 lost work days
per accident (2015: 25.0), which means that the severity of workplace accidents could be further
reduced in 2016.
We are also always working to improve HSSE standards for our contractors. To this end,
Oiltanking’s contractor program, which includes a safety manual and a global, web-based database, was further intensified. The good news is that these increased efforts at Oiltanking have
shown successes and that the number of accidents has decreased year-on-year. In addition, there
were no fatal contractors’ accidents in connection with our activities.

Occupatio nal He alth & S afety

Prevention of Fires
Past incidents in our industry have shown that technical measures, organizational processes, and
rules of conduct are not always sufficient to prevent fires. Oiltanking has prepared a mandatory
Fire Protection Standard consisting of 72 rules that often go beyond legal requirements, to ensure
adequate protection against fire and its escalation.
In 2016, there were 21 small fires, thereof two small explosions (2015: 31 fires). The explosions
were very contained events in an electrical cabinet and a vehicle battery during maintenance in a
workshop. There were no injuries in any of the cases. The absolute frequency of fires has therefore
decreased. Moreover, they mostly occurred on construction sites and not at our tank terminal
operations, and remained closely confined to the local area. However, altogether these incidents
resulted in 128,300 euros of damage (2015: 29,924 euros).

Noise
Noise can have a negative impact on the working environment, local residents, and wildlife. We
therefore aim to minimize noise production wherever possible. Potential sources of noise include
pumps, generators, and industrial vehicles. We reduce noise through better maintenance and
shielding, but also by replacing aging equipment. Apart from this, noise protection is part of the
mandatory personal protective equipment wherever speciﬁed noise limits are exceeded.

Safety on Business Trips
Many of our employees travel frequently as part of their work for Marquard & Bahls. Travel safety
is therefore an important issue on our HSSE agenda. In order to provide the best medical advice
and services for employees on their travels, as well as for expats, Marquard & Bahls has signed a
service contract with International SOS, the leading provider of medical assistance, international
healthcare, and security services. To support our employees in planning international business
trips, there is also a group-wide manual on travel safety and a web-based airline-vetting database
that is updated daily.

Corporate Citizenship
In accordance with our values and our sustainability strategy, it is
important to us to contribute to the well-being of our surrounding communities. We therefore support the communities in the form of financial
support and voluntary work by our employees, in our five defined focus
areas.

Our Engagement in Numbers
In 2016, Marquard & Bahls and its subsidiaries spent a total of 567,234 euros on charitable
purposes (2015: 438,121 euros), of which 480,056 euros was donated and 87,178 euros was in
the form of sponsorship. In addition, numerous employees worldwide volunteered 4,536 hours of
work for various initiatives and projects (2015: 3,939 hours).
In a breakdown by companies, Oiltanking was once again the Group’s biggest donor in 2016
(Fig. 27), which is explained partly by the nature of its operations and its closeness to the
surrounding communities. Oiltanking also has the highest number of employees in the Marquard &
Bahls group: it accounts for 50 percent of the Group’s total workforce, which is reflected in its
52.3 percent share of donations. Broken down by topical focus, the largest share of donations
went to projects in the fields of Education and Culture & Sports (Fig. 28).

Beach Cleanups to Protect Daya Bay in China
G4-15

Marine pollution is a serious and primarily man-made global problem. Oiltanking Daya Bay, a
coastal terminal in China, has identified marine pollution as a local challenge. For this reason,
the terminal teamed up with the local Marine
Conservation Volunteer Service to organize
marine environmental protection activities in
Daya Bay. About 50 employees and their families volunteered for a beach cleanup campaign
in March and December 2016, collecting trash
along the shoreline of Daya Bay.

Protecting the oceans
About 50 Oiltanking employees helped clean up the coast of
Daya Bay.

Education
Volunteering for Young Refugees in Germany
In 2016, Marquard & Bahls joined forces with a non-profit initiative in order to help improve the
situation of young refugees in Hamburg and facilitate their integration into the labor market.
As part of the JOBLINGE “Kompass” program,
Marquard & Bahls started its first language course
for young refugees on August 2, 2016. Over a
period of six weeks thirteen committed employees temporarily became language coaches
and taught up to ten Joblinge German vocabulary from their daily business life at Marquard &
Bahls headquarters. Additionally,about a dozen
employees of different departments and subsidiaries registered for the JOBLINGE mentoring
program to support a Jobling for half a year.

Mutually beneficial experiences
The language course turned out to be valuable training for both
the Joblinge participants as well as our employees.

Health
Free Medical Checkups for Local Community in Peru
In 2016, the Oiltanking terminal in Matarani (LQS) conducted three health campaigns in the community of “Villa el Pescador”. The approximately 200 inhabitants living there have limited economic
resources. Medical care for the community is
also limited, as there are no medical centers
or hospitals close by. To improve this situation,
the campaigns offered the inhabitants general
medical treatment, pediatrics, and dentistry, as
well as instruction on oral hygiene and nutrition.
Nearly all local residents received free medical
checkups, including a large number of children.

Wholly healthy
Nearly all 200 residents took advantage of the health campaigns
and received basic medical care.

former professor and composer Valeria Llaría, the
choir provides a cultural space for children aged
between four and 18 in the Punta Alta community.

kids occupied in their free time, nurtures their
musical and creative side, and improves their
vocal training – and their self-esteem, as they
have already earned some accolades from the
community. Because Oiltanking also believes

Cape Town, OTGC employees manned the soup

also distributed, along with refreshments, fruit
and treats. A bowl of soup and a piece of bread
won’t make the daily hardships of life in the community disappear. However, it is one way to show
the community that others do think and care
about them. And more importantly, the “soup
