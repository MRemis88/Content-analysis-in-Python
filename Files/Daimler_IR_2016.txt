Dear readers,
You might be familiar with the following Chinese saying: “When the
wind of change blows, some build protective walls, but others build
windmills.” Today, the wind of change is rapidly picking up speed in our
industry as well. In response, we’re not building any windmills — but
we are building vehicles that operate with innovative drive concepts.
In the period until 2025 we will launch the series production of ten new
electric cars and invest approximately E10 billion to expand our fleet
of electric vehicles.
But the electrification of the drivetrain is by no means the only change
that is challenging and inspiring us at Daimler. We’re also focusing on
digitization, autonomous driving, and new mobility concepts — especially
concepts for urban areas. Taken together, these trends represent the
biggest transformation of mobility in more than 130 years. Our aim is to
shape these changes for the benefit of our customers, business partners,
stakeholders, and employees. And in order to do that, we’re not building
any protective walls — on the contrary. At our new CASE unit, we are
addressing future-oriented topics holistically. Here we are using new and
flexible forms of cooperation such as swarm organizations.

02

Changes create not only new opportunities but also new responsibilities,
which we are emphatically taking on. In all of our activities, we behave
with integrity and take the effects on society and the environment into
account. Among the important guidelines for these activities are the
principles laid down in the UN Global Compact, the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, and the accords reached in the Paris
Agreement.
As you read this report, you will find out where we stand today and what
we plan to do in the future. Dear readers, please continue to support us
through your constructive criticism as we move into the future. We are
convinced that, thanks to our concerted efforts, the wind of change will
become a following wind that takes all of us forward together.
Best regards,

Dr. Dieter Zetsche

Materiality analysis
Our sustainability strategy also takes the expectations of our stakeholders into
account. We use a multi-step materiality analysis to identify the fields of action that
are relevant to us and to our stakeholders.
This report is oriented toward the G4 guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and
thus takes the materiality principle into account as well. We consider fields of action to
be “material” if they are important for the company as well as for our stakeholders. We use
a multi-step materiality analysis to help us determine what the different assessments, which
do not always coincide, have in common.
Specifying fields of action. We evaluate a variety of sources in order to obtain as precise a
picture of our stakeholders’ concerns as possible. This involves evaluating readers’ feedback
regarding this report; surveys of customers, employees, and interest groups; workshops
in the specialist units; dialogs with individual stakeholder groups; and events such as the
“Daimler Sustainability Dialogue.” We also conduct symposia in order to gather input from
our stakeholders, and we take into account the analyses of our News and Issues Management
team and our Society and Technology Research Group. In this way, we identify fields of action
that influence our company and that we can, in turn, influence ourselves.
Stakeholder surveys. To enable a priority ranking of the identified fields of action, we
conduct an international open stakeholder survey every two years. The target groups are
not preselected in advance. For more than one month, all interested parties can take part in
the survey on our Website at www.daimler.com, and name and evaluate topics that are
important to them. In our assessment of the results, we give special consideration to the
great significance of our primary stakeholder groups (shareholders and investors, customers,
suppliers, and employees) as well as to non-governmental organizations. We had received
more than 700 replies by the end of the last survey in the summer of 2015. The next survey
will be held in 2017.

04

Determining materiality. With the help of a materiality analysis, we compare the results of
the online survey — which in the year under review was supplemented with about 60 in-depth
interviews with sustainability experts from Germany and abroad — with those of an internal
survey of the members of our company’s sustainability bodies and of the entire Board of
Management of Daimler AG. These internal bodies discuss which topics have material effects
on our company from a social, ecological, ethical, human-rights, and economic perspective.
Consistent action. The materiality analysis shows us the areas to which we have to pay
particular attention. As a result, we further intensified our sustainability management activities in 2016, focusing particularly on the key topics of the materiality analysis, which we also
took into account when selecting topics for our annual “Daimler Sustainability Dialogue.” In
the year under review, we began to orient our sustainability strategy even more strongly toward clearly defined focus themes based on the main future-oriented topics of the materiality
analysis. We will systematically continue this process in the year ahead. The tables on the
following pages depict the fields of action that were evaluated in our last assessment in 2015.
The fields are clustered by topic and arranged in descending order according to stakeholder
priorities.

Strategy and Management
For Daimler, acting in line with the principles of sustainability means striving to achieve long-term business
success on a viable basis. To make this possible, our activities must always be in harmony with society
and the environment. One of our key tasks is to offer safe, fuel-efficient, and low-emission vehicles. We are
convinced that good sustainability management is essential so that we can remain one of the world’s
foremost automakers in the future.

Sustainability is a basic principle of our corporate strategy and
a benchmark for our business success. Our sustainability strategy
aims to be the best in the industry — and we will achieve this
goal by implementing our Target Program. We are continuously
enhancing this strategy in order to ensure that we can deal systematically with the fields of action that are also considered important
by our stakeholders.

Our understanding of sustainability

1

At Daimler, we define sustainability as responsible corporate behavior
that leads to long-term business success and strives to achieve harmony with
society and the environment.

2

We are achieving our targets by making sustainability a central benchmark of our operations. This is what we require as a mandatory state
of mind from all managers and employees at Daimler and we also promote
a strong sense of responsibility in this regard among our staff.

3

We maintain a continual dialog with our stakeholders in order to take
their points of view into account.

4

Our business partners are also expected to meet our requirements as
regards responsibility for sustainable operations.

5

Our management structures, processes, and systems are designed in
accordance with the principles of sustainability as well. All of our behavior
is based on legality and integrity.

6

As one of the world’s leading automobile manufacturers, we also seek to
be a leader when it comes to sustainability.

Our strategic approach
As a globally operating automobile manufacturer, we face industryspecific challenges whose associated opportunities need to be exploited
and whose risks need to be minimized:
–		We are committed to legal and ethical standards and strive to ensure
that they are observed within the Group worldwide as well as by our
business partners and suppliers.
–		 Road traffic contributes to the generation of CO2 and pollutant
		 emissions, which can endanger the health of pedestrians and people
		 on the road. We therefore use our power of innovation to create
		 environmentally friendly and safe vehicles that conserve resources
to the greatest extent possible. We also develop sustainable mobility
solutions and promote their profitable implementation.
–		 Our operational processes, particularly in vehicle production, are
also associated with environmental effects, which we keep as low as
possible through a system of effective environmental management.
–		 As an employer, we bear responsibility for providing fair and attractive working conditions for our 282,488 employees worldwide.
–		 As a good corporate citizen, we want to contribute to the common
good beyond the scope of our business operations and to make use
of our special competencies as we do so.

To adequately meet all of these requirements, we have developed a
Group-wide sustainability strategy, which is integrated into our corporate
strategy and makes sustainability a fundamental principle at the implementation level. This strategy relates to six main areas in which we assume responsibility: product, production, employees, ethics, society, and
business partners. In each of these areas, we focus on fields of action
that both we and our stakeholders believe are of essential importance.
We set targets, and define target indicators, for each field of action. Taken
together, all of these targets form our medium- to long-term target program. GRI G4-18
Controlling with a sustainability scorecard. We utilize a sustainability
scorecard as an instrument for controlling the key sustainability targets.
The scorecard uses a color-coded “traffic-light” system to signal needs for
action and successes based on quantitative and qualitative indicators.

Main fields of action
We regularly conduct a multi-stage materiality analysis to prioritize the
fields of action. This analysis combines our assessment with those of
our stakeholders, who include our employees, customers, shareholders,
and suppliers, as well as governments, environmental and human rights
organizations, and other interest groups from civil society. Their opinions
are also requested whenever we decide on measures for expanding or
adjusting our sustainability strategy. GRI G4-18, G4-24

Our management and organizational structures support this process
by establishing clear lines of responsibility in all business divisions. Our
sustainability objectives and their management are key components
of our corporate governance system and are also incorporated into the
target agreements between employees and managers.

Our central management committee for sustainability is the
Corporate Sustainability Board (CSB), which is headed by Renata Jungo
Brüngger (Member of the Board of Management, Integrity and Legal
Affairs) and Ola Källenius (Member of the Board of Management, Group
Research & Mercedes-Benz Cars Development). The CSB is managed
by Anke Kleinschmit (Head of Group Research and Sustainability and
Chief Environmental Officer). The operational work is done by the
Corporate Sustainability Office (CSO), which consists of representatives
of the specialist units and the business divisions.
Integrity, compliance, and legal responsibility are cornerstones of
our sustainable management approach and serve as the basis of all
our actions. In order to emphasize their strategic significance, we have
combined the responsibilities for integrity, compliance, data protection,
corporate responsibility, and legal affairs within a division headed by a
member of the Board of Management. This division helps the corporate
units to incorporate these topics on a sustained basis. As integral parts
of our corporate culture, integrity and compliance contribute to the longterm success of our company and will provide us with an even greater
competitive edge in the future. They are already a natural part of our
daily business. The basis for this is our Integrity Code, which lays down
the principles of our daily conduct, offers our employees orientation, and
helps them make the right decisions even in difficult business situations.
The Integrity Code is supplemented by other in-house principles and
policies.

Target Program

The basic guidance for our business activity is provided by the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact, with which we have a special affiliation as
a founding participant and part of its LEAD Group. Our internal principles
and guidelines are founded on this international frame of reference and
other international principles.
The House of Policies is our digital platform for policies. All internal
policies of the Group and works agreements are compiled here in a userfriendly Enterprise Regulations Database (ERD), which is accessible to
all employees. The policies are available in up to 23 languages. The House
of Policies offers a compact e-training course to employees and advice on
the local management of policies to Group companies.

Governance structures. As a stock corporation founded under German
law, the Daimler Group has a two-tier management structure that consists
of a Board of Management and a Supervisory Board. Both of these bodies
work closely together in line with the recommendations of the German
Corporate Governance Code. The requirement for sustainable corporate
management is also firmly established at this top management level, as
Board of Management remuneration is also linked to non-financial targets,
such as those related to integrity.

Quota for women almost reached. With three women on the shareholders’ side and two women on the side of the employee representatives,
Daimler has almost achieved the 30 percent quota for women on supervisory boards that is required at listed companies. Women account
for 25 percent of the members of the Board of Management. We want
women to occupy 20 percent of management positions by the year 2020.
The share of women in such positions worldwide stood at 16.8 percent
at the end of 2016.

Sustainability ratings
Independent rating agencies and research institutes conduct numerous
ratings and rankings of sharply varying quality and significance today.
Daimler therefore only supplies data for such ratings and rankings whose
assessment methodology, quality, and transparency can be subjected to
a verifiable analysis.
Top ranking in the CDLI. In 2016, the non-profit organization CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) once again put Daimler in the “leadership” category for its climate-related reporting activities. The company
was honored for outstanding commitment and exemplary transparency in
dealing with climate change. In addition, Daimler is one of the top-rated
companies of the German ranking, where it received a score of A and
the status of Index/Country Leader DAX for initiated measures, already
achieved progress, and planned strategies for the reduction of CO2
emissions.

Daimler once again achieved “Prime Investment Status” in the rating from

Stakeholder dialog
Dialog with our stakeholders is very important to us. We seek to
conduct a dialog with all stakeholder groups in order to share views

constructive manner.
Organization of the dialog. We have defined clear lines of responsibility,
communication channels, and forms of dialog for our stakeholder relationships. In addition to performing institutionalized dialog management, for
example in Investor Relations, Procurement and Corporate Communications, the Sustainability Board and the Sustainability Office coordinate the
dialog with civil society. GRI G4-26
Identification of stakeholder groups. For us, stakeholders are all parties and organizations that impose legal, financial, operational or ethical
requirements on Daimler AG. One criterion for the identification and
weighting of a stakeholder is the extent to which a person or group is
affected by our company’s decisions or can, in turn, affect these decisions. The most important stakeholders are our employees, customers,
shareholders, and investors, as well as our suppliers. However, civil
groups such as NGOs also have legitimate interests that we take into
consideration. The same applies to analysts, professional associations,
trade unions, media, scientists, and politicians as well as municipalities,
residents, and neighbors of our locations. GRI G4-24, G4-25

Stakeholder dialog media and formats. To ensure the inclusion of
our stakeholders, we utilize online and print media, questionnaires and
surveys, discussions with experts, workshops, and local and regional
dialog events, among others. In addition, we collaborate in professional
associations, committees, and sustainability initiatives. We also stage
interdisciplinary conferences, including a conference on combating
money laundering in the trade with goods, which was held in June 2016.
The Daimler Compliance Academy has also met with a very positive

Advisory Board for Integrity and Corporate Responsibility. The
Advisory Board for Integrity and Corporate Responsibility has been an
important source of input for Daimler since 2012. The Advisory Board
consists of independent external experts from the fields of science,
business and politics and from non-governmental organizations. These
experts support the integrity process at Daimler critically and constructively from an external perspective. In its three regular meetings per year,
the Advisory Board mainly holds discussions with Board of Management
members and other representatives of Daimler. Among other things,
the agenda has included discussions about human rights, methods for
measuring progress in the field of integrity, and the challenges associated
with future mobility. The members of the Advisory Board have extensive
experience in addressing ethical issues and contribute their different
points of view to the discussion of integrity. GRI G4-26, G4-27

The “Daimler Sustainability Dialogue,” which has been held annually
in Stuttgart since 2008, brings various stakeholder groups together with
representatives of our Board of Management and the executive management. The main element of the dialog is the sharing of ideas in a variety
of themed workshops. The Daimler representatives listen to the feedback
from the external participants and work together with the stakeholders
to achieve the agreed-upon targets during the following year. At the next
event, they report on the progress that has been made in the interim.
We also organize such dialog-focused events in other countries in order
to discuss local challenges and promote sustainability standards around
the world. Thus far, international “Daimler Sustainability Dialogues” have
been held in China, Japan, the US, and Argentina. During the year under
review, we held the ninth “Daimler Sustainability Dialogue” in Stuttgart.

In September 2015, all of the member countries of the United Nations approved

goals were set to address economic, social, and environmental challenges. They
are universally valid, which means they apply to developing countries as well
as to emerging markets and industrialized nations.
Daimler AG supports the implementation of the SDGs. Through our sustainable
corporate strategy and sustainability targets, we are making positive contributions to solving the global challenges of our time.

The risk management system with regard to existence, threatening and
other material risks is integrated into the value-based management and
planning system of the Daimler Group. It is an integral part of the overall
planning, management, and reporting process in the legal entities, divisions, and corporate functions. The risk management system is intended
to systematically and continually identify, assess, control, monitor, and
report risks threatening Daimler’s existence and other material risks, in
order to support the achievement of corporate targets and to enhance
risk awareness at the Group. The focus here is on industry and business
risks, company-specific risks, financial risks, risks from guarantees, legal
risks, as well as compliance and reputation risks within and outside the
company.

In order to ensure the complete presentation and assessment of existence-threatening and other material risks of the Group, as well as the
control and risk processes with regard to the corporate accounting process, Daimler has established the Group Risk Management Committee
(GRMC). In addition to dealing with fundamental and material issues
related to the design of the risk management, the committee has the
following tasks:
-		 The GRMC is responsible for the creation and design of the framework conditions relating to the organization, methods, processes,
and systems for a functional, Group-wide risk management system
		 at Daimler AG and its subsidiaries.
– 		 The GRMC regularly reviews the effectiveness and functionality of
the installed risk management processes, including the necessary
adaptations. This includes reviewing the appropriateness of the
		 organization, methods, processes, and systems. The GRMC specifies
minimum requirements relating to the design of risk management,
gives instructions for necessary and appropriate corrective measures
to eliminate possibly identified system failings or weaknesses, and
monitors their implementation. The general objective is to ensure
		 efficient and effective risk management that facilitates the early
identification of material risks and enables management to recognize
developments at an early stage and to control them by taking suitable measures.

measures that have been initiated are continually monitored. The central
Group Risk Management regularly reports the identified risks to the
GRMC, the Board of Management, and the Supervisory Board
Other initiatives established in the context of risk management are
Compliance Risk Assessment, the integrity reviews of business partners,
environmental risk analyses at our production locations, and the consideration of consumer protection issues in our quality management system.
We also conduct risk analyses related to data protection and human
rights and systematically take environmental protection into account
throughout the life cycle of our vehicles.

Local risk management plays an important role at our locations. For
example, our environmental management system ensures clear areas of
responsibility and transparent reporting at all of our production facilities
around the world. More than 98 percent of our employees work at
locations with environmental management systems certified according
to ISO 14001. In addition, we regularly conduct environmental due
diligence processes at our locations, and we are also working on a Groupwide risk management system for human rights.

For us at Daimler, integrity and ethics are not merely abstract concepts. That’s because only those who act

actions with shared values.

A culture of integrity
Integrity is one of the four corporate values that form the foundation of our business activities. A culture of integrity is the
prerequisite for remaining successful in the future. That is why
we are systematically investing in the ongoing development of
our corporate culture of integrity.
In order to further advance our culture of integrity, we conduct an ongoing and open dialog with our employees. We regularly address integrity
issues in our internal media and make a wide range of materials available
to our business units. We also value personal discussion. That is why
we regularly conduct dialog events with employees at all levels of the
hierarchy, as well as with external stakeholders. Such events are held
regularly in our markets abroad as well.
Our Integrity Code is one of the most important results of the employee
dialogs we have been conducting since 2011. The Code is based on a
shared understanding of values agreed upon with our employees and lays
out the principles for our everyday business conduct. These principles
include fairness, responsibility, mutual respect, transparency, openness,
and compliance with laws. The Code is valid throughout the Group and is
available in 23 languages. A guide is available on the Group’s intranet to
support the employees in the application of the Code in everyday situations, providing answers to frequently asked questions.

Our “Infopoint Integrity” serves as a central contact and advice center
for our employees. The Infopoint team offers advice on integrity-related

Further measures from our integrity strategy complement the range
of information and advice offered on issues related to integrity. We use
various event formats to approach these issues from different perspectives and encourage the participants to think about integrity. For example,
we conduct business simulations that enable employees to experience
and discuss the relevance of integrity to daily business operations from a
new viewpoint. We also have a network of integrity contact persons who
help the business units address their specific issues in a targeted manner.
In addition, we produce target-group-specific materials for managers who
wish to raise awareness of integrity and potential ethical dilemma situations in their departments.
The extensive range of training courses we offer is also based on
the Daimler Integrity Code. Our integrated training program is defined on
the basis of an annual planning cycle that starts with a needs analysis,
extends through the implementation of the program, and ends with a
monitoring process. Among other things, the program covers the topics
of integrity, compliance, data protection, and antitrust law. Depending
on the risk and the target group, we use classroom training or digital
learning techniques such as Web-based training courses.

Respecting and safeguarding human rights is among Daimler’s top

Our approach to respecting and safeguarding human rights is based on
the requirements of the UN Global Compact and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. In line with the expectations towards
a human rights policy in these documents, we have clearly defined what
we expect from all of our employees and business partners. These expectations are formulated in our Integrity Code, our Supplier Sustainability
Standards, and our supplier agreements. The responsibility for human
rights issues lies with the Board of Management division Integrity and
Legal Affairs.
All of our employees, especially our security officers, receive training
which includes information on respecting human rights in the course of
our Group’s business operations as stipulated within the Integrity Code. In
particular, the managers responsible for the security units are sensitized
with the compliance processes in the respect. External security personnel
are also informed about our requirements and instructions for respecting
human rights in line with our Group-wide procurement guidelines.

Our direct suppliers (Tier 1) are subject to our Supplier Sustainability Standards, which include respect for human rights. We have
formulated this contractual mandate for our suppliers, and we help
them to comply with it by providing them with targeted information
and qualification measures. The contracts for our Tier 1 suppliers
also include a mandate for them to extend Daimler’s expectations
to their own suppliers in the downstream stages of the value chain.
We use a multi-stage process to investigate whether these mandates
are being complied with. This process is based on a risk analysis
that we carry out for each country and each category of goods. The
complaints management process, which is conducted via the World
Employee Committee and other bodies, enables whistleblowers to
draw attention to possible human rights violations by suppliers. We
use communication and training measures to promote the transfer of
our standards to suppliers in downstream stages of the value chain.

Due diligence assessments through the Human Rights Respect
System. In 2016 we implemented our new Daimler Human Rights
Respect System (HRRS) in a pilot project at a selected production and
sales location. The HRRS builds on the experience of the human rights
compliance assessments of the Danish Institute for Human Rights, which
we applied in 19 countries all over the world between 2011 and 2015.
In 2016, we began to base our activities on the HRRS instead of the
Assessment.
The Human Rights Respect System is based on the UN Guiding Principles and is applied to all of Daimler AG’s majority-owned companies. It
consists of a risk-oriented two-step process. In the first step, the Group’s
majority-owned companies undergo a preliminary categorisation that
takes into account the overall risk situation for human rights in the
specific country and the business model-specific risks of the companies
under consideration. In the second step, these findings are used as
the basis of an assessment of selected majority-owned companies to

determine whether there are any concrete risks to rightsholders and
what measures the company has taken to mitigate any risks to human
rights. As a result, our new approach addresses a broad spectrum of
human rights issues, including fundamentals such as the prevention
of child labor and forced labor, freedom of association, and collective
bargaining, as well as issues specific to the automotive sector.
This innovative system was, and will continue to be, developed in a
cross-functional process. Specifically, experiences in the field of human
rights are combined with the methodological and process expertise of
the Compliance unit. In addition, key issues are discussed with external
stakeholders.
Within the scope of our analyses no cases or reports of child labor, forced
labor, or violations against the right to collective bargaining or freedom
of association were found within the Daimler Group in 2016. Indigenous
peoples are not affected by the activities at our production locations.
In addition to these measures, we followed up and reviewed reports of
incidents and tips we received publicly. In cases where we have identified
a need for action, we work continuously, alone or in cooperation with our
partners, to develop possible solutions.

Compliance programs
We aim to act in accordance with ethical principles and to comply
with all applicable laws, internal regulations, and voluntary commitments. We pay particular attention to complying with all applicable
anti-corruption regulations and to ensuring the maintenance and
promotion of fair competition, as set out in binding form in our
Integrity Code.

Our Compliance Management System (CMS) is based on national
and international standards and supports us in ensuring compliant behavior in daily operations at all of our business units. We regularly review
the effectiveness of the system and adjust it to worldwide developments,
changed risks, and new legal requirements. Thus, we continually improve
its effectiveness and efficiency, also with regard to compliance with technical regulations relating to our products. In particular, this is a matter
of identifying regulatory risks in the product-creation process, in order
to protect the Daimler Group, its employees, and its brands. Our various
compliance programs are based on our Compliance Management System.
We would like to present the following areas by way of example:
We systematically minimize compliance risks. We analyze and assess
the compliance risks of all our business units every year. The results of
this analysis form the basis of our risk management. One focus of our risk
minimization activities is on sales companies in high-risk countries. The
responsibility for implementing and monitoring the associated measures
lies with each company’s management, which cooperates closely with the
relevant department within Integrity and Legal Affairs.
Our effective Compliance and Legal department structures play a
key role in ensuring that all rules and regulations are adhered to throughout the Group. Our Compliance organization is structured in a divisional
and regional way, while our Legal department is organized along the value
chain and regionally. This structure enables us to offer optimal support
and advice to our divisions. For this purpose, a contact person is assigned
to each function, division, and region. In addition, local contact persons
around the world make sure that our standards are observed. The divisional compliance officers and the regional compliance officer report
directly to the Chief Compliance Officer. This ensures the divisional and
regional compliance officers’ independence from the divisions. The Chief
Compliance Officer and the Group General Council report directly to
the Member of the Board of Management responsible for Integrity and

We offer target-group-specific qualification courses within our integrated
training program in order to make sure our employees in the Compliance
organization and Legal department are up to date on changes made to
laws and regulations. All new Compliance and Legal department employees also receive a comprehensive introduction to their functions in a
special practice-oriented seminar.
Our whistleblower system BPO (Business Practices Office) enables
Daimler employees and external whistleblowers to report misconduct
anywhere in the world. The office is available to receive information
around the clock. This information can be sent by e-mail or normal mail,
and it can also be provided by calling an external toll-free hotline or by
filling out a reporting form. The information can be submitted anonymously if local law permits. In Germany, reports to the BPO can also
be submitted via a neutral intermediary — in this case, an independent
external attorney. The BPO system enables us to learn about potential
risks and specific violations, thus preventing damage to the company
and its reputation. Our globally valid corporate policy ensures a fair
and transparent approach that takes into consideration the principle of
proportionality for the affected parties, while also giving protection to
whistleblowers.
	More information on the BPO
In order to increase trust in our whistleblower system and make it even
better known within the Group, we have established a transparent communication process. It includes regularly informing employees about
the type and number of reported violations and holding information and
dialog events at our locations. The events we held for this purpose in
various markets during the reporting period were attended by approximately 750 employees. In 2016, 109 BPO cases were newly opened.

In the year under review, 71 cases were closed “with merit” out of a
total of 116 closed BPO cases. In the cases that were closed “with merit,”
a concrete initial suspicion was confirmed. One of these cases was
categorized as “bribery.” We responded to these cases with the appropriate measures.
We require our business partners to adhere to clear compliance
stipulations, because we regard our business partners’ integrity and
behavior in conformity with regulations as an indispensable precondition
for cooperation based on trust. In the selection of our direct business
partners, we therefore make sure that they comply with the law and observe ethical principles. Within the framework of our integrated training
program, we also offer our business partners special training courses
on integrity and compliance in line with the specific risks they face. In
2016, we published a “Compliance Awareness Module” that can be made
available to our business partners on request and is designed to increase
awareness of the latest compliance requirements. We also reserve the
right to terminate our cooperation with business partners who fail to
conform to our standards.

Anti-corruption compliance is ensured with a system applied worldwide
that primarily comprises integrated risk assessment, risk-based measures
for the avoidance of corruption in all business activities (such as reviews
of business partners and transactions), and special care in contacts
with public officials. We have achieved a recognized high standard in the
avoidance of corruption and place the same strict requirements on all of
our activities around the world. We are continually further developing our
methods and processes.
Our anti-money laundering policy is designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism in trade with goods. It forms the
basis for ensuring that legislation in various countries is complied with
throughout the Group. The Chief Compliance Officer serves as the

regulation. The goal of this project is to support all companies of the
Daimler Group in the EU member states with the implementation of the
new regulation, which will replace the previous EU regulation and the
national data protection laws in the EU countries in May 2018. The
new directive requires the implementation of increased transparency
obligations towards the concerned persons, and the introduction of
Europe-wide records of processing activities and a privacy impact
assessment for certain applications.
The Chief Officer Corporate Data Protection helps to ensure compliance with data protection requirements and our own standards. The

Daimler focuses on electric mobility
When Daimler introduced the first electric smart ten years ago, the company was a pioneer in electric driving. The
fourth generation of the smart electric drive will soon be rolling off the assembly line. With its new product brand EQ,
the company is launching an electric drive offensive in order to electrify vehicles in a variety of segments throughout
the Group, from compacts to luxury class to vans, trucks, and buses.

In October 2016, the Paris Motor Show hosted the public debut of the Concept EQ,
the forerunner of a new generation of battery-electric vehicles at Daimler. From the
outside, it looks like a SUV-coupé combined with futuristic features. However, the
Concept EQ reveals its true capabilities when it is taken out for a drive. Two electric
motors (one each on the front and rear axles) enable the vehicle to achieve an
overall output of up to 300 kW so that it can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in less
than five seconds. The vehicle’s range is also pretty impressive for an electric SUV:
When measured according to the NEDC, the Concept EQ can travel up to 500 kilometers before it has to be recharged. This is due not only to the high-performance
lithium-ion batteries but also to the intelligent operating strategy that the engineers
have developed for the vehicle.
These and many other technological innovations ensure that the Concept EQ is well
equipped for the pioneering role that the engineers at Daimler have planned for it.
Series-production vehicles based on the EQ will begin to roll off the assembly lines of
our plants within the next few years. That’s why we gave the EQ a vehicle architecture
that is specifically developed for battery-electric models. This architecture is scalable in every way and can be installed in a wide range of models. Thanks to the use
of a modular system, the wheelbase, tread width, and system components such as
the batteries are adjustable and can be adapted to all the requirements of a family of
battery-electric vehicle models. The basic architecture is suitable for SUVs, sedans,
coupés, cabriolets, and other model series.

En route to an emission-free future
There is every indication that two current trends, the switch to renewable sources
of energy and the growing demand for electric vehicles, will continue to intensify
worldwide in the years ahead. It could make the vision of completely emission-free
mobility a reality in the not too distant future. As we head toward this future, we

30

have to utilize all of the means available to us to reduce CO2 emissions more quickly.
The electrification of the drive system is without doubt the key means of achieving this
goal. In doing so, we are continuing to pursue a three-pronged drive system strategy.
In addition to all-electric vehicles and additional plug-in hybrids, highly efficient combustion engines will continue to be part of the solution at Daimler. This is especially
the case with cutting-edge diesel engines, which emit substantially less CO2 than do
gasoline engines. The incorporation of 48-volt battery systems in combination with
starter generators will enable all Mercedes-Benz model series to be electrified in the
future.
Today nobody can say with certainty when electric cars and plug-in hybrids will
account for more than half of all the new vehicles registered. However, it’s certain that
we already have the technology to develop electric automobiles whose range is not
much shorter than that of a gasoline-powered car, while their driving pleasure is even
greater. Moreover, the battery cells have now reached a level of development that
experts considered unrealistic just a few years ago. Last but not least, progress is also
being made with regard to the associated infrastructure. Thanks to these developments, the market is moving forward.

An “ecosystem” of innovations
In view of these developments, Daimler is preparing to switch to alternative drive
systems. We want to make electric mobility suitable for mass production so that it can
achieve a breakthrough. We belive that alternative drive systems must also be attractive. The crucial factors are driving pleasure, striking design, and a competitive range,
as well as high quality, safety, service, and connectivity. Thus our electric vehicles
are supplemented by an entire “ecosystem” of attractive services — from the
installation of the Mercedes-Benz wallbox to the provision of digital services for electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles that are accessible through the “Mercedes me” portal.
In the years ahead, we will invest more than E10 billion in the expansion of our electric fleet and in this way launch ten new electric vehicles on the market by 2025. In
general, Daimler will continue to increase its share of investment in future-oriented
technologies. We are investing E1 billion alone in the global expansion of our battery
production for electric cars and plug-in hybrids. In this way, we are ensuring that we
have direct access to key components of electric mobility.
Part of this investment in E500 million in the construction of a second battery
factory in Kamenz, Saxony, which will significantly boost our production capacity

and increase our production and logistics area fourfold. In addition, we are striking
out in new directions with our innovative stationary energy storage units in Lünen and
Hanover. In Lünen, 1,000 used batteries from smart fortwo electric drive vehicles together form the world’s largest second-use battery storage system (see p. 45). In
Hanover, we are combining 3,000 new replacement battery modules, which are destined for smart electric drive vehicles, into a super-large stationary system instead
of storing them, unused and at high cost, in a high-bay warehouse (see p. 45). Both
of these approaches improve the environmental performance of electric mobility and
support the switch to renewable sources of energy by buffering against the unavoidable fluctuations that these energies cause in the grid.
The availability of a comprehensive charging infrastructure is absolutely essential for
electric mobility and our upcoming vehicle concepts. Electric cars must be rechargeable everywhere, no matter who makes them or where they are located. Isolated
solutions must be avoided. The expansion of the public charging infrastructure is in
full swing and the importance of public fast-charging systems is also increasing as
batteries become larger and larger. In order to actively contribute to the creation of
the required infrastructure, we have teamed up with Volkswagen, BMW Group, and
Ford Motor Company and are currently planning to form a joint venture for an ultrafast high-performance charging network along Europe’s main traffic arteries.
The joint venture partners want to set up thousands of charging stations by 2020.
These stations will have a charging power of up to 350 kW so that vehicles can be
recharged much faster than at previous fast-charging stations. In a first step, around
400 high-performance charging stations will be set up in Europe, beginning in 2017.
We are also involved in another alliance where we promote the development of a
hydrogen infrastructure throughout Germany. Called H2 MOBILITY, the new company is a joint venture between Daimler and Air Liquide, Linde, OMV, Shell, and Total.
In 2016 it put its 25th public hydrogen filling station into operation. The company
plans to have around 400 H2 fueling stations by 2023.

Another premiere will be in 2017, when a new generation of fuel-cell vehicles based
on the GLC kicks off. This electric SUV, which generates its energy onboard from
hydrogen, has a very compact fuel-cell system as well as a lithium-ion battery that can
be charged externally by means of a plug-in system (see also p. 38).
As part of our plug-in hybrid offensive, we will also make a big technological leap
in 2017, when vehicles from the updated S-Class will be the first to use our refined
lithium-ion battery. In conjunction with the further optimized intelligent operating
strategy, the battery will enable the vehicle to travel more than 50 kilometers solely
on electricity. We already have a line-up of eight plug-in hybrids today. As a result,
Daimler offers one of the broadest ranges of plug-in hybrid models.

Electric mobility — from city runabouts to trucks
At the Paris Motor Show, we not only provided a preview of Daimler’s electrically
mobile future but also displayed the electric vehicles we already have on the road.
For example, the new smart fortwo coupé electric drive1, the new smart fortwo
cabrio electric drive2, and the smart forfour electric drive3 celebrated their world
premieres in Paris. smart already took the lead back in 2007, when it set up the
first electric test fleet in London. smart continues to be the world’s only automotive
brand to offer its complete range of models not only with combustion engines but
also as all-electric battery-powered versions.

It goes without saying that we, the world’s leading manufacturer of commercial vehicles, also employ sustainable new drive systems in our trucks, buses, and vans. We
put our first electric van into series production in 2011: the Vito E-CELL. It will be
followed in 2018 by a completely new van, which will be based on the Vision Van concept vehicle. The new van will be completely electric and connected and will feature
an automated cargo area. In the same year, we also plan to launch an electric version
of our Citaro short-distance bus. Thanks to its range of 300 kilometers, this bus
can easily cover most regular-service routes. Finally, our Fuso Canter E-CELL ensures
that we are also the leader when it comes to green trucks. In 2017 we will launch
the third generation of this battery-electric light truck on the market. It will feature an
enhanced electric motor and a greater range.

For us, product responsibility requires a combination of three
things: the greatest possible customer benefit, the highest safety
standards, and maximum eco-friendliness. To achieve this goal,
we depend on environmentally sound product development and
innovative concepts. This extends from trailblazing vehicle and
powertrain technologies to intelligent lightweight construction, the
use of recycled and renewable materials, the remanufacturing
of components, and the development of assistance systems that
can prevent accidents.
In the area of environmental compatibility we follow the Daimler
Environmental and Energy Guidelines. The second guideline is as follows:
We strive to develop products which are highly responsible to the environment and are energy-efficient in their respective market segments. Therefore, our mission is to fulfill demanding environmental standards and
deal sparingly with natural resources. Our measures for environmentally
compatible and energy-efficient product design take into account the
entire product life cycle — spanning development, production, and product use, as well as disposal and recycling.

development
A vehicle’s environmental impact is largely decided in the first stages
of development. The earlier we integrate environmentally responsible
product development (Design for Environment, DfE) into the development
process, the more efficiently we can minimize the impact on the environment. That is why continuous improvements in environmental compatibility are a major requirement in the creation of the product performance
specifications.
Our DfE experts are involved in all stages of vehicle development as a
cross-divisional team. In addition, we systematically integrate environmentally compatible product design into our environment and quality
management systems according to ISO 14001 and ISO 9001. Since 2012,
Mercedes-Benz has been in full compliance with the relevant ISO 14006
standard.

Mercedes-Benz has been certified according to ISO TR 14062, the standard for environmentally oriented product development, since 2005.
Certificates issued by the TÜV SÜD inspection agency after an audit
confirm that all environmental aspects of the entire life cycle have been
taken into account during product design and development and that
the results are based on life cycle assessments. These measures ensure
that the ISO TR 14062:2002 and ISO 14006:2011 standards are met.
By comparing previous and current vehicle models, TÜV SÜD confirms
that a standard is correctly implemented and that a vehicle’s environmental impact has been reduced throughout its entire life cycle. Several
Mercedes-Benz models have been awarded an environmental certificate
in their second generation.

Comprehensive life cycle assessment. Evaluating the environmental
compatibility of a vehicle requires an analysis of the emissions and use
of resources throughout the entire life cycle. This is done by means
of a life cycle assessment, which examines the most important environmental effects, from the extraction of raw materials and vehicle production to product use and recycling. At Mercedes-Benz Development, we
use life cycle assessments to evaluate and compare different vehicles,
components, and technologies.

Comprehensive CO2 reporting. We publish our CO2 emission data in
accordance with the standards of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG).
Along with the emissions produced by our own energy and heat generation activities (Scope 1) and from the external procurement of energy

Innovative vehicle and powertrain
technologies
Our goal is to safeguard mobility for the generations to come. That is why
we strive to offer our customers safe, efficient, and low-emission vehicles
and services. A core element of our approach is to achieve a drive system
mix that is tailored to the market requirements. The main focal points of
our development of particularly fuel-efficient and environmentally compatible powertrain technologies in all our automotive divisions are defined
in our initiative “The path to emission-free mobility”:
–	Further development of our vehicles equipped with state-of-the-art
combustion engines in order to achieve significant reductions in
consumption and emissions.
– Further efficiency increase through hybridization.
– Electric vehicles with battery and fuel cell drive.

** At Mercedes-Benz Cars the three categories “purchased goods and services”:
15.5 Mio. t CO2, “end-of-life treatment of sold product”: 1.0 Mio. t CO2 and “use of sold
product” including fuel production: 54.6 Mio. t CO2 accounted for around 95% of all
Scope 3 CO2 emissions. For the calculation of “use of sold product” we used for the
first time a refined, regionally specific calculation method. In comparison with 2015
we realized a specific reduction per vehicle of about 6% in the use phase.

The new smart electric drive models: the smart fortwo, the smart forfour, and the smart
fortwo cabrio. All feature pre-entry climate control and radar-assisted energy recovery.

The new Denza 400 undergoing quality assurance. This electric sedan is made in China
for China and has a range of up to 400 kilometers.

The fourth generation of the smart electric drive was unveiled in
Paris in October 2016. In addition to the smart fortwo, the smart fortwo
cabrio and smart forfour are now also available with electric drive.
As a result, smart will continue to be the only automaker to offer all
of its models in both combustion engine and battery-electric versions.
The new electric smarts are agile, swift, and locally emission-free.
Moreover, they use energy even more efficiently than before. The ECO
mode, for example, limits the car’s top speed and uses the highest energy
recovery level as the default setting in order to regain as much energy
as possible. To reduce charging times, all of the models are equipped
with an improved onboard charging unit. Depending on the electricity
conditions in the country in question, the standard version of this unit
recharges the battery up to 50 percent faster than in the predecessor
model. In 2017, we will also offer a 22 kW rapid charging unit at very

favorable terms. Under optimal charging conditions, this device enables
the battery to be completely recharged in less than 45 minutes.

The new Denza 400 has a range of up to 400 kilometers. This means the
vehicle can travel 100 kilometers farther than its predecessor on a fully
charged battery. The developers at BYD Daimler New Technology Co., Ltd.
(BDNT) managed to increase the car’s battery capacity from 47.5 kWh
to 62 kWh without changing the vehicle’s installation volume. BDNT is the
first Sino-German joint venture for electric vehicles. The Denza is manufactured in Shenzhen exclusively for the Chinese market.

The near-series Concept EQ is ushering in the age of a new battery electric vehicle
generation at Daimler.

Thanks to its plug-in hybrid technology, the E 350 e1 can travel up to 33 kilometers solely
on electricity, making it the ideal vehicle for locally emission-free driving in urban areas.

The Concept EQ provides a preview of a new generation of
Mercedes-Benz vehicles equipped with a battery-electric drive system.
The vehicle was unveiled in Paris in October 2016. It has two electric
motors (one each on the front and rear axles) which give it a total
system output of up to 300 kW and a range of up to 500 kilometers.
Focus on electric mobility: pp. 29 ff.
EQ — the new electric drive brand from Mercedes-Benz

they use electricity from renewable sources. Once that is the case, the
vehicles’ CO2 and NOX emissions will decline to a minimum. That’s
why we are continuing to forge ahead with our plug-in hybrid offensive.
The E 350 e is already the eighth plug-in hybrid in our product range.
This figure will rise to ten in 2017.

Customers

Third- generation plug-in hybrids combine the best of two worlds.
Besides traveling more than 30 kilometers solely on electricity, they
benefit from the long range of a combustion engine. Hybrid technology is
thus taking our customers closer to electric mobility step by step and is
already helping to protect the climate as well. However, hybrid vehicles
won’t be able to fully bring their environmental benefits to bear until

GLC with a fuel cell. In 2016, Daimler unveiled the first representative of
a new generation of fuel-cell vehicles based on the GLC. This SUV, which
will go into series production in 2017, features a compact fuel-cell system
that fits into conventional engine compartments. In addition, the vehicle
is equipped with a large lithium-ion battery, which serves as an additional
source of energy for the electric motor and can also be charged externally by means of a plug-in system. This combination enables the SUV to
achieve a total range of about 500 kilometers (NEDC).

H2 MOBILITY is building hydrogen filling stations. Electric vehicles
with fuel cell drive are also suitable for long driving distances, thanks
to their great range and quicker refueling. However, due to a lack of
hydrogen filling stations, such vehicles remain largely unattractive to
customers. That is why Daimler is promoting the development of a comprehensive hydrogen infrastructure jointly with partners from the political
arena and the energy sector. In September 2016, Daimler and Linde,
the two main partners of a national innovation program for hydrogen
and fuel-cell technology (NIP), opened the latest of H2 MOBILITY’s now
25 hydrogen filling stations in Germany.
H2 MOBILITY: p. 47

The largest share of primary energy consumption and CO2 emissions over
the life cycle of a vehicle is attributable to the usage phase. In the case
of a car with a combustion engine it is about 80 percent. The remaining
20 percent is caused almost entirely during the manufacturing process.
Vehicles with alternative drive systems have lower CO2 emissions during
the usage phase. However, the primary energy consumption of these
vehicles generally increases during production because of the energy
needed to manufacture certain components such as batteries, electric
motors, and electronic control systems.
Fleet emissions of CO2. In the year under review, the average CO2
emissions of the total fleet of Mercedes-Benz Cars in Europe amounted
to 123 g/km emissions have thus declined by 12.2 percent over the
past five years — from 140 g/km in 2012 to 123 g/km in the year under
review. In 2015 we already achieved our target of lowering the CO2
emissions of our new-vehicle fleet in Europe to 125 g/km by the year
2016. Even though the sales structure shifted toward upper mid-range
and luxury-segment vehicles, the value remained unchanged from the
previous year because we continued to reduce the CO2 emissions of
the individual models. In consideration of the expected average vehicle
weight, we have now set a new target of 100 grams of CO2 per kilometer
(NEDC) within the framework of our Target Program for 2021.

The Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP),
which will be introduced in 2017, will bring test results closer to actual
consumption values. The new test procedure specifies the use of a more
realistic uniform method for testing fuel consumption and exhaust emissions in the automotive industry. With regard to handling, average speed,
and top speed, the WLTP is much more strongly based on actual driving
conditions out on the road than is the case with the current New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). Consequently, the WLTP produces results that
are much closer to actual consumption values in daily operation.

Fuel Economy Standards (CAFE). Separate target values are set for cars
and light trucks for each manufacturer. If a manufacturer does not meet
the GHG standards, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) identifies
the vehicles from the manufacturer’s fleet to which the overrun of the
limit is attributable. A penalty payment is then imposed on all affected
models.
The CAFE fleet value for each model year is determined on the basis of
the number of vehicles sold and their respective fuel economy figures. For
every 0.1 mile per gallon below the specified limit, the manufacturer is
required to pay a fine to the government of US$5.50 per vehicle produced
for sale in the United States.

for light commercial vehicles over the last five years. Our target is to
reduce the fleet consumption of our cars and light-duty trucks on the US
market by 25 percent by 2019 as compared to 2012, which is the base
year for the currently valid CAFE regulations.

Sophisticated aerodynamics. To date, we have managed to steadily
improve the Cd value from one model to the next by optimizing the vehicle
body shapes, the underbodies, and many attachments. The resulting
improvements are demonstrated, for example, by the S 300 h Sedan1.
With a Cd value of 0.23, this car continues to be the most aerodynamic
vehicle in its class. In practice, this low drag coefficient results in measurably lower values for fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. This is especially the case at higher speeds, such as those on highways. This means
that improved aerodynamics will have a bigger effect on the WLTP values
than on the previously used NEDC figures, because the new test method
uses a higher average vehicle speed.

than its predecessor. Thanks to these and other features, it also consumes up to 31 percent less fuel in the NEDC. The use of lightweight
materials such as aluminum produces slightly higher CO2 emissions
during the manufacturing process — for the current model this value
amounts to 8.7 tons of CO2, compared to 8.6 tons of CO2 for the predecessor. However, the new vehicle’s much higher efficiency during the
usage phase more than offsets this drawback. Throughout its life cycle,
the E 220 d Wagon emits around 21 percent (about 12.5 tons) less CO2
than its predecessor.
360-degree environmental check of the new E-Class
S-Class Coupé with CO2 a/c technology. The new S-Class Coupé is the
first series-production car in the world to feature a CO2 air-conditioning
system. The technology will be introduced in additional E-Class models
beginning in 2017. CO2 is neither toxic nor flammable and has a very low
greenhouse potential compared to other refrigerants. Its Global Warming
Potential (GWP) of 1 means that CO2 meets the EU’s requirements for
a refrigerant with a greatly reduced climate impact. Because the new
a/c technology performs better than conventional systems in many ways,
it saves energy by cooling off the passenger compartment more rapidly
than other techniques. The consumer magazine Guter Rat has therefore
named the CO2 air-conditioning system from Mercedes-Benz a “rational
innovation.”
Declining CO2 emissions for our vans. An EU directive on the emissions of vans with a total curb weight of up to 2,585 kilograms entered
into force in 2011. The regulation stipulates that beginning in 2017, the
average emissions of such vans may not exceed 175 g CO2/km. As of
2020, the CO2 level will drop to 147 g CO2/km. Taking into account
vehicle weight, Mercedes-Benz vans must comply with a maximum CO2
fleet level of 210 g CO2/km in 2017. However, our vans were already
lower than that level in 2014. We aim to achieve a further reduction of
more than 10 percent by 2018. The CO2 emissions of our van fleet did
not decline between 2015 and 2016.

adVANce is the name of a future-focused initiative at Mercedes-Benz
Vans. Over the next five years, our Vans division plans to invest around
E500 million in order to further optimize the digitization, automation,
electric mobility, and robotics of vans and develop new mobility services.
Around 200 employees are already working in Stuttgart, Berlin, and
Silicon Valley on concepts for making vans even faster, more efficient,
and more environmentally compatible. A recent concept vehicle shows
how this can look in practice. Called the Vision Van, the vehicle is completely electric and connected, and has an automated cargo area that
also contains delivery drones. The van has a range of 270 kilometers.

Efficient truck engines. The latest generation of the OM 470 six-cylinder
inline engine is even more economical and cleaner than its predecessor,
but also more powerful, with a new peak output rating of 335 kW (456 hp).
With this new engine, Daimler is optimizing its heavy-duty trucks. Numerous enhancements are once again noticeably reducing the engine’s fuel
consumption. The heavy-duty engines are benefiting from new low-friction
motor oils. The Mercedes PowerShift 3 12-speed transmissions are now
even more efficient, and the Predictive Powertrain Control (PPC) utilizes
a refined driving strategy. Depending on the engine variant, all of these
improvements combined reduce fuel consumption by up to 6 percent in a
clear demonstration of the benefits of a perfectly coordinated drivetrain
encompassing the engine, the transmission, and the axles.

The Mercedes-Benz Actros has completed significantly more than
2,700 “fuel duels” with its key European competitors. With 10.7 percent
better fuel efficiency on average, the Daimler truck won more than
90 percent of the duels, as was objectively demonstrated with the help
of the telematics-based Internet services of the Fleetboard fleet management system. The 90 semitrailer tractors used in the fuel consumption
tests covered a total of over 13.2 million kilometers in 22 European countries. This edge in fuel economy literally pays off for Actros customers in
the shipping industry. That’s because fuel accounts for 29 percent of their
total operating costs and thus makes up the biggest share. Future comparative fuel efficiency tests promise to generate even more favorable
results for the Actros, because the introduction of the new OM 471
engine generation will reduce the already low fuel consumption value by
up to 3 percent.
Efficient trucks
Actros semitrailer rig in the Efficiency Run. Optimizing several
components of a semitrailer rig simultaneously help to reduce fuel
consumption and CO2 emissions even more effectively, as demonstrated
by the second Efficiency Run, which was held in 2016. In cooperation
with the trailer manufacturer Krone, Daimler developed an optimized
Actros semitrailer rig, which it then tested for three months on the road.
The field test showed that the truck equipped with the new OM 471
engine, Predictive Powertrain Control, improved low rolling-resistance
tires, and the Profi Liner Efficiency trailer from Krone reduces fuel
consumption and CO2 emissions by 18 to 20 percent, compared to
previous tractor-trailer combinations.

European Truck Platooning Challenge. In June 2016, digitally connected trucks demonstrated their capabilities during a rally that extended
across Europe. When connected trucks drive in convoys, they are safer
than conventional vehicles, take up less space on highways, and consume
less fuel. This is made possible by platooning, in which a telematics
platform communicates with the other vehicles and with the traffic infrastructure. Daimler and five other manufacturers took part in the test
drive, which was initiated by the Dutch government.
The Green Truck 2016 is the Actros 1845. The editors of VerkehrsRundschau and Trucker have presented the coveted award to Mercedes-Benz’
flagship vehicle, thus naming it the most fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly truck of the year. The Actros 1845 was honored after it
scored the most points in a series of vehicle and comparative tests in
which it consumed the least amount of fuel and AdBlue in its class. It is
the second time in a row that the Mercedes-Benz Actros has performed
better than all other heavy-duty long-haul semitrailer rigs in the most
important environmental ranking of the transportation and logistics
sector.
Green Truck 2016 (available in German only)
Efficient truck. In 2012 Daimler Trucks North America promised its customers that it would improve its vehicles’ fuel efficiency by 5 percent
every two years. Three test drives by an independent auditor prove that
the company has kept its promise. On routes across the United States,
the test driver put three Freightliner New Cascadias through their paces.
The results showed that the long-haulage truck’s fuel economy is up to
8 percent better than that of the best-equipped version of the current
2016 Cascadia Evolution. This substantial increase was achieved through
improved aerodynamics and an optimized drive system.

Green energy for the smart fortwo electric drive. Drivers of the smart
electric drive Phase III travel without producing any emissions. That’s
because Daimler feeds as much self-generated renewable wind energy
into the German grid as is required to cover the operation of the smart
fortwo electric drive III cars sold in Germany until the end of 2016. In
doing so, Daimler does not accept any of the subsidies made possible by
the Renewable Energy Sources Act.

Recharging with renewable energy at home and driving completely
emission-free — both are now possible for all Mercedes-Benz and smart
customers. A few clicks in an online form are all it takes to have the electricity from renewable sources offered by Daimler and the EnBW energy
company delivered to these customers’ homes.

Electricity from the spare parts warehouse. In Hanover, Daimler has
set up an energy storage system that combines 3,000 new replacement
batteries, which were built for smart electric drive vehicles. This creates
a stationary storage unit with a total capacity of 15 megawatt-hours. The
facility is one of the largest of its kind in Europe. The unit will help offset
fluctuations in the amount of energy generated by renewable sources and
thus also help stabilize grid frequency — a task that is usually carried
out today by fossil-fuel power plants. This project, which is like no other
anywhere in the world, is being conducted by Daimler, ACCUmotive, and
the Enercity grid operator (Stadtwerke Hannover — Hanover’s municipal
utility company).
Super-large battery storage system in Hanover

The world’s largest second-use battery bank went on line in Lünen,
Germany, in September 2016. The innovative energy storage system
consists of batteries that Daimler uses in its electric vehicles. In Lünen,
1,000 old batteries from electric smarts provide a total storage capacity
of 13 megawatt-hours. After completing their tough service in vehicles,
the batteries are being reused here under less demanding conditions.
Doing so doubles the batteries’ economic value and improves their
environmental performance. Battery banks such as the one in Lünen
also promote Germany’s energy transition by helping to offset the grid
fluctuations caused by the switch to renewable sources of energy.

E500 million for a new battery factory. Daimler is investing around
E500 million in the expansion of its electric mobility activities. On
October 24, 2016, it began to construct a second battery factory in
Kamenz, Germany. This facility will greatly increase the production
capacity for lithium-ion batteries at our subsidiary Deutsche ACCUmotive.
In the future, this factory will produce batteries for electric and hybrid
vehicles from Mercedes-Benz and smart.
Ultra E project for an international network of fast charging stations. The Ultra E project aims to enable electric vehicles to recharge for

We think that the use of biofuels is only beneficial and promising if they
aren’t produced in competition with food and their sustainability is assured. In the future, natural gas can make a key contribution to mankind’s
efforts to achieve its climate targets. Biogas and power-to-gas fuels offer
additional benefits with regard to the reduction of CO2 emissions. As
a result, the European Union expects natural gas and biogas to play an
increasingly important role in road freight traffic in the future.
HVO permitted for Mercedes-Benz trucks. Since February 2016,
hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) can be used to run Mercedes-Benz
trucks equipped with OM 470, OM 471, OM 936, and OM 934 series
engines that meet the Euro VI emissions standard. This permit is valid
for all engine types and all output ratings. HVO is a second-generation
biodiesel fuel that is created from waste such as used fats and cooking
oils or from oils that are made from cultivated plants. The raw material
comes from controlled and certified sources and does not compete
with food production.
H2 MOBILITY initiative. Since 2013, we have been participating as a
partner in the H2 MOBILITY initiative and making specific plans to
establish a nationwide network of H2 filling stations in Germany. The
plans envisage the creation of around 400 public hydrogen fueling
stations by 2023 so that an H2 filling station is located along at least
every 90 kilometers of highway between urban centers. Furthermore,
at least ten hydrogen filling stations will be available in each metropolitan
region starting in 2023. The total investment requirement for the project
will amount to E350 million. A total of 25 hydrogen fueling stations have
been completed to date.
Fuel economy training. Fuel consumption can be reduced by as much

Our safety and emission-free driving strategies are aimed at ensuring
maximum safety for drivers, passengers, and all other road users, and the
prevention of emissions and noise.

We use cutting-edge technologies to further reduce the pollutant emissions of our cars and commercial vehicles. Our target is to fulfill future
emission requirements in advance as much as possible. For example,
all of our diesel vehicles and 130 of our 147 gasoline-powered directinjection Mercedes-Benz models already comply with the more stringent
particulate emission limit of the second stage of Euro 6, which will go
into effect in September 2017. Moreover, our new generation of diesel
engines, which was put on the road in 2016 with the OM 654 four-cylinder
engine of the E-Class, is already designed to meet future emissions
regulations that will use Real Driving Emissions (RDE) as their basis.
For example, the new E 220 d Sedan1 equipped with the OM 654 engine
was subjected to six test drives by the independent inspection agency
DEKRA as well as to a variety of test drives by the Karlsruhe Institute
of Technology. The results showed that the car already stays within the
80 mg/km NOX certification limit of the Stage 2 Real Driving Emissions
regulations.

Upon delivery, our products and services must satisfy demanding criteria
for quality and active and passive safety, and must be ready to be used
safely in accordance with their intended purpose. That is why as early as
in the development and design stage, we work hard to ensure that errors
never arise to begin with. Our safety obligations also apply during production and sales as well as after the handover of the vehicles. The Daimler
Product Safety policy regulates the related requirements, tasks, activities,
and responsibilities. With the help of our worldwide product monitoring
system, we can identify potential risks at an early stage. We have clearly
defined processes and procedures for suitable countermeasures such
as warnings and customer service activities.

Studies regarding inner-city air quality. Daimler has commissioned
several studies in order to find out more about the expected positive
impact of Mercedes-Benz’ latest diesel engine technologies on the air
quality of inner cities. Various scenarios were developed and compared
as part of the “Daimler Sustainability Dialogue.” In addition to a “business
as usual” scenario, in which the current number of vehicles with today’s
technologies remains unchanged, the study examined an advanced
scenario where cutting-edge exhaust treatment technology such as that
found in the new Mercedes-Benz E-Class would be used. The results
showed that the widespread use of the new technologies could greatly
help to reduce inner-city NOX emissions even within a short period of
time.

Vehicle safety

Good air quality in the vehicle interior and anti-allergen surfaces contribute to the passengers’ safety and well-being. As early as the development
stage, we ensure that emissions in the vehicle interior are reduced to a
minimum and that allergens are avoided. External allergens are effectively
kept out by highly efficient filters in the air conditioning unit.

One of our key obligations is to ensure the safety of our customers and
all other road users. Mercedes-Benz experts have been conducting inhouse accident research on critical traffic situations and real accidents
with Mercedes-Benz vehicles since 1969. That is why our comprehensive
Integral Safety concept is systematically reconciled with real traffic and
accident data. The concept is focused on the synergy between active
and passive safety.

Proven anti-allergen features. Since 2016, all of our car model series
have borne the seal of quality of ECARF, the European Centre for Allergy
Research Foundation. The ECARF seal is awarded to products whose antiallergen properties have been demonstrated through scientific study.

Noise
We have reduced the noise emissions of our passenger cars, trucks,
and buses in recent years through a series of improvements. Our main
concern at present is to find satisfactory solutions for the conflicting
objectives we repeatedly face in the area of noise reduction. Commercial
vehicles in particular have areas where reducing noise and lowering fuel
consumption are at odds from a technological standpoint. For example,
an encapsulation of the powertrain dampens the engine noise. At the
same time, however, it requires a stronger cooling system, which raises
the fuel consumption. The additional fuel consumption can be countered
with higher injection pressures, which in turn lead to harsher combustion
noise.

Assistance systems that prevent accidents are very effective and helpful, as has been demonstrated numerous times. A great number of such
systems ensure maximum safety in our vehicles, and safety components
and driver assistants are becoming increasingly linked with one another.
Examples include:
The DRIVE PILOT, which not only regulates speeds and the distance to
other vehicles but also helps the driver steer. It can greatly reduce driver
stress, especially on long trips or when the vehicle is stuck in traffic jams
or on congested roads. The system can automatically keep the car at a
proper distance from the preceding vehicle and also follow it at a speed
of up to 210 km/h. To do so, the DRIVE PILOT uses a whole package of innovations, consisting of the Steering Pilot, the Distance Pilot DISTRONIC,
and the Speed Limit Pilot. The system also includes the Active Lanechange Assistant and Active Brake Assist. The latter brakes the vehicle
until it comes to a stop in its lane if the driver fails to put his or her hands
on the steering wheel after being requested to do so several times.
At the request of the driver, the Distance Pilot DISTRONIC regulates the
distance from preceding vehicles at speeds of up to 210 km/h. The
Speed Limit Pilot, finally, ensures that the Distance Pilot DISTRONIC automatically adheres to detected speed limits so that the vehicle’s speed
can be adjusted before it enters built-up areas, for example.

Intelligent Drive. Less stress, more safety, and greater comfort — all
of this is made possible by Intelligent Drive, a multi-system concept for
driver assistance and safety. Intelligent Drive can:
– Ease the burden on drivers in normal driving situations
– Recognize dangerous situations
– Provide timely warnings and assistance, and intervene in the vehicle’s
operation
– In this manner prevent accidents or mitigate their impact
– Take precautionary protective measures in dangerous situations
A networked sensor system allows each function to access comprehensive information about the vehicle and its surroundings.
Intelligent Drive analyzes traffic situations
Intelligent safety in the new E-Class. An innovative driver assistance
package makes the new E-Class the most intelligent sedan in its segment.
The package not only enables partially autonomous driving on highways
and secondary roads but can also issue warnings about critical situations
long before they take place and brake the vehicle autonomously to reduce
impending dangers.
New assistance systems for trucks, buses, and vans are bringing
our commercial vehicles another step closer to the goal of accident-free
driving. Such systems include everything from Crosswind Assist for vans
to Blind Spot Assist for trucks, which can detect pedestrians and cyclists
in the blind spot.

Active Brake Assist 4. Active Brake Assist revolutionized safety systems
ten years ago, when it was introduced as the first emergency braking
assistant for trucks that independently activates the brakes when the
vehicle encounters obstacles. The latest generation of the system, Active
Brake Assist 4, is now setting new standards. It is the first system of
its kind in the world to warn truck drivers of impending collisions with
pedestrians and at the same time initiate a partial braking maneuver.
The acoustic and visual alarms activate at the same time as the partial
braking. This enables drivers to prevent a collision from occurring by
either maximum full-stop braking or steering out of the way. Drivers can
also warn endangered pedestrians by honking their horns.
Safety innovations for trucks, buses, and vans
Top marks in safety testing. Mercedes-Benz models repeatedly earn
top marks in safety tests. In its overall assessment, the new E-Class
achieved the greatest number of points possible in the European New Car
Assessment Programme (NCAP) in 2016 and was labeled “best in class.”
Moreover, the GLC obtained five Euro NCAP stars in December 2015 for
the combined assessment of occupant protection, child safety, pedestrian
safety, and assistance systems. In 2016, three Mercedes-Benz models
scored highly in the safety assessments of the Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety (IIHS) in the United States. The three models in question
were the new C-Class and E-Class as well as the GLE, all of which were
named TOP SAFETY PICK+ in their respective categories.

Conservation of resources
The production of vehicles naturally requires great quantities of materials.
Therefore, one of the focal points of our development tasks is to keep the
demand for natural resources as low as possible. In particular, we attempt
as early as the initial development stage to restrict the use of raw materials that are only available in limited quantities and that frequently have
a big environmental impact. An important role is played here not only by
the economical use of resources but also by the remanufacturing of components and the recycling of used materials.

effects of materials used in their production. For this, we are employing
new lightweight materials and components on the one hand and increasingly using renewable raw materials and recycled materials on the other.

Target Program

Intelligent lightweight construction can further reduce vehicle weight
without sacrificing safety and comfort. In this context, the selection of
materials, as well as the component design and manufacturing technology also play an important role — not every material is suitable for every
component. At 35 percent, the vehicle body accounts for the biggest
share of total vehicle weight, followed by the chassis at 25 percent, the
comfort and safety equipment at 20 percent, and the engine and transmission at 20 percent. Thus the most effective approach is to focus on
the vehicle body.
Increased use of “resource-conserving materials,” which is our term
for recyclates and renewable raw materials. The European End of Life
Vehicle Directive 2000/53/EC specifies utilization quotas for passenger
cars and vans with a gross vehicle weight of up to 3.5 tons. In addition,
it also requires manufacturers to use more recyclates during vehicle production in order to strengthen the markets for recycled materials. That is
why the performance specifications for the new Mercedes-Benz models
prescribe continuous increases in the amounts of recycled materials to be
used in car models, as is also specified in the target program.

Renewable raw materials offer us many advantages. For example, they
can help reduce component weight and the resulting products are generally easily recyclable. Moreover, their CO2 effect is almost neutral when
their energy is recovered, because only as much CO2 is released as was
absorbed by the plant during its growth. Last but not least, renewable
raw materials as well as recyclates help reduce the consumption of fossil
resources.

The lower percentage of steels and ferrous materials and the increasing share of
light metals illustrate the new approach now being taken with our vehicle architectures,
which in some cases has led to a substantial weight reduction for the entire vehicle.

3D-printed spare parts. For the first time we are now using 3D-printed
spare parts for our Mercedes-Benz trucks. Among the world’s truck
manufacturers, we are the technology leader in the use of 3D printing.
In September 2016, a 3D printer made the first on-demand set of 30
genuine-quality parts for a wide variety of applications. The number of
3D-printed parts has continuously grown since then. The “printed” parts
are produced with the selective laser sintering (SLS) method, which does
not waste any material. This saves money and conserves resources.
Resource consumption of various drive systems. Vehicles with
hybrid and electric drives contain a particularly large number of valuable
resources. This pays off if the entire life cycle is taken into consideration.
In comparison to its predecessor the E 350 CGI the plug-in hybrid
requires more material resources in the manufacturing phase. On the
other hand the consumption of energetic resources in the usage phase
is reduced disproportionately.

No more plastic bags for free. The Mercedes-Benz and smart dealerships and sales and service centers in Germany as well as the other sales
outlets for parts and accessories and the Mercedes-Benz Museum no
longer hand out plastic bags for free. Instead they use environmentally
friendly fabric or paper bags. However, the existing stocks of plastic bags
will still be used up.
Making resource efficiency measurable. For years now, the global
economy has been growing — and with it the burden on the environment
and the consumption of resources. Achieving more with less is therefore
the order of the day for sustainable development. We have conducted
several studies that address issues related to resource efficiency. Our
focus here is on the development of procedures for holistically assessing
the resource efficiency of our products.

The holistic assessment of resource use also has to take other factors
into account besides the consumption of raw materials. For example, it
needs to look at the security of the medium and long-term supply of raw
materials as well as the fulfillment of social and environmental standards
along the supply chain. In the ESSENZ research project, which received
funding from the German Ministry of Education and Research, Daimler
helped to develop a new holistic evaluation method that takes all of these
factors into account.

Mobility concepts and services
Transport infrastructure and transport systems frequently operate at
their limits, especially in urban areas. That is why Daimler has developed
a range of pioneering mobility concepts — from the car sharing provider
car2go and the mobility platform moovel to the taxi app mytaxi, the coach
company flixbus, and the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system. They are joined
by Blacklane, a service portal that offers professional chauffeur services
at fixed prices. Blacklane doesn’t use its own vehicles and drivers, but
instead relies on a broad network of professionally licensed local ride
services.
New car sharing platform launched in Munich. Croove is the name
of a new app-based service from Mercedes-Benz that brings together
people seeking to provide or rent private vehicles. The platform is open
for vehicles from all brands. Croove enables people who are looking to
rent a vehicle to quickly and easily find what they are looking for, while
vehicle providers can optimize the use of their automobiles.

car2go launched in China. In 2016, car2go was launched in the Chinese
megacity of Chongqing with the brand suffix “JíXíng” (roughly: “drive off
immediately”). The Daimler subsidiary car2go is the first international
company to implement the free-floating car sharing concept in China.
New business model for car2go. Since the summer of 2016, car2go
has been offering Mercedes-Benz A-Class, B-Class, GLA, and CLA models
in addition to the smart. The 300 new vehicles are being used in Berlin,
and the additional models will also be introduced to other cities in the
future. With this change car2go is responding to the wishes of numerous
users.
Daimler increases stake in Blacklane. The professional limousine service Blacklane is already available in more than 200 cities in 50 countries
worldwide. To boost the mobility provider’s global growth, Daimler
invested an eight-digit sum to increase its stake in Blacklane in 2016.
Parking space sharing for drivers of smart. “ready to park+” is the
name of a new service for drivers of smart. In downtown Munich and
Cologne, the service offers more than 100 parking spaces exclusively to
the drivers of smart, who select, reserve, and pay for the spaces online
and cash-free. The parking spaces cost up to 50 percent less than conventional parking opportunities, thanks to the partnership between smart
and the parking space sharing provider ampido.

A culture of customer orientation. Daimler offers its products and
services in nearly all countries of the world. In order to be successful, the
company needs to address in detail the specific wishes of its customers
in every market. To this end, we have been organizationally reinforcing our
corporate structures and aligning them with our five business divisions
even more strongly in recent years. The corporate departments have
also been better aligned with the market requirements of the business
divisions. For us, customer dedication is not a purely organizational
measure; it’s the means by which we will reach our goal of ensuring a
comprehensive culture of customer orientation at all units throughout
our entire company.
Improving customer satisfaction. Our business units have established
quality management systems for the continuous monitoring and improvement of customer satisfaction. The goal of our program “CSI No. 1 —
Delightful Customer Care” is to make Daimler Number 1 in the world for
customer service. Country-specific CSI action plans are agreed upon and
implemented on the basis of international benchmark studies, internal
data surveys, and customer surveys.
Processes and behavior patterns are continuously enhanced at all sales
stages and hierarchical levels to ensure maximum customer orientation.
The measures include process improvements, training courses, and
dealer consulting and coaching, as well as the incorporation of key figures
relevant for customer satisfaction into the monetary control instruments
for sales and service. Thanks to all of these measures, Mercedes-Benz
Cars and Daimler Trucks have been at the top of many rankings.

“Mercedes Benz 2020 — Best Customer Experience” is the name of
the growth strategy we derived from the organizational realignment of
passenger car sales and marketing operations. The strategy encompasses
numerous new approaches for sales, aftersales, and financial services.
We strive to offer our customers a consistent premium brand experience
across all points of contact. To this end, we employ a holistic approach.
Our strategy focuses on the following:
– The opening of the brand and personal contact with customers
– The digitization of all channels
–	New differentiated sales formats and HR profiles for dealerships
– Personalized customer management across all channels
We reach out to customers where they live and work, and we give them
the opportunity to contact us anytime and anywhere. Our focus here is on
creating a seamless customer journey. We also offer our customers and
anyone interested in the brand customized support and service solutions
tailored to their individual needs — throughout the entire life cycle of their
vehicle. Our focus is always clearly on customer utility — and that pertains
to vehicle connectivity systems as well.
Customer feedback on vehicle quality. The Mercedes-Benz brand has
always stood for technical innovation and high quality. In order to safeguard exactly this type of quality over the long term, we use our Internal
Vehicle Quality Study (German abbreviation: IFQS) to analyze feedback
concerning the quality of Mercedes-Benz vehicles from our company car
users and customers who obtained their vehicles via the Employee Sales
system.

The goal of IFQS is to identify recurring defects and areas in need of
improvement at an early stage and to determine whether the measures
we take have a noticeable positive effect on the customer experience.
Every year, we receive reports on quality deficiencies via the IFQS online
questionnaire from more than 40,000 company car drivers and Employee
Sales customers in Germany, the United States, China, and South Africa.
Some 800 staff members from development, quality, and aftersales units
use this data to continually optimize and refine our products. Thanks
to IFQS, about 400 causes of problems were analyzed in 2016 — in many
cases by directly examining the vehicles about which complaints were
made. In these years, measures related to more than 340 IFQS issues
were introduced in ongoing series production operations and changes
were defined for successor model series with regard to approximately
400 issues.
Divisional key account system. In the course of the closer alignment of
our corporate organization with the business divisions we have introduced
a divisional key account system at Daimler Financial Services, which
enables us to offer financial services that are tailored even more closely
to our customers’ needs.
Customer service at the divisions. People who buy our vehicles also
wish to receive great service during the period of use. For example, they
want to have close contact with the customer service department, individual advice, effective processing of warranty and damage claims, first-rate
maintenance, and optimum parts supply. Quick and targeted assistance is
ensured by customer centers and service support points, which generally
address customer concerns around the clock.
–		 The Mercedes Benz Customer Assistance Center (CAC) in
		 Maastricht is the central point of contact for customer concerns
and complaints regarding sales, service, and technology issues in
Western Europe. We also maintain local assistance centers in

		 other core markets. At the CAC in Maastricht, approximately 600 em		 ployees ensure that customers are assisted around the clock. One
of the CAC’s key tasks is to coordinate Mercedes-Benz Service 24h,
which also includes the organization of breakdown assistance. When
necessary, the center also tells customers how repairs or processes
are coming along. This is an especially important benefit for commercial customers. The service activities at the CAC extend beyond
the repair and service center business and include service contracts,
warranty extensions, and motor insurance.
–		 Throughout Europe, there are over 600 service outlets for bus
		 customers that are operated by OMNIplus, which is a brand of
		 Daimler’s EvoBus subsidiary. In addition to operating a professional
parts supply system, the comprehensive network of outlets offers
bus customers service deals and contracts, driver and repair shop
training programs, pre-owned vehicles, and customized financial
services. In 2012, OMNIplus introduced a customer complaint management (CCM) system, which combines all of the customer service
department’s complaint processing channels into a single unit that
also enables the company to evaluate the complaints that customers
make.
–		 24 hours a day — the Fuso Call Center that the Mitsubishi Fuso
Truck and Bus Corporation (MFTBC) opened in 2010 is available to
customers around the clock. Service at Fuso has also been improved
by the Vehicle Delivery Management (VDM) system introduced in
2012. The system enables vehicles with a two-month production
		 time to be delivered up to two weeks earlier. Moreover, because
MFTBC vehicles can be configured directly at dealerships, sales staff
can notify customers of the scheduled delivery date when they
		 place their orders. In 2013, Fuso also launched its “Fuso integrated
total support” (Fits) project to improve its customer service even
further.

200,000 categories of spare parts at seven locations. The network
also serves customers of DTNA’s Thomas Built Buses (TBB) subsidiary. In order to further improve customer satisfaction, DTNA has also
introduced a new Initial Buyer Tracking Survey system that generates
customer feedback for specific vehicle systems.
Fulfilling customer wishes — for people with disabilities as well. For
us, customer orientation means taking the needs and interests of our
customers seriously. That is why no two vehicles rolling off the production
lines at our plants are exactly the same. The Mercedes-Benz program
Ex-Factory Driving Aids, which is now offered in Germany, Austria,
Switzerland, and Luxembourg, is directed especially at people with
physical disabilities. The program offers steering and operating aids such
as hand-operated gas and brake pedals, as well as vehicle entry aids such
as hydraulic lifts for front passengers. Mercedes-Benz currently operates
23 More Mobility Centers, where specially trained sales staff are glad
to advise and assist customers. We are continuously expanding this
network of service centers. In Germany, Mercedes-Benz also offers
disabled people special terms for almost all passenger car model series.
In 2012, Mercedes-Benz developed the Educated Comfort demonstration
vehicle, which is adapted to the special needs of older drivers with
adjusted ingress and egress and improved vehicle loading possibilities.
In the next step, the vehicles will be produced in a small batch for the
model’s market entry.

Information and advertising — with respect. All of our advertising,
sales promotion, and sponsorship campaigns are subject to an in-house
audit procedure to ensure that they are in compliance with the applicable
laws and Daimler’s standards and codes of conduct. We also observe
industry principles such as the European advertising sector’s Code of
Ethics. As a matter of principle we avoid the use of violent, discriminatory,
sexual, or religious elements in our advertising. Respect for foreign
cultural norms and religious beliefs is a particularly important concern
in our international campaigns.
Sustainability issues are increasingly taken into account in brand and
product communications. For example, Mercedes-Benz’s efficiency
programs include a range of innovative technologies for drive systems,
aerodynamics, and lightweight design that enable a marked reduction of
fuel consumption and emissions. We are also increasingly highlighting
the topic of sustainable mobility at motor shows. At the 2016 Paris Motor
Show, for example, we presented the new smart electric drive as well
as the first representative of a new Mercedes-Benz product brand, the
Concept EQ, and our strategy for the gradual electrification of our entire
range of vehicles.

Data protection and networked mobility. The increasing trend toward
Internet connectivity in vehicles is presenting us with new data protection
challenges. We not only need to protect vehicle electronic systems from
possible hacker attacks; we also need to ensure the security of personal
data. Our top priority here is ensuring that customers can decide for
themselves how their data will be used. For example, our customers can
decide which types of data may be forwarded. They can do this by issuing their consent, signing a contract or pushing a button. It’s important
that every customer knows which data is collected for which purpose
and when — and we provide our customers with comprehensive information about this process. We also protect our customers’ data from
being manipulated or misused. To this end, we continually refine our data
protection measures in line with the latest developments in information

Targeted control. In order to eliminate or reduce environmental risks
and excessive demand for resources in advance, we regularly audit our
locations in accordance with globally uniform standards. Suppliers must
fulfill our sustainability requirements. We also expect them to operate
with an environmental management system that is certified according
to ISO14001, EMAS or other comparable standards. In addition, our
Mercedes-Benz specifications define the requirements for the environmental compatibility and energy efficiency of the components delivered to
us. Furthermore, the Mercedes-Benz contract terms include requirements
concerning materials selection, banned substances, and recycling, as well
as compliance with environmental-protection and energy legislation.
Strict environmental risk analysis. Our environmental risk analysis
system encompasses all processes of relevance to the environment:
emissions to the atmosphere and wastewater, waste management, handling of hazardous materials, and damage to the soil and groundwater.
A team of auditors visits all Daimler locations at fixed intervals — including
the locations we operate as a majority shareholder with partners. The
auditors conduct interviews and plant tours. The findings are documented
in reports to the heads of the production locations and summarized in
Summary Reports for top management. In addition, the analysis process
facilitates the sharing of best practices that flow into the Daimler standards, which are valid worldwide.

Because of our high share of in-house production relative to our competitors, we also
reflect a greater proportion of the environmental effects in our carbon footprint.
Transmissions alone, which other manufacturers do not take into consideration because
they are purchased parts, account for around 8 percent of the energy consumption
of our Cars division.

In 2016, the measures mentioned enabled production to increase by
2 percent and CO2 emissions to decline by 8.3 percent (0.5 percent when
calculated on a comparable basis) on the previous year even though
energy consumption remained unchanged. The total emissions resulted
from the combustion of fossil fuels and purchases of electricity and
district heating from third-party energy producers.

Target Program

Approaches to saving energy. Our energy projects at all locations are
operated on the basis of exact record-keeping with the help of a dense
network of automatic electricity meters. Starting from this network, our
energy-saving measures focus on four points:
1.		 To avoid unnecessary use of energy during production breaks, we
use intelligent switch-off and stand-by controls.
2.		 We avoid the energy waste caused by compressed air leaks, heat
losses, and excessive process requirements (e.g. temperature
		 specifications) by exploiting the reduction potential in the production
processes themselves and in the building infrastructure.
3.		 We achieve the most significant efficiency increases by replacing
		 old production facilities with state-of-the-art plant technology and
constructing new buildings.
4.		 Moreover, we are using events and communication measures to
		 raise our employees’ and managers’ awareness of the need to save
energy. In addition, energy-saving suggestions are rewarded within
the scope of the company suggestions system.
Climate-friendly energy supply. For the heating of our plants we use
low-carbon natural gas and, where available, district heating. In many
locations, we use highly efficient combined heat and power facilities that
are operated either by Daimler or by a regional provider. The expansion
of combined heat and power (CHP) units is an important pillar of our
eco-friendly energy supply system. Since 2011 we have set up 46 CHP
modules with a total capacity of approximately 199 MW. With these modules alone, we can cover around 9 percent of our electricity and heating
requirements under optimized CO2 conditions.

Cooling from waste heat. In 2016 we installed an absorption cooling
system in our commercial vehicle plant in Ludwigsfelde in the German
federal state of Brandenburg. The system uses the waste heat of the
plant’s CHP unit which cannot be fed into the district-heating network
in order to supply cooling for plant’s paint booths. As a result, the plant
requires less electricity and generates less carbon dioxide. According
to expert estimates, this system reduces the plant’s CO2 emissions by
approximately 440 tons per year.

Solar panels power the logistics center. In 2016 the Mercedes-Benz
Global Logistics Center (GLC) in Germersheim connected a photovoltaic system consisting of 5,060 solar modules to the grid. On an area
of 15,000 square meters, this facility will produce over 1.3 million kWh
of electricity per year, almost all of which is consumed by the GLC itself.
Daimler invested around E1.4 million in the facility, which results in the
avoidance of 755,000 kilograms of CO2 emissions per year. Because
Daimler does not claim any subsidy for this facility under the German
Renewable Energy Act (EEG), the CO2 savings are credited in full to the
Group’s own CO2 balance.
Chennai relies on solar energy. In 2016, Daimler India Commercial
Vehicles (DICV) greatly expanded the existing photovoltaic system in
Chennai, India. More than 10,000 solar panels were added to the system,
increasing its total capacity to 3.3 MW. As a result, the facility can now
cover more than a fourth of its daily power requirement with renewable
energy.

According to the experts, such a concept could boost efficiency by an
additional 10 to 20 percent compared to the current level. Daimler is
implementing this approach not only in Germany and the rest of Europe
but also in South Africa, for example. The Mercedes-Benz plant in East
London, South Africa, is preparing to launch a pilot project that will for
the first time incorporate stationary energy storage units into a real-life
production environment as part of a smart grid.

A smart energy supply system for efficient production. As part of the
EU-funded project Automation and Robotics for European Sustainable
Manufacturing (AREUS), which was initiated by Daimler and other companies and successfully concluded in 2016, researchers and engineers developed approaches to the energy-efficient automobile production system
of the future. Its most important components were as follows:
1.		 Digital measuring technology,
2.		 Intelligent control of the facilities and the energy supply network,
3.		 Energy recovery during the slowing-down of the robots’ movements,
4.		 Intermediate storage of energy in order to be able to primarily use
renewable energy that is not equally available at all times,
5.		 Switching the energy supply of industrial robots from alternating
		 current, which is usually employed today, to direct current in order
		 to minimize conversion losses.

Solvents (volatile organic compounds or VOCs) in particular are released
during vehicle production. In addition, sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon
monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOX), and particulates are also emitted
into the atmosphere. Substances that damage the ozone layer are only
emitted in tiny residual amounts. Through the introduction of largely
solvent-free paint systems, we have already achieved a drastic reduction
of solvent emissions; Mercedes-Benz Cars, in particular, is the benchmark
here in comparison with its competitors. We are also unlocking further
reduction potential through the use of new technologies, primarily in
the painting of commercial vehicles and major components.

Waste and resource management
The recycling and reuse of raw materials, indirect materials, and supplies
in our plants has been a self-evident activity for years now. Thanks to
these measures, we currently have a waste utilization rate of 91 percent.
In addition, our cutting-edge technical processes and environmentally
sound production planning enable us to avoid waste from the very start.
With a view to meeting our special responsibility as a waste producer, we
regularly audit the waste disposal operators for our production plants in
accordance with an established process. None of our waste is exported
to other countries.

Effective resource management. As a company from an industry that
consumes large amounts of raw materials, we strive to carefully plan our
use of materials and to employ finite resources as sparingly as possible.
We purchase a large part of the materials used in our vehicles from suppliers in the form of components. Although the environmental effects of
purchased components are not directly included in the assessment of our
corporate environmental performance, we take them into account in our
holistic assessment of product development and selection of materials.
69

Target Program

Under this assessment method, which we have used for our passenger
cars thus far, we extrapolate the total use of materials in the production
chain, also taking the waste flows into account. Because of the size and
complexity of the Daimler Group, the material flows cannot be analyzed
in greater detail here. However, details of the individual model series are
provided in the respective life cycle reports.
	Product development and material selection: pp. 52 ff.
Efficient technologies have enabled us to reduce the use of scarce
resources to the absolute minimum. In the development stage, we already
plan in the recycling of materials at the end of the product life cycle.
In addition, we remanufacture used parts to a great extent. This yields
economic benefits for the customers and conserves resources.

Logistics and employee transport
The incoming and outgoing delivery traffic in our plants as well as the
distances our employees travel for work and business also affect our
environmental performance through emissions, noise, and resource use.
We minimize the environmental effects of these transports through the
use of an efficient logistics system, rail transportation, and inland shipping. We replace business travel by conference calls, video conferences
or online conferences wherever this is possible and expedient. Employees at the Sindelfingen and Stuttgart locations receive discounted yearly
passes for the public transit system.

* Beginning in 2016, the figure takes into account the CO2-neutral railway electrification
system used for long-distance transportation in Germany.

Truck deliveries to our German plants, the Hungarian plant in Kecskemét,
and the plant in Vitoria, Spain are monitored centrally. Since 2015, our
transport assessment has also included travel between plants. This
largely accounts for the increase in transport in 2016 compared to the
previous year. The CO2 emissions can be approximated on the basis of
the tonnage and the truck kilometers traveled.

We now select logistics concepts not only on the basis of their costs,
duration, and transport quality, but also according to their CO2 emissions.
When selecting providers of logistics services, we also take sustainability
criteria into account. These criteria range from environmental certificates
and the use of environmentally compatible equipment to the utilization
of trucks that meet the latest European emissions standard.

Optimization of transport logistics. Our global transport logistics
operations currently serve 75 manufacturing plants in around 30 countries and about 8,500 retailers in almost all areas of the world. We transported around 3.1 million vehicles worldwide in 2016. In addition, almost
4.1 million tons of production materials were transported in Europe
in the first half of 2016 alone. The global transport volume amounted
to around 380,000 standard containers of sea freight and about
75,000 tons of air freight.

Efficient return transport of shipping containers. One drawback of
reusable shipping containers is that they have to be sent back to the
supplier. In order to optimize this return transport, 17 Daimler plants in
Europe have joined forces with five regional logistics centers to create a
network and an IT-based container management system. These measures
eliminated about 2,200 tons of CO2 emissions in 2016 alone, compared
to the situation before the system was introduced. This has also significantly reduced our freight costs.

In order to reduce the associated CO2 emissions, we are working hard
to optimize our logistics network. Our main goal here is to optimally
connect the transportation hubs with one another so as to reduce the
distances traveled and utilize capacity more efficiently. Innovative transportation concepts and new transport systems also play a major role.

Our production plants cover a total area of around 4,800 hectares,
63 percent of which is occupied by buildings and transport areas.
Because land is a limited resource, we use these areas as efficiently as
possible through dense, multi-level building development. Whenever
possible, we also design outdoor areas within our plants to serve as a
habitat for indigenous plants and animals. In this way, we can facilitate
biodiversity even amidst the industrial architecture. For example, peregrine falcons have found a new home on chimneys of our plants in
Wörth and Sindelfingen. In the Tuscaloosa plant, natural vegetation and
beavers with their dams ensure the retention and preliminary sedimentation of rainwater. Due to the way we use land and our plant locations in
industrial zones, no significant negative effects on endangered species
are to be expected.
Biodiversity index. To measure the effect of our activities more
accurately, we have developed a biodiversity indicator whose practical
viability is currently being tested in several plants. The indicator categorizes our horizontal and vertical areas in accordance with their environmental value. This indicator will enable us to set targets for our plantspecific environmental protection programs and to clearly evaluate the
progress that has been made.

Target Program

The planting project at the Sindelfingen facility. Next spring,
50,000 flower bulbs of native species will ensure that the green areas
at the Sindelfingen plant will flourish and bloom. The plant spent around
E15,000 on the spring flowers, which will serve as an excellent food
source for insects such as wild bees, which are facing extinction. Last
October, the facility organized a project in which teams of employees
planted the bulbs. This project is only one of many that the plant and
its employees are implementing in order to maintain biodiversity.
An environmental protection zone in a semi-arid landscape. Daimler
has cooperated with biologists from the Autonomous University of Nuevo
León to create a botanical garden at the edge of the grounds of the
Mercedes-Benz bus plant in Monterrey, Mexico. For the facility’s employees, the garden is an oasis of peace and relaxation. Above all, this ecological reserve, which covers about two square kilometers, is helping to
preserve indigenous animals and vegetation. A wide variety of cactuses,
shrubs, palms, and other trees flourishes here. The semi-arid landscape
that has been left here in its natural state also serves as a habitat for
numerous animal species, some of which are on the endangered species
list.
Soil and groundwater. We prevent any soil and groundwater contamination as much as possible. An internal guideline provides minimum
standards for the handling of soil and groundwater contamination at all
of our locations. The requirements frequently extend beyond the local
legal regulations. Compliance with these requirements is reviewed within
the framework of our worldwide audits. In 2016 there were no significant
accidents associated with soil or groundwater damage.

Human resources strategy and objectives. We need skilled and dedicated employees so that we can be continuously successful and achieve
our goal of making a key contribution to the sustainable mobility of the
future. This means that we need to recruit, develop, and retain highly
qualified people. That’s why we are always striving to further increase our
already high appeal as an employer — within the company and on the
external market. Because our managers should motivate their employees
to achieve top performance, it is crucial that we equip our managers
with outstanding leadership skills. In addition, we want to take on social
responsibility and let diversity flourish in our global company. A professional HR organization and efficient operating processes form the basis
of our human resources strategy.
Areas of action. We have derived key areas of action from these overarching objectives — ranging from generation management to topics
such as diversity and equal opportunity, life balance, and the qualification
training of specialists in the growth markets. For each area of action
we have defined specific objectives that are also reflected in the target

Principles and guidelines. In our guidelines, such as our “Principles of
Social Responsibility,” we commit ourselves, among other things, to provide equal opportunities and respect key employee rights, ranging from
the right to form trade unions to the right to have equal opportunities and
receive equal pay for equal work. We reject forced labor and strive to
abolish exploitive child labor. We also require the same policies from our
business partners and suppliers. For violations of our principles, we have
established a complaints process in which each case is centrally documented and processed.

Safeguarding jobs. We strive to safeguard the jobs of our employees on
a permanent basis. Among the measures that help us achieve this target
are the “future plan” agreements that have been reached at many of our
locations in Germany and that include concrete investment commitments.
In 2015 we renewed our company-wide “Safeguarding the Future of
Daimler” agreement. It builds on the agreement that was first reached
in 2004 and renewed in 2011. It essentially protects all of the employees
of Daimler AG in Germany from being laid off until the end of 2020.

Suppliers

In addition, we utilize flexible personnel assignment models, which enable
us to make better use of market opportunities and absorb fluctuations
in demand. At the same time, these agreements help us respond more
effectively to rising manpower requirements in certain areas. We are continuously enhancing our working time regulations in order to safeguard
employment over the long term. In doing so, we achieve as much employment flexibility as possible — with regard to time and space as well as
work content.

Employee representation and co-determination. Our employees have
the right to organize themselves in labor unions. We also ensure this right
in countries in which the freedom of association is not protected. More
than 95 percent of our employees in Germany and more than 80 percent
of our employees worldwide are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Our employees in Germany have extensive co-determination rights
which are regulated by the German Labor Management Relations Act
(BetrVG). Although there is no requirement to adhere to collective bargaining agreements at some Group companies, the employees at these
companies have works councils in keeping with the above-mentioned law.
Partnership with employee representatives. We work together constructively with the works councils and trade unions. Important partners
here include the World Employee Committee (WEC) and the European
Works Council. The WEC is represented in 15 countries. At the corporate level, ten members of the Supervisory Board represent employee
interests.
Comprehensive information, regular communication. We inform the
works council about all important changes and conclude agreements
regarding the effects wherever the German Labor Management Relations
Act requires it. We notify the employees about far-reaching changes early
on. In addition, the employee representative bodies at the Group and
company levels (the Group Joint Management-Employee Economic
Committee and the WEC) are also informed about the economic situation
and important changes within the Group and at the Group companies.
Moreover, we regularly inform the WEC of any violations of our Principles
of Social Responsibility.

Target Program

Further development of the company: Leadership 2020. Our industry
is changing at an unprecedented pace. This development is affecting
not only technology, the legal framework, and customer requirements,
but also the way we work and communicate with one another, as well
as forms of management. In order to remain as successful in the future
as we have been in the past 130 years, we need to undergo an internal
cultural transformation and develop a new management culture. This
is why we launched the Leadership 2020 initiative in January 2016. For
this program, we selected 144 employees from 24 countries and all levels
of management and asked them to develop proposals for a new management culture at Daimler. After being grouped into eight teams around the
world, the participants worked separately on developing new leadership
approaches, but were given no specific instructions for this task. The
teams defined eight thematic areas referred to as game-changers. These
game-changers are processes and procedures that change, question or
break down established structures in a targeted way in order to make a
new management culture possible. We have also identified eight leadership principles that will define our future management approach and
guide the actions of managers and employees. In this way, Leadership
2020 will noticeably generate new momentum for our company’s future.

Employees identify themselves strongly with the company. The
opinion of our employees is important to us. That’s why we regularly
conduct employee surveys to determine how satisfied our employees
are and how strongly they identify themselves with the company.
In the 2016 employee survey, we achieved an outstanding participation
rate of 76 percent, which shows that our employees are interested in
becoming actively involved in our company’s further development. The
survey results are also impressive. The Employee Commitment Index
(ECI), which measures, among other things, employee satisfaction and
our appeal as an employer, rose to 68 points, which is the best result
to date. The ECI result was therefore five points higher than in the survey
of 2014 and thus represents an improvement in our ranking that puts
us among the top 33% companies in an external benchmark comparison.
The feedback we receive helps us enhance our organization and management culture.

Attractive and fair remuneration. We remunerate work in accordance
with the same principles at all our affiliates around the world. Our Corporate Compensation Policy establishes the framework conditions and
minimum requirements for this. It applies to all groups of employees. In
our desire to offer attractive salaries and benefits we also give consideration to local market conditions within the specified framework. We audit
the local compensation systems on a regular basis through sampling
procedures.
Industry-typical salaries. The salaries are determined on the basis of
the employees’ tasks and performance, and in line with their qualifications and experience. We pay salaries that are customary for the market
and the industry, which are significantly above the legal minimum wages
that apply at many locations. In addition to the statutory minimum wages,
salaries and wages are often determined by collective bargaining agreements. In the event of union affiliations, our affiliates generally offer
additional voluntary benefits. For example, the employees of Daimler AG
in Germany currently receive a total remuneration that is significantly
above the level specified in collective bargaining agreements.
Weekend work and overtime. The length of our employees’ workweek
is generally regulated by the company or by a collective bargaining agreement. In Germany, the workweek is 35 hours long in the manufacturing
sector, although deviating agreements are possible. Overtime is only
performed within the framework of a requirements planning forecast and
has to be approved. In general, we allocate working times in such a way
that remuneration remains stable even if the amount of work sometimes
fluctuates. This is made possible by a time-account system.
Fair pay. In setting the base remuneration we are not guided by gender
or place of origin, but exclusively by the employee’s job and responsibility,
and we thus eliminate all forms of discrimination. Salary decisions
are made on the basis of the “multiple-eye principle.” Transparency is

Compensation of managers. The more responsible the position, the
higher the variable remuneration component. On the one hand, the
variable component takes into consideration the company’s performance.
On the other, it is based on the extent to which the manager has achieved
the individually agreed targets, which are discussed between managers
and their supervisors as part of a globally uniform process. Sustainability
criteria also play a role in this context.
Performance assessment and target-oriented leadership. In order to
measure and control each individual’s performance, we use standardized
leadership processes such as LEAD for managers and NAVI for employees
of Daimler AG. In these processes, the individual agrees to quantitative
and qualitative targets with his or her supervisor, and employees generally agree to a personal development goal as well. Depending on the
individual’s position and management level, the objectives also include
diversity and compliance targets.
At the end of the year the supervisor decides whether the objectives
have been reached. The individuals’ goal attainment and leadership and
work performance as well as the employees’ development potential
are then discussed in company-wide management conferences. The
supervisor personally discusses the results with the employee. Potential
measures for professional development are then discussed as well.

Target Program

Attractive company pension plans. Upon retirement, our employees
can generally expect to receive attractive company pensions — in addition
to the statutory and privately financed benefits. This applies to both fulltime and part-time employees. Depending on the country and company,
we generally offer defined benefit or defined contribution pension plans.
In addition, employees can also make additional provisions for retirement
by means of deferred compensation.
All permanent employees of Daimler AG are entitled to participate in the
company pension plan. As a result, they not only receive such a pension
in old age but are also covered against premature insured events such as
disability and death. The employee-funded company pension plans and
the pension benefits are generally also available to temporarily employed
people.

The Global Pension Policy stipulates the requirements for our pension
plan models. We cover the majority of our pension obligations with pension assets. In addition, the pension plans of the employees in Germany
are insured by the German businesses’ Mutual Benefit Association for
Pension Security (PSVaG). It is impossible to make general statements
about the percentage of salaries that is deducted for pension plans,
because these plans vary widely worldwide in terms of their type and
extent.

Diversity management
Daimler promotes the diversity and heterogeneity of its employees, because they serve as the basis for a successful and high-performing company. As a result, diversity management has been part of our corporate
strategy since 2005. Our activities aim to bring the right people together
for overcoming our challenges; to create a work culture that promotes
the performance, motivation, and satisfaction of our employees and
managers; and to help us access new target groups for our products and
services.
At Daimler, we currently shape diversity in three fields of action: best
mix, work culture, and customer access. With regard to our workforce,
the focus is on the areas of best mix and work culture.
Diversity brochure “Ready to Be Different” (PDF)

All the members of the Daimler Board of Management support our Diversity Statement and actively advocate the realization of its principles:
–		 Promoting diversity. We respect and appreciate the diversity of
		 our employees. We encourage them to contribute this diversity to the
company.
–		 Creating connections. We utilize the multifaceted experiences,
		 perspectives, and skills of our employees around the world. They
		 reflect the diversity of our customers, suppliers, and investors.
–		 Shaping the future. Each individual makes a contribution to
		 creating an environment characterized by respect and mutual appreciation. This is how we are shaping Daimler’s future together.
Best mix. Daimler’s 282,488 employees from 156 countries provide the
Group with a vibrant mixture of cultures and ways of life. We utilize this
diversity to put together optimized teams. That’s because the more facets
are expressed within the company, the faster ideas will bear fruit.

Gender. Daimler has the self-designated target of increasing the share of
women in management positions in the Group to 20 percent by the year
2020. In 2016, more than 16 percent of our executives in middle and upper management were women. To achieve our objective, we have installed
a stringent internal reporting and forecasting system and are promoting
women through special programs and seminars. This applies in particular
to female professionals in the fields of engineering and technology. In
2016, approximately 40 percent of the trainees who entered the company
through our CAReer program were women.

Generations. Demographic change is also occurring within our factories.
The latest forecasts show that the average age of the Daimler AG employees in Germany will rise from 44.2 years today to about 47 years in
seven years’ time. The rising age of retirement and longer working life will
increase the age differences within the company. We consider the demographic transformation to be an opportunity, and we are using our generation management measures to help adapt ourselves to these challenges.
In doing so, we are specifically focusing on measures for maintaining the
health and performance of younger and older employees and promoting
cooperation between people of all ages.
80

Target Program

–		 We encourage mutual respect among all age groups and promote
productive collaboration. We hold workshops and seminars to raise
the awareness of managers in particular regarding work with people
from different generations.
–		 We are using qualification measures and employment methods that
encourage “lifelong learning” in order to promote our employees’
		 further development and ensure their employability.
–		 To maintain our employees’ capabilities, we make ergonomic
		 improvements, offer courses on how employees can promote their
health, and develop innovative work organization concepts.
–		 Our strategic HR Resource Management system helps us to adapt
our workforce structures in line with our needs. This method enables
us to prepare ourselves for demographic capacity effects early on.

Global assignments. Throughout the world, around 1,965 Daimler employees from 34 countries are taking part in international assignments.
By far the most important country in which assignees from Germany work
is China, with a share of almost 30 percent. It is followed by the United
States at approximately 15 percent and Japan at around 4 percent.
Other important target countries include Mexico, Romania, and Hungary.
However, we also promote the assignment of employees from our global
locations to Germany so that they can build up networks and deepen
their know-how. Such expats from abroad also help to make Daimler
in Germany more international. We currently have around 320 global
assignees in Germany, with most of them coming from India, the United
States, and China.

Work culture. We are creating appropriate framework conditions to
strengthen our supportive work culture, which is based on appreciation
and respect. These measures range from fair and flexible working time
regulations to mobile working from home and on the road.
Flexible working arrangements. Changed living and working conditions
require working times to be flexibly organized in accordance with individual needs. We are convinced that we need to request and promote high
performance, not attendance. That’s why we take targeted measures
to boost the performance of our employees and managers especially with
regard to the reconciliation of their work and private lives.

Reconciling work and family. Of the 2,804 employees who took advantage of parental leave during 2016, 71 percent (2015: 69 percent) were
men. More than 90 percent of the fathers took two “partner months”
of leave. We encourage all employees who take parental leave to subsequently return to their jobs at the company. That’s because we value the
knowledge and experience of our employees so much that we cannot
do without them and don’t wish to lose them.

Target Program

In Germany, we offer around 710 places in daycare centers in close
proximity to our company locations as well as approximately 175 reserved
places at cooperating facilities. In addition, we cooperate with a third
party that assists employees in finding childcare providers.
In September 2015, we set up our first “sternchen” daycare center outside Germany. Located in Hungary, the facility can take care of more than
60 employee children aged six or younger. Company-run daycare centers
also exist in Switzerland, the United States, and Japan. A new “sternchen”
daycare center was opened in Bremen in May 2016. In addition, we offer
places for refugee children in Kassel.
Furthermore, work agreements enable employees to suspend their
careers for several years for a qualification program or a sabbatical or to
provide home care — with the promise that they can return to Daimler
afterwards. In 2016, around 460 employees took advantage of the opportunity to take off work for a prolonged period, with 349 doing so in order
to attend qualification measures (2015: 388), 100 to take a sabbatical
(2015: 832), and 10 to provide home care (2015: 6).
We also offer a variety of events for employees on parental or family
leave. For example, we organize dialog meetings and information events
for expectant parents and for employees who take care of dependents.
Job sharing. We also promote job sharing, in which two employees share
the same task/position and work up to 30 hours per week each. In this
way, we help our employees reconcile the needs of their work and their
private lives. This is especially important for managers, whom we thus
enable to work part-time. However, this arrangement requires reliable
agreements by everyone involved, and in particular by Daimler, the
employer. In mid-2016, more than 160 employees were working in jobsharing positions at the team and department levels.

all of our locations. The result is a future-oriented company-wide agreement that went into force on December 1, 2016. The agreement gives
employees the right to mobile working if the task permits. In this way,
Daimler is promoting greater flexibility and self-determination while building on a culture of trust.

Our international exchange program for trainees and trainers fulfills
the basic requirements for mobility and flexibility, as well as for foreign
language and intercultural skills. In 2016, more than 100 trainees and
15 trainers had a chance to gather their first international experience.
Moreover, ten trainees took part in an exchange project in Poland in

In addition, we are continuously internationalizing our training activities
in order to achieve high training standards throughout the Group. For
example, we have developed the Mercedes-Benz Qualification System
(MBQS) for our international passenger car locations. In several countries,
we are creating our own company training centers and qualification
structures or supporting the respective region’s offers. Furthermore, we
are also establishing dual education elements outside Germany.
Daimler currently employs a total of 7,960 trainees (2015: 8,307), including 2,034 abroad (2015: 2,017). At international locations such as those
in China and India, more than 5,000 teenagers are being trained and qualified in cooperation with schools and in other training models. This figure
is continuing to increase.

Further training and qualification — lifelong. In keeping with the
principle of lifelong learning, we enable our employees to obtain further
education and training — professional as well as personal — throughout
their careers. Once a year, supervisors and employees meet to discuss
qualification topics and agree on appropriate measures.

Further education is regulated by the general works agreement on qualification, which also enables employees to leave the company for up to five
years in order to obtain additional qualifications, and subsequently return
to the company. In 2016, around 400 employees used this opportunity.
Moreover, managers can facilitate employees’ qualification efforts with
time credits and financial support.
Challenges and key areas of qualification
Digitalization: We are supporting the digital transformation of our company by creating a framework in which we can provide our employees
with the necessary digital capabilities. To achieve this goal, we are working to recruit and bind digital talents, create a digital management culture
and organization, and identify the qualification and further education
requirements of the entire workforce.

“Bridge” internships for refugees. The main aim of the “bridge” internships that Daimler initiated at the end of 2015 is to integrate refugees
into the German labor market. The participants in the 14-week internships work 3.5 hours per day at an industrial facility and spend another
3.5 hours each day attending a German language course. Almost 600 refugees have taken part in these internships in Germany to date. More
than 60 percent of these refugees come from Syria. After completing the
internships, many graduates attend additional language courses. Some of
them were directly hired by other companies, while others were recruited
for a trainee position or entry-level qualification measures at Daimler.
Beginning with the 2016 hiring year, Daimler is also offering 50 additional
trainee positions especially for refugees.

Maintaining and promoting employee health. As part of our health
management measures, we develop forward-looking solutions that are
implemented at the company. These solutions range from the workplacerelated “Daimler HealthCheck” to ergonomic workplace design and
an IT system that makes it easier to permanently reintegrate employees
whose health is impaired.
Company health promotion is aimed at motivating employees to
develop healthy lifestyles and reinforcing their sense of personal responsibility regarding health issues. This objective is promoted worldwide with
the help of campaigns, counseling, and qualification offerings, as well
as therapeutic and rehabilitation measures. All of our plants in Germany
have health centers on their premises or cooperate with health centers
located near the plants.
In cooperation with our health centers, we offer, among other things,
scientifically evaluated programs for helping employees suffering from
chronic back complaints.

The ergonomics strategy. To enable us to cooperate more efficiently
on ergonomics issues and improve ergonomics in the product creation
processes, Daimler developed and approved a new ergonomics strategy
for the Mercedes-Benz Cars, Mercedes-Benz Vans, Daimler Trucks,
and Daimler Buses divisions. The strategy is valid worldwide and encompasses the following targets and areas of action:
-		The use of the ergonomics standards in all areas of development,
planning, and production
-		 Responsibility for ergonomics from the concept stage all the way to
		 series production
-		 Continuous ergonomic improvements
-		 Qualification of the employees and managers
-		 Introduction of ergonomics at the international level
-		 Demographics-appropriate workstations that will remain viable
		 in the future
IT project for ergonomics assessment. As part of the EAB 2.0 project,
we are working on an IT solution for standardized ergonomics assessment
methods. Our objective is to document the assessments in a database to
ensure that uniform ergonomics processes and systematic ergonomics
analyses can be established at all divisions. The database is scheduled to
be introduced in early 2017.
IT process for assigning employees to tasks that are in line with
their capabilities. We have developed a special IT system that enables
employees suffering from health-related limitations to be permanently
reintegrated into existing work processes. With the help of this system,
we can determine which jobs correspond to an employee’s capabilities.
As a result, we can utilize employees in line with their physical capabilities.

Human-robot collaboration. New safety concepts are needed as we
head toward Industry 4.0. In this context, we have developed a humanrobot collaboration safety concept that is used at all production facilities
that involve such collaboration. This concept serves as the basis for the
EC-conformity declaration. The concept’s modular structure enables it
to be flexibly used for a wide variety of different applications — regardless
of whether a robot takes on an assisting or service-supporting role or
operates completely automatically.
Wearable computing systems. An important topic for Industry 4.0 is
the use of digital devices in manufacturing. These wearable computer
systems open up new and better opportunities for the design of work and
processes. However, we need to take into account not only occupational
safety risks, but also ergonomic and medical stress factors. Our work
here is also based on a danger and risk assessment that we and the Technology Factory jointly developed and tested in a pilot project.
HR initiative Life Balance. Our HR initiative Life Balance helps employees reconcile their professional responsibilities with their private lives,
and thus also serves to keep them healthy. To do so, managers and
employees conduct dialog-focused workshops on the basis of shared
corporate guidelines concerning life balance. In addition, we have a
broad range of measures that help ensure a proper life balance for our
employees.
Determining the health risks of psychological stress. We are using
our system for determining the health risks of psychological stress (GPB)
to find potential stress factors related to the employees’ daily work.
Each Daimler AG location has GPB assessment teams composed of occupational safety experts, works council members, and company doctors.

Preventing accidents and making workplaces safe. Daimler’s occupational safety program includes all measures for the prevention of work
accidents, work-related illnesses, and occupational diseases. Our Center
of Competence Safety creates the associated Group-wide guidelines.
Key occupational and health protection processes are standardized in
order to enable the creation and advancement of integrated processes
and systems.
Every organizational unit within the Daimler Group has to approve and
pursue occupational safety objectives on a regular basis in accordance
with our occupational health and safety guidelines and occupational
safety strategy and the results of audits and reviews. Centers of Experts
help the organizational units address overarching topics such as machine
safety and the handling of hazardous materials. An effective reporting
procedure helps the units achieve the previously set targets.
Our managers are responsible for ensuring that all internal guidelines and
legal requirements for occupational health and safety are complied with.
Each location regulates the responsibilities and obligations in line with
local conditions. The responsible managers are assisted by experts in the
field of occupational health and safety.
89

Our occupational health and safety guidelines focus on prevention
and continuous improvement. The guidelines emphasize the managers’
obligation to act responsibly but also underscore the fact that the
employees have to actively participate in the associated measures.
The occupational safety and health management guideline of
Daimler AG regulates the tasks, responsibilities, and communication
activities for the implementation of the occupational health and safety
measures from the headquarters functions down to the individual company locations. Among other things, the guideline stipulates that each
location must have an occupational safety committee. These committees
consist of the location managers, the responsible planning officers, occupational health and safety experts, and the employee representatives.

system. It ensures that the database is correct by enabling users to
access the source systems for the hours of attendance, lost days, and
organizational structures.
Component concept for risk assessment. Our concept for assessing
the risks of workplaces and work processes investigates individual
processes (components). All of these individual assessments combined
then generate the overall assessment. The concept is continuously
adapted to legal changes and optimized. We are currently developing a
risk assessment system for test drives and the use of drones.
Campaign for moving safely through the plants. The occupational
safety campaign sICHer, which was launched in 2015, was continued in

are actively supporting the creation of new test courses in countries
such as Brazil and the United States.
Accidents. Unfortunately, two fatal accidents occurred in 2016 — one

Medical care for employees. At Daimler, occupational and emergency
medicine includes all measures for the prevention of work-related illnesses and occupational diseases, health maintenance in the workplace,
and the diagnosis and treatment of acute illnesses and accident-related
injuries. It lies within the area of responsibility of our plant and company
physicians worldwide.

The specialist departments and the occupational health and safety organization are responsible for implementing preventive health measures.
After a risk assessment team has systematically recorded all of the
possible risks, the employee in question is medically examined in accordance with Germany’s Regulation on Preventive Occupational Medicine
(ArbMedVV).

Daimler AG provides all of its employees with comprehensive medical
care. This care is supplemented by the measures and services of the
company health program and the personal counseling organization.
If an employee is suspected of suffering from an occupational illness, the
company documents the occupational medical checkups and doctors’
diagnoses and reports the information to the responsible employers’
liability insurance association.

course. Our Supplier Sustainability Standards serve as the basis of all our business relations with suppliers.
We continuously develop these stipulations and monitor their implementation.

Our responsibility does not end at the gates of our plants. Instead,
we obligate our direct suppliers to uphold our Sustainability Standards and introduce them into their own supply chains. We promote
this effort through dialog and qualification measures as well as
joint initiatives with other manufacturers. We check to make sure
that our standards are complied with and that violations have
appropriate consequences.
Our success depends in large part on our good and trusting cooperation
with suppliers all over the world. This cooperation is based on shared
requirements and values, which include the companies’ compliance with
our Sustainability Standards along the supply chain.
Around 3,200 employees work in Daimler’s procurement units at more
than 70 locations worldwide. Our established procurement management
committees ensure the cross-departmental management of sustainability
issues as well as uniform communications within and outside the organization. We regularly keep our employees up to date about new developments with regard to sustainability and compliance. In addition, introductory training programs about these issues are mandatory for all new
employees.
Increasing procurement responsibility at the local level. As part of its
global growth strategy, Daimler is increasingly shifting its value added to
the respective sales markets and production locations. We are therefore
continuing to expand our procurement organizations’ international presence. As a result, in the future Procurement will incorporate additional
local suppliers in order to increase the local share of its value added. This
will bring clear advantages in terms of sustainability. In growth markets
such as China and Mexico, conducting our procurement activities close to
production locations will support local regions. In addition, it will reduce
our logistics costs and thus our CO2 emissions as well.

Our Sustainability Standards
Our Supplier Sustainability Standards define our requirements for
working conditions, human rights, environmental protection, safety, business ethics, and compliance. They are a binding component of the contractual conditions and form the basis of all of our business relations with
manufacturing suppliers and service providers worldwide. By signing the
contract, our direct suppliers commit to observing our Sustainability Standards, communicating them to their employees, and spreading them to
their upstream value chains as well. We support them in this by providing
targeted information and training measures. The Daimler Supplier Portal
is the central information platform for this purpose.
Supplier Sustainability Standards — text

Environmental management in the supply chain. Our suppliers exert
considerable influence on Daimler’s overall ecological balance. That’s why
we closely integrate them into our concept of sustainable environmental
protection. We expect our suppliers to take on responsibility for the environment, and we request proof of certified environmental management
along the supply chain according to ISO 14001, EMAS or other comparable standards. On a revenue basis, our goal is to require 70 percent of
our suppliers of production materials to have such a certificate by 2018.
Great progress has been made here. We also expect selected suppliers
of non-production materials to have an environmental certificate. We will
select these suppliers by means of a risk filter.

Dialog and training. We believe that good cooperation along the global
supply chains is essential in order to permanently ensure sustainability.
This cooperation involves staying in close touch with our suppliers. We
also include in this process the local supplier industry in countries with
sustainability risks. In cooperation with other automobile manufacturers,
our Procurement unit has been organizing supplier training courses since
2010. In 2016 we also organized the first sector-focused Sustainable
Supply Chain Logistics Forum in Berlin.
We now also offer a special e-learning training program that all of our
existing and potential suppliers can use on an ongoing basis to further
enhance their knowledge about sustainability. It is available in German,
English, Spanish, and Chinese. In 2016 we cooperated with econsense
to add a module called “Respecting Human Rights in the Supply Chain.”
In this module we specify our expectations regarding our suppliers’ due
diligence regarding human rights. The suppliers working with this module
receive practical examples and a checklist that shows how conditions in
areas such as working times and occupational safety can be improved.
This training module also provides guidelines for purchasing officers and
offers further information.
	Training modules for suppliers worldwide
	Supplier training courses in China
To implement sustainability standards in the supply chain, we also hold
discussions as part of our stakeholder dialog events. In 2016, the Procurement unit initiated a dialog with its most important stakeholders on
the topic of human rights in the supply chain. The goal of this dialog
was to shine a spotlight on risks related to human rights and to discuss
approaches to solutions. Through these measures we are ensuring our
continuous improvement.

Target Program

Social standards for contracts for work and services. The awarding
and performance of contracts for work and services are subject to standards that extend beyond the existing legislation. These standards define
our requirements with regard to occupational health and safety, accommodation, remuneration, use of temporary employees, commissioning
of subcontractors, and freelancing. These social principles are relevant
for all orders that exceed a period of two months and are realized on the
business premises of Daimler AG in Germany. All of the relevant service
providers must sign a declaration that they comply with these standards.
Only if they fulfill this prerequisite can they receive new purchase orders.
An auditing team from Procurement determines whether the standards
are being complied with.
Cooperating on sustainable supply chains. To make global supply
chains more sustainable, we have actively participated for years in various
national and international trade and industrial associations. These include
econsense, the Association of Supply Chain Management, Procurement
and Logistics (BME), the German Association of the Automotive Industry
(VDA), the American Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG), and the
European Automotive Working Group on Sustainability in the Supply
Chain, an industry initiative within the CSR Europe corporate network.
The goal of this collaboration is to create a frame of reference for companies and industries that is recognized all over the world. The social
and environmental minimum standards that are defined in the document
“Automotive Industry Guiding Principles to Enhance Sustainability Performance in the Supply Chain” have been recognized not only by numerous
automakers but also by many of our suppliers on the recommendation
of the VDA.
As part of CSR Europe, we are cooperating with experts from the procurement units of other manufacturers to develop tools for minimizing
sustainability risks. For example, we have developed an industry-wide
questionnaire with which suppliers can self-assess their sustainability

performance. Today this questionnaire is being used and continuously
refined by all the companies that are members of the initiative. We have
set ourselves the target of rating 70 percent of our suppliers (revenuebased in terms of our annual procurement volume) by means of this
self-assessment questionnaire by 2018. Last year we once again made
significant progress; in 2016 alone, we received self-assessments from
approximately 200 of our highest-volume suppliers. In addition, we specifically used the questionnaire in high-risk non-production-material product
groups such as transport logistics. On the basis of these results, we derive measures for improving sustainability performance and communicate
these measures to our suppliers.
Further results of our cooperation with other automakers and associations in 2016 include the ongoing development of the questionnaire
contents and our preparations to distribute the questionnaire through our
direct suppliers to their partner suppliers. In the future we will further
intensify our cooperation with industry-wide initiatives in order to gain
further synergy effects. We are convinced that comprehensive sustainability standards and a shared monitoring process will increase the
effectiveness of sustainability measures along the entire supply chain.

Responsible raw material procurement. Certain mining regions of
the world are exposed to the risk that armed conflicts could be financed
with the revenues from the sale of raw materials and minerals such
as tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold. To prevent this from happening,
various voluntary initiatives and government regulations are calling for
the responsible procurement of these raw materials and clear declaration
of their origins. In the United States, for example, the Dodd-Frank Act

95

Suppliers

stipulates that companies listed on US stock exchanges must certify the
source of these commodities along the entire supply chain. In Europe,
the European Union is also preparing to enact legislation concerning this
issue.
Daimler supports an effective and practicable approach to ensuring
the responsible procurement of raw materials. We are already exerting
our influence on our direct suppliers with regard to this issue. To make
sure that this process includes as many links as possible of our very long
and often very complex supplier chain, we are cooperating with many
different associations. For example, we are working within the German
Association of the Automotive Industry to develop effective approaches
to a solution for the entire sector.
In addition, as part of our “Daimler Sustainability Dialogue” we have
discussed the theme of human rights in supply chains, using concrete
examples. Suppliers as well as representatives of nongovernmental
organizations participated in these discussions.

Sustainability management in the supply chain

We use a multi-stage concept to implement uniform sustainability standards and monitor their observance in our global supply chain.
1.		 Regular review of our active suppliers. To identify sustainability
risks with regard to issues such as child labor, environmental pro		 tection, corruption prevention, violation of freedom of association, and
violations of human rights at an early stage, we conduct risk analysis
of our suppliers by country and commodity at regular intervals. This
analysis enables us to identify suppliers that are subject to increased
risk and to take preventive measures. We use regular media and data		 base research as well as targeted on-site visits to investigate cases
in which our standards of sustainability and compliance have actually
been violated. We systematically follow up all reports of violations.

The whistleblower system BPO (Business Practices Office) enables

The whistleblower system BPO: pp. 24 f.

3.		 Escalation process. In the event of a suspected or actual violation
against our sustainability standards by a supplier, we follow an established escalation process. We work very closely with the employee
representatives when dealing with human rights issues. We cooperate
with the corporate environmental protection unit when investigating
		 violations of environmental standards. If necessary, trained experts
and independent auditors conduct sustainability audits at our sup		 pliers. In justified cases we refrain from placing further orders or terminate the cooperation until it is demonstrated that the irregularities
have been remedied.

As a globally operating company, we regard it as our responsibility to support social progress all over the
world. We want to help shape the social environment at our locations and support the dialog between
cultures. To this end, we promote education, science, art and culture, and nature conservation. In addition,
we support initiatives for increasing traffic safety and assist our employees’ charitable activities.

As a result of our global presence, we must promote social progress
at our locations and contribute to its advancement. We seek to
co-design the social environment worldwide and to support the
dialog between various cultures. To this end, we support education,
science, art and culture, as well as efforts to improve environmental
protection. We also support initiatives for increasing traffic safety
and encourage our employees to make donations and become
involved in charitable activities.
For us, business success and social responsibility go hand in hand. As a
company, we strive to contribute to the advancement of society and to
effectively shape, help, and promote its development. Together with
our employees we are involved in many charitable community projects in
order to help meet social challenges and create noticeable benefits.
As a globally operating company, we have the opportunity to co-design
the social environment at our locations worldwide and to support the
dialog between various cultures. In this context, we focus on the one
hand on fields of action that arise from our role as a “good neighbor.”
On the other, we are involved in projects in which we can contribute our
specific expertise and our core competencies as an automaker. Our main
emphasis is on the following issues: promotion of science, education
and traffic safety, nature conservation, art and culture, community and
charitable work, dialog, and understanding. In addition, we support our
employees’ commitment to social welfare projects.
In 2016, we spent almost E60 million on donations to non-profit organizations and the sponsorship of socially beneficial projects, in addition to
our foundation activities, corporate volunteering efforts, and projects
that we ourselves initiated.

Effective control, high transparency. The donations and sponsorship
committee of the Board of Management manages all of our donations and
sponsorship activities around the world. The committee is guided by our
Sponsorship and Donations Policy, which specifies binding regulations
concerning criteria, legal provisions, and ethical standards. Transparency
is additionally facilitated by the donations and sponsorship database, in
which all donations and sponsorship activities of the Group worldwide
must be recorded. Regular communication measures help our employees
to observe the policies worldwide and make them aware of the risks
associated with donations and sponsorships.
We provide donations to political parties in strict compliance with
established laws. Our internal corporate policy explicitly requires a Board
of Management resolution for all donations to political parties. In 2016,
we supported the democratic parties exclusively in Germany with a total
of E320,000. Of this total, the CDU and SPD each received E100,000,
and the FDP, CSU, and Bündnis 90/the Green Party E40,000 each.

Promoting science
Sustainable development is not possible without the targeted global promotion of science, research, and technology. Sharing knowledge across
borders and promoting innovation are important factors in this respect.
We therefore support universities, research institutes, and interdisciplinary science projects around the globe. We have consolidated these
activities in foundations.
Environmental protection and ultra-safe technology are two of the
fields in which the Daimler and Benz Foundation is supporting research.
Endowed with E125 million, the foundation promotes the in-depth scientific exploration of research ideas that can have an important impact on
society. Furthermore, it supports a mobility think tank that was expressly
established to investigate the effects and socially relevant aspects associated with autonomous driving.

Education
Education creates opportunities and opens up doors to a future full of
possibilities. We believe that improving access to education is one of the
most long-lasting investments we can make for society and for our company. We are involved in a variety of education projects around the world
with a view to promoting people’s enthusiasm for science and technology
and also their ability to look beyond the working world and go through
life with an open mind. The projects we support also promote equal
opportunity.

Self-driving automobiles will be a key technology of the future. However, they will also pose new challenges to road users and society. The
Daimler and Benz Foundation is investing around E1.5 million in the “Villa
Ladenburg” project, in which researchers are examining the future effects
of self-driving vehicles on road traffic.

More curiosity — more future. This is the motto of the “Genius —
Daimler’s young knowledge community” education initiative, which is
targeted at children and teenagers and their teachers. The latter are
given special training and provided with teaching materials that introduce
children to new automotive technologies in an entertaining and practical
way and also get them interested in technology and research.

Traffic safety
Our “journey on the road to accident-free driving” is not just about using
suitable systems to relieve the burden on drivers, protect them, and support them in hazardous situations. For us it is more a question of ensuring
the safety of all road users. We pursue this goal with traffic-education
projects for schoolchildren and safety training programs for adults, for
example.
MobileKids celebrates an anniversary. In 2016, our MobileKids program celebrated 15 years of successful traffic safety training in Germany
and around the world. To date, MobileKids has made more than two million children fit for road traffic worldwide. In 2015, Daimler also launched
a new traffic safety campaign in India known as the “Safe Road Project —
A Safety Initiative.”

Nature conservation
We share the responsibility for preserving the diversity of natural habitats
for future generations. That is why we have been supporting the projects
and initiatives of environmental organizations around the world for many
years now. In this way, we contribute to making sure the earth remains a
place worth living in.
Thriving wetlands are valuable habitats and carbon sinks. With the
support of Daimler, nature conservationists are rescuing two wetlands in
Germany (one in the Black Forest, the other in the Allgäu region) that are
at risk of drying out.
Working together to stop the decline of mangroves. Mangrove forests
line the coasts of many Asian countries, where they are an indispensable
part of the protective ecosystem. Because these forests are greatly
endangered, the Global Nature Fund is planting new mangroves.
Life-preserving water. In areas near our locations in India, Brazil, and
Mozambique, we are working together with Caritas International from
the beginning of 2016 to November 2018 in order to run projects that
promote the sustainable use of water resources. Climate change is threatening to make entire tracts of land uninhabitable in those countries. Here,
project workers are creating reliable water supply systems and providing
training and knowledge to local farmers. We are also planning to hold
two multi-day forums in which project participants and Caritas employees
can share experiences and work together to enhance the joint project.
The results of these forums will then be shared with all the project
partners in the Caritas network so that they can benefit other projects
as well.

Art and culture
Art has the power to build bridges. A rich cultural life and a vibrant art
scene also foster creativity and innovation. That is why promoting art and
culture is very important to us. Our cultural activities include the Daimler
Art Collection, which was founded in 1977 and has now grown to around
2,600 works by 700 different artists. The emphasis of our activities is
generally on the regional promotion of culture, with a focus on jazz,
classical music, and the promotion of film in addition to the visual arts.
Cultural partnerships around the world. In Germany’s capital, we are a
partner of the Berlin Philharmonic. In Stuttgart, we sponsor the animated
film festival and the jazzopen. Our cooperation with Stuttgart’s Theaterhaus theater goes back a long way. The theater is well known far beyond
the confines of the city. In China, we are involved in a strategic partnership with the National Center for the Performing Arts and we sponsor
the International Music Festival. In South Africa, we are active as partners
of the “21 icons” project. This initiative strives to inspire young people to
follow in the footsteps of national icons like Nelson Mandela.
Sponsoring culture. We also support the Internationale Bachakademie
and are the main sponsor of the BACHBEWEGT! SINGEN! project and the
MusikfeSTuttgart music festival as part of this support. We support the
Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation in order to increase the importance
of culture in society and make sure that Germany’s rich cultural heritage
remains visible and tangible.
The Emerging Artist Award helps young artists start out on their
careers. With our support, the award provides funding for a particularly
promising graduate of the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan each

Emergency relief for Haiti. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew hit
Haiti with winds of up to 220 km/h, causing severe damage and killing
hundreds of people. Around 1.4 million people have since then been dependent on outside assistance. In the aftermath, Daimler and Germany’s

a cholera outbreak by improving hygienic conditions. More than
2,100 cholera sets for water purification have been shipped to Nippes
so far; another 1,000 sets are ready to be sent. Moreover, a broad-based
vaccination campaign has been launched in order to protect up to one
million people from cholera. The project partners also supplied tools and
materials for cleanup work and the restoration of the country’s heavily
damaged agriculture.
Extensive support for refugees. Daimler has been helping refugees
for a long time. For example, it has cooperated with Wings of Help since
2013 to send four convoys with relief supplies to Syrian refugee camps in
Turkey and two flights with similar supplies to northern Iraq. In addition,
we are providing the city of Stuttgart with three years of funding for its
refugee welcome fund. We have also donated two Mercedes-Benz vans to
organizations that help refugees. Moreover, we support projects run
by the Bürgerstiftung Sindelfingen for the integration of newly arriving
refugees and offer a support fleet of Mercedes-Benz vehicles to relief
organizations.
Employees help refugees. We are also assisting the social integration of
the refugees and supporting the relief activities of our employees. Among
other things, employees are involved in local refugee projects that are
being conducted within the framework of Social Days@Daimler. In 2016,
employees renovated refugee shelters, for example, and helped to build
playgrounds for children. Daimler paid for the required materials and
ensured that the work was carried out under professional supervision.

Report Profile
In this Sustainability Report we assess the economic, environmental, and social impact of
our business operations in 2016 and present our current Target Program. We make this comprehensive report available as a navigable PDF file to ensure that the information it contains
is easy to find and use. As a result, topics and information can be directly called up in the
same way as they are on a Website.
Moreover, additional online information can be immediately called up through the links in the
PDF file. This information supplements the PDF file and offers additional possibilities of use.
For example, the Website features a search function, an extensive thematically linked GRI
Content Index, and a key figures tool, with which you can create tables and diagrams adapted
to your information needs.
The information provided in our Sustainability Report applies to the entire Daimler Group with
its business divisions. We do so using a control approach, which means that the calculations
take all of the Group’s production-related majority holdings fully into account. The reporting
period corresponds to our financial year, which runs from January 1 to December 31.
The report is in accordance with the “Comprehensive” option of the GRI G4
Guidelines
In 2006, Daimler joined the multi-stakeholder network of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)
as an organizational stakeholder. This report was prepared in accordance with the internationally recognized guidelines on sustainability reporting GRI G4. The report was submitted
for the GRI Materiality Disclosures Service, and GRI confirmed the correctness of the
locations of the G4 materiality disclosures (G4-17 to G4-27).

Our reporting activities are audited in accordance with ISAE 3000
We engaged the auditing and consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers to examine the
Corporate Sustainability Report. The review was based on the International Standard on
Assurance Engagements 3000: Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews
of Historical Financial Information (ISAE 3000), published by the International Auditing
and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB).
The auditing firm subjected our Sustainability Report to a critical assessment of its correctness, completeness, comparability, comprehensibility, and relevance. The main focus of
the review was on the corporate level and was supplemented by samples from individual
production plants. The following areas were reviewed:
–	the Group-level management systems and processes that are used for recording,
gathering, consolidating, and processing the data published in the report;
–	the control processes for sustainability reporting at the Group level;
–	the accuracy of Group-level figures in tables and statements:
–	production-related key figures on “CO2 emissions, water consumption, and recycling
rate”
–	“average CO2 emissions of the European passenger car fleet of Mercedes-Benz Cars”
–	statements concerning human rights
–	the incorporation of sustainability into the corporate governance structure.
At the conclusion of the review we received a review certificate, which presents the aim,
purpose, and foundations of the review, the work performed, and its conclusions. Internal
reporting is conducted through the Corporate Sustainability Board (CSB).

Our UN Global Compact Progress Report

Focusing on the essentials

Daimler has committed itself to upholding the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact. We
were one of the first signatories of the UN Global Compact, and we participate in the LEAD
group established in 2011. We are involved in thematic and regional task forces and initiatives
of the UN Global Compact. With this Sustainability Report we are meeting our obligation
to report regularly on our initiatives regarding human rights, labor standards and employee
rights, environmental protection, and the fight against corruption.

From a thematic standpoint, the Sustainability Report continues to focus on the areas
highlighted in our materiality analysis. We also concentrated on the main key figures in our
inclusion of the GRI Content Index.
Materiality analysis: pp. 04 ff.

In June 2016, we submitted the Sustainability Report 2015 together with the document titled
“Realizing the Blueprint: Corporate Action Plan” as our official UN Global Compact Communication on Progress. We will present the next Communication on Progress in July 2017.
UN Global Compact Communication on Progress

In addition to having PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) conduct a system and data quality
audit, we perform detailed benchmark analyses. In parallel we also have an internal process
for the review of targets, measures, and fields of action.

The reporting process and quality assurance

Scope of reporting and data acquisition methods
We want to become better and better
Daimler is continuously enhancing its sustainability activities and measures. This also
applies to its Sustainability Reporting. This report was prepared in line with the principles
of materiality, stakeholder inclusiveness, completeness, and sustainability context.

Economic data. The information about economic relationships presented in the Sustainability Report for 2016 is based on data from the Daimler Annual Report 2016. The latter’s
Management Report and Notes sections were attested to with an unqualified opinion by
the auditing firm KPMG Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft AG.
Further information can be found in the Annual Report 2016

New features in the report since 2015
Our Sustainability Report has followed a new approach since 2015, eliminating the journalistic features and reports that are more appropriate for a broader readership. We are now
informing these readers about our sustainability activities in additional publications. As a
result, the Sustainability Report now primarily addresses the information requirements of
experts such as analysts, rating agencies, NGOs, and sustainability organizations. We have,
accordingly, concentrated even more strongly on providing content that is of importance
to these groups. The key figures, data, and facts are therefore clearly presented in a focused
and easy-to-find manner.

127

Employee data. The facts and figures in the Employees section are based on the Daimler
Annual Report 2016. The reporting on human resources data is based mainly on the
“HR ePARS” electronic human resources planning and reporting tool, which combines the
data of all consolidated companies within the Daimler Group. This information is supplemented with data acquired with the aid of the ePeople and HR EARTH electronic human
resources management systems. The texts and diagrams in this section indicate whether
the data refers to the entire Group or only to parts thereof.

Corporate Environmental Protection

Collection of data on corporate environmental protection. Daimler has been systematically compiling key environmental data from its German plants since 1992. In 1997 and
1998 its data acquisition was gradually extended to include production plants outside
Germany. Since 2002 the data acquisition and analysis have been handled with the aid of
a database. The data in this report reflects the structure of the Group in 2016 and includes
all production plants of which the Daimler Group is a majority shareholder as well as the
German and other European locations for logistics, service, and sales. It does not include
the locations of Daimler Financial Services. For this reason, the timelines may differ from
those of previously published data. New parts of the company have been included from
the time at which they became part of Daimler. In a change from the prior year, the report
for 2016 includes the spare parts center in Neuhausen. The environmental data for 2016
refers to a total of 72 production locations and subordinate sites as well as to 35 logistics,
service, and sales locations.

Disclaimer
We have exercised extreme care in the compilation of the data contained in this report.
Nevertheless, we cannot entirely exclude the possibility of error. Insofar as this report contains forward-looking statements, these are based exclusively on data and forecasts available
at the time of publication. Although such projections are drawn up with extreme care, a great
variety of factors that were unforeseeable at the time of publication may lead to deviations.
The content of the report was checked by the responsible specialist staff. Parts of the report
were also examined by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Our last Sustainability Report appeared
in April 2016 under the title “Sustainability Report 2015.” The current Sustainability Report
will appear in March 2017 under the title “Sustainability Report 2016.” Our next report will be
published in early April 2018.
Editorial deadline for this report: February 24, 2017

Specific environmental and energy data. Resource consumption and emissions are
largely dependent on the number of units produced. That is why we calculate specific values
for the individual divisions. This involves matching the number of vehicles produced in the
consolidated plants of each division with the appropriate data from the production facilities.
We measure the specific values of the Cars, Trucks, Vans, and Buses divisions according to
the divisional allocation that has been in force since 2006. This distribution was calculated
back into the past as far as possible in order to obtain consistent timelines. The specific
data gained in this way can only serve as general benchmarks, because it does not take
into account the different ways in which the vertical integration of production has developed,
the diversity of products, or the special features of the production network, which in some
cases extends across divisions.

How we calculate and document our CO2 emissions
Daimler calculates and documents its CO2 emissions in accordance with the 2004
Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative
(Scopes 1 to 3).
We document all CO2 emissions from stationary sources (Scope 1), indirect emissions
resulting from the generation of the purchased electricity and district heating (Scope 2),
and emissions resulting from the use of our products (Scope 3). Thus we also take into
account the emissions produced before and after our own activities.
– Scope 1: We calculate our direct emissions from the combustion of fuels, heating
oil, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, and coal with fixed CO2 emission factors as
specified by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) or the
German Emissions Trading Office, DEHSt. We began to include the combustion of fuels
in the calculations of Group-wide CO2 emissions for the first time in 2010. The calculation also includes the consumption of energy for production purposes (e.g. forklifts)
and test benches in Product Engineering. Company cars assigned to specific individuals
are not taken into account. If data is available, the results of previous years are also
included in the calculation.
– Scope 2: We differentiate by time and region in our calculations of indirect emissions
from district heating and electricity from external sources. If more detailed data is not
available, we use the annually updated factors of the International Energy Agency (IEA).
In the United States we use the electricity generation factors published by the EPA.
The CO2 emissions from electricity production for the German locations are calculated
on the basis of the applicable factors of Germany’s Federal Environment Agency (UBA).
Since 2016, CO2 emissions have been calculated according to separate assessments
for market-based and location-based emissions. This calculation is based on

129

Employees

Suppliers

Social
Responsibility

Target Program

the new guideline of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative for determining Scope 2
emissions, which was published in 2015. For market-based emissions, we determine
the CO2 emission factors of the local electricity prices or power companies at our
locations worldwide. Where such information is not available, we continue to use the
current average location-based emission factor published for the country in question.
For the sake of comparison, we also publish the CO2 emissions of all our locations
according to the location-based method.
– Scope 3: We calculate CO2 emissions from the use of our products on the basis of
our sales figures and the average fleet consumption values. For this calculation, we
assume that each car travels 15,000 kilometers per year. At the moment, no statutory
test cycles are prescribed for trucks and buses. The European Commission is working
on a computer-based simulation program (VECTO) that aims to make manufacturers’
statements regarding the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of trucks and buses
comparable. We will use this program as soon as it is approved. We calculate other
indirect CO2 emissions from the purchased services and preliminary work for business
trips and truck deliveries, which we use as examples.
The CO2-optimized provision of energy and electricity. With a view to reducing our
production-related carbon emissions and continuously improving our energy supply,
we are investing in facilities such as cogeneration units within our plants and are also
optimizing our external energy procurement. For example, we have been purchasing
green electricity since 2011. In accordance with the updated requirements of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, we have also been using the market-based method for our emissions
reporting since 2016.
At this time, we are not calculating the figures for other greenhouse gases across
the Group. As the calculation of climate-relevant coolants in the German plants shows,
the emissions from such refrigerants account for only a negligible amount in the parts
per thousand range.

Independent
Assurance Report
To Daimler AG, Stuttgart
We have been engaged to perform a limited assurance engagement regarding several sustainability key performance
indicators and information selected by Daimler AG (the ‘Company’) in the Sustainability Report 2016 (the ‘Report’) for the
business year from 1 January to 31 December 2016.
Scope and subject matter
The sustainability key performance indicators and information selected by the company for the calendar year 2016 (Average
CO2 emissions of the Mercedes-Benz Cars vehicle fleet in Europe (EU 28), direct and indirect CO2 emissions scope 1 and 2
of the Daimler Group, energy consumption of the Daimler Group, waste volumes, waste utilization rate, water consumption,
human rights), which are included in the scope of our engagement, can be found on the pages 22-23, in chart 12 on page
40, on page 63, in table 30 on page 66, in the first paragraph (incl. table 34) on page 69 and in chart 36 on page 70 of the
Report. The assessment of the materiality analysis of the company was not part of our engagement scope.
The Company prepared sustainability key performance indicators and information in accordance with the Sustainability
Reporting Guidelines Vol. 4 (pages 16 to 18) of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) (the ‘GRI-Criteria’).
Responsibility of the legal representatives
The Company’s Board of Managing Directors is responsible for the proper preparation of the sustainability key performance
indicators and information and the report in accordance with the GRI-Criteria.
This responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the sustainability key performance indicators and information, the Report and the use of assumptions and estimates for sustainability disclosures which
are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, the responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining
systems and processes relevant for the preparation of the sustainability key performance indicators and information and
the Report.
Our independence and quality control
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants
issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity,
objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior.
Our firm applies the International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of
quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional
standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

Employees

Social
Responsibility

Target Program

We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (revised)
‘Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information’. This Standard requires that
we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the assurance engagement, under consideration of materiality,
to provide our conclusion with limited assurance.
In a limited assurance engagement the evidence-gathering procedures are more limited than for a reasonable assurance
engagement, and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance engagement. The procedures selected
depend on the practitioner’s judgement.
Summary of work performed
Within the scope of our work we performed amongst others the following procedures:
– Inquiries of personnel responsible for the preparation of the Report regarding the process to prepare the reporting of
sustainability information and the underlying internal control system;
– Inquiries of personnel responsible for the reported information regarding fleet emissions (and fuel consumptions)
as well as reconciliation of selected information regarding fleet emissions (and fuel consumptions) with the official fuel
consumptions and emissions type-test values of the Federal Motor Transport Authority of Germany;
– Inspection of documents regarding the sustainability strategy as well as understanding the sustainability management
structure, the stakeholder dialogue and the development process of the Company’s sustainability program;
– Inquiries of personnel in the corporate functions that are responsible for the chapters human rights, operations-related
environmental protection as well as fuel consumption and CO2 emissions;
– Gaining an understanding of the systems and processes for collection, analysis, validation and aggregation of sustainability data and its documentation on a sample basis;
– Performance of site visits as part of the inspection of processes for collecting, analyzing and aggregating selected data:
– in the corporate headquarter in Stuttgart,
– in the Mercedes-Benz plant in Berlin (Germany),
– in the Trucks plant in Saltillo (Mexico);
– Analytical procedures on sustainability data disclosed in the report;
– Comparison of selected data with corresponding data in the Company’s Combined Management Report;
– Gaining further evidence for selected data of the Report by means of inspection of internal documents, contracts and
invoices/reports from external service providers.
Conclusion
Based on our limited assurance engagement, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the key
performance indicators and information disclosed with the Sustainability Report of the Company for the business year 2016
has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the GRI-Criteria.

We assign a very high priority to recognizing and protecting human rights within our company and in the locations where we
operate. For us as an automaker, the emphasis is on employee rights, fair working conditions, and the rejection of every form of
discrimination and of forced labor and child labor. We have firmly assigned the responsibility for human rights issues in the
Integrity and Legal Affairs division in the Group’s Board of Management. In addition, we emphasize this issue in our corporate
governance structure for sustainability.

Principle 6	Prevention of
discrimination

To ensure that hiring processes are free of discrimination, whether gender-specific or in other forms, the fixed base salary is
based on the individual’s position and level. The same goal is served within our regular income reviews by mandatory documentation, the inclusion of several people in each process, and a central HR system that ensures transparency. Our in-house income
reviews have shown that the amount of the remuneration paid for comparable tasks is affected by factors such as individual
performance and the amount of experience a person has gained in a particular position, but not by the person’s gender.

Principle 6

22 f. 79 ff.

Principle 7	Precautionary environmental protection

Risk prevention is particularly important when it comes to managing the local effects of our business activities. This applies,
for example, to environmental protection in the production process. Our environmental management system defines structures
and processes that ensure transparent reporting and clear areas of responsibility at all levels of our production facilities
around the world. More than 98 percent of our employees work at locations with environmental management systems audited
and certified according to ISO 14001. In addition, we regularly conduct environmental due diligence processes at our locations.

Principle 10	Measures against
corruption

We aim to act in accordance with ethical principles and to comply with all applicable laws, internal regulations and voluntary
commitments. We pay particular attention to complying with all applicable anti-corruption regulations and to ensuring the
maintenance and promotion of fair competition, as is set out in binding form in our Integrity Code. In this respect, our managers
have a special responsibility due to their role model function. Consequently, integrity and compliance requirements are important
criteria in the target agreements and in assessing the annual target achievement of our managers. They are also part of the
non-financial targets for the members of the Board of Management.
Among other things, our extensive range of training courses covers sections on ethical conduct in daily operations, corruption
prevention, our whistleblower system BPO, and antitrust law. Depending on the risk and the target group, we use classroom
training or digital learning techniques such as Web-based training courses.
In addition to the cross-hierarchical Group-wide dialogs concerning ethical conduct, we ensure ethical practices and compliant
behavior in daily operations at all our business units with the help of our effective Compliance and Legal department structures
as well as our Compliance Management System, which is based on national and international standards. Our Compliance
organization is structured in a divisional and regional way, while our Legal department is organized along the value chain and
regionally. This structure enables us to offer optimal support and advice to our divisions. For this purpose, a contact person is
assigned to each function, division and region. In addition, local contact persons around the world make sure that our standards
are observed.
We regard our business partners’ integrity and behavior in conformity with regulations as an indispensable precondition for
cooperation based on trust. In the selection of our direct business partners, we therefore make sure that they comply with the
law and observe ethical principles.

Additional information on labeling
On the basis of the measured CO2 emissions, taking into account the
mass of the vehicle.
The values quoted for fuel consumption and CO2 emissions were calculated
on the basis of stipulated measuring procedures (Section No. 5, 6, 6a
Energy Labeling Ordinance for Cars [Pkw-EnVKV] in its current version).
The figures do not refer to a specific individual vehicle and are not part
of any product offering, but instead are presented solely for purposes of
comparison between various vehicle types.
The figures are provided in accordance with the German regulation
‘PKW-EnVKV’ and apply to the German market only. Further information on
official fuel consumption figures and the official specific CO2 emissions
of new passenger cars can be found in the EU guide ‘Information on the
fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and energy consumption of new cars’,
which is available free of charge at all sales dealerships, from DAT Deutsche
Automobil Treuhand GmbH and at http://www.dat.de.
