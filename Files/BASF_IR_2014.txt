Welcome to BASF
Our integrated corporate
report combines financial
and sustainability reporting
to inform shareholders,
employees and the
interested public about
the 2014 business year.

150 years of BASF
Our innovations have
influenced how we live
today. But what will
society need tomorrow?
In our anniversary year, we
are guided by three major
questions of the future:
What will the cities of
the future look like?
Where will the energy
we need come from?
How can everyone have
access to healthy food?
At BASF, we are working on
answers. Find out more on
the following pages.

Cover photo and page 1:
In the laboratory at the BASF subsidiary Deutsche
Nanoschicht GmbH, we conduct research on the next
generation of superconducting tapes. These are based
on metal strips to which a superconductive coating is
applied. Superconductors transfer electricity at almost
zero loss, which translates into huge savings potential
in the generation and transport of electricity.

URBAN LIVING
THE QUESTIONS

What will the cities
of the future look
like?
Cities draw people seeking
work, prosperity and culture.
The year 2008 marked the
first time that more people
worldwide were living in
metro­politan areas than in the
country. Estimates suggest
that, in 2050, over 70% of
the world’s population will
call cities home.
But how will our cities look and
sound in the future, what will it
be like to live there? How can
more and more people find
­living space and quality of life?
How can we create intelligent
transportation systems? And
will there be enough resources,
such as water, for everyone?

URBAN LIVING
THE ANSWERS

We at BASF have been working
on answers to these questions
for 150 years: by identifying the
needs of our customers and
partners, exploring the as-yet
undiscovered, and making
innovations available to as
many people as possible.
Examples include the special
concrete admixtures used to
construct the world’s tallest
buildings or an earthquake-­
proof tunnel under the sea. Or
thermal and acoustic insula­tion
materials that make riding the
subway more comfortable.
Or membranes that allow
saltwater to be transformed
into drinking water.

Shaping the London skyline:
“The Shard” was inaugurated in
2012. The futuristic building’s glass
façade is about the size of 8 football
fields. On the inside, visitors can ride
44 elevators.

Making room where
space is scarce
Big cities the world over are
facing enormous challenges.
With urban populations
constantly growing, l­iving
and work space need to
be found for more and more
people. And yet space is
limited. That’s why the trend
is to build upwards – as
demonstrated by sky­
scrapers like London’s The
Shard. Completed in 2012,
the building’s 310 meters are
only topped in Europe by the
Mercury City Tower in
Moscow. Taller still is the
Burj Khalifa: with its more
than 160 stories, it stretches
800 meters into the skies
over Dubai, making it the
tallest building in the world.
BASF’s products assist in
construction. The Shard,
for example, employed a
specially developed blend of
BASF’s MasterGlenium® Sky
concrete admixture:
Construction projects of this
sort require particularly fluid
concrete that can be easily
pumped up great heights.
MasterGlenium® Sky also
helps concrete dry quickly,
so that building can proceed
without t­ oo long of a pause.
MasterGlenium® super­
plasticizers not only improve
the construction properties
of concrete, they also lessen
its environmental impact.
For example, slag or fly ash
can replace some of the
­cement, avoiding the ­carbon
emissions released b
­ y the
energy-intensive ­cement
production process.

With more than 8 million
­inhabitants, New York is the
most populous city in the
United States. Living space
is extremely scarce, not to
mention expensive. That’s
why creative solutions are in
demand – especially in the
densely populated center.
432 Park Avenue is not only
a swank address. It is also
the name of a spectacular
building being erected in the
heart of Manhattan: a new
skyscraper that will stand
on an area measuring only
28 by 28 meters. The
residential building will rise
426 meters into the air.
Helping accomplish this feat
is BASF’s Green Sense®
concrete technology, which
was also used in the construction of the One World
Trade Center in New York.
Green Sense® concrete
technology is a BASF
performance package that
manufacturers can use to
improve their concrete in
terms of durability, processing characteristics, longevity
and environmental impact.



The world’s tallest building:
With more than 160 stories,
the Burj Khalifa rises 828 meters
into the air above the desert city
of Dubai. Its tip is still visible
100 kilometers away.

“Things have to move quickly in cities
like London. The entire foundation
slab for The Shard was poured on a
single weekend, because causing
traffic snarl-ups with the construction
vehicles was out of the question.”
Brian Williams,
Sales Manager, BASF’s Construction Chemicals division

URBAN LIVING

In the heart of Manhattan:
Opened in November 2014,
the One World Trade Center is
a ­record-breaker. It is simulta­
neously the tallest building in
the Western Hemisphere and
one of the most environmentally
friendly of its size. Its features
include a ­recycling system for
rainwater.


28 by 28 meters: This is
how small the area is on
which 432 Park Avenue is
being built. Once completed,
it will be among the tallest
residential buildings in the
world.

City lifelines
Urban life is criss-crossed by
many different forms of
transportation. Streets, rails,
tunnels – these are the veins
and ­arteries of a city.
Commuters especially rely
on fast, dependable connections. In Istanbul, for example, the Marmaray Tunnel
running u
­ nder the Bosporus
Strait makes it possible for
a train to go from ­Europe to
Asia in only 4 minutes.
The underwater tunnel is
therefore not only an
environmentally friendly
alternative to the busy
Bosporus Bridge highway, it
also saves time, along with
reducing traffic noise and
­exhaust emissions in this
megacity. BASF’s expertise
and solutions were called for
here, as well: For example,
a special injection foam to
prevent water ingress and a
concrete formulation
to earthquake-proof the
­tunnel both contributed to
its construction.
Commuters on their way
to work in the Canadian
city of Montreal have also
enjoyed a nicer ride since
the beginning of 2014, when
new subway cars featuring
special thermal and acoustic
insulation were introduced.
The Bombardier-made cars
have ceilings equipped
with BASF’s Basotect®
melamine resin foam. By
2018, 468 of these new cars
are expected to be in
circulation, making noisy
and uncom­fortable subway
rides a thing of the past.

Urban jungle: Day after day,
thousands of people are on
the go in big cities. They use
various forms of transportation
to get to their destinations.
How can cities design their
transportation systems in the
future?

“Constructing the
Marmaray Tunnel was
a huge challenge:
Its deepest section
lies 56 meters below
the water’s surface.
Also, the tunnel
must withstand up
to a magnitude 9
earthquake on the
Richter scale.”
Suat Seven,
Regional Manager, BASF’s
Construction Chemicals division
Comfortable commutes: The
Montreal Metro is the most highly
frequented subway in Canada.
On workdays, it is used by more
than a million people. All of them
benefit from materials that make
the ride more comfortable.

URBAN LIVING

Thirsty cities
Cities demand great
quantities of resources,
like water. And yet much
of the existing water supply
infrastructure in congested
urban areas is ­already being
stretched to its limit. Places
where many people share
close quarters are places
that require countless liters
of ­water ­every day for
drinking, cooking, washing,
hygiene and ­industry. How
can we quench the thirst of
cities?
Over 70% of the Earth’s
­surface is covered in water –
most of it saltwater.
Desalinating seawater
makes this valuable resource
available for consumption.
One such plant is ­located
in the Spanish El Prat de
Llobregat.

It supplies drinking water
to around a quarter of the
population in the greater
Barcelona area. And in
Nungua, about 12 kilometers
from the Ghanian capital of
Accra, desalination will soon
be able to provide drinking
­water to roughly half a
million people.
Potable water is a scarce
commodity on Cyprus, too.
Water scarcity can at times
mean drastic restrictions for
the island’s inhabitants: It
has happened that, during
periods of drought, ­the
­water supply was reduced
to 36 hours per week.
Here, too, people now count
on seawater desalination.
Famagusta, Cyprus, uses
the ultra­filtration technology
of inge GmbH, a subsidiary
of BASF. M
­ embranes
made from Ultrason®
high-performance plastic
prepare the seawater for
desalination by intercepting
­undesirable particles like
sand, clay, ­algae, and even
pathogens.

Seawater desalination is
an opportunity for coastal
cities around the world to
secure their long-term
supply of water. According
to the forecasts of sector
specialists Global Water
Intelligence, three times
more people will meet
their water needs through
desalination technologies
in 2030 than do so today.

Keeping out the junk:
The filter membranes used in
seawater desalination plants
feature tiny pores only 20 nanometers in diameter, intercepting
both particles and pathogens.

“We produce around
7,000 cubic meters of
potable water for
Famagusta daily. If water
means life, then we’re
giving this city life.”
Aydin Celikbas, Desalination Plant
Manager in Famagusta, Cyprus

SMART ENERGY
THE QUESTIONS

Where will the
energy we need
come from?
Our lives are inconceivable
without energy – we need it in
industry as much as at home.
Energy keeps our houses cool
in summer and warm in winter,
lets us cover great distances in
an electric car and allows us to
go ­online with our laptops and
­tablets at any time.
Demand for energy is growing
by the day. By 2050, humanity
will need two to three times
more energy than it does now,
but fossil resources are finite.
How can we use it more
efficiently? How can we store
and transport energy with
minimal losses in the process?
And how can we expand
electricity generation from
renewables in a cost-effective
manner?

SMART ENERGY
THE ANSWERS

We at BASF have been working
on answers to these questions
for 150 years: by recognizing
future trends early on, keeping
our research on the cutting
edge and finding flexible
solutions for society and the
environment.
Examples include technologies
that e
­ nable houses to secure
their own energy supply
and the nearly loss-free
transmission of electricity.
Or a material that e
­ nsures
optimal voltage in laptops,
or battery materials for electric
cars. Or technologies that
­increase the effectiveness of
wind and solar power plants.

The online generation:
Everyday life without laptops,
tablets and smartphones is almost
unthinkable nowadays. We are
increasingly depen­dent on energy
that is readily and reliably available
wherever we go.

SMART ENERGY

The power of ­­
sun and wind

We are also developing new
solutions for solar thermal
power plants: In September
2014, for example, we
started up a pilot plant
­together with Novatec Solar
in southern Spain that uses
molten salt i­nstead of
thermal oils as a heat
transfer medium. The
benefit: Inorganic salts allow
operating temperatures to
be raised to more than
500 degrees Celsius, which
increases electricity yield.
BASF is the world’s leading
supplier of synthetically
produced sodium ­nitrate for
solar thermal p
­ ower plants.

They represent renewable
energy and generate
electricity from natural
­resources: solar and wind
power plants. BASF’s
­expertise goes into many of
these ­facilities in order to
improve their efficiency and
longevity. Our Seluris®
technology, for example, is
engineered along the entire
­solar cell value chain. From
cutting and etching to
texturing, doping and
cleaning, Seluris® processing chemicals contribute
­toward increasing ­solar
cells’ performance – such
as by cleaning the surface
of solar wafers so as to
minimize ­the occurrence of
flaws.

“With our salts and the knowledge
of how to use them at high
temperatures, we help solar thermal
power plants generate electricity
even more efficiently.”
Dr. Kerstin Dünnwald,
Head of Business Management for Inorganic
Chemicals in BASF’s Monomers division

Wind turbines need to run
safely and efficiently over a
period of at least 20 years.
During that time, they are
exposed to enormous
weather-related stress
factors, such as rain, hail,
snow and ultraviolet rays.
The strain on a r­ otor blade is
­extreme: The tips reach top
speeds of ­­300 kilometers
per hour, rotating at a height
of around 90 meters in the
air. Under these conditions,
things like raindrops can
turn into tiny bullets. Such
speeds also mean enormous
pressure on the tips of the
blades, which can bend by
over a meter.

Hardy on the high seas:
The offshore windpark West
of Duddon Sands has stood in
the middle of the Irish Sea since
October 2014. It produces
enough electricity to supply
around 280,000 households
every year.

SMART ENERGY

So it’s no wonder that wind
turbine components need to
be made of special material.
BASF developed its
­RELEST® coating system
based on specific poly­
urethane chemistry. It
protects the ­rotor blade
from the weather and is
characterized by high
erosion resistance and
­excellent flexibility.
The insides of many modern
rotor blades consist of glass
and carbon-fiber mats
soaked with and bonded by
our Baxxodur® epoxy
systems. As a core material,
the polyethylene tereph­
thalate (PET) foam Kerdyn®
stabilizes rotor blades in
conditions of structural
and dynamic stress.
MasterFlow® mortar solidly
bonds tower and foundation
– and quickly, too: The
­mortar hardens rapidly even
in inclement weather and at
very low temperatures,
which helps wind parks to
be built faster and therefore
more cost-effectively, both
onshore and off.

Buildings as
power plants
Houses need energy:
for light and electrical
appli­ances, for heating
and air conditioning.
Developments like the
“passive house” have
already significantly
­improved energy
management in modern
buildings. And ­yet we can
even go a step further:
Buildings can actually
become power plants.
Together with Swansea
University in Wales, along
with other partners in
industry, BASF is involved in
a special project: SPECIFIC
(Sustainable Product
Engineering Center for
Innovative Functional
Industrial Coatings).
SPECIFIC tackles the
question of how buildings
can, for example, transform
incident sunlight into heat or
electricity. The team of over
120 scientists, technicians
and engineers is developing
special roof and façade
coatings to address this very
issue. BASF supports their
work on topics like energy
storage, and provides its
­expertise in photovoltaics
along with coatings that give
off light and heat.

Façades as energy providers: Kevin
Bygate and his colleague examine a steel
surface that has been treated with a heat-­
generating coating. These surfaces can
be used on structures with metal façades,
such as commercial buildings.

“Smart surface coatings for steel and
glass have the potential to generate
enough heat and electricity to
independently power a building
throughout the entire year.”
Kevin Bygate, Chief Executive Officer
of SPECIFIC

The electricity
transmission
of the future
When electricity is
transmitted over
conventional ­copper
conductors, a portion of the
electrical energy is always
lost in the form of heat.
High-temperature
­superconductors, on the
other hand, can transport
considerably higher
amounts of electricity. Even
at temperatures above the
boiling point of liquid nitrogen (–196 degrees Celsius),
they transmit electricity
with almost zero loss,
­enabling major savings
­potential in the generation
and transport of electricity.
Superconductor cables
can improve electricity
infra­structure in dense
­urban centers and large
indus­trial sites. Possible
applications are in current
limiters and transformers
for public power grids, and
electricity ­cables for supply
­networks within cities.

Little balls that pack power:
The cathode material for
lithium-ion batteries consists
of ­little balls only micrometers
in size. These particles can
be shaped so that, depending
on customer application, they
enable optimal performance
in terms of electric cars’
acceleration and range
(magnification 6,400:1).

Even generators and
electric ­motors can be
made more c
­ ompact and
energy efficient. Super­
conductor technology
­enables, for ­example,
­better use of ­renewable
­energies with wind and
­water power ­generators.
The BASF subsidiary
Deutsche Nanoschicht
GmbH has developed an
innovative technique for
producing super­conductors
in a more efficient and
environmentally friendly
manner. A joint laboratory
with the Karlsruhe Institute
of Technology is scheduled
to open in 2015 with the
goal of further optimizing
superconducting tapes.
Electric drive comes standard:
The BMW i3 is the first massproduced electric car of the
BMW Group. Its 170-horsepower
electric engine has a range of
around 190 kilometers.

Real bundles
of energy
Electricity is also taking on
an ­increasingly significant
role ­in the field of mobility.
Estimates suggest that
around 1.2 billion cars will be
on the road in 2020 – a good
300 million more than now –
most of which in congested
urban ­areas. And yet big
­cities today are already
suffering from smog and
noise pollution. That’s why
cityscapes of the future will
feature more and more
electric cars – with highperformance batteries at
their core. BASF develops
and produces cathode
materials and electrolyte
formulations for lithium-ion
batteries, helping vehicles
get as far as possible on a
single charge.

“New materials for
high-tech lithium-ion
batteries are the key
to the electromobility
of tomorrow.”
Dr. Michael Krausa,
Managing Director,

Lithium-Ionen-Batterien

SMART ENERGY

“Our new visualization
methods help researchers to
optimize next-generation
batteries.”
Professor Vanessa Wood, Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology Zurich, Department
of Information Technology and Electrical
Engineering, Switzerland

We work together with
strong partners to make this
happen. In the collaborative
Alpha-Laion project, we are
­developing new high-energy
batteries for electric vehicles
with companies like Bosch
and Daimler. We also
operate a joint laboratory
with the Karlsruhe Institute
of Technology that works on
new battery materials.
In addition, we are
furthering research on
lithium-ion batteries and
cathode materials at
­research labs in ­Amagasaki,
Japan, and Beachwood,
Ohio, as well a
­ s in
Ludwigshafen, Germany.
BASF is also involved in the
international Electro­
chemistry ­and Batteries
Research Network and in
the Lithium-Ion Battery
Competence Network in
Berlin.

Furthermore, we ­research
additional materials to
­advance electromobility:
For example, we supported
BMW in developing several
components of the BMW i3,
the BMW Group’s first fully
electric mass-produced
­vehicle. BASF’s plastics are
built into automotive parts
such as the body, seats and
roof construction.
For the last three years, ­
we and Volkswagen have
presented the Science Award
Electrochemistry to
researchers around the world
in order to support their
work on electromobility. The
2014 prize winner, Professor
­Vanessa Wood, developed ­
a new imaging analysis
method that helps improve
the performance of
lithium-ion batteries.

Current technology
for laptops
Smartphones, tablets and
laptops: Thanks to their
many functions, mobile
devices are part of everyday life. Each individual
component of these
complex electronics must
perform at a particularly
high level. Some parts,
such as the CPU or hard
disk, need current with a
different voltage than that
supplied by the battery; if
the voltage were to deviate
from the required value,
these c
­ omponents would
sustain damage. BASF’s
high-­purity carbonyl iron
powder makes a decisive ­

contribution toward solving
this problem: Incorporated
into the cores of high
frequency coils, it ensures
that the current flowing
into delicate electronics
always maintains exactly
the right voltage.
BASF discovered how to
produce carbonyl iron
powder in 1925. Back
then, it was used in
applications like magnetic
tape for the first tape
recorders.

Powder in coils: Their perfect
spherical shape makes BASF’s
carbonyl iron particles
especially suited for use in
electronic components like
high-frequency coils.

FOOD
THE QUESTIONS

How can everyone
have access to
healthy food?
In 2050, more than nine billion
people will live on Earth. One
person in eight is already going
hungry today. Yet nutritious food
is essential to a healthy life. The
faster the world’s population
grows, the more important it
becomes to consider how we
will feed everyone:
How will everyone be able to
eat healthfully? How can we
combat malnutrition? What
will the agriculture of the future
look like?

FOOD
THE ANSWERS

We at BASF have been working
on answers to these questions
for 150 years: by recognizing a
need early on, conducting
inquisitive research, and sharing
our expertise with others.
This includes innovative
products and solutions for
agriculture with which we
support farmers in growing
high-quality food. Together, we
work to keep cultivated land
arable for future generations.
We use information technology
to help farmers engage in
efficient, careful, high-yield
agriculture. Furthermore, we
produce vitamins and fatty
acids that contribute to a
balanced diet.

Global routine: The market in
­Chichicastenango, Guatemala,
is the largest in Central America.
No matter where in the world we
shop, an adequate food supply
is one of the essentials of life.

FOOD

In the field
In order to secure harvests
around the world, our crop
protection products guard
against fungal infections,
­insect pests, and weeds,
and raise the quality of
agricultural products. One
of the most destructive
soybean diseases is Asian
soybean rust – a fungal
infection. To combat it,
farmers can turn to BASF’s
proven strobilurin fungicides
and Xemium®, our product
launched in 2011.
Rice is the main food source
for a large percentage of the
world’s population, and thus
one of the most important
crops of all. Yet “red rice,”
a type of wild grass, can
cause considerable harvest
losses in rice cultivation.
BASF’s Clearfield® production system provides a
solution: It combines an
herbicide with Clearfield
technology’s nontransgenic,
herbicide-tolerant seeds,
which can secure rice yields
and increase them up to
threefold.
Our research in plant
biotechnology concentrates
on plants for more efficient
agriculture that are hardly
­affected by heat or drought,
for example. One such
product is the Genuity®
DroughtGard® variety of
corn we developed together
with our partner Monsanto.
In times of drought, it is
more stress-resistant than
conventional corn varieties.

As a project partner in the
“Better Rice Initiative Asia,”
we support the distribution
of information in Indonesia
and Thailand on the proper
use of crop protection
products. We are also
­involved in the development
of courses to train farmers
and agricultural consultants,
as well as in the creation of
educational materials and
conducting seminars. For
the staple rice, especially,

farmers receive consultation
on the selection of seeds,
the right application of crop
protection products and
the analysis of growth. We
support s­ oybean farmers
in a similar cooperation
in India.
In North America, innovation
specialists visit our customers in the field, where they
work together on tailor-­
made solutions for success.

One of these farmers
is Matt Miles from the
U.S. state of Arkansas.
Together, we developed
a plan – from planting
seeds to applying fertilizers
and crop protection
products, all the way to
harvest. Matt produced a
record yield in Arkansas in
2013: He harvested more
than 7 tons of soybeans
per hectare. Farmers
usually achieve 3 to 4 tons
on average.

FOOD

A fungus fighter of many
­talents: The fungicide
Xemium® – seen here as small
white sticks – protects plants
against fungal infection from
day one. Applied to seeds,
Xemium® disperses throughout the plant as it grows, all
the way out to the tips of the
leaves (magnification 2,500:1).

“You’ve got to give the plant what it needs
before it needs it, to really ensure that you’re
going to get that kind of yield.”
Matt Miles, soybean farmer in the U.S. state of Arkansas
See all of Matt’s story on youtube.com under the search term
“planting a legacy”

Partnering for a successful
harvest: In Indonesia, we
advise farmers on all sorts
of topics related to crop
cultivation. Around 50 million
people work in agriculture in
Southeast Asia’s most
populous country. In addition
to cereals, farmers there also
grow coffee and soybeans.

FOOD

Agriculture 2.0
Modern farms rely more and
more on high-tech solutions.
It is not uncommon today to
see farmers using a tablet or
smartphone to assist their
work in the field. John Deere
and BASF agreed on a
collaboration in 2013 to
develop an integrated
IT-based solution for farmers
worldwide. The plan
combines BASF’s
agronomic expertise with
John Deere’s experience
in agricultural data
management. This enables
farmers to more easily
interpret data in order to
make more sound, efficient
decisions on crops and
processes. Farm machines
equipped with sensors
provide detailed data that
is used to evaluate the
optimal treatment of each
piece of land.

“A successful harvest these days is
determined not only by soil and weather,
but also by smart IT.”
Dr. Matthias Nachtmann,
Global Manager of business development in
BASF’s Crop Protection division

Digital farming:
Modern apps assist farmers
with tasks like diagnosing plant
diseases or deciding how much
fertilizer to use.

Aside from the cooperation
with John Deere, BASF also
has other IT-based solutions
on offer. Farmers in Brazil,
for example, can take
photos of diseased plants
and compare them with a
database in order to learn
about possible treatments
and recommendations.

Promoting a
­balanced diet
Vitamin A deficiency is a
­serious problem in over
70 of the world’s countries.
Each year, one million
children die from the effects
of this deficiency. It can
cause blindness and make
children more susceptible to
deadly infections like
measles and pneumonia.
Vitamin A is necessary for
nearly every function in the
human body, including
­vision, the nervous system,
skin, bones, and the
immune system. Because
the body cannot produce
the vitamin on its own, we
need to eat foods that
contain it. This presents a
problem for many people
in emerging and developing
countries: They cannot
­afford the expensive foods,
like meat and vegetables,
where the vitamin is
naturally found. In our Food
Fortification Initiative, we
assist governments,
develop­mental aid agencies
like UNICEF, and producers

in supplementing necessary
staples like oil, corn, rice
and flour with additional
vitamins and minerals. At
the Rio+20 United Nations
summit in 2012, BASF
committed to reaching
60 million more people
per year with enriched
staple foods in order to
protect them from the
conse­quences of vitamin
and mineral deficiencies.

Fewer deficiencies for greater
health: Food fortification means
enriching staple foods with
supplementary vitamins and
minerals. In one kilogram of
enriched flour, for example, there
are 3 to 5 milligrams of Vitamin A.

“UNICEF and BASF have been working for
years to combat Vitamin A deficiency,
helping reduce child mortality worldwide.”
Roland Kupka, Senior Advisor for micronutrients at UNICEF

A balanced diet is also
not necessarily a given
for people in industrialized
countries, where strokes,
high blood pressure and
other cardiovascular
diseases are on the rise
as a result of unhealthy
food. Long-chain omega-3
fatty acids, such as those
found in fish, can offer
protection from these
illnesses. BASF produces
highly concen­trated
omega-3 fatty acids and
makes them available for
many consumers to take
in various forms, from
powder to oil.
For food that can do more:
In the laboratory, we research
omega-3 fatty acids that can
be added to foods like y­ ogurt.

To Our Shareholders
Letter from the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors﻿

Dear Shareholder,
For you and for BASF, 2014 was an unstable, or even ambivalent, year. We
started off cautiously optimistic, not least because demand in Europe was picking
up slightly. But then from summer onward it was clear: Europe was hardly going
to grow at all. In the first half of the year, we were burdened by a strong euro,
which then began a downward slide in August. We struggled with increasing costs
for some raw materials in the first six months – a consequence of the high price
of oil – before this development, too, reversed. A year ago, no one could have
foreseen that the price of oil would plummet from $110 per barrel to a price as
low as $50 per barrel of Brent crude. And the political uncertainty in some parts
of the world also continued to grow.
Our share price reflected these ups and downs. Although you, our shareholders,
were able to enjoy a new high in June, our share performance was unsatisfying by
the end of the year – also as compared with the DAX 30 and the global chemical
industry. It’s only a small consolation that BASF still remains among the top
performers when viewed over a ten-year period.

“We have grown – despite
disappointing developments
in Europe.”

Especially against this background, it’s important to keep in mind that we
nevertheless achieved our goal for 2014. We wanted to once again increase our
earnings. And despite the disappointing developments in Europe, we did just that:
We grew. We further strengthened our chemicals business and in turn improved
our margins. We have our costs firmly under control.

To Our Shareholders
Letter from the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors ﻿

“We once again propose raising
the dividend, from €2.70 to €2.80
per share.”

BASF Report 2014

We once again propose raising the dividend, from €2.70 to €2.80 per share. All
of this has only been possible through the extraordinary accomplishment of our
employ­ees. On behalf of the team of the Board of Executive Directors, I offer
them my heartfelt thanks.

“We create chemistry” strategy
In a volatile year like 2014, it makes sense to ask whether BASF’s fundamental
direction – our “We create chemistry” strategy – is still the right path. The answer
is a clear yes: The chemical industry will continue to grow worldwide, although
somewhat more slowly than was predicted a few years ago. And we want to
participate in this growth – through the largest investment program in decades.
We are investing in emerging markets. We are investing to take advantage of
shale gas in the United States, and we are investing in the competitiveness of
our European sites. A whole range of new plants will start up operations in 2015
– plants that will keep producing for the next 10, 20 or 30 years.
We made advances in the regional diversification of our oil and gas business. We
acquired additional reserves and development fields in Norway, and have already
made good progress there. The swap of our gas trading business for oil and gas
reserves from Gazprom in Russia did not happen, however. We will continue our
successful joint ventures in western Europe and Russia, even though the current
political situation is difficult.
We also continued restructuring our portfolio. This included, for example, exiting
the textile chemicals and styrene plastics businesses, yet also establishing a joint
venture with Toda Kogyo, a leading Japanese company in battery chemicals. We
are intensively researching and developing this area.

“Innovation is and remains
the driving force for chemistry.”

Innovation is and remains the driving force for chemistry. That is why we once
again spent more on research and development and globalized our activities.
In Mumbai, we are setting up a research center that will focus primarily on crop
protection. The Innovation Campus in Shanghai – already the largest research site
in Asia – will be expanded. At a new laboratory in Amagasaki, Japan, our employees are developing electrolytes and electrode materials for more high-performance
batteries. You will discover even more examples of BASF’s innovations in this
report, including substantially improved superabsorbents for d
­ iapers.
The new diapers will also contribute to sustainability, which continues to serve as
the benchmark for our actions – whether economic, environmental, or social. This
includes the thorough analysis we conducted of our products in more than 60,000
applications. The findings help us steer our portfolio. We can specifically develop
even more sustainable products together with our customers or find alternatives
for products that no longer fulfill our standards.

BASF Report 2014 

Innovation and sustainability are also at the core of our anniversary activities.
We will celebrate BASF’s 150th birthday. And yet above all, we will use 2015
to find answers to pressing questions through inventiveness and innovations –
together with our customers and partners. The great thing is, everyone can join
in – including you – at creator-space.basf.com.

Outlook for 2015
The outlook for the 2015 business year is subject to significant uncertainty. We
do expect the global economy to grow by 2.8%, somewhat faster than in 2014;
and chemical production should also increase by a good 4%. However, a reliable
forecast is impeded by volatile raw material prices and exchange rates.
We currently anticipate an average oil price of $60 to $70 per barrel (Brent) and
an exchange rate of $1.20 per euro. For the Oil & Gas segment, this would result
in income from operations before special items considerably below the previous
year’s level. We want to once again improve earnings in our chemicals business,
however. In the end, the price of oil will be among the factors that determine
whether we increase our earnings overall. With the oil price range mentioned
above, ­income from operations before special items at the same level of the
previous year is achievable.
Investment will be substantially lower in 2015: We were able to successfully
conclude several major projects in 2014, and more plants will start up in 2015.
In the Oil & Gas segment, investment levels will be lower than in the year before.
We plan total capital expenditures of €4 billion, compared with €5.1 billion in 2014.
We will once again increase research and development spending, primarily to
­support further globalization.
One thing I can assure you: We will continue to concentrate on what we do best –
researching, developing and offering our customers attractive solutions. This is
something we have done successfully for 150 years. And the entire BASF team is
committed to making sure that this holds true in the future, as well.
Yours,

Kurt Bock

proposed dividend per share

BASF once again included
in sustainability indexes

The stock markets in 2014 were particularly marked by
the effects of geopolitical conflict and economic uncertainty. ­Investors were unsettled by the ongoing debt crisis
in the eurozone and by speculation as to the end of the
U.S. Federal R
­ eserve’s expansive ﬁscal policy. In this
volatile environment, the BASF share fell by 9.8%, trading
at €69.88 at the end of 2014. We stand by our ambitious
dividend policy and will propose a dividend of €2.80 per
share at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting – an increase
of 3.7% compared with the previous year. BASF enjoys
solid ﬁnancing and good credit ratings.

BASF share performance
▪▪ Overall mixed year on stock markets
▪▪ BASF share falls 9.8% in 2014
▪▪ Long-term performance continues to clearly ­
surpass industry indexes
Stock markets were characterized by a high degree of vola­
tility in 2014, exacerbated by geopolitical conflicts, ongoing
uncertainty as to when the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise
interest rates, and weak economic figures from the eurozone.
As a result, the German stock index DAX 30 and the BASF
share both reached their lows for the year on October 15,
2014. The increase in the Ifo Business Climate Index in

Novem­ber, which had deteriorated six times in a row before
that, as well as the European Central Bank’s decision in
Decem­ber to keep interest rates low led to a considerable
stock market recovery at the end of the year. The BASF share
­remained behind this development: Share performance was
especially weighed down by the falling price of oil in addition
to market participants’ increasing uncertainty with regard to
business in Russia.
BASF shares traded at €69.88 at the end of 2014, 9.8%
below the previous year’s closing price. Assuming that dividends were reinvested, BASF shares lost 6.8% in value in
2014. This did not match the performance of the German and
European stock markets, whose benchmark indexes DAX 30
and DJ EURO STOXX 50 gained 2.7% and 3.9% over the
same period, respectively. As for the global industry indexes,
DJ Chemicals declined by 0.1% in 2014 while MSCI World
Chemicals rose by 9%.
Viewed over a ﬁve and ten-year period, the long-term
performance of BASF shares still clearly surpasses these
­indexes. The assets of an investor who invested an amount of
€1,000 in BASF shares at the end of 2004 and reinvested the
dividends in additional BASF shares would have increased to
€3,864 by the end of 2014. This equates to an average ­annual
return of 14.5%, placing BASF shares above the returns for
the DAX 30 (8.7%), EURO STOXX 50 (3.8%) and MSCI World
Chemicals (9.6%) indexes.

Weighting of BASF shares in important indexes as of
December 31, 2014

With over 400,000 shareholders, BASF is one of the largest
publicly owned companies with a high free ﬂoat. An analysis
of the shareholder structure carried out at the end of 2014
showed that, at around 16% of share capital, the United
States and Canada made up the largest regional group of
institutional investors. Institutional investors from Germany
­
accounted for 11%. Shareholders from the United Kingdom
and Ireland hold just under 10% of BASF shares, while institutional investors from the rest of Europe hold a further 21% of
capital. Approximately 25% of the company’s share capital is
held by private investors, most of whom reside in Germany.
BASF is therefore one of the DAX 30 companies with the
largest percentage of private shareholders in Germany.

Proposed dividend of €2.80 per share
At the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, the Board of Executive
Directors and the Supervisory Board will propose a dividend
payment of €2.80 per share. We stand by our ambitious
­dividend policy and plan to pay out just under €2.6 billion to
our shareholders. Based on the year-end share price for
2014, BASF shares offer a high dividend yield of around 4%.
BASF is part of the DivDAX share index, which contains the
15 companies with the highest dividend yield in the DAX 30.
We aim to increase our dividend each year, or at least maintain it at the previous year’s level.

BASF Report 2014

BASF in key sustainability indexes

Good credit ratings and solid financing

▪▪ DJSI World: Special recognition for ecoefficiency,
environmental reporting, labor practice and
human rights
▪▪ CDLI: Inclusion once again attests to BASF’s
­transparent reporting on climate protection

With “A+/A-1/outlook stable” from rating agency Standard &
Poor’s and “A1/P-1/outlook stable” from Moody’s, we have
good credit ratings, especially in comparison with competitors in the chemical industry.
At the end of 2014, the financial indebtedness of the
BASF Group was €15.4 billion with liquid funds of €1.7 billion.
The average maturity of our financial indebtedness was
5.7 years. The company’s medium to long-term debt ­ﬁnancing
is predominantly based on corporate bonds with a b
­ alanced
maturity proﬁle. For short-term debt financing, BASF has a
commercial paper program with an issuing ­volume of up to
$12.5 billion. As backup for the commercial paper p
­ rogram,
there are committed, broadly syndicated credit lines of €6 billion available, which are not currently being used.

The BASF share has been included in the Dow Jones
­Sustainability World Index (DJSI World) for the fourteenth year
in succession. The analysts especially recognized our commitment to ecoefficiency, environmental reporting, labor
practice and human rights. As one of the most well-known
sustainability indexes, the DJSI World represents the top 10%
of the 2,500 largest companies in the Dow Jones Global
­Index based on economic, environmental and social criteria.
According to the nonproﬁt organization CDP (Carbon
Disclosure Project), BASF is among the leading companies in
the world in reporting on climate protection. The CDP
­represents more than 750 institutional investors who manage
over $90 trillion in assets. Investors use CDP indexes as
assess­
ment tools. The “Disclosure Score” measures the
transparency and completeness of a company’s climate
­protection reporting. In 2014, BASF once again achieved the
maximum disclosure score of 100 points, taking first place in
the Energy & Materials sector of the Carbon Disclosure
­Leadership Index (CDLI). We have already qualified for the
index ten times.
In 2014, BASF was unable to qualify for the Carbon
­Performance Leadership Index (CPLI), which judges companies’ climate protection activities. Inclusion in the CPLI
­requires a considerable reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with the previous year (–4%). Measures
­already taken in previous years are not eligible for consideration. BASF has already implemented numerous measures in
the past to ­reduce greenhouse gases, which have managed
to decrease absolute emissions by just under 49% since
1990 (BASF business excluding the Oil & Gas segment).
Further improvements have lower potential, preventing us
­
from reaching the CPLI’s high reduction requirement.

Analysts’ recommendations
Around 30 ﬁnancial analysts regularly publish studies on
BASF. At the end of 2014, 41% recommended buying our
shares (end of 2013: 45%) and 38% recommended holding
our shares (end of 2013: 45%), while 21% had a sell rating
(end of 2013: 10%). On December 31, 2014, the average
target share price according to analyst consensus estimates
was €77.45.

Close dialog with the capital market
▪▪ Roadshows for institutional investors and talks with
rating agencies
▪▪ Themed investor days
▪▪ Information events for private investors
▪▪ Numerous awards for BASF Investor Relations
Our corporate strategy aims to create long-term value. We
support this strategy through regular and open communication with all capital market participants. To keep institutional
investors and rating agencies informed, we host numerous
one-on-one meetings and roadshows worldwide. We also
hold informational events to provide private investors with
­insight into BASF.
In May 2014, we talked to analysts and investors in London about the implementation of the “We create chemistry”
strategy in the Chemicals segment, explaining the segment’s
significance for the BASF Verbund and outlining our most
important value chains. We also elaborated on our investment
strategy. By investing extensively in all regions, we are setting
the foundation for further profitable growth in the Chemicals
segment. We additionally presented future projects in North
America, through which BASF intends to benefit from inexpensive, shale gas-based raw materials.
For more on our “We create chemistry” strategy, see page 22 onward

To Our Shareholders
BASF on the capital market﻿

In 2014, we once again conducted special roadshows for
inves­tors who base their investment decisions on sustain­
ability criteria, where we particularly explained our measures
­related to climate protection and energy efficiency. In addition,
we conducted several special creditor relations roadshows,
where creditors and credit analysts could learn more about
our business and our financing strategy.
Investors can find comprehensive information about BASF
and BASF shares on our newly designed website. We have
also been providing interested users with current information
on the BASF share over social media platforms like Twitter
and Facebook for a few years now.
Analysts and investors have confirmed the quality of our
communication work: In the annual survey of European
financial analysts and investors conducted by Britain’s IR
­
Magazine, we received the Grand Prix for Investor Relations
and took first prize across several categories, including “Best
­Financial Reporting” and “Best Sustainability Practice” as well
as in the “Materials” sector. In the Global Top 50 Awards, also
conferred by IR Magazine and covering all regions and
­industries, BASF took second place in the category “Best­
­Investor Relations Worldwide.” Moreover, our digital communication activities were honored with first place in the British
IR Society’s Best Practice Awards.

5 segments
14 divisions
85 strategic business units

At BASF, we create chemistry – and have been doing so
for 150 years. As the world’s leading chemical company,
we combine economic success with environmental
­protection and social responsibility. In the BASF Group,
around 113,000 employees work on contributing to the
success of our customers in nearly all sectors and almost
every country in the world. Our broad portfolio is arranged
into ﬁve segments: Chemicals, Performance Products,
Functional Materials & Solutions, Agricultural Solutions
and Oil & Gas.

Organization of the BASF Group
▪▪ 14 divisions grouped into five segments
▪▪ Regional divisions, corporate units and competence
centers support our business
Until the end of 2014, five segments contained 14 divisions
that managed and bore operational responsibility for our 65
global and regional business units. The divisions develop
strategies for our 85 strategic business units and are organized according to sectors or products.

As of January 1, 2015, we reorganized our paper chemicals
business in order to sharpen our competitive edge. This
­involved dissolving the Paper Chemicals division and continuing the paper chemicals business in the Performance Chemicals and Dispersions & Pigments divisions. By doing so, we
can utilize synergies along the existing value chains and at the
same time remain a reliable, high-performing partner for the
paper industry.
The regional divisions contribute to the local development
of our business and help exploit market potential. They are
also responsible for optimizing infrastructure for our business.
For financial reporting purposes, our divisions are organized
into the following four regions: Europe; North America; Asia
Pacific; and South America, Africa, Middle East.
Three central divisions, six corporate units and ten competence centers provide services for the BASF Group in areas
such as ﬁnance, investor relations, communications, human
resources, research, engineering, and site management, as
well as environment, health and safety.

BASF has companies in more than eighty countries and supplies products to a large number of business partners in
nearly every part of the world. In 2014, we achieved 44% of
our sales (excluding Oil & Gas) with customers in Europe. In
addition, 26% of sales were generated in North America; 21%
in Asia Pacific; and 9% in South America, Africa, Middle East.
Based on the entire BASF Group, 55% of our sales were to
customers in Europe, 20% in North America, 17% in Asia
Pacific and 8% in South America, Africa, Middle East.
We operate six Verbund sites as well as 353 additional
production sites worldwide. Our Verbund site in Ludwigshafen
is the world’s largest integrated chemical complex. This was
where the Verbund concept was originally developed and
steadily honed before being put into practice at additional
sites.

The Verbund system is one of BASF’s great strengths. Here,
we add value as one company by using our resources
efﬁciently. The Production Verbund, for example, intelligently
links production units and energy demand so that heat
­released by production processes can be used as energy in
other plants. Furthermore, by-products of one plant can serve
as feedstock elsewhere. In this system, chemical processes
run with lower energy consumption and higher product yield.
This not only saves us raw materials and energy, it also avoids
emissions, lowers logistics costs and makes use of synergies.
Another important part of the Verbund concept is the
Technology and Know-How Verbund. Expert knowledge is
pooled into our global research platforms.
For more on the Verbund concept, see basf.com/verbund_e

Competitive environment
BASF occupies one of the top three market positions in about
70% of the business areas in which it is active. Our most
impor­
tant global competitors include Akzo Nobel, Bayer,
Clariant, Dow Chemical, DSM, DuPont, Evonik, Formosa
Plastics, Lanxess, Reliance, Sabic, Sinopec, Solvay and
many hundreds of local and regional competitors. We expect
competitors from emerging markets to become increasingly
signiﬁcant in the years ahead.

Corporate legal structure
As the publicly traded parent company of BASF Group,
BASF SE takes a central role: Directly or indirectly, it holds the
shares in the companies belonging to the BASF Group, and is
also the largest operating company. The majority of Group
companies cover a broad spectrum of our business. In some,
we concentrate on speciﬁc business areas: The Wintershall
Group, for example, focuses on oil and gas activities. In the
BASF Group Consolidated Financial Statements, 274 companies including BASF SE are fully consolidated. We consolidate
seven joint operations on a proportional basis, and 34 companies are accounted for using the equity method.

We create chemistry
for a sustainable future

As strategic basis for our ­
success on the market

As guideline for our
conduct and actions

With the “We create chemistry” strategy, BASF has set
itself ambitious goals in order to strengthen its position
as the world’s leading chemical company. We want to
contribute to a sustainable future and have embedded
this into our corporate purpose: “We create chemistry for
a sustainable future.”

Innovations based on chemistry will play a key role in three
areas in particular:

In 2050, more than nine billion people will live on Earth. While
the world’s population and its demands will keep growing, the
planet’s resources are ﬁnite. On the one hand, population
growth is associated with huge global challenges; and yet
­we also see many opportunities, especially for the chemical
­industry.

Our leading position as an integrated global chemical
company creates opportunities for us to make important
­
contributions in all three of these areas. In pursuing them, we
act in accordance with four strategic principles.

Our corporate purpose

▪▪ We create chemistry for a sustainable future
Through research and innovation, we support our customers
in nearly every industry in meeting the current and future
needs of society. Our products and solutions contribute to

The BASF brand

Global standards

▪▪ Trust in the BASF brand
▪▪ New claim in BASF logo: “We create chemistry”

▪▪ We act according to values and standards of
conduct that fulﬁll or exceed laws and regulations
▪▪ We review our performance with regular audits and
a three-pronged monitoring system

We rely on a strong brand in order to expand our position as
the world’s leading chemical company. Our brand is derived
from our strategy and our corporate purpose – “We create
chemistry for a sustainable future” – as well as our strategic
principles and values.
“Connected” describes the essence of the BASF brand.
Connectivity is one of BASF’s great strengths. Our Verbund
concept – in production, technologies and knowledge as well
as employees, customers and partners – enables innovative
solutions for a sustainable future. As of January 1, 2015, we
changed our claim in the BASF logo from “The Chemical
Company” to “We create chemistry” in order to more firmly
embed our solution-oriented strategy in the public consciousness. Our brand creates value by helping communicate its
usefulness for our stakeholders as well as our values.
Anywhere our stakeholders encounter our brand, we aim
to convince them that BASF stands for connectivity, intelligent
solutions, value-adding partnerships, an attractive working
environment and sustainability. This contributes to our
customers’ confidence in their buying decisions and to­
­
our company value.
We are constantly developing our brand image by measuring awareness of and trust in our brand, and therefore in
our company. A global market research study conducted in
2014 showed that, in terms of awareness and trust, BASF is
above the industry average in numerous countries. The study
collected data on respondents’ aided awareness of BASF
and our most important competitors. Our goal is to continue
increasing this value in all markets relevant to BASF.

Our standards fulﬁll or exceed existing laws and regulations
and take internationally recognized principles into account.
We respect and promote all of the following:
––The 10 principles of the U.N. Global Compact
––The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and both United
Nations covenants on human rights
––The ILO’s core labor standards and Tripartite Declaration of
Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social
Policy (MNE Declaration)
––The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises
––The Responsible Care Global Charter
––The German Corporate Governance Code
We stipulate rules for our employees with standards that
apply throughout the Group. We set ourselves ambitious
­
goals with voluntary commitments and review our environmental, health and safety performance using our Responsible
Care Management System. Regular audits and a threepronged monitoring system ensure our compliance with labor
and social standards. This system comprises the following
instruments:
––External compliance hotlines
––Annual inquiry into our Group companies to inspect prevailing working conditions
––Close dialog with our stakeholders, such as employee
­representatives and international organizations
Our business partners are expected to comply with prevailing
laws and regulations and to align their actions with internationally recognized principles. We have established monitoring
systems to ensure this.

Innovations for a sustainable future

Business expansion in emerging markets

Innovations in chemistry are necessary to meet the needs of
the growing world population on a long-term basis. The
­development of innovative products and solutions is, therefore, of vital signiﬁcance for BASF. In 2020, we aim to generate
around €30 billion of our sales and €7 billion of our EBITDA
with the help of innovative products that will have been on the
market for less than ten years. This means effective and
­efficient research is becoming increasingly important. In addition to our R&D activities in established business areas, we
have deﬁned technology and growth ﬁelds with which we can
make a decisive contribution to innovative solutions for global
challenges and contribute to sustainable development. The
growth fields address new business areas for BASF.
We are continuing to strengthen our research and
­development activities in Asia as well as in North and South
America. As of January 1, 2015, we are pooling our worldwide ­
research expertise into three platforms, each head­
quartered in one of the regions particularly significant for us:
Europe, Asia Pacific and North America: Process Research &
Chemical Engineering (Ludwigshafen, Germany), Advanced
Materials & Systems Research (Shanghai, China) and Bio­
science Research (Research Triangle Park, North Carolina).
By 2020, we aim to conduct half of our research and development ­activities outside of Europe. Our stronger global presence opens up new opportunities to participate in regional
­developments in innovation and gain access to local talent.

In the years ahead, we want to grow even more vigorously in
the emerging markets and expand our position there. Today’s
emerging markets are expected to account for around 60% of
global chemical production in 2020. We want to benefit from
the considerable growth in these regions and plan to invest
more than a third of our capital expenditures there between
2011 and 2020.
In 2014, emerging markets once again saw substantially
faster growth rates than the industrialized countries, although
the pace was slower than in the previous year. While momentum deceler­ated only marginally in Asia’s emerging markets,
the South American economy stagnated. Growth in Brazil
was weak; Argentina experienced a recession. Eastern European emerging markets posted only slow overall growth, as
well. Russia’s economy slowed down enormously due to the
crisis in Ukraine, declining oil prices, trade sanctions imposed
by the European Union and the United States, and the sharp
depreciation of the Russian ruble.
Despite higher sales volumes, we observed a slight
­currency-related decline in our business in emerging markets
in 2014: Compared with 2013, sales at our companies
headquartered in these countries decreased by 1% to
­
€15,804 million. Based on customer location, sales (excluding Oil & Gas) in emerging markets were down by 1% to
€19,242 million year-on-year, also as a result of currency
­effects. Sales to customers in emerging markets therefore
amounted to around 33% of total sales (excluding Oil & Gas)
in 2014. By 2020, we aim to expand this proportion to 45%.

Goals
In 2011, we set ourselves sales and earnings goals for 2015
and 2020 as part of the “We create chemistry” strategy. W
­ e
will not reach our medium-term fi­ nancial goals for 2015, primarily because gross domestic product and industrial and
chemical production grew at a considerably lower average
rate from 2010 to 2015 than ­­our strategy had anticipated
(former expectations in parentheses)1:

This weaker economic development is largely due to sluggish
momentum in the emerging markets and the lack of ­recovery
in the European economy.
Furthermore, pressure increased on margins for some
basic products as well as in sections of the Performance
Products segment.

––Growth of gross domestic product: 2.6% (3.4%)
––Growth in industrial production: 3.3% (4.5%)

Management’s Report
Our strategy — Value-based management ﻿

BASF Report 2014

Value-based management
“We add value as one company” is one of the four principles of our “We create chemistry” strategy. To create
­value in the long term, a company’s earnings must exceed
the cost of stockholders’ equity and borrowing costs. This
is why we strive to earn a premium on our cost of capital
of at least €2 billion on average per year. To ensure BASF’s
long-term success, we encourage and support all employ­
ees in thinking and acting entrepreneurially in line with our
value-based management concept. Our goal: to create
awareness as to how each and every employee can ﬁnd
value-oriented solutions in the company’s day-to-day
operations and implement these in an effective and
efﬁcient manner.

EBIT after cost of capital
▪▪ Performance and management indicator
Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) after cost of capital is
a key indicator for the performance and management of the
BASF Group, its operating divisions and business units. This
ﬁgure combines the company’s financial situation as summarized in EBIT with the costs for the capital made available to us
by shareholders and creditors. When we earn a premium on
our cost of capital, we exceed the return expected by our
shareholders.

The ﬁgures for 2010 and 2011 were not restated in accordance with IFRS 10 and 11.

Calculation of the cost of capital percentage
The cost of capital percentage (weighted average cost of
capital, WACC) is determined using the weighted cost of
capital from equity and borrowing costs. The cost of equity is
ascertained using the Capital Asset Pricing Model. Borrowing
costs are determined based on the ﬁnancing costs of the
BASF Group.
EBIT after cost of capital, which we use as a steering
­parameter, is a pretax ﬁgure. Therefore, we use the current
average tax rate to derive the pretax cost of capital percentage from the WACC. In 2014, this cost of capital percentage
was 11%; it will be at the same level in 2015. Based on this,
an EBIT threshold is calculated which must then be reached
by all the BASF Group’s operating units put together in order
to earn the cost of capital.

▪▪ Exercising a value-oriented mindset in day-to-day
business by every employee
For us, value-based management means the daily focus
placed on value by all of our employees. To this end, we have
identiﬁed value drivers that show how each and every unit in
the company can create value. We develop performance indicators for the individual value drivers that help us to plan and
pursue changes.
An important factor in ensuring the successful implementation of value­
-based management is linking the goals of
BASF to the individual target agreements of employees. In the
operating units, the most important performance indicators
are the achievement of a positive EBIT after cost of capital
and a competitive level of profitability. By contrast, the functional units’ contribution to value is assessed on the basis of
effectiveness and efficiency.
All this forms a comprehensive system of value drivers
and key indicators for the individual levels and functions at
BASF. In addition to EBIT after cost of capital, EBIT and EBIT
before special items are the most signiﬁcant performance
indicators for measuring business success as well as for
­
steering the BASF Group and its operating units.
We primarily comment on EBIT before special items on a
segment and division level in our ﬁnancial reporting because
this ﬁgure is adjusted for inﬂuences not associated with typical business operations. This makes it particularly suitable for
describing financial development over time. In addition to
EBIT before special items, we also report on sales as a further
main driver for EBIT after cost of capital. BASF’s nonfinancial
targets are focused more on the long term, and are not used
for short-term steering.
According to our value-based management concept, all
employees can make a contribution in their business area to
help ensure that we earn the targeted premium on our cost of
capital. We pass this value-based management concept on
to our team around the world through seminars and training
events, thereby promoting entrepreneurial thinking at all levels
within BASF.

Management’s Report
Our strategy — Sustainability management﻿

Sustainability management
Sustainability is ﬁrmly embedded into our company
strategy and organization. Sustainability management
­
follows our corporate purpose, “We create chemistry for
a sustainable future,” and supports our strategic principle, “We drive sustainable solutions.”

Strategy
▪▪ Recognizing significant topics and trends early on
▪▪ Taking advantage of business opportunities
▪▪ Minimizing risks
As the world’s leading chemical company, we combine eco­
no­mic success, environmental protection and social respon­
sibility. We have recognized sustainability as a signiﬁcant driver
for growth. By integrating sustainability considerations into
our decision-making processes, we optimize our business
and contribute to long-term economic success. We accomplish this by, for example, embedding sustainability into our
organization with clearly defined responsibilities.
Our sustainability management has three duties: We want
to identify significant topics early on, take advantage of business opportunities, and minimize risks. We are assisted in this
endeavor by constant, trust-based exchange with our stakeholders as well as by our systematic materiality analysis.
We take advantage of business opportunities by offering
our customers innovative products and solutions that contribute to sustainable development. We ensure that sustainability
is included in the development and implementation of our
business units’ strategies and research projects. Our “opportunity finding” method was developed for this purpose: It
allows us to identify main sustainability drivers in relevant
­
­value chains and for our customers. This is how we aim to
identify, and make targeted use of, the potential business
opportunities created by sustainability.
We minimize risks by setting ourselves globally uniform
standards for safety and security, environmental and health
protection, product stewardship, and compliance, as well as
for labor and social standards – many of which go beyond
legal requirements.

In addition, we have integrated various dimensions of sustainability into our standard processes for evaluating investment
decisions in property, plant and equipment as well as in financial
assets. We prepare expert appraisals for detailed assessments
of sustainability issues to assist in our decision-making.
We have created structures to promote sustainable, entrepreneurial actions all the way from strategy to implementation.
The Corporate Sustainability Board is BASF’s central steering
committee for sustainable development. It is comprised of
heads of our business, corporate and functional units as well as
of the regions. A member of the Board of Executive ­Directors
serves as chair. We have also established an external, independent Stakeholder Advisory Council. Its members bring an
impor­tant external perspective to the table in discussions with
BASF’s Board of Executive Directors, thereby helping us expand
our strengths and identify our potential for improvement.
For more on the organization of our sustainability management, see
basf.com/sustainabilitymanagement

Materiality analysis
▪▪ Relevant sustainability topics identified and
prioritized
▪▪ Topics grouped into eight material aspects of
sustainability
The findings from our materiality analysis provide the foundation for focused and reader-oriented reporting. At the same
time, they serve as the starting point for integrating material
aspects of sustainability into our management and evaluation
processes.
Starting in 2013, we once again used a multistep process
to identify and prioritize the sustainability topics relevant for
BASF. We started by collecting around 100 potentially relevant subjects. A workshop and qualitative interviews with
inter­
nal and external specialists revealed that 38 of these
were particularly relevant. Using a global survey, we gathered
feedback on these 38 topics from around 350 external stakeholders worldwide, as well as around 90 experts and managers from various functions within the company. The participants rated the topics in terms of their current and f­uture
rele­vance for BASF. The results of this ranking are presented
in a materiality matrix.
Finally, the findings were discussed in internal workshops
and classified under eight overarching material aspects of
sustainability. The results of this materiality study and the
eight aspects derived from it were presented to, and validated
by, the Board of Executive Directors.

BASF Report 2014

In order to integrate sustainability further into our business
activities, we launched a follow-up process in 2014 that
translates the results of the materiality analysis into our steering and business processes. Categories of action were
­assigned to the individual aspects. A further step involved
inter­views with representatives from business, corporate and
functional units, who assessed the business relevance of
each category along the value chain. The results of this quantitative prioritization process show where along the value

chain we have the possibility to take action with respect to
each individual aspect. As a result, we have achieved a better
understanding of the steps along the value chain where action
needs to be prioritized in terms of the material aspects, and
which topic areas we can influence with our actions. Building
on this, we want to derive additional measures that maximize
the positive effects of our actions and further minimize the
negative ones.

Engaging stakeholders

Creating value for customers

▪▪ Constant dialog with our stakeholders along
the ­value chain
▪▪ Sustainability integrated into day-to-day business

▪▪ Product portfolio examined and evaluated for
­sustainability
▪▪ Various additional instruments established for
­assessing sustainability

Our stakeholders include employees, customers, suppliers
and shareholders, as well as experts in science, industry,
politics, society and media. We provide transparent communication about our activities and take on critical questions.
Through constant dialog with our stakeholders along the
­entire value chain, we want to ensure that society accepts our
activities and subsequently build partnerships based on trust.
At the same time, we use this dialog to verify that our materiality analysis is complete and up to date.
We have a particular responsibility toward our production
sites’ neighbors, and discuss current issues with them in
84 community advisory panels. These panels aim to promote
open exchange between citizens and our site management
with the goal of strengthening trust in our activities.
In keeping with our corporate strategy, we integrate sustainability considerations into our day-to-day business and
help our employees make their contribution to a sustainable
future. We offered further information sessions, online ­courses,
workshops and discussions on sustainability in 2014.
In order to even more closely involve our stakeholders, we
discussed topics like responsibility along the value chain,
climate protection and human rights with our Stakeholder
­
Advisory Council in 2014. The diverse international experts
from science and society once again discussed material
aspects of sustainability with BASF’s Board of Executive
Directors in o
­ rder to enhance BASF’s sustainability strategy.
For example, a Stakeholder Advisory Council discussion on
the topic “partnering” prompted us to review and standardize
our approach to dialog with neighbors at relevant sites around
the world.
BASF takes an active part in the United Nations Global
Compact: BASF’s Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors is a member of the United Nations Global Compact
Board. In the worldwide network of Global Compact LEAD,
we are involved in the creation of the Post-2015 Development
Agenda and discussing possible global sustainability goals
together with the other participants. BASF is also active in
numerous local Global Compact networks.
Our lobbying and political communications are conducted
in accordance with transparent guidelines and in keeping
with our publicly stated positions. BASF does not in principle
support political parties. The BASF Corporation Employees
Political Action Committee, established by our employees in
the United States, is an independent, federally registered
employee association that collects donations for political
­
purposes and independently decides how these are used.

From 2011 to the end of 2014, BASF conducted sustaina­bility
assessments and evaluations on 98.3% of its entire portfolio
of more than 60,000 specific product applications – which
account for €66.3 billion in sales – using the Sustainable
­
Solution Steering method. This externally validated procedure
allows us to deter­
mine how our products contribute to
­sustainability. We observe their application in various markets
and industries.
The product applications we analyzed were arranged into
four categories: “Accelerator,” “Performer,” “Transitioner” and
“Challenged.” Of the analyzed products, 23.0% (by sales)
turned out to be Accelerators. They contribute particularly to
sustainability in the value chain. Performers are solutions that
meet all of the market’s standard sustainability requirements.
Around 74.1% of BASF’s analyzed product portfolio matches
this descrip­tion. A Transitioner is a product for which specific
sustainability requirements have been identified and plans of
action have been defined. These recommendations are being
carried out. Approximately 2.6% of the analyzed products fall
under this category. Applications that do not sufficiently fulfill
significant sustainability criteria are labeled Challenged. BASF
is developing plans of action for these products in order to
find better solutions, which can include research projects,
reformulations or even replacing one product with an alternative product. Currently, this applies for 0.3% of the analyzed
products.
We aim to increase the number of Accelerator solutions in
the long term in order to further improve the sustainability
contribution made by BASF and its customers. This is why
our product portfolio is constantly being reviewed.

We use our established Eco-Efﬁciency Analysis tool to identify
critical parameters for improving the ecological and economic
balance of our products and processes along the value chain. In
order to even better support our divisions in implementing
­sustainability strategies and goals, we also offer other ecological
evaluation instruments alongside the Eco-Efficiency Analysis.
These include the methods often used for impact assessment
as a part of life-cycle analyses.
With our AgBalance® method, we can address specific
questions in order to improve sustainability in agricul­tural production and products in the food sector. We use the information
from these comprehensive evaluations to work on products and
solutions together with our customers that make a contribution
to sustainable development.
Our “mass balance method” allows us to replace fossil
­resources in the current Production Verbund with renewable
resources.

risks early on
▪▪ Global standards provide framework for actions
Through our materiality analysis, dialog with partners along
the value chain, and our many years of experience, we are
constantly developing a better understanding of possible
risks along our value chain. We optimize our risk management
by recognizing sustainability-related risks early on and preventing these as far as possible.
Uniform worldwide standards provide a clear framework
for our actions and are outlined in our Code of Conduct. We
support the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business
and Human Rights and have been part of the Global Business
Initiative since 2012 – a group of globally operating companies from different industries whose goal is to advance the
regard of human rights in business activities. As the only
member based in Germany, we worked in 2014 with partners
and experts on challenges and solutions surrounding business and human rights, which included introducing ­examples
of how to implement the U.N. Guiding Principles. In 2014, we
also participated in two events for the consultation process of
the German government’s national plan of action on this
topic. We are constantly working to improve our internal
guidelines and processes in keeping with the U.N. Guiding
Principles.

Innovations based on effective and efﬁcient research and
development are an important growth engine for BASF.
Our employees work in interdisciplinary teams on innovative processes and products for a sustainable future.
This is how we ensure our long-term business success
with chemistry-based solutions for almost all sectors of
­industry.

Global network in science and industry

A growing need for energy, food and clean water, limited
­resources and a booming world population – reconciling all
these factors is the greatest challenge of our time. Innovations
based on chemistry play a key role here, as they contribute
decisively to new solutions.
We have set ourselves ambitious goals: In 2015, we aim
to achieve sales of around €10 billion and an EBITDA of
around €2.5 billion with new and improved products or
­applications that will have been on the market for less than
ﬁve years. In 2020, we want to increase our sales to around
€30 billion and EBITDA to around €7 billion with innovations
that will have been on the market for no longer than ten years.

Our global network with more than 600 excellent universities,
research institutes and companies is an important part of our
Know-How Verbund. We work with them in many different
disciplines in order to achieve our ambitious growth targets. In
2014, we established the “Network for Advanced Materials
Open Research” initiative together with seven leading universities and research institutes in China, Japan and South
­Korea. Together, we aim to develop new materials for a wide
range of applications. The initial focus is on products for the
automotive, construction, detergent and cleaner industries,
as well as the water and wind energy sector. In addition, we
have founded the “California Research Alliance by BASF”
­together with major universities on the U.S. West Coast. This
multidisciplinary research institute focuses on new inorganic
materials and their applications, bioscience, and related
­technologies.

BASF Report 2014

Innovations based on chemistry require market-oriented
research and development that is sharply focused on the
­
needs of our customers. In order to bring promising research
ideas even faster to market, we regularly assess our projects
according to a multistep process. BASF New Business plays
a central role in the search for new business areas. It identiﬁes
trends and future markets at an early stage, turning attractive
topics into growth ﬁelds.
Another vital factor for our success is a global research
and development presence. We continued to broaden our
activities in 2014, especially in Asia. By expanding our Innovation Campus Asia Pacific, we are further boosting the regional
research capacities for new materials and systems. We are
also expanding business areas like formulations and chemical
process engineering. In Mumbai, India, we opened a global
research and development center that focuses on organic
synthesis, process development, formulation and crop
­protection research, and molecular modeling. We will also
work on innovations for the electronics industry at our new
Electronic Materials Research and Development Center Asia
Paci­fic in Suwon, South Korea, which was inaugurated in 2014.
We aim to keep strengthening our research and development activities in Asia as well as in North and South America.
Starting January 2015, we are pooling our research expertise
into three global platforms surrounding the topics of chemistry, materials and bioscience, each headquartered in a region
significant for us: Europe, Asia Pacific and America. We plan
to conduct half of our research and development activities
outside of Europe by 2020. This increased presence outside

Europe creates new opportunities for fortifying and expanding
customer relations and scientific collaborations, strengthening our R&D Verbund and making BASF an even more attractive partner and employer in the regions.
The number and quality of our patents attest to our power
of innovation and long-term competitiveness. We ﬁled around
1,200 new patents worldwide in 2014. For the sixth time in
succession, we headed the rankings in the Patent Asset
­Index in 2014 – a method which compares patent portfolios
industry-wide. This once again underscores BASF’s power of
innovation.

Research focus areas
▪▪ Chemistry-based innovations play important role in
answering questions of the future
▪▪ Growth ﬁelds with attractive sales potential in 2020
▪▪ Technology fields provide the basis for developing
our growth ﬁelds
In order to develop future business areas for BASF, we have
deﬁned growth and technology ﬁelds for which we expect
high sales potential in 2020. These research focus subjects
are derived from the three major areas in which chemistrybased innovations will play a key role in the future: ­resources,
environment and climate; food and nutrition; and quality of
life. We regularly review the attractiveness of these growth
and technology ﬁelds for BASF and adjust our portfolio as
necessary.

Growth ﬁelds – examples

Technology fields

Innovative mobility concepts such as electromobility require
batteries that are high-performance, affordable and safe.
Therefore, in the Batteries for Mobility growth field, we are
researching important system components of a battery, such
as new cathode materials with a higher energy density and
improved cost-benefit profile, and electrolytes for increased
lifespan in lithium-ion batteries. In 2014, we expanded our
research and development facilities in Beachwood, Ohio, and
Amagasaki, Japan, where we will explore new cathode materials and improved electrolyte systems in the future. In order
to better understand battery materials and stimulate new
ideas, we work together with renowned scientists worldwide
in our “Research Network Electrochemistry and Batteries.”
We decided in 2014 to continue the university network, which
was established in 2010, for another five years.
The growing world population’s increasing demand for
food requires additional solutions for healthier plants and
higher yields that supplement conventional crop protection.
This is why we research new products in the Functional Crop
Care growth field that, for example, improve plant growth,
better protect seeds, and help plants use scarce resources
like water and nutrients more efficiently. Farmers all over the
world mainly employ urea-based fertilizers in order to ensure
that plants are supplied with enough nitrogen. However, some
of the nitrogen contained in these fertilizers is lost as gaseous
ammonia. Limus® can greatly reduce these losses. Thanks to
its special formulation, this product also enables better storage of urea-based fertilizers. Limus® guarantees farmers both
efficient fertilizer application and higher yields.
One of our projects in the Automotive Lightweight
Composites growth field is the search for innovative materials and material systems that can be used to manufacture
load-bearing components, such as the frame or passenger
compartment, out of fiber-reinforced plastic. We are developing composite systems based on epoxy, polyurethane and
polyamide resins. Carbon fibers lend themselves particularly
well to reinforcement materials thanks to their high rigidity. In
addition to developing the materials themselves, we are also
adapting composite systems to the automotive industry’s
new manufacturing processes in order to make their transfer
into large-scale production economically viable.

Various cross-sectional technologies provide the basis for
developing our growth ﬁelds. We have grouped these into
three technology ﬁelds: Materials, Systems & Nanotech­
nology, Raw Material Change and White Biotechnology.

The challenges of the future require intelligent solutions based
on new systems and functional materials, which means that
formulation and application expertise is increasing in significance. In the Materials, Systems & Nanotechnology technology field, BASF researchers work for example on new
color filters that can be used in laptop and computer monitors
as well as television screens. Irgaphor Red® S 3621 CF,
BASF’s new red pigment, ensures especially high image
quality in liquid crystal displays. Thanks to its tiny particles
that are less than 40 nanometers in size, light is less scattered
in the color filter. The viewer therefore sees a very sharp image
with clear colors and high contrast.
In the Raw Material Change technology ﬁeld, we are
searching for alternatives and supplements to crude oil as a
raw material for the chemical industry. With natural gas, carbon dioxide and renewable resources, we aim to expand the
raw material basis of our value chains in the long term. To do
so, we use catalysts that make many chemical reactions
more cost-effective, more environmentally compatible, or in
some cases even possible. In the BasCat joint laboratory at
the Technical University (TU) of Berlin, we and our partners
seek to gain fundamental knowledge on activating less reactive molecules in order to accelerate the development of
indus­trial catalysts in the long term. We started operations at
the new BasCat laboratory building on the TU Berlin campus
in 2014.
In the technology field White Biotechnology, we are
research­ing methods and techniques for creating chemical
and biochemical products in an efficient and resource-saving
manner. Fermentation and biocatalysis increasingly represent
competitive alternatives to chemical processes. Our researchers are working on new enzymes for technical applications
that use molecular biological methods to improve the applications’ properties. Furthermore, they optimize fermentational
production processes in order to produce enzymes on a large
scale at high yield.

Chemicals: We have added a new product to our comprehensive range of amines: methyl diaminocyclohexane,
which we market under the brand name Baxxodur® ECX 210.
As a hardening agent in epoxy systems, Baxxodur® ECX 210
has proven valuable in, for example, the manufacture of wind
turbine rotor blades and layering systems for industrial flooring and bridges. Baxxodur® ECX 210 is more efficient and can
be processed for a longer period of time than comparable
products.
Succinity GmbH, our joint venture with Corbion Purac,
has been producing succinic acid out of renewable
­resources since 2014. The highly efficient process, based on
sugar, starch or glycerin, binds carbon dioxide, reducing the
formation of carbon dioxide by 60% compared with petrochemical processes. Bio-based succinic acid is therefore an
economically and ecologically viable alternative to conventional succinic acid for our customers. Succinic acid is highly
versatile and can be used, for example, in the production of
bioplastics, solvents, polyurethanes and plasticizers.
Our chemical solutions help the highly competitive lumber
industry further improve their products’ properties and reduce
costs. For example, we have been able to enhance our
­Kaurit® glues so that wood can be worked into fiberboard
even more efficiently and reliably, even with varying degrees of
moisture content. As a result, our customers benefit from a
higher level of process reliability and greater plant throughput.

Performance Products: We launched Styrofan ECO® 7623,
our newest water-based polymer dispersion, on the market in
2014. It imparts excellent flow properties and adhesion to
­repair mortars and floor screeds, and increases strength and
abrasion resistance, as well. Styrofan ECO® 7623 meets the
respective industries’ most stringent formaldehyde and
­ammonia emission standards for building materials, making it
especially environmentally friendly.
With our innovative portfolio of SAVIVA® superabsorbents,
producers of baby diapers, adult incontinence products and
feminine hygiene articles can reduce raw material consumption and increase the comfort of their products. Droplet poly­
merization allows us to produce a round particle shape that
­results in an especially soft feel. Liquid is rapidly absorbed
and distributed, keeping the skin pleasantly dry. The development of this pioneering technology makes superabsorbents
even more efficient, enabling the creation of products like
thinner and more comfortable diapers.
Trace elements in animal feed are essential in livestock
farming. For example, they strengthen immune function,
­promoting the animals’ welfare. Our new, globally launched
glycinate product line comprises organic compounds with
copper, iron, manganese and zinc. Their high degree of
­bioavailability means that trace elements can be absorbed
especially readily from feed. Furthermore, their excellent water
solubility allows BASF glycinates to be easily added to d
­ rinking
water. The animals are thus optimally provided with important
trace elements, and the environment benefits from fewer
­excreted trace elements.
Paper and cardboard food packaging is coated with
­barrier materials to protect food from outside influences and
keep, for example, water and grease from leaking out. BASF’s
Epotal® product line comprises water-based barrier dispersions to efficiently coat various types of packaging. In South
America, one of our biggest customers has been using
Epotal® DS 2013 in their paper production as a liquid barrier
for frozen food cartons since the middle of 2014. Epotal® DS
2013 is partly composed of renewable materials, can be
easily recycled and is especially easy for customers to use.
Industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants can
be operated more efficiently and effectively with Zetag®
­ULTRA, our new range of flocculants. Zetag® ULTRA’s highly
effective binding capability enables advanced dewatering
performance compared with conventional flocculants. The
higher proportion of cake solids in the dewatered sludge
benefits the environment, as less energy is required for transportation, disposal and i­ncineration. This has a positive impact
on the treatment f­acility’s carbon footprint.

BASF Report 2014 

Functional Materials & Solutions: High ozone levels present
a major challenge to many cities around the world. This is why
we developed PremAir®, a patented catalytic coating for
­automotive radiators. As air flows over the radiator, PremAir®
converts the ground-level ozone – the main component of
smog – into oxygen. Our innovation, PremAir® NXT, is
­especially designed for use with today’s smaller automotive
radiators. It can achieve even higher ozone conversion performance than the standard PremAir® coating over the lifetime­
of the vehicle. This helps automobile manufacturers meet
the challenging California LEV III and U.S. Tier 3 emissions
requirements and improves air quality for us all.
With MasterSphere, we provide the construction industry
with an utterly novel solution for making concrete more resistant to frost and dew. Around 50 external factors must be
monitored in the application of conventional technologies for
extending concrete’s lifespan under such conditions – such
as how fine the concrete’s raw materials are, how long it takes
to transport the fresh concrete, or the concrete’s compression during pumping. MasterSphere, however, is impacted
by none of these factors. This not only makes application
easier for our customers, it also substantially increases the
concrete’s durability. ­
Buildings are given an improved life­
span, especially in cooler climates.
Our new RELEST® Wind LEP ETU paint protects rotor
blades even better – especially on the edges – from the
­enormous stress of rain, hail, snow, sand and ultraviolet rays.
Before, an intensive process was required involving a special
film. With RELEST® Wind LEP ETU, the paint can be applied
directly following pretreatment. The substantial advantages
here are especially apparent when touching up dings and
scratches: Whereas in the past, a rotor blade’s film had to be
entirely removed for repair work, damaged spots can now be
treated individually and thus more efficiently.
The BMW i3, the first entirely electric production vehicle
from the BMW Group, makes use of several of our innovative
high-performance plastics at once. Their improved material
properties make the car body sturdier, the roof construction
stiffer and the seats more comfortable. The resilience of our
Elastolit® polyurethane system was demonstrated in the
­Chinese province of Guangdong in July 2014: While more
than 70,000 metal and concrete power pylons were severely
damaged by Typhoon Rammasun, the pylons made with
Elastolit®, which were installed as part of a pilot project,
stood intact.

Management’s Report
Innovation﻿

Agricultural Solutions: We work together with farmers to
keep farmland arable for future generations and to accommodate society’s rising expectations. To do so, we constantly
invest in our development pipeline in order to expand our
portfolio both in and beyond conventional crop protection –
such as in biological solutions. In 2014, we invested
€511 million in research and development in the Crop
­Protection division, representing around 9% of sales for the
segment.
Our innovation pipeline continued to increase in value
in 2014. The pipeline comprises products launched in the
­period between 2010 and 2020. We foresee a peak sales
potential of €2,300 million for these products, which repre­
sents an i­ncrease of €200 million compared with the previous
year. The higher value is boosted by innovations in all application areas. Particular examples include a new, especially
high-performance insecticide as well as the area of herbicide
tolerance with the herbicide Engenia®, the next-generation
dicamba formulation.
The Functional Crop Care portfolio has continued to show
very promising development. For example, we will launch
SerifelTM, a biological fungicide from our Functional Crop
Care research and development platform, on the market in
2015. SerifelTM fights fungal infections with a broad range of
effects all the way up until harvest and is characterized by a
variety of action mechanisms.
BASF Plant Science: We work with numerous biotechnology and seed companies, research institutes and universities
worldwide to develop crops with higher yields and improved
resistance to unfavorable environmental factors, such as
drought. The drought-tolerant corn Genuity® DroughtGard®,
the first product from our cooperation with Monsanto, allows
for an average crop yield increase of more than 300 kilograms
per hectare compared with competitors’ drought-tolerant
corn varieties.
Oil & Gas: Our research and development activities focus on
improving the discovery rate of oil and gas reservoirs,
developing technologies for reservoirs with challenging
­
­development and production conditions, and increasing the
recovery factor of reservoirs.
Our minimum facility platform in the L6-B field in the
Dutch North Sea represents an important step in the more
efficient production of small and medium-scale reservoirs.
This mini-platform is 25% lighter than previous platforms and
can be installed in merely nine months, substantially reducing
purchasing and manufacturing costs. With this new generation of platforms, even the numerous smaller natural gas fields
in the North Sea can be produced over a longer period of time
in an economical manner.

▪▪ Total investments slightly above previous year’s level
▪▪ Intensiﬁed investments in emerging markets
We invested €5,368 million in property, plant and equipment
in 2014. Total investments therefore exceeded the previous
year’s level by €451 million. We presume that average yearly
investment between 2015 and 2020 will be lower compared
with 2014, after having initiated several major projects in
­previous years that are now being implemented. Our investments in 2014 focused on the Chemicals, Oil & Gas and
Performance Products segments.
In Ludwigshafen, we are building an integrated TDI facility
with a capacity of 300,000 metric tons per year and expanding the plants for the associated precursors. Production is
expected to start in the second half of 2015. TDI is an important basic chemical product that is used primarily for soft
polyurethane foams.
The construction of the new MDI plant in Chongqing,
China, and acrylic acid and superabsorbent production
­complex in Camaçari, Brazil, as well as the expansion of our
Verbund site in Nanjing, China, are progressing. With these
major investments, we are expanding our presence in the
growth regions Asia and South America.
In the Oil & Gas segment, we invested primarily in ﬁeld
development projects in Norway, Argentina and Russia in
2014.

Furthermore, on October 31, 2014, we completed the acquisition of a 2.5% share in the Brage production field in the
Norwegian North Sea from Tullow Oil Norge AS, based in
Oslo, Norway. The transaction was concluded with retro­
active financial e
­ ffect as of January 1, 2014. With this acquisition, we ­increased our investment in Brage to a total of 35.2%.
We agreed with our partner Gazprom not to proceed with
the asset swap planned for the end of 2014. The arrangement
had been for Wintershall to give Gazprom its share in the
natural gas trading and storage business as well as a share of
Wintershall Noordzee B.V. Wintershall was to receive shares
in two additional blocks of the Urengoy field in western Siberia
in return. Together with Gazprom, we still intend to continue
the close partnership we have established over many years of
dependable cooperation.

Acquisitions
▪▪ Further expansion of our oil and gas production
and reserves in the North Sea
▪▪ Transaction with Statoil ASA concluded
We gained €1,001 million worth of property, plant and equipment through acquisitions in 2014. Additions to intangible
assets including goodwill amounted to €732 million.
We continued the expansion of our oil and gas production
and our reserves in Norway in 2014. On December 1, 2014,
we concluded the purchase agreed upon with Statoil, based
in Stavanger, Norway, of shares in the Gjøa (5%) and Vega
(24.5%) production fields, the Aasta Hansteen development
project (24%), the Asterix discovery (19%) and the Polarled
Pipeline Project (13.2%), as well as in four exploration licenses
near Aasta Hansteen. Our share in these assets encom­
passes reserves and resources of around 170 million barrels
of oil equivalent (BOE). The acquisition of shares in the Gjøa
and Vega production fields increased our daily production in
­Norway from around 40,000 BOE to roughly 60,000 BOE.
Furthermore, Wintershall is scheduled to take over operatorship of the Vega field at the end of the first quarter of 2015.
The transaction was concluded with retroactive financial effect
as of January 1, 2014. We have additionally agreed with
­Statoil to work together on the future development of the
­exploration potential of the Vøring Basin.

On March 25, 2014, we concluded the sale of selected oil
and gas investments to the Hungarian MOL Group as agreed
upon at the end of 2013; MOL received 14 licenses in the
North Sea. The transaction was financially retroactive to
­January 1, 2013.
The sale of our PolyAd Services business to Edgewater
Capital Partners, L.P., was concluded on June 2, 2014. With
this divestiture, we are gearing our plastic additives business
even more toward the core business areas of light stabilizers,
antioxidants and customer-specific blends.
Effective November 17, 2014, we sold our 50% share in
Styrolution Holding GmbH to the INEOS Group. An option for
INEOS to purchase BASF’s share had already been included
in the partnership agreement of 2011.
On December 31, 2014, we sold to our partner Shell our
50% share in the joint operation Ellba Eastern Private Ltd.,
­Singapore, which produces styrene monomer and propylene
oxide. Because propylene oxide and its value chains remain
important, Shell has contractually agreed to provide BASF

customers reliably and cost effectively. Marketing is partly
carried out via e-commerce.
We create a broad range of customized products,
­particularly in the Performance Products segment – from vitamins, personal care ingredients and color pigments to paper
chemicals and plastic additives. In joint projects, we start
working closely together with customers already at an early
stage in order to develop new products or formulations for a
speciﬁc industry. A worldwide network of development laboratories allows us to quickly adapt our products to local
needs.
We offer functionalized materials and solutions tailored
to customers’ requirements, particularly in the Functional
Materials & Solutions and Agricultural Solutions segments.
These include, for example, engineering plastics, concrete
additives, coatings and crop protection products. We engage
in close partnerships with customers and develop innovations
together that help them optimize their processes and applications. Our understanding of the entire value chain as well as
our global setup and market knowledge are key success
factors here.

Industry orientation
▪▪ Around half of business units geared toward
speciﬁc industries
▪▪ Industry teams pool cross-unit expertise,
knowledge and contacts
▪▪ ­Industry orientation undergoing systematic,
­structured enhancement
We serve customers from many different sectors with our
broad portfolio of diverse competencies, processes, tech­
nologies and products. Around half of our business units are
geared toward speciﬁc industries. By combining expertise
and resources, we position ourselves as a solution-oriented
system provider for our customers.
Yet not all business units can be arranged purely according to industry. That is why BASF has created sector-specific
groups for key customer industries – like the automotive,
pharmaceutical and packaging industries – or for growth
ﬁelds such as wind energy. These “industry teams” pool
expertise, knowledge and contacts across different units,
­
sharpen our understanding of the value chains in customer
industries and work on sector-speciﬁc solutions that often
could not be developed within one operating division alone.
For the wind energy growth market, for example, BASF has
combined the expertise of five divisions into one global industry team. There, we develop intelligent solutions together with
our customers for making the manufacture and operation
of wind turbines more efficient. In addition to matrix systems
for highly durable, fiber-reinforced components, our portfolio
for wind power applications also includes adhesives and
coatings for rotor blades, lubricants and hydraulic liquids
for gearboxes and concrete additives for foundations and
towers.
The close alignment of our business with our customers’
needs is an important component of our “We create chem­
istry” strategy. We will therefore continue the systematic and
structured enhancement of our industry orientation in the
­future.

Our employees are fundamental to achieving the goals of
our “We create chemistry” strategy. We want to attract
­talented people, retain them in the company, and support
them in their development. To do so, we cultivate a working
environment that inspires and connects people. It is f­ ounded
on inclusive leadership based on mutual trust, respect and
dedication to top performance.

Strategy
▪▪ Best Team Strategy focuses on excellent people,
workplace and leaders
Our Best Team Strategy is derived from our corporate strategy
and simultaneously contributes to the achievement of its goals.
We want to form the best team. To achieve this, we focus on
three strategic directions: excellent people, excellent place to
work and excellent leaders. Emphasis here is placed on our
attrac­tiveness in worldwide labor markets, career development
and life-long learning in all regions, and supporting and
­developing our leaders, all while aiming to respect internationally recognized labor and social standards worldwide. Our
­actions are dictated by internal corporate guidelines.

Number of employees
At the end of 2014, BASF had 113,292 employees (2013:
112,206); of these, 3,186 were apprentices (2013: 3,060). We

Competition for talent

Vocational training

▪▪ New career website
▪▪ Expansion of recruiting and training
measures in Asia Pacific

▪▪ 3,186 apprentices in around 60 occupations
worldwide
▪▪ €101 million used for vocational training

In the worldwide competition for the best employees and
­leaders, we want to recruit qualiﬁed talent in order to achieve
our ambitious growth targets. To even further enhance BASF’s
status as an attractive employer, we specified the ­values that
we as an employer want to stand for: Connecting, Engaging,
Learning and Caring. At the end of 2014, we redesigned our
career website and tailored it to the needs of our target groups.
This involved, for example, improved worldwide job search
functions as well as interactive elements like live chats, where
applicants can connect with BASF employees for insight into
our working environment.
We also want to strengthen our employees’ identification
with the company. In North America, for example, we started
the Recognizing You program in 2014, which spotlights exceptional employee performance and activities.
One of our recruiting focus areas is in the Asia Pacific
­region. We scout out researchers from around the world to
meet the increasing staff requirements for our Innovation Campus Asia Pacific research site in Shanghai, China. Furthermore,
we are establishing the Roots – Laboratory training program in
China. This one-year dual program with both theoretical and
practical elements prepares employees for work at an Innovation Campus laboratory.
For its activities in helping graduates and entry-level
employ­ees get started on their careers, BASF was once again
selected by engineering students as one of the 50 most
­attractive employers in the world in a 2014 study conducted by
Universum. Furthermore, BASF Corporation in the United
States received the Talent Board’s Candidate Experience
Award for the second time in a row for our excellent performance in the management of external candidates.
Worldwide, the percentage of employees who left the company voluntarily during their ﬁrst three years of employment
was 1.3% on average. This turnover rate was 0.5% in Europe,
1.8% in North America, 3.9% in Asia Pacific and 1.4% in South
America, Africa, Middle East.

As of December 31, 2014, BASF was training 3,186 people in
around 60 occupations in 16 countries worldwide. We spent a
total of €101 million on vocational training in 2014, as well as
around €15 million on the BASF Training Verbund as part of our
social commitment in the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region.
In 2014, 908 apprentices started their vocational training
at BASF SE and German Group companies. An additional
263 young people participated in the BASF Training Verbund’s
career-start programs Start in den Beruf and Anlauf zur Aus­
bildung in cooperation with partner companies. The goal of
these programs is to prepare participants for a subsequent
appren­
ticeship within one year. Their approach comprises
theoretical as well as practical program ele­
ments. Examples
include guidance in choosing a profession and gaining work
experience in the BASF Training Verbund’s partner companies.
In this way, the programs contribute to ensuring a long-term
supply of quali­ﬁed employees for BASF and the Rhine-Neckar
Metropolitan Region.
As in the previous year, 20 Spanish apprentices began their
vocational training in Tarragona, Spain, in 2014, based on the
German vocational training model. The theoretical and practical
phases take place in Tarragona and in Ludwigshafen. We see
this as a way to expand our recruiting base and plan, upon
successful completion of their training, to employ the appren­
tices in areas like production at the Ludwigshafen site.

Learning and development
▪▪ Life-long learning concept
▪▪ Specific further training for employees
in production and technical areas
▪▪ Learning Campus offers multifaceted possibilities
and promotes learning in worldwide networks
Our employees’ individual development is important to us.
We follow a life-long learning approach that emphasizes the
significance of learning from experience, supplemented by
the concepts of learning from others and learning through
courses and media. By combining learning in the workplace
with programs for development, we address the varying
require­ments of a rapidly changing market.
In regular development meetings, our employees and
leaders outline prospects for individual professional develop­
ment together and determine measures for further training
and develop­ment. This approach was carried out for around
45,000 employees by the end of 2014. Our goal is to introduce these development meetings for all BASF employees by
2017. They supplement the annual employee dialogs that are
conducted in all BASF Group companies worldwide, which
include an employee performance assessment component.
We spent around €101 million on further training in
2014 (2013: €106 million). Our measures for further training
are based on the learning needs of our employees. Local
and ­international seminars and workshops enable the acquisition and exchange of knowledge and promote networking.
Each employee spent an average of 2.6 days on further training in 2014. More than 107,000 seminar days took place at
BASF SE, including at the Learning Center, in 2014.
Internal specialists provide our employees with career
counseling. In addition, we provide targeted guidance for
employees engaged in part-time Bachelor’s or Master’s
studies and advise them on various career development
oppor­tunities. We support the large number of employees in
production and technical areas worldwide with career-specific
further training and vocational guidance. We have strengthened our in-plant qualiﬁcation measures with shift trainers
who promote the continual professional development of
employ­ees in production and technology through individual
learning assignments. Furthermore, we have established
programs on safety culture, knowledge management and
team development.

Management’s Report
Working at BASF﻿

Our global Learning Campus is the central platform for the
life-long learning programs we offer. It allows employ­ees to
find relevant learning opportunities on both a local and global
level. The offers entail learning in the workplace as well as
self-directed learning through electronic media. Networking
and learning from others is also promoted. We opened a
training center in Singapore in 2014 as part of the Learning
Campus.
The concept additionally includes the Welcome to BASF
program for new employees around the world, as well as the
seminar Campus: Dialog with the Divisions, in which around
1,400 employees take part each year. We are also enhancing
our mentoring approach to promote long-term partnerships
and mutual learning.

Managing demographic changes
In order to address the ramifications of demographic change,
we create a suitable framework to help maintain the employability of our personnel at all stages of life and ensure the
availability of qualiﬁed employees. We support our employees
and leaders with workshops, health and exercise programs,
age-­
appropriate workplace optimization and demographic
analyses. For example, the topic “leadership in times of
demo­
graphic change” has been a part of our basic skill
enhance­ment for new leaders since 2013. We are additionally
working on measures to safeguard and pass on knowledge.

Inclusion of diversity
▪▪ BASF Corporation honored in United States
▪▪ Portion of (senior) executive positions with
disciplinary responsibilities held by women
at 19.1% worldwide
In order to address the various needs of our customers and
markets, we rely on the best team in all areas and functions
around the globe. The inclusion of diversity is an important
component of our strategic talent management. It helps us to
continuously improve our team’s performance and power of
innovation, and increases creativity, motivation and identiﬁcation with the company. This is why we are developing measures
to further promote the appreciation and inclusion of diversity.
Leaders play an important role here. We support them in
embrac­ing diversity and integrating it into day-to-day business.
For example, speciﬁc goals and measures are developed
together with leaders, such as those for recognizing and
­
developing different kinds of talent. Employees around the
world are active as ambassadors of diversity within the
company, contributing signiﬁcantly to an open and appreciative
company culture. For its particular commitment to social diversity, BASF Corporation in the United States received the 2014
award for Top 50 Company for Diversity from the organization
DiversityInc for the second time in a row.
In the BASF Group, the worldwide percentage of (senior)
executive positions with disciplinary leadership responsibilities
held by women was 19.1% at the end of 2014 (2013: 18.5%).
In a joint initiative with all 30 DAX-listed companies, BASF
signed a voluntary commitment in 2011: In Germany, we aim to
raise the percentage of women in these positions from 9.8%
(baseline 2010) to 15% by the end of 2020. At the end of 2014,
this figure was 14.5% in Germany.
Continuing internationalization prompted us to raise our
goal in 2012 for the proportion of senior executives¹ with international experience to over 80%. In 2014, 83% of our senior
executives had international experience and 34.3% were not
German citizens.
For more information, see basf.com/diversity

Work-life balance
▪▪ Worldwide offers help combine career, family and
personal life
To promote a good working environment, we provide – and
continue to develop – a wide range of programs worldwide
that help employees better combine their careers with family
and personal life. This increases our employees’ identification
with the company and bolsters our position as an attractive
employer in the competition for qualified personnel. We offer,
for example, diverse working models: such as ﬂexible working

hours, part-time employment and mobile working. In 2014, a
total of 11.3% of BASF SE employees held part-time positions,
68.5% of which were women. Numerous BASF SE employees
also made use of parental leave, including more and more men.

­ udwigshafen
and Münster sites can accommodate a total of 475 children.
We also provide employee assistance opportunities in North
America. Furthermore, employees at the Florham Park, New
Jersey, site can exercise in modern fitness centers and visit the
physical therapy facilities.

What we expect from our leaders
▪▪ As role models, leaders should demonstrate values
and standards of conduct to particularly high degree
Our leaders serve as role models in implementing our ­strategy
in their day-to-day business. Our leadership culture is based on
BASF’s strategic principles and values as well as on the standards of behavior set out by our globally uniform Code of
Conduct. In their capacity as role models, leaders are expected
to demonstrate these standards to a particularly high degree.
The global competency model introduced in 2013 a
­ pplies for
all employees. It forms the foundation of our e
­ mployee and
leadership development.
All new leaders at BASF take part in the New Leader
­Program, a modular development program focusing on the
enhancement of fundamental leadership skills, self-reflection
and networking. We support experienced leaders with indi­
vidual offers for honing their competencies. They furthermore
serve as internal trainers or observers in our development
measures to promote the development of others. We offer
multifaceted global, regional and local programs to increase
connectivity and exchange.

The term “senior executives” refers to leadership levels 1 to 4, whereas level 1 denotes the Board of Executive Directors. In addition, individual employees can attain senior executive
status by virtue of special expertise.

Global Employee Survey
The Global Employee Survey and its follow-up process have
been established for the entire BASF Group ever since the ﬁrst
global survey in 2008. We conducted the second Global
­Employee Survey in 2012. The results were presented to the
Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board.
Employ­ees and leaders then discussed the results together,
and developed and implemented measures for improvement in
all regions. Example topics included supporting employ­ees in
their career development, work-life balance, and dealing with
change. We conduct this survey on a regular basis. The next
Global Employee Survey is planned for 2015.

Compensation and benefits
▪▪ Compensation based on employee’s position
and individual performance as well as company’s
success
▪▪ Pay generally comprises fixed and variable
components plus benefits
In addition to market-oriented compensation, BASF’s total offer
also comprises beneﬁts, individual opportunities for development and a good working environment. Our employees’ pay is
based on global compensation principles. These take into
­account an employee’s position and individual performance as
well as BASF’s success as a company. We are currently working
on a global framework for these compensation principles as well
as an overview of the company’s total offer for our employees
(“you@BASF”). Analyses of the Ludwigshafen site have shown
that, for contracts e
­ xempt from collective agreements, there are
no systematic differences in pay between men and women,
provided the positions and qualiﬁcations are comparable.
As a rule, compensation is comprised of fixed and variable
components as well as benefits that often exceed legal requirements. In many countries, these include company pension
beneﬁts, supplementary health insurance, and share programs.
In 2014, the BASF Group spent €9,224 million on wages and
salaries, social security contributions and expenses for pensions
and assistance (2013: €9,285 million), representing a 0.7%
­decrease in personnel expen­ses.

Thereof for pension benefits
Total personnel expenses

Employees participate in company’s success
▪▪ Annual bonus for 2014 to once again reach high level
▪▪ BASF share program “plus” fosters employees’ longterm participation in company
Our employees par­tici­pate in the company’s success through
variable pay components and are rewarded for their indi­vidual
performance. The same principles basically apply for all employees. The amount of the variable component is deter­mined by the
success of the company – measured by the return on assets of
the BASF Group – and the employee’s individual performance.
Individual performance is assessed using a globally consistent
performance management approach. The annual bonus for
2014 will once again reach a high level.
In numerous Group companies, employees are offered the
chance to purchase shares. The BASF share program “plus”
sponsors the long-term participation of our employees in the
company through incentive shares: By investing a part of their
compensation in BASF shares, they take part in the long-term
development of BASF.
Since 1999, BASF has offered its senior executives the
oppor­tunity to participate in a share-price-based compensation
program. This long-term incentive (LTI) program ties a portion of
their compensation to the long-term performance of BASF
shares. In 2014, 94% of the approximately 1,200 senior executives eligible worldwide participated in the LTI program, investing
up to 30% of their variable compensation in BASF shares.

Dialog with employee representatives
Open dialog with employee representatives is an important
component of our company’s actions. If restructuring leads to
staff downsizing, we work with employee representatives to
develop socially responsible implementation measures. This
­
is done in accordance with the respective legal regulations and
the agreements reached. For cross-border matters, the BASF
­Europa Betriebsrat (European Works Council) has been responsible for employees in Europe since 2008. Our German ­employee
representatives and leaders met in the “Wittenberg Dialogs”
once again in 2014 to discuss the Code of Responsible Conduct
for Business in the Social Market Economy.

Global labor and social standards
▪▪ National law and ILO core labor standards as minimum
requirement
▪▪ Adherence to voluntary commitments evaluated using
three-pronged monitoring system
Compliance with national law and the core labor standards of
the International Labor Organization (ILO) forms the basis of
our actions. Moreover, we aim to harmonize our working conditions worldwide with our voluntary commitments, the relevant
ILO conventions, and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational
Enterprises, as well as with local requirements like industry
standards. In countries where national laws, rules and customs
deviate from international standards, we are challenged with
ﬁnding appropriate solutions by engaging in dialog with the

relevant stakeholders. We evaluate our adherence to our voluntary commitments ­using a three-pronged monitoring system
introduced throughout the BASF Group. It consists of the
following instruments:
––External compliance hotlines
––Annual survey of our Group companies
––Close dialog with our stakeholders, such as with employee
representatives and international organizations
In 2014, our external compliance hotlines received 127 calls
relating to human rights, 116 of which pertained to labor and
social standards. Misconduct was identiﬁed in 21 cases.
Countermeasures were taken in all of these cases. The ­results
of the annual survey conducted at our Group companies reﬂect
the working conditions of 100% of our employees in 2014. If
the findings indicate that our voluntary commitments are not
being sufficiently implemented, we investigate this information
and introduce remedial measures. In order to better evaluate
worldwide compliance with international labor and social standards, we conduct regional risk analyses for our businesses
every year, including in 2014. We are constantly enhancing and
refining our risk management.

The global economy grew only moderately in 2014. After
a positive start to the year, the economy in the European
Union grew faster than in 2013; however, it temporarily
lost momentum over the course of the year. The U.S.
economy was able to quickly recover after a weather-­
related slump at the beginning of the year, slightly
outpacing the previous year’s growth rate. The Japanese
economy was dampened by a sales tax increase. In
China, growth d
­ eclined slightly but remained at a high
level. At 2.5%, global gross domestic product increased
at about the same rate overall as in 2013 (+2.4%1), which
was less than we had originally forecast for 2014 (+2.8%).
The ­average crude oil price for Brent blend fell to $99 per
barrel (2013: $109 per barrel).

Trends in the global economy in 2014

Economic trends by region

The year 2014 was characterized by weak economic development. While the construction industry in western Europe
benefited from a warm winter, economic activity in the United
States was hampered by u
­ nusually cold weather at the beginning of the year. The e
­ conomy in China also got off to a slow
start in 2014 before the government’s economic support
measures temporarily accelerated growth somewhat. The
conflict in Ukraine intensified over the course of the year.
Aside from the negative effects of mutually imposed sanctions
on trade with Russia, uncertainty with regard to the further
­development of the crisis contributed heavily to dampening
expectations for the European economy and led to a reduced
appetite for investment.

▪▪ Economic development in E.U. slack and uneven
▪▪ U.S. economy grows faster than in 2013
▪▪ Growth in Japan and South America considerably
weaker than in previous year

1

Economic development in the European Union was slack
and uneven. At an overall rate of 1.4%, gross domestic product nevertheless grew faster than in the previous year (2013:
+0.1%). While the United Kingdom enjoyed robust growth,
Spain and Germany were the only larger eurozone countries
to show positive development. Italy remained in recession
and the French economy stagnated. By comparison, the
eastern E.U. countries observed solid growth rates. Particularly in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, growth was
substantially higher than in 2013. In Germany, business
expec­tations turned considerably gloomy after the first quarter. Economic performance even dipped slightly in the second
quarter, espe­cially as ­construction spending declined while
private consumption grew only weakly. Growth accelerated
somewhat over the rest of the year, and Germany’s gross
domestic product grew as a result by an average of 1.6% for
the year (2013: +0.2%).
In the United States, average growth for the year
was somewhat higher than in 2013. In the first quarter of
2014, cold weather and cyclical inventory effects led to a
significant decline in gross domestic product. Over the rest of
the year, the economy grew by around 4% on average, with

Figures that refer to previous years could deviate from last year’s report due to statistical revisions.

BASF Report 2014 

momentum coming from investment activity and private
consumption. Against this background, the u
­ pward trend in
the labor market continued unabated; the unemployment rate
dropped below 6% in the fall.
In the emerging markets of Asia, growth receded ­slightly
in 2014. A major reason for this lay in the slowing eco­nomic
dynamic in China (2014: +7.7%; 2013: +7.4%). The positive
influence of the Chinese government’s stimulus measures
following the unusually weak first quarter had less of an
­impact than in the past. Lower housing prices and the downturn in construction activity had further negative effects.
Compared with the previous year’s averages, currencies in
many of Asia’s emerging markets – such as India, Indonesia
and Thailand – lost considerable value relative to the dollar.
In Japan, the economy in the first quarter of 2014 was
marked by massive advance purchases in private consumption. Following a sales tax increase in the second quarter,
gross domestic product fell temporarily and did not stabilize
again until the end of the second half. Seen on average over
the year, the Japanese economy stagnated. The end of deflation brought about by an expansive monetary policy initially
had a negative impact on the real economy: Real income fell,
as salaries did not keep pace with the increase in consumer
prices.
Gross domestic product in South America grew at a
significantly slower rate than in the previous year. The economic situation in Brazil deteriorated dramatically compared
with 2013. Consumer confidence dropped considerably over
the course of the year. Investors, too, adopted a restrained
­approach before the presidential election in the fall of 2014.
After record growth in the previous year, the agricultural ­sector
was only able to make a small contribution to growth. The
Argentinian economy shrank by around 2%. Growth was
hampered by the sharp depreciation of the local currency and
high inflation, in addition to uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the negotiations with international creditors and the
lack of access to capital markets.

Management’s Report
The BASF Group business year — Economic environment﻿

Most key customer sectors of the chemical industry grew at a
similar rate as in 2013. Development in the transportation and
construction industries was markedly different from r­egion to
region. While automobile production in the European Union
once again grew considerably, the automotive industry’s
­robust growth slackened in Asia and the United States. The
construction industry in the European Union was able­­
to boast slight gains for the first time since 2007. By contrast,
growth was in part considerably weaker for the construction
industry in the United States, Japan, China and South
­America.
Agriculture grew markedly slower than in 2013. In North
and South America, growth was more modest compared with
the previous year’s rates, which were in part very high. Growth
in ­agri­cultural production declined in eastern Europe.

Europe was able to see slight gains after declines in the previous two years. By contrast, the emerging markets showed
somewhat slower industrial growth (2014: +4.3%, 2013:
+4.8%), primarily reflecting the deceleration of growth in

Important raw material price developments

▪▪ Growth somewhat weaker than in 2013

▪▪ Prices drop for crude oil and naphtha
▪▪ Gas prices rise in United States and fall in Europe;
prices remain significantly lower in U.S. than Europe

The chemical industry (excluding pharmaceuticals) grew at
4%, in keeping with the dampened dynamic of its key customer industries and somewhat more slowly than in the previous year (+4.5%). Our original forecast of +4.4% had been
slightly higher.
After stagnating in 2013, production in the European
Union increased only slightly overall. The United Kingdom,
France and the eastern E.U. countries provided growth impetus. Chemical production in Germany declined, however,
­primarily as a result of decreases in the production of basic
chemicals. Growth in the United States was as high as in the
previous year; at 2.7%, it was considerably higher than in
Europe. In Japan, the economic downturn led to a slight
decline in chemical production. The chemical industry’s
­
growth rate in China, the largest chemical market in the world,
continued at a high level. Growth was nevertheless around
one percentage point slower than in the previous year due to
the weak overall economy.

At an average of around $99 per barrel in 2014, the price of
Brent blend crude oil was below the previous year’s level
($109 per barrel). The oil price ﬂuctuated over the course of
the year between $112 per barrel in June and $62 per barrel
in December.
Average monthly prices for the chemical raw material
naphtha ranged over the course of 2014 between $953 per
metric ton in June and $492 per metric ton in December. At
$837 per metric ton, the annualized average price of naphtha
in 2014 was below the level of 2013 ($902 per metric ton).
The average price of gas in the United States was $4.37
per mmBtu, once again significantly above the level of the
previous year ($3.73 per mmBtu). In Europe, the average
price for gas imports remained substantially higher, at $10.1
per mmBtu. Yet the difference between U.S. and European
reference prices shrank considerably, from $8.1 per mmBtu in
2013 to $5.7 per mmBtu in 2014. In China, the price for gas
was around $10 per mmBtu on national average. The price of
gas was between $11 and $14 per mmBtu in the coastal
­regions. Compared with the previous year, this represents an
increase of between 15 and 20%.

The BASF Group business year — Results of operations﻿

Results of operations

The market environment was volatile and challenging in
2014. Growth rates for the global economy, industrial
production and the chemical industry all lagged behind
our expectations, largely influenced by growing geopolitical tensions and the uncertainty triggered by them.
­Despite these conditions, our b
­ usiness developed successfully overall.

Factors influencing sales

Sales and income from operations before
­special items

Factors influencing sales BASF Group

▪▪ At €74,326 million, sales match level of 2013
▪▪ Income from operations before special items
rises by 4% to €7,357 million
At €74,326 million, sales in 2014 matched the level of the
previous year. In the chemicals business1, sales rose as a
­result of higher sales volumes. Increased volumes in the gas
trading business and slight sales growth in the Agricultural
Solutions segment likewise supported sales development.
Sales declined considerably in Other.
Income from operations before special items grew by
around 4% to €7,357 million. This was primarily the result of a
larger contribution from the chemicals business. Earnings
declined in the Agricultural Solutions and Oil & Gas segments.

We raised sales volumes in all segments in 2014. Prices were
reduced overall, largely on account of significant decreases in
oil and gas prices. Negative currency effects dampened sales
in almost all divisions. Portfolio ­effects did not have an appreciable impact on BASF Group sales.

Sales and income from operations before
­special items in the segments
Sales in the Chemicals segment in 2014 matched the level of
the previous year. Falling prices in all divisions were offset by
higher sales volumes, especially in the Petrochemicals division. Income from operations before special items surpassed
2013 levels by 8%, supported by substantially larger contributions from the Petrochemicals and Intermediates divisions.
The Monomers division, however, posted a considerable,
margin-related decline in earnings.
In the Performance Products segment, sales were down
by 1%. Despite an increasingly gloomy market environment
over the course of the year, we were able to increase sales
volumes with stable prices and thus almost fully compensate
for negative currency effects. Income from operations before
special items improved by 7% year-on-year. This was mainly
because of the reduction in fixed costs brought about by
restruc­turing measures and other factors.
In the Functional Materials & Solutions segment, significantly higher sales volumes – especially of products for the
automotive industry – led to a 3% increase in sales, which
was curbed by negative currency effects. Prices were stable
overall. We raised income from operations before special
items by 12% through considerable increases in the Catalysts
and Coatings divisions.

Our chemicals business comprises the Chemicals, Performance Products and Functional Materials & Solutions segments.

BASF Report 2014 

Sales in the Agricultural Solutions segment exceeded the
level of 2013 by 4% despite negative currency effects. This
was largely due to robust business in Europe and North
America as well as greater demand for fungicides and herbicides. Yet the drop in prices for agricultural products that
­resulted from the previous year’s successful harvests put a
considerable strain on our business. Negative currency
­effects, margin declines due to a less favorable product mix,
and higher expenditures for research and development as
well as for production and distribution all led to a decrease of
9% in income from operations before special items.
Sales in the Oil & Gas segment grew by 2% in 2014,
mainly through higher volumes in the natural gas trading
business. Sharply falling oil and gas prices weakened sales
growth. In the Exploration & Production business sector, the
activities in Norway acquired from Statoil led to positive portfolio effects. Income from operations before special items
declined by 3% as a result of slightly smaller contributions
from both business sectors.
Sales in Other decreased by 14%. This was predomi­
nantly because of lower plant availability after a plant outage
at the Ellba C.V. joint operation in Moerdijk, Netherlands.
­Income from operations before special items improved by
8%. The reversal of provisions for the long-term incentive (LTI)
program and an improvement in foreign currency results not
assigned to the segments were partly offset by lower earnings
contributions from other businesses.
For more on business reviews by segment, see page 60 onward

Management’s Report
The BASF Group business year — Results of operations﻿

Income from operations and special items
▪▪ Income from operations rises slightly
▪▪ High premium once again earned on cost of capital
At €7,626 million, income from operations for the BASF Group
in 2014 was up from the previous year’s level (€7,160 million).
This includes earnings from companies accounted for
using the equity method.
Special items in 2014 resulted in an earnings contribution
of €269 million (2013: €83 million).
Of this, €712 million pertained to divestitures, especially
the sale of our 50% share in Styrolution Holding GmbH. Also
contributing to the total were the divestiture of oil and gas
fields on the British continental shelf to the MOL Group, as
well as the sale of our 50% share in Ellba Eastern Private Ltd.
and of the PolyAd Services business. In 2013, divestitures
had led to an earnings contribution of €591 million.
Compared with the previous year, special charges from
various restructuring measures declined by €189 million to
€68 million and expenses for the integration of acquired
­businesses by €80 million to €6 million.
Miscellaneous special charges increased by €204 million
in 2014 to €369 million. These predominantly included asset
impairments in the Oil & Gas, Chemicals and Functional
Mate­
rials & Solutions segments. In 2013, other special
charges of €165 million had especially pertained to impairment charges in the Chemicals and Oil & Gas segments.
We once again earned a high premium on our cost of
capital in 2014. EBIT after cost of capital amounted to
€1,368 million after €1,768 million in the previous year. Cost
of capital rose mainly as a result of the increased amount of
fixed assets and higher inventories.

improves by 8%
▪▪ Earnings per share increase by €0.39 to €5.61

▪▪ Adjusted earnings per share improve by €0.13

The ﬁnancial result improved in 2014 to minus €423 million,
compared with minus €560 million in the previous year.
Compared with 2013, net income from shareholdings
rose by €274 million to €278 million, mostly due to special
income from the disposal of our shares in VNG – Verbundnetz
Gas AG.
The interest result improved by €24 million to minus
€504 million. This was largely attributable to positive con­
tributions from interest rate and currency swaps for variable
interest rates on financial indebtedness.
Other financial result declined by €161 million to minus
€197 million. This was mainly due to effects from the market
valuation of options for the disposal of the share in ­Styrolution:
Miscellaneous financial expenses amounted to €42 million in
2014, compared with miscel­
laneous financial income of
€119 million in 2013.
At €7,203 million, income before taxes and minority interests was up by €603 million. Return on assets amounted to
11.7%, compared with 11.5% in the previous year.
Income taxes rose by €224 million to €1,711 million. The
tax rate grew from 22.5% to 23.8%, predominantly as a result
of earnings increases in countries with high tax rates, particularly Norway. These were partly offset by higher, largely taxfree income compared with the previous year that was related
to the disposal of investments – mainly the 50% share in
Styrolution Holding GmbH.
Income before minority interests rose by €379 million to
€5,492 million. Minority interests increased from €321 million
to €337 million.
Net income amounted to €5,155 million, exceeding the
previous year’s level of €4,792 million. Earnings per share
rose from €5.22 to €5.61.

For sales, “slight” represents a change of 1–5%, while “considerable” applies for changes of 6% and higher. “At prior-year level” indicates no change (+/–0%).
For earnings, “slight” means a change of 1–10%, while “considerable” is used for changes of 11% and higher. “At prior-year level” indicates no change (+/–0%).

Actual development compared with outlook
for 2014
For 2014, we had predicted a slight decline in sales due to the
planned divestiture of our gas trading and storage business
as well as a considerable boost in EBIT and EBIT after cost of
capital as a result of the special income expected from the
divestiture. The swap did not take place. Sales therefore
matched the ­previous year’s level; the considerable increase
in EBIT after cost of capital could not be achieved. We were
able to slightly raise income from ­operations, due in part to
special income from the ­divestiture of the share in Styrolution
Holding GmbH, reported in Other. Income from opera­tions
before special items rose slightly, as anticipated.
With sales at 2013 levels, we just missed the slight sales
increase foreseen for the Chemicals segment. Sales volumes
rose, as we had intended; yet declining prices and negative
currency effects counterbalanced this volumes growth.
Thanks to considerably higher contributions from the Petrochemicals and Intermediates divisions, the segment’s income
from operations before special items grew slightly, performing
better than expected. Startup costs for plants that began
operations were lower than we had assumed.
We were unable to achieve the slight rise in sales anticipated in the Performance Products segment; despite stronger
volumes, negative currency effects resulted in a slight decline.
Increasing by 7%, income from operations before special
items barely missed the considerable growth we had tar­
geted. Especially in the Care Chemicals division’s hygiene
business, earnings remained below expectations. This was
further weighed down by ongoing, competition-related pressure on Vitamin E prices as well as the weaker development
of our paper chemicals business.

1

Our expectations for the Functional Materials & Solutions
segment matched actual development in 2014.
Sales in the Agricultural Solutions segment grew slightly,
which was somewhat less than we had predicted. Prices for
agricultural products dropped more sharply over the course
of the year than expected. Negative currency effects had
more of an impact than presumed, especially in the first half of
the year. In this challenging market environment, income from
operations before special items declined slightly, against our
expectations.
For the Oil & Gas segment, we had anticipated a considerable sales decrease due to the asset swap with Gazprom.
Because the swap was not carried out, sales slightly ­exceeded
the previous year’s level. Especially because of unexpectedly
sharp declines in oil and gas prices, we did not meet our aim
of slightly increasing income from operations before special
items; earnings declined slightly.
We achieved our sales forecast for Other. Income from
operations before special items improved slightly in Other,
against our expectations, as provisions were reversed for the
LTI program.
In 2014, we invested a total of €5.1 billion in property,
plant and equipment1, thereby surpassing the anticipated
amount of around €4.4 billion. The investment increase was
partly because of additions to property, plant and equipment
due to the dissolution of the gas trading business disposal
group as well as currency effects.

Assets
▪▪ Total assets exceed previous year’s level
by €7,155 million
▪▪ Noncurrent assets rise mainly as a result of
­investments and acquisitions
Total assets amounted to €71,359 million, exceeding the level
of 2013 by €7,155 million. Both noncurrent and current a
­ ssets
contributed to this development.
Noncurrent assets grew by €5,686 million to €43,939 million. The €643 million increase in intangible assets was particularly attributable to an acquisition-related rise in goodwill.
Investments and currency effects also contributed to the
­increase, while amortization partly counterbalanced it.
The value of property, plant and equipment grew by
€4,267 million to €23,496 million, especially as a result of
invest­ments and acquisitions. At €6,369, additions considerably exceeded depreciation of €2,770 million and were
primarily related to investments (€5,368 million). Significant
investments concerned the construction of a TDI plant in
Ludwigshafen, ­Germany, an MDI plant in Chongqing, China,
and an acrylic acid and superabsorbent production complex
in Camaçari, Brazil. They also included field development
projects in ­Norway, Argentina and Russia. Currency effects
additionally increased the value of property, plant and equipment. Disposals were largely attributable to the sale of selec­
ted oil and gas investments in the North Sea to the Hungarian
MOL Group and of the 50% share in Ellba Eastern Private Ltd.

The €929 million decline in investments accounted for using
the equity method to €3,245 million resulted predominantly
from the disposal of the 50% share in Styrolution Holding
GmbH.
The value of other financial assets declined by €103 million to €540 million, mainly because of the disposal of our
15.79% share in VNG – Verbundnetz Gas AG and of the 15%
share in South Stream Transport B.V.
Deferred tax assets rose by €1,187 million primarily on
account of higher actuarial losses for defined pension plans.
Other noncurrent receivables and miscellaneous noncurrent assets grew year-on-year by €621 million to
€1,498 million. This was mostly due to WIGA Transport
Beteiligungs-GmbH & Co.’s higher loan receivables from NEL
Gastransport GmbH and GASCADE Gastransport GmbH.
Current assets rose by €1,469 million to €27,420 million,
mostly as a result of higher inventories. This increase was due
in part to greater gas ­storage inventory in the Oil & Gas segment as a result of warm weather in Europe, preparations for
new plant startups, scheduled plant turnarounds and foreign
currency effects.
At €1,718 million, cash and cash equivalents were­
€109 million below the level of December 31, 2013.

Equity and liabilities
▪▪ Solid equity ratio of 39.5%
▪▪ Liabilities rise mainly because of higher provisions
for pensions and similar obligations
▪▪ Net debt increases slightly
Equity grew by €522 million to €28,195 million compared with
the previous year. Retained earnings rose by €2,675 million to
€28,777 million. Other comprehensive income decreased by
€2,082 million to minus €5,482 million, largely influenced by
the remeasurement of defined benefit plans, at minus
€2,396 million. The equity ratio amounted to 39.5% (2013:
43.1%).
Compared with the end of 2013, noncurrent liabilities rose
by €5,079 million to €27,271 million. This was largely attributable to the €3,586 million increase in provisions for pensions
and similar obligations, which was brought about by lower
discount rates.
Long-term ﬁnancial indebtedness grew by €688 million to
€11,839 million. Of this, €610 million comprised higher liabilities to credit institutions and €78 million were bonds. In 2014,
we issued bonds with a nominal value of €1.8 billion and
£250 million with maturities between three and ten years as
part of our debt issuance program. Two bonds due in 2015,
one for €2 billion and one for CHF 200 million, were reclassified to short-term financial indebtedness.

Deferred tax liabilities rose by €526 million, mostly due to the
acquisition of shares in Norwegian oil and gas fields.
Current liabilities grew by €1,554 million to €15,893 million. This was mainly because of the €1,272 million increase in
other liabilities, which was primarily attributable to the rise in
negative fair values of derivatives in connection with hedging
transactions resulting from oil price and U.S. dollar developments relative to the euro. In addition, short-term financial
indebt­
edness increased by €289 million, short-term provisions by €174 million, and tax liabilities by €111 million. Trade
accounts payable fell by €292 million.
Long-term ﬁnancial indebtedness increased overall by
€977 million to €15,384 million. Net debt grew by €1,086 million to €13,666 million.

Financing policy and credit ratings
▪▪ Financing principles remain unchanged
▪▪ “A” ratings conﬁrmed
Our ﬁnancing policy is aimed at ensuring our solvency at all
times, limiting the risks associated with ﬁnancing and optimizing our cost of capital. We preferably meet our external
ﬁnancing needs on international capital markets.
We strive to maintain at least a solid A rating, which allows
us unrestricted access to money and capital markets. Our
ﬁnancing measures are aligned with our operative business
planning as well as the company’s strategic direction and also
ensure the ﬁnancial ﬂexibility to take advantage of strategic
options.

With “A+/A-1/outlook stable” from rating agency Standard &
Poor’s and “A1/P-1/outlook stable” from Moody’s, we have
good credit ratings, especially compared with competitors in
the chemical industry. Standard & Poor’s last conﬁrmed our
long-term rating on December 11, 2014; Moody’s last
conﬁrmed our long-term rating on October 31, 2014, and
pronounced the outlook stable. Both agencies maintained
BASF’s short-term ratings.
Corporate bonds form the basis of our medium to longterm debt ﬁnancing. These are issued in euros and other
currencies with different maturities as part of our €20 billion
debt issuance program. Our goal is to create a balanced
maturity proﬁle, attain a diverse range of investors, and optimize our debt capital ﬁnancing conditions.

BASF Report 2014

For short-term ﬁnancing, we use BASF SE’s commercial
paper program, which has an issuing volume of up to
­
$12.5 billion. On December 31, 2014, $150 million worth of
commercial paper was outstanding under this program.
­Firmly committed, syndicated credit lines of €6 billion serve to
cover the repayment of outstanding commercial ­paper, and
can also be used for general company purposes.
These credit lines were not used at any point in 2014. Our
external ﬁnancing is therefore largely independent of shortterm ﬂuctuations in the credit markets.

Off-balance-sheet ﬁnancing tools, such as leasing, are of
­minor importance to us. BASF Group’s most important ﬁnancial contracts contain no side agreements with regard to
speciﬁc ﬁnancial ratios (ﬁnancial covenants) or compliance
with a speciﬁc rating (rating trigger).
For more on the ﬁnancing tools used, see the Notes to the
­Consolidated Financial Statements from page 210 onward

If possible, we bundle the ﬁnancing, ﬁnancial investments and
foreign currency hedging of BASF SE’s subsidiaries within the
BASF Group in order to minimize risks and exploit internal
optimization potential. ­
Foreign currency risks are primarily
hedged centrally by means of derivative ﬁnancial instruments
in the market.
Our interest risk management generally pursues the goal
of reducing interest expenses for the Group and minimizing
interest risks. Interest rate hedging transactions are therefore
conducted with banks in order to turn selected liabilities to the
capital markets from fixed interest to variable rate or vice
versa.

BASF Report 2014 

Statement of cash flows
▪▪ Cash provided by operating activities remains at
high level
▪▪ Cash used in investing activities improves
At €6,958 million, cash provided by operating activities in
2014 was €1,142 million below the level of the previous year.
This was largely attributable to an increase in the amount of
capital tied down in net working capital as a result of greater
inventories and other operating receivables. Miscellaneous
items primarily include the reclassi­fication of the gain on the
disposal of our 50% share in Styrolution GmbH to cash used
in investing activities.
Cash used in investing activities amounted to minus
€4,496 million in 2014 compared with minus €5,994 million in
the previous year. This was mostly the result of the positive
balance of payments received from divestitures (€1,336 million) and p
­ ayments made for acquisitions (€963 million) in
2014. In the p
­ revious year, payments made for acquisitions
(€1,156 million) had considerably exceeded payments
­received from divestitures (€63 million). Payments for prop­
erty, plant and equipment and intangible assets were at
€5,296 million, surpassing both the level of depreciation and
amortization (€3,455 million) and the level of 2013 (€4,873 million). The disposal of financial assets and other receivables
from financing activities as well as other items led to €427 million in payments received compared with the previous year’s
€28 million in payments made.
For more on investments and acquisitions, see page 38 onward

Management’s Report
The BASF Group business year — Financial position﻿

Cash used in ﬁnancing activities amounted to minus
€2,478 million in 2014, increasing cash outflow by €604 million compared with the previous year. In both years, more
finan­
cial and similar obligations were assumed than were
paid back, but in 2014, a greater amount was paid back than
in 2013. Dividends of €2,480 million were paid to shareholders of BASF SE and €286 million to minority shareholders in
Group companies in 2014.
In total, cash and cash equivalents fell by €109 million
compared with the previous year, amounting to €1,718 million
as of December 31, 2014.
The year-on-year decline in free cash flow of €1,565 million to €1,662 million was the result of lower cash provided by
operating activities and of higher payments related to prop­
erty, plant and equipment and intangible assets.

Value for BASF
Expected annual sales

through 2025

Value for our customers

7%

Generating electricity with renewables involves sharp fluctuations depending on weather and time of day. Energy storage
systems are therefore required to ensure a steady, reliable
supply of electricity. Molten salt based on sodium nitrate can
be ­employed as a medium to both transfer and store heat.
This makes it especially suited to the growing use of solar
thermal energy to generate electricity. We aim to increase
sales of s­ odium nitrate for this application by an average of 7%
each year through 2025.

Greater power plant
efficiency through storage
of thermal energy

up to

10%

In solar thermal power plants, molten salt based on sodium
nitrate serves to store the heat provided by the sun’s rays
and ­
release it again to be converted into electricity later.
This can increase a plant’s capacity utilization – and thus its
efficiency – by up to 10%.

Strategy
▪▪ Integrated production facilities form backbone of
Verbund concept
▪▪ Technology and cost leadership are most important
competitive advantages
With our production facilities, we form the core of the Verbund
structure and supply the BASF segments with basic chemicals for the production of downstream products. We add
value with innovations in processes and production, and
­invest in future markets to ensure the growth of the entire
BASF Verbund. As a reliable supplier, we market our products
to customers in downstream industries, primarily in the
chemi­
cal, electronics, construction, textile, lumber, auto­
motive, pharmaceutical and crop protection industries. We
continually improve our value chains and are expanding our
market position – particularly outside Europe – with new
methods and technologies, as well as through capital expenditures and collaborations in future markets.

We invest in research and development in order to develop
new technologies and to make our existing technologies even
more efficient. Cost leadership and a clear orientation along
individual value chains are among our most important competitive advantages. We concentrate on the critical success
factors of the classical chemicals business: making use of
economies of scale, the advantages of our Verbund, high
capacity utilization, continuous optimization of access to raw
materials, lean processes, and reliable, cost-effective logistics. Furthermore, we are constantly improving our global
production structures and aligning these with regional market
requirements.

Chemicals

Petrochemicals

At €16,968 million, sales to third parties in the Chemicals
segment in 2014 matched the level of the previous year.
Higher sales volumes offset lower prices (volumes 3%, prices
–3%, currencies 0%). Income from operations before special
items grew by €185 million to €2,367 million. This was due to
considerable earnings increases in the Petrochemicals and
Intermediates divisions, which more than compensated for
the Monomers division’s margin-related decline. Income from
operations rose by €310 million to €2,396 million. S
­ pecial
­income arose from the divestiture of our shares in the Ellba
Eastern Private Ltd. joint operation in Singapore. Special
charges included the impairment of a plant.
Sales are likely to decrease slightly in 2015. Substantially
lower oil and raw material prices will lead to price declines
in some business areas. Anticipated volumes growth in all
divisions – partly from the startup of new plants – will not be
able to fully compensate for this. We foresee higher volumes
in the Monomers division, especially of isocyanates and
­polyamide-6 extrusion polymers. In the Intermediates division,
we particularly expect sales volumes to rise in the amines and
polyalcohols businesses. Overall, income from operations
before special items is likely to decline slightly due to ­expenses
for starting operations at several plants.

▪▪ Higher volumes lead to sales increase of €47 million
to €7,832 million compared with 2013 levels
▪▪ Earnings up considerably thanks to significant
improve­ment in margins for steam cracker products
In the Petrochemicals division, sales to third parties in 2014
rose by €47 million to €7,832 million. We were able to raise
volumes primarily through the startup and expansion of
­production plants, in addition to our robust business with
steam cracker products. Sales growth was curbed by falling
prices (volumes 4%, prices –3%, currencies 0%).
Sales in Europe were below the previous year’s level,
largely due to a plant outage at the Ellba C.V. joint operation’s
site in Moerdijk, Netherlands, at the beginning of June 2014.
Prices also declined overall. Volumes grew considerably in
North America. This development was mostly driven by higher
demand for steam cracker products, the startup of the tenth
furnace of the steam cracker in Port Arthur, Texas, and the
higher capacity utilization of the condensation splitter. Sales in
Asia saw a considerable, mainly volumes-related d
­ ecline.
We significantly increased our margins for steam cracker
products. In other business, we observed sustained high
pressure on prices and margins in all regions, especially for
acrylates and in the plasticizer and solvent business. This was
partly attributable to additional capacities leading to better
product availability, primarily in Asia. As a result of ­significantly
improved margins for steam cracker products, income from
operations before special items considerably exceeded the
level of 2013.

BASF Report 2014 

In Nanjing, China, we started up an acrylic acid complex with
an annual capacity of 160,000 metric tons; another acrylic
acid complex will start up in Camaçari, Brazil, in early 2015.
With the tenth steam cracker furnace in Port Arthur, Texas, we
have been able to enhance our raw material flexibility there
and better take advantage of the low gas prices in the ­United
States. A butadiene extraction plant went online in Antwerp,
Belgium, in 2014.

Monomers
▪▪ Sales decline by €48 million to €6,337 million
due to lower prices
▪▪ Earnings down considerably as a result of
­competitive pressure and weaker margins in Asia
Sales to third parties in the Monomers division fell by €48 million to €6,337 million compared with 2013 (volumes 2%,
prices –3%, currencies 0%). Reduced sales prices in Asia led
to sales declines for polyamides and isocyanates. In both
value chains, higher volumes were partly able to compensate
for the negative price developments.
We raised sales volumes of MDI, especially in Europe and
Asia. In the polyamides business, we observed sharp volumes
growth for polyamide-6 extrusion polymers, particularly in
Asia.
Additional MDI, TDI and caprolactam capacities led to
inten­sified competitive pressure and lower margins in Asia.
Income from operations before special items therefore
­declined considerably. Fixed costs remained at the prior-year
level despite higher spending on research and costs for both
the new TDI complex in Ludwigshafen and the MDI plant in
Chongqing, China.
Monomers – Sales by region
(Location of customer)

Intermediates
▪▪ At €2,799 million, sales €25 million below
prior-year level
▪▪ Earnings rise considerably through higher
sales ­volumes and reduced fixed costs
In the Intermediates division, sales to third parties in 2014
declined by €25 million to €2,799 million. Lower prices and
negative currency effects, especially during the first half of
the year, were almost fully offset by higher sales volumes
(volumes 3%, prices –3%, currencies –1%).
Amines and polyalcohols were main drivers for this
­volumes growth, particularly in Asia and North America. In our
business with butanediol and its derivatives, we achieved
higher sales volumes in Europe and North America, whereas
volumes declined in Asia.
More intense competition compared with 2013, especially
in Asia, led to price and margin pressure on butanediol and
formic acid. We were able to ­compensate for this with a favorable product mix including a higher proportion of specialties.
As a result of the increased sales volumes and lower fixed
costs, income from operations before special items considerably surpassed the level of the previous year. Special items
mainly pertained to the impairment of a production plant in
Ludwigshafen. In addition, we closed one small production
plant at each of two Louisiana sites in Geismar and Zachary in
2014.
At the Verbund site in Geismar, Louisiana, we are expan­
ding our S-methylisopropylamine capacity in order to accommodate the Crop Protection division’s growing demand for
this chiral amine. We are also enlarging our butanediol plant
there. In Ludwigshafen, Germany, and Nanjing, China, we are
expanding our production capacities for specialty amines. We
plan to construct an ethylhexanoic acid plant in Kuantan,
Malaysia, with our joint venture partner PETRONAS. These
projects are enabling us to intensify the backward and
forward integration within our Verbund.

Value for BASF
Expected annual sales

Value for our customers and the environment
Process water recovered

>10%

Because water plays a significant role in most mining pro­
cesses, it is crucial that it be treated responsibly in this indus­try
– which is where our Rheomax® technology comes in.
­Rheomax® ETD is used in mining to separate solids from water
when treating overburden. We aim to increase our sales of
Rheomax® ETD by more than 10% every year through 2020.

>80%
Thanks to Rheomax® ETD, we can recover more than 80% of
process water, compared with the industry standard of 75%.
The mining industry can therefore reduce the land footprint
needed to store overburden and – because of the faster rate
of soil drainage – can begin sooner with renaturation.

Strategy
▪▪ Tailor-made products improve our customers’
­applications and processes
▪▪ Global presence ensures reliable supply to
­customers in all regions
▪▪ Paper chemicals business reorganized
We take on the challenges arising from important future
­issues, especially population growth: scarce resources, environmental and climatic stressors, greater demand for food
and the desire for better quality of life. In doing so, we focus
on research and development and maintain close relationships to leading companies in our key customer industries.
We position ourselves globally in order to reliably supply
­customers in all regions. We invest in the development of
inno­vations that enable our products and processes – as well
as our customers’ applications and processes – to make a
contribution to sustainability: for example, by allowing
­resources to be used more efficiently.
Industry-speciﬁc specialties make up a major part of our
product range. These products create additional value for our
customers, which allows them to stand out from the competition. We develop new solutions together with our customers
and strive for long-term partnerships which create profitable
growth opportunities for both sides.

We employ a different business model for standard products,
such as vitamins or dispersions for paper coatings. Here,
efficient production setups, backward integration in our
­
­Production Verbund’s value chains, capacity management,
and technology and cost leadership are all essential.
We support our customers by being a reliable supplier
with consistent product quality, a good price/performance
ratio and lean processes.
We reorganized our paper chemicals business as of
­January 1, 2015, in order to strengthen our competitiveness.
This involved dissolving the Paper Chemicals division and
continuing the business in the Performance Chemicals and
Dispersions & Pigments divisions. In doing so, we can utilize
synergies along our existing value chains and at the same
time remain a reliable, high-performance partner for the paper
industry.

Previously conducted in the Performance Chemicals division, our business with pigments in the plastic additives business area was allocated to the Dispersions & Pigments division at
the beginning of 2014. The 2013 figures for both divisions have been adjusted accordingly to ensure better comparability.

Performance Products
At €15,433 million, sales to third parties in the Performance
Products segment in 2014 were €101 million below the
­prior-year level. We were able to raise sales volumes despite
an increasingly gloomy market environment over the course
of the year. With prices stable, sales were negatively impacted
by currency e
­ ffects (volumes 1%, prices 0%, currencies –2%).
Restructuring measures helped reduce our fixed costs compared with 2013. As a result, we were able to raise income
from operations before special items by €90 million to
€1,455 million. Nearly every division contributed to this slight
increase. ­Income from operations grew considerably, up by
€317 million to €1,417 million compared with the previous
year. This was largely on account of lower special charges,
which were primarily related to restructuring measures, as
well as special income from the sale of our PolyAd Services
business in 2014.
We want to considerably increase sales in 2015, mainly
through organic growth. In the Dispersions & Pigments and
Care Chemicals divisions, this endeavor will be supported by
factors like new production capacities. We anticipate a considerable volumes increase in the Nutrition & Health division,
including for products for animal feed and for flavors and fragrances. Sales prices are likely to remain under pressure,
however. In the Performance Chemicals division, we plan on
increasing sales volumes. We are particularly striving to gain
additional market share in the fuel and lubricant additives
business area. We will also continue expanding our water
treatment, oilfield and mining solutions business in attractive

growth markets, such as enhanced oil recovery and membrane filtration. The textile chemicals business will be sold to
Archroma during the first half of 2015. Income from operations before special items is expected to considerably exceed
the level of 2014, supported in all divisions by strict cost
discipline and measures to increase competitiveness.

Dispersions & Pigments
▪▪ At €3,869 million, sales match level of 2013
▪▪ Slight earnings improvement, mainly through
higher volumes and reduced fixed costs
At €3,869 million, sales to third parties in the Dispersions &
Pigments division matched the level of the previous year
­despite negative currency effects. We were able to slightly
increase our sales volumes, although the market cooled off in
the second half of the year (volumes 3%, prices –1%, currencies –2%).
Sales in the dispersions business were at the ­prior-year
level. Sales volumes rose particularly in Asia and South America, and also through the startup of new plants in the fourth
quarter of 2014. In the pigments business, volumes ­remained
stable despite adjustments to the product portfolio. We were
able to increase our sales of resins in an intensely competitive
environment. Growth impetus was provided by Europe and
Asia. We achieved a slight i­ncrease in sales volumes in the
additives business. The h
­ igher volumes helped offset intense
pressure on prices and negative currency effects.

BASF Report 2014 

Management’s Report
The BASF Group business year — Performance Products﻿

We were able to slightly improve income from operations
­before special items compared with 2013. This was largely
owing to higher volumes and reduced fixed costs, especially
as a result of restructuring measures in the pigments business. Special charges were substantially below the level of
the previous year, and were mostly related to restructuring
measures.
In 2014, we expanded our capacities in, for example, the
dispersions business area by constructing new plants in
­Dahej, India, and Freeport, Texas, which will contribute to our
future growth in these regions.

In 2014, we began production at a surfactants plant at the
site in Dahej, India. Furthermore, we invested in new capa­
cities for superabsorbents in Camaçari, Brazil, as well as in
our joint venture BASF-YPC Co. Ltd. in Nanjing, China.

Care Chemicals
▪▪ Currency effects lead to €36 million decline in sales
to €4,835 million compared with previous year
▪▪ Earnings increase slightly through improved margins
and higher capacity utilization
Sales to third parties declined by €36 million to €4,835 million
in 2014 in the Care Chemicals division. Currency effects, primarily from the Argentinian peso, Brazilian real and Turkish
lira, had a negative impact on sales. Volumes matched the
level of the previous year. Higher raw material costs resulted
in our raising prices, especially for lauric oil-based standard
products (volumes 0%, prices 1%, currencies –2%).
Sales volumes dropped considerably in the hygiene
business area. In the previous year, we had beneﬁted from
temporarily low capacities on the market. In other business –
particularly ingredients for personal care products – we
increased sales volumes overall, especially in Europe and
­
Asia, despite a market environment that remained difficult.
Despite negative currency effects and the sales volumes
decline in the hygiene business, we were able to raise income
from operations before special items slightly, thanks in part to
improved margins. Our capacity utilization, which once
­
again topped the prior-year level, also had a positive effect.
Restruc­
turing measures allowed us to keep fixed costs
steady.

Nutrition & Health
▪▪ Sales decrease by €59 million to €2,029 million
due to lower volumes and negative currency effects
▪▪ Earnings improve slightly partly as a result of
portfolio measures
Compared with the 2013 level, sales in the Nutrition & Health
division were down by €59 million in a challenging market
environment, amounting to €2,029 million (volumes –2%,
prices 0%, portfolio 1%, currencies –2%).
With demand largely stable, sales volumes matched
­prior-year levels in the human and animal nutrition business
as well as in the flavor and fragrance business. Volumes
fell in the pharmaceutical business area. This was largely due
to competitors entering the market for highly concentrated
omega-3 fatty acids. The successful development of the rest
of the pharmaceuticals business partly counteracted this
decline in sales volumes. We were able to offset competition-related declines in vitamin E prices by raising prices in the
other business areas.
Despite lower sales volumes and negative currency
­effects, we slightly increased income from operations before
special items. Portfolio measures as part of a divisional
reorganization were major factors supporting this development. This enabled us to improve our margins and keep our
fixed costs at prior-year levels despite negative currency
­effects and investment preparations. Special charges arose
predominantly in connection with measures to increase our
competitiveness.
We began the construction of an integrated production
complex for flavors and fragrances in Kuantan, Malaysia, in
April 2014 – a joint project with our partner PETRONAS. With
this investment, we are building up both our production network and our competitive strength in the region.

Paper Chemicals
▪▪ Sales down by €71 million to €1,371 million
▪▪ Earnings comparable with level of 2013,
supported by restructuring measures
Sales to third parties in the Paper Chemicals division fell by
€71 million to €1,371 million compared with 2013 (volumes
–3%, prices – 1%, currencies –1%). Sales volumes decreased
slightly following portfolio optimization and restructuring measures. This meant that our business developed in step with
our relevant market, which shrank slightly in 2014. The lower
volumes were largely due to declining paper production in our
largest market segment, graphical paper, as well as to our
Asian customers’ increasing backward integration along the
value chain. Lower raw material costs and an aggressive
competitive environment led to declining prices. Negative
currency effects additionally dampened sales.
In this difficult environment, we concentrated on repositioning our portfolio toward paper packaging and continued
the expansion of product lines with competitive advantages
for our customers. This allowed us to achieve significant gains
in sales volumes of VFA-based cationic polymers and cost-­
effective binders, which enable paper manufacturers to produce more efficiently and at lower cost.
Income from operations before special items matched the
level of the previous year. This was especially the result of
measures taken in our restructuring project, which counteracted somewhat weaker sales volumes and the cost of
starting up new plants in Asia and North America. Special
charges arose predominantly from restructuring measures.
Special income arose from the sales of our business with alkyl
ketene dimer emulsions.

▪▪ Sales grow by €47 million to €3,329 million
due to increased sales volumes
▪▪ Earnings rise considerably, especially through
sales volumes growth and reduced fixed costs
In the Performance Chemicals division, sales to third parties
rose year-on-year by €47 million to €3,329 million. This was
predominantly a result of higher sales volumes (volumes 4%,
prices –1%, portfolio –1%, currencies –1%), which we were
able to increase in all business areas. Plastic additives
contributed particularly to positive development in Europe.
In Asia, sales volumes rose especially for fuel and lubricant
addi­tives; in North America, we primarily raised volumes in the
business area for water treatment, oilfield and mining solutions. Sales volumes in South America remained overall at
prior-year levels.
Income from operations before special items considerably
surpassed the level of 2013. This was partly attributable to
significantly higher volumes as well as fixed cost reduction
measures, especially in our plastic additives business. Considerably improved earnings in fuel and lubricant additives
furthermore contributed to the earnings increase.
Special income arose from the sale of our PolyAd Services
business. Special charges came in part from measures to
restruc­ture our businesses with plastic additives.

Catalysts

In the Functional Materials & Solutions segment, we increased
our sales to third parties by €473 million to €17,725 million
compared with the previous year (volumes 5%, prices 0%,
currencies –2%). This was predominantly on account of
­considerably higher sales volumes, especially of products for
the automotive industry. Negative currency effects weakened
sales growth in all divisions. Prices remained stable overall.
At €1,197 million, income from operations before special
items were €127 million above the 2013 level as a result of the
increase in the Catalysts and Coatings divisions. Income from
operations grew by €123 million to €1,150 million despite
higher special charges in the Construction Chemicals division.
For 2015, we expect higher demand from our key customer industries, automotive and construction. We anticipate
a significant increase in sales volumes of our innovative
specialties and system solutions. We want to raise our
sales considerably. In the Catalysts and Performance Mate­
rials divisions, sales growth will be supported by the startup of
new plants. We are also striving for a considerable increase in
­income from operations before special items. All divisions are
­expected to contribute to this development.

▪▪ Sales up by €427 million to €6,135 million
through i­ncrease in sales volumes
▪▪ Considerable increase in earnings due in part to
higher volumes in mobile emissions catalysts
We raised sales to third parties by €427 million to €6,135 million in the Catalysts division in 2014 (volumes 9%, prices
–1%, currencies –1%). This was primarily due to sales growth
for mobile emissions catalysts as well as to the larger, volumes-driven contribution from precious metal trading, which
rose by €220 million to €2,575 million.
Because of greater demand for vehicle engines and the
introduction of new emissions regulations, sales volumes
­increased for our mobile emissions catalysts, especially in
Europe and Asia. Significant factors here included the stricter
Euro 6 emissions regulation that took effect for lightweight
passenger cars in Europe as well as the introduction of
Euro IV emissions norms for trucks in China. In the United
States, Europe and Japan, sales volumes of catalysts for
­offroad vehicles rose in response to the step-by-step implementation of the Tier 4 emissions regulation. We observed
declining volumes in South America as a result of weaker
market growth.

BASF Report 2014 

Management’s Report
The BASF Group business year — Functional Materials & Solutions﻿

Sales rose slightly for chemical catalysts, mainly through price
increases. We were also able to raise our sales slightly for
­refinery catalysts, largely through increased volumes.
Income from operations before special items considerably
exceeded the level of the previous year. This was predominantly attributable to the higher sales volumes of mobile
emissions catalysts and stronger margins for chemical and
refinery catalysts.

Construction Chemicals
▪▪ Currency and portfolio-related sales decline of
€60 million to €2,060 million
▪▪ Slight dip in earnings, especially due to currency
­effects
In the Construction Chemicals division, sales to third parties
fell by €60 million year-on-year to €2,060 million. This was
mostly because of negative currency effects as well as divestitures. Higher volumes and prices slowed the sales decline
(volumes 2%, prices 1%, portfolio –3%, currencies –3%).
Sales in Europe fell considerably as a result of portfolio
and currency effects. The portfolio effects came essentially
from divestitures undertaken as part of our efficiency measures in Germany. Sharply negative currency effects were
observed in Turkey and Russia. Weighed down by currencies,
sales in Asia were just below the prior year’s level. With prices
slightly higher, we were able to considerably increase sales
volumes, primarily in India. Stronger demand and stable
­prices led to a slight rise in sales in North America compared
with 2013, despite negative currency influences. In the region
South America, Africa, Middle East, we were able to considerably exceed the sales of the previous year due to positive
portfolio effects as well as higher volumes and prices.
Income from operations before special items was slightly
down compared with 2013, due especially to currency e
­ ffects.
Special charges rose because of the impairment of intangible
assets.

In the Coatings division, sales to third parties in 2014 rose by
€57 million to €2,984 million. We were able to more than offset negative currency and portfolio effects with higher volumes
and prices (volumes 4%, prices 3%, portfolio –1%, currencies
–4%). Sales volumes grew in Asia, North America and Europe,
whereas they declined slightly in South America. We particularly raised our prices for decorative paints and automotive
refinish coatings.
Our business with OEM coatings developed very successfully thanks to growing demand in Asia, North America
and Europe. For automotive refinish coatings, we were able to
partly compensate for weaker demand in South America and
negative currency effects by raising sales prices. A considerable sales increase in the industrial coatings business area
was particularly buoyed by higher volumes, which arose
mainly from greater demand for coil coatings as well as for
rotor blade coatings for wind turbines. In the decorative paints
business, sales declined slightly despite increased demand
and higher sales prices. This was largely on account of
­negative currency effects in Brazil and the divestiture of the
business in Argentina.
Income from operations before special items grew
­considerably, mainly owing to higher sales volumes for OEM
coatings.

Performance Materials
▪▪ Sales up by €49 million to €6,546 million
through ­increase in sales volumes
▪▪ Slight decline in earnings due to higher
production costs
In the Performance Materials division, we increased sales to
third parties by €49 million to €6,546 million in 2014 (volumes
2%, prices 0%, currencies –1%). Whereas volumes declined
slightly in Europe, we saw considerable gains in sales ­volumes
in Asia and especially North America. Price levels were largely
stable. Negative currency effects dampened sales growth in
all regions, particularly in South America.
We raised our sales to the automotive industry considerably. Demand in Asia and North America rose significantly,
especially for engineering plastics, our specialty elastomer
Cellasto® and polyurethane systems. Mainly as a result of
sharply increased contributions from Cellasto®, Europe also
observed slight sales growth.
The slight recovery of the European construction industry
had a positive effect on our sales of polyurethane systems
and styrenic foams in the region. We benefited from higher
demand in North America, too, which was primarily due to a
better market environment in residential construction. We
were able to continue increasing sales of Neopor® in Asia.
Sales to the consumer goods industry declined slightly,
however, mostly because of a considerable drop in sales
­volumes in polyurethane systems in Europe. We were able to
partly compensate for this with overall higher volumes in
North America and in our specialties, particularly Ultrason®
and the thermoplastic polyurethanes.

BASF Report 2014

Compared with the previous year, income from operations
before special items was down slightly due to rising manufacturing costs through the startup of new plants. Sales growth
in our high-margin businesses with engineering plastics and
thermoplastic polyurethanes was not able to fully compensate
for the increased fixed costs.
In 2014, we began operations at a new Ultrason® production plant at the Yeosu, South Korea, site. We furthermore
invested in the sites at Lemförde, Germany, and Shanghai,
China, as well as Dahej, India, especially in the areas of
thermoplastic polyurethanes and Cellasto®. With these
­
­measures, we are further expanding our specialties business.

How we create value – an example
Blockbuster fungicide Xemium®
Critical component and driver of BASF’s fungicide portfolio
Value for BASF

Value for our customers

Peak sales potential

>€600 million
Since its introduction in 2011, Xemium® has been a key component of our fungicide portfolio and has strengthened our
leading position in innovative fungicide solutions. Xemium®’s
excellent sales growth between 2011 and 2014 confirms that
products featuring Xemium® have been adopted very readily
by our customers and that they are being used in numerous
crops across all regions. We aim for a peak sales potential of
more than €600 million with Xemium®.

Better performance than
conventional fungicides

3-fold

Xemium® outperforms conventional fungicide products in
three ways: It remains effective longer, can be used more
flexibly and disperses extraordinarily well within the plant. For
the farmer, this translates into higher crop yields and improved
quality thanks to high product reliability and a broad range of
effects.

Strategy
▪▪ Contribution to feeding a growing world population
▪▪ Long-term innovation strategy ensures future
growth
▪▪ Development of solutions that go beyond
conventional crop protection measures
Our strategy has been developed based on long-term market
trends. A key challenge of the future will be to ensure enough
food for a growing world population. This means that farmers
around the world need to increase their yields – and yet the
natural resources for doing so, such as water and arable land,
are limited. We see it as our duty to provide farmers with
professional support in producing more – and more nutritious –
food as efficiently as possible.
We are committed to the responsible treatment of our
products and the environment. We offer our customers a
broad portfolio of integrated solutions and constantly invest in
our development pipeline to create chemical and biological
innovations in crop protection.
Our research and development activities range from solutions for guarding plants against fungi, insects and weeds, to
seeds and soil management, to plant health. The Functional
Crop Care business unit, for example, not only offers seed

enhancement products and innovations for better soil man­
agement, but also provides biological and chemical techno­
logies that make plants more resistant to stress factors such
as heat, cold and nutrient deﬁciency.
We are intensifying our investment in growth markets
and continuing to expand our good position in our core
markets. In 2015, we will introduce the new dicamba formulation ­Engenia® in North America. Used in dicamba- and
glyphosate-tolerant cropping systems, this is a highly efficient
agent for controlling glyphosate-resistant weeds in important
field crops, such as corn and soy.
We will further expand our partnerships with seed companies, benefiting as well from the technological competence of
BASF Plant Science. In addition, we work together with other
BASF divisions to develop the best solutions for our customers. Integrated IT applications for increasing agricultural yield
and productivity are one example. We develop these together
with farmers, and will begin introducing them to key agricultural markets around the world in 2015. They will ­support
farmers in their decision-making and in managing their business operations, and will better connect the global agriculture
community.

Agricultural ­Solutions
In the Agricultural Solutions segment, we increased sales to
third parties in 2014 by €219 million to €5,446 million through
higher volumes and sales prices. Continuously falling prices
for agricultural commodities put a considerable strain on our
business over the course of the year. The agricultural sector
grew more slowly overall than it had in 2013. In this challenging environment, income from operations before special items
declined by €113 million to €1,109 million. Income from
­operations decreased by €100 million to €1,108 million.
For 2015, we expect prices for agricultural commodities
to remain at the level of the second half of 2014. With
­exchange rates developing more favorably overall, we anticipate high market volatility. In this environment, we set ourselves the ambitious goal of increas­ing sales volumes and
considerably improving sales and income from operations
­
before special items.

Crop Protection
▪▪ Volumes and price-driven sales increase of
€219 million to €5,446 million
▪▪ Income from operations before special items
falls by €113 million to €1,109 million
We improved sales to third parties by €219 million to
€5,446 million compared with the previous year. This was
mostly ­attributable to vigorous business in Europe and North
America as well as increased demand for fungicides and
herbicides. In the first half of the year, negative currency
­developments particularly affected our business in the emerging markets (volumes 5%, prices 2%, currencies –3%).
Compared with 2013, sales in Europe grew by €100 million to €2,046 million. This was mainly because of a strong
start to the year, especially in western and central Europe.
Demand for fungicides was high after the mild, humid winter.
We were able to increase sales prices overall.

In North America, sales grew by €77 million year-on-year to
€1,574 million, primarily driven by greater demand and by
price increases in innovative herbicides. Sales were nega­tively
­impacted by currency exchange effects.
Sales in Asia amounted to €526 million, exceeding the
level of 2013 by €13 million. This was largely on account of
high demand for our fungicides in China and our successful
direct business in Australia. Negative currency effects reduced
sales growth in the region.
In South America, we improved sales by €29 million to
€1,300 million, despite the first half of the year’s sharply nega­
tive currency effects and the pressure exerted on insecticides
by generic products. Our innovative fungicide Xemium® and
our herbicide Kixor® performed especially well.
At €1,109 million, income from operations before special
items was €113 million below the level of the previous year.
This decline was due to negative currency effects, especially
in the first half of the year; declining margins resulting from an
unfavorable product mix; and higher expenditures for research
and development and for production and distribution as part
of exploiting future growth opportunities.

Value for society

50%

Steam flooding is an Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) method
that improves yields in oil production. This method involves
injecting hot steam under pressure into an oil reservoir to heat
the oil, which becomes less viscous and therefore more easily
extractable. Usually, around 30% to 35% of the crude oil in a
reservoir is recovered. Steam flooding allows us to raise this
rate for some parts of the reservoir up to 50% and more.

Longer oil production at a
constant level helps secure
energy supplies

3-fold

Germany is dependent on energy imports to a high degree.
Using EOR technologies, domestic oil reserves can be produced both longer and more efficiently. We have already used
steam flooding to increase production time at the Emlichheim
location to 70 years, three times longer than originally planned.

Strategy
▪▪ Pursuit of our growth strategy through
exploration, acquisitions, strategic partnerships
and technological expertise
▪▪ Important contribution to security of Europe’s
natural gas supply
In the future, crude oil and natural gas will continue to contribute signiﬁcantly toward covering the sharply rising energy
demand of a growing world population. That is why we invest
in the exploration and production of oil and gas, primarily in
our core regions Europe, North Africa, Russia and South
America, thereby continuing along our growth course. We
also aim to establish the Middle East as another of our core
regions.
Our growth strategy is based on three pillars: innovative
technologies, selected collaborations and partnerships, and
the responsible development and production of hydrocarbons. In addition to the successful execution of our projects,
we focus on continuously optimizing our portfolio of oil and
gas activities. Measured by production volumes, gas activities
comprised around 70% of our portfolio in 2014. Our oil and
gas activities contributed approximately equal shares to
­income from operations before special items.
Our diversified portfolio, low production and reserves
replen­ishment costs, and our focus on attractive techno­­
logical and exploration projects have made us able to make
significant contributions to the earnings of the BASF Group,
even when oil prices are low.

Handling hydrocarbons in a responsible manner demands
special measures for the protection of people and the
environment. We therefore carefully assess the potential
­
effects of every project before we begin. Together with
­
­experts, contractors and relevant stakeholders, we develop
methods and implement measures to be able to use r­­ esources
even more efﬁciently and minimize the impact on the
­environment. In doing so, we act in accordance with international agreements, local legislation and our own, self-imposed
high standards.
We intensified our collaboration with Statoil in 2014 by
acquiring additional assets and concluding agreements on
joint investment and exploration activities. This increased our
Norwegian oil and gas production by 50%, to 60,000 barrels
of oil equivalent (BOE) each day. We will furthermore take over
operation of the Vega field.
We agreed with our partner Gazprom not to proceed with
the asset swap planned for the end of 2014. The arrangement
had been for Wintershall to give Gazprom its share of the
natural gas trading and storage business as well as a share of
Wintershall Noordzee B.V. In return, Winters­hall was to ­receive
shares in two additional blocks of the Urengoy field in western
Siberia. Together with Gazprom, we still intend to continue the
close partnership we have established over many years of
dependable cooperation.

BASF Report 2014 

The long-term increase in demand for natural gas in western
Europe, coupled with the decline in regional production,
means that ever-­increasing volumes of natural gas will have to
be imported. Aside from the production of natural gas and
development of gas fields, our pipeline network, natural gas
storage facilities and trading activities all make an important
contribution to supply security in western Europe.

Exploration & Production
▪▪ Active portfolio management, including
expansion of our position in Norway
Europe: The Mittelplate ﬁeld off the North Sea coast is
the cornerstone of our crude oil production in Germany. We
own a 50% stake in this field, the largest known oil deposit
in the country. At the Bockstedt oil ﬁeld, we continued our
ﬁeld test for increasing recovery rates with the biopolymer
Schizophyllan.
Our portfolio’s Norwegian activities gained even more in
significance through the shares we acquired from Statoil ASA
in the producing fields Vega and Gjøa. The transaction
­increased our production from 40,000 BOE to 60,000 BOE
per day. Wintershall Norge AS will take over operations in the
Vega field in 2015, provided approval is granted by authorities
and partners. Furthermore, we acquired shares in the Aasta
Hansteen development project, the Asterix discovery and the
Polarled pipeline project, and concluded an agreement with
Statoil on even more intensive collaboration in exploration.
We were able to further bolster our portfolio of licenses,
mainly through the receipt of eight new exploration licenses
including five with our own operatorship. Four of these
licenses are for the North Sea: three in the Norwegian Sea
and one in the Barents Sea.
We continued our work in developing the Edvard Grieg
and Knarr oil prospects in 2014.
The sale of selected investments in development projects
on the British continental shelf to the Hungarian MOL Group
was concluded in the first quarter of 2014 with retroactive
­financial effect to January 1, 2013.
Russia: The Yuzhno Russkoye natural gas ﬁeld in western
Siberia has been operating at plateau production since 2009.
We have a 35% economic interest in this ﬁeld. Together with
our partner Gazprom, we are currently drafting a development
plan for the Turon horizons, another formation in this natural
gas field. We hold a stake of 50% in the development of Block
IA of the Achimov formation in the Urengoy ﬁeld in western
Siberia. The gradual development of this ﬁeld was continued;
40 wells were producing at the end of 2014. We are involved
in the oilfield exploration and production of the Volgograd area
together with Lukoil.

Management’s Report
The BASF Group business year — Oil & Gas﻿

North Africa/Middle East: In Libya, we are the operator of
eight oil ﬁelds in the onshore concessions 96 and 97.
­Production there had been suspended in July 2013 as a result
of strikes at export terminals; we were able to temporarily
­resume production in concession 96 to a limited extent in
September 2014. In December, the unstable situation once
again forced us to shut down production. Production in
­concession 97 remains unfeasible due predominantly to the
ongoing blockade of transport infrastructure. However, we
have been able to continue operations without interruption at
the Al Jurf offshore oil ﬁeld in Libya, in which we have a stake.
In May, we started our first exploration drilling as the
opera­tor in the development of the Shuweihat sour gas and
condensate field in Abu Dhabi. We have shares in this project
together with the Abu Dhabi national oil company, ADNOC,
and the Austrian oil and gas company OMV.
South America: We hold shares in a total of 15 onshore
and offshore ﬁelds in Argentina. In the Neuquén Basin, we
continued our technology projects to explore the potential
for shale gas and oil. We signed a joint venture agreement
with the Argentinian company Gas y Petróleo del Neuquén
in January 2014 for the exploration and potential further
develop­ment of the Aguada Federal block. In this 97 square
kilometer block, a deposit is being developed in the shale
of the Vaca Muerta formation. Wintershall, with its 50% share,
is the block’s operator. In Chile, we hold 10% of the San
Sebas­tian block.

together with Gazprom
In this business sector, the natural gas trading and storage
activities conducted together with Gazprom are ­predominantly
combined into the W & G Beteiligungs-GmbH & Co. KG
(W & G) Group. The natural gas transport businesses are
gathered into the WIGA Transport Beteiligungs-GmbH &
Co. KG (WIGA) Group. W & G and WIGA mainly fulfill holding and financing functions. The natural gas trading, transport
and storage sectors act as independent subsidiaries under
the umbrella of their respective holding. This organizational
structure accommodates the unbundling requirements set
down by the ­German Energy Act.

Natural gas trading: The W&G subsidiary WINGAS GmbH
markets natural gas from various producers to ­Germany and
other European countries. Its main customers are municipal
utilities and regional gas suppliers as well as larger industrial
ﬁrms and power plants. ­WINGAS is also ­active on spot trading markets.
In line with our strategy of growth at the source, we sold
our shares in the Leipzig natural gas provider VNG – Verbundnetz Gas AG to EWE AG.
Gas transport: The WIGA Group operates a 3,300 kilometer long-distance network that includes the pipeline links
to the Nord Stream Pipeline, the Baltic Sea Pipeline Link
(OPAL) and the North European Gas Pipeline (NEL). The
­significant portions of the project to link the NEL to G
­ ASCADE’s
existing long-distance network were completed and started
up in 2014.

We hold a 15.5% share in the Nord Stream Pipeline through
Nord Stream AG, which is accounted for as an ­investment
using the equity method in the BASF Group ﬁnancial statements. Other shareholders are Gazprom (51%) and ­­
E.ON
(15.5%), as well as N.V. Nederlandse Gasunie and GDF Suez
(9% each). With a total capacity of 55 billion cubic ­meters of
natural gas per year, this pipeline, which stretches from Russia to the German coast over the Baltic Sea, helps shore up
supply security in Europe.
The South Stream Offshore Pipeline through the Black
Sea was to be developed, constructed and operated by
South Stream Transport B.V. The companies Gazprom (50%),
Eni (20%), Wintershall (15%) and EdF (15%) agreed to terminate the South Stream Offshore Project. Gazprom therefore
­acquired all minority shares on December 29, 2014.
Gas storage: astora GmbH & Co. KG markets the ­storage
capacity of western Europe’s largest natural gas storage facility in Rehden, Germany, as well the share in the storage facilities in Haidach, Austria, and Jemgum, G
­ ermany.

Oil & Gas
In the Oil & Gas segment, sales to third parties grew by
€369 million compared with 2013 to €15,145 million (volumes
14%, prices/currencies –13%, portfolio 1%). This was predominantly the result of higher volumes in the natural gas
trading business. Income from operations before special
items fell by €61 million to €1,795 million as a consequence of
slightly smaller contributions from both business sectors.
Special charges of €239 million mainly arose from valuation
allowances on exploration and production projects, and were
only partly offset by special income from the sale of shares in
oil and gas fields in the British North Sea to the MOL Group.
­Income from operations therefore decreased by €715 million
to €1,688 million. Net income declined by €266 million to
€1,464 million.

Our planning for 2015 is based on an average oil price
­between $60 and $70 per barrel and a U.S. dollar exchange
rate of $1.20 per euro. On average, gas prices are likely to
remain at 2014 levels. Because of the lower price of oil, we
anticipate a slight decrease in sales and considerably reduced
income from operations before special items in 2015. In
the Exploration & Production business sector, the negative
effects of the drop in oil prices will probably be partly offset by
the expansion of our activities in Norway and the boost in
Achimgaz production in Russia. We also expect to partially
resume our onshore production in Libya. Our portfolio
opti­
mization measures will continue. For the Natural Gas
Trading business sector, we anticipate considerable earnings
improve­ment thanks to a higher contribution from the transportation business as well as rising sales volumes.

Exploration & Production

Natural Gas Trading

▪▪ At €2,938 million, sales at prior-year level despite
lower prices
▪▪ Crude oil and natural gas production rises by 3%
▪▪ Declining production in Germany due to
authorization logjam for fracking plans
▪▪ Earnings decline by €38 million to €1,412 million,
weighed down mainly by prices and currencies

▪▪ Higher volumes lead to €360 million increase
in sales, totaling €12,207 million
▪▪ Earnings at €383 million, down €23 million
year-on-year

Sales to third parties in the Exploration & Production business
sector amounted to €2,938 million, matching the level of the
previous year. Higher volumes, especially in Russia, and
largely portfolio-driven growth in Norway were able to compensate for lower prices.
The yearly average for the price of Brent crude oil
­decreased by 9% to $99 per barrel. The price of oil also fell by
9% in euro terms, amounting to €74 per barrel.
At 136 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), our crude oil
and natural gas production exceeded the level of 2013 by
3%. Production increased substantially both in Norway and in
our joint operation Achimgaz. Counterbalancing effects came
mainly from reduced production in our Libyan onshore fields
as well as the further decrease in production in Germany
resul­ting from the ongoing authorization logjam for fracking
plans for conventional deposits.
Income from operations before special items was at
€1,412 million, representing a mostly price and currencyrelated decline of €38 million despite the significantly higher
contribution from our Norwegian activities.
In the search for new crude oil and natural gas deposits,
we ﬁnished drilling a total of 21 exploration and appraisal
wells in 2014, of which 16 were successful.
Our proven crude oil and natural gas reserves increased
by 17% compared with the end of 2013 to 1,708 million BOE.
We replenished 284% of the volumes produced in 2014.
The reserve-to-production ratio is around 13 years (2013:
11 years). This is based on Wintershall’s share of production
in 2014 and refers to the reserves at year-end.
For more on our crude oil and natural gas reserves,
see page 225 onward

Sales to third parties in the Natural Gas Trading business
sector grew by €360 million to €12,207 million as a result of
higher volumes. Intensified trade on European spot markets
led to a 40 billion kilowatt hour increase in sales volumes to
561 billion kilowatt hours. WINGAS provided 3% of its volumes to BASF Group companies outside of the Oil & Gas
segment.
At €383 million, income from operations before special
items was €23 million below the level of the previous year. A
smaller contribution from the storage business was partly
offset by higher earnings in the transportation business and
ongoing optimization measures on the procurement end of
the trading business.

▪▪ Sales decline by 1% to €42,854 million
▪▪ Site for mobile emissions catalysts opened in Poland

▪▪ Sales rise by 6% to €15,467 million
▪▪ Intensified investment in the region

In 2014, sales at companies headquartered in the region
­Europe decreased by 1% to €42,854 million. Sales in the
chemicals business1 fell by 2% to €23,461 million; a higher
contribution from the Oil & Gas segment was able to almost
fully compensate for this.
The Chemicals segment posted a volumes and price-­
related sales decline in 2014. With volumes stable, sales in
the Performance Products segment were slightly below the
previous year’s level. In the Functional Materials & Solutions
segment, sales rose compared with 2013 as a result of higher
demand. We also posted sales growth in the Agricultural
Solutions segment, boosted by positive development in volumes and prices. Sales were considerably up in the Oil & Gas
segment due to higher volumes in gas trading.
Income from operations before special items amounted to
€4,759 million, an increase of 10% compared with 2013. This
was mainly the result of the 18% improvement in earnings in
the chemicals business to €3,006 million.
We are taking a series of steps to sharpen the competitive
edge of the Performance Products segment. We are adapting
our business to altered market conditions by streamlining
processes, investing in new technologies, taking portfolio
measures and making organizational revisions.
In Środa Śla˛ska, Poland, we opened our largest European
production plant for mobile emissions catalysts in 2014. This
will enable us to even better accommodate the rising demand
resulting from Euro 6/VI, the stricter exhaust gas regulations
for trucks and passenger cars in Europe.

At €15,467 million, sales for companies headquartered in
North America were up by 6% compared with 2013. In local
currency terms, this was an increase of 7%. Sales in the
Chemicals segment rose considerably, thanks in particular to
higher volumes for steam cracker products. The Functional
Materials & Solutions and Agricultural Solutions segments
also contributed to sales growth. Sales in the Performance
Products segment matched the level of the previous year.
Income from operations before special items rose by 2%
to €1,566 million. The main reason for this was a considerably
larger, margin-driven contribution from the Petrochemicals
division. We were able to increase earnings in the Agricultural
Solutions segment, as well. Main factors dampening this
develop­ment were the considerable earnings declines in the
Performance Products segment and in Other.
In this region, we continue to focus on innovation, attractive market segments and cross-business initiatives in
order to ensure proﬁtable growth. At the same time, we
are enhancing our operational excellence through ongoing
improvements. We want to intensify our investment in North
America in light of the attractive growth prospects and lower
raw mate­rial prices. Together with Yara, we are planning the
construction of an ammonia production plant in Freeport,
Texas. We are furthermore exploring an investment in a worldscale methane-to-­propylene complex on the U.S. Gulf Coast.
This would be BASF’s largest single investment to date.

▪▪ At €11,643 million, sales match level of previous year
▪▪ Strengthening research and development presence
and local production

▪▪ Sales dip by 1% to €4,362 million
▪▪ New production capacities for acrylic acid and
superabsorbents in South America

Sales at companies headquartered in the Asia Pacific region
reached €11,643 million, a level comparable with that of the
previous year. In local currency terms, sales rose by 1%. We
observed substantially higher volumes, especially in the Catalysts, Crop Protection, Performance Chemicals, Coatings and
Dispersions & Pigments divisions. This sales volumes increase
was able to compensate for negative currency effects and
falling prices.
Income from operations before special items fell by 27%
to €614 million, mostly weighed down by lower prices in the
Monomers division.
We continued to pursue our regional “grow smartly” strategy last year. In Asia Pacific, we aim to increase the proportion
of sales from local production from its current level of 55% to
around 75% by 2020. Steps toward this goal included opening a new production site in Dahej, India; starting up the
Crop Protection division’s first Asia Pacific plant in Rudong,
China; and inaugurating new plants in China for superabsorbents, acrylic acid, butyl acrylate and automotive coatings.
We also began constructing plants to produce butanediol and
PolyTHF® in Korla, China; aroma chemicals in Kuantan,
Malay­sia; and isononanol in Maoming, China.
The new Electronic Materials R&D Center in Suwon, South
Korea, has further strengthened our presence in the global
Research Verbund. The continued expansion of the Innovation Campus Asia Pacific in Shanghai, China, and a new innovation campus in Mumbai, India, will also contribute to this.
With the opening of the regional Learning Campus in Singapore, we provide our employees in the region with additional
programs for personal and professional development.
To improve profitability in Asia Pacific, we enacted a program to increase efficiency and expand our ability to tap
market potential.

At €4,362 million, sales for companies headquartered in
South America, Africa, Middle East were 1% below the level
of 2013. Sales grew by 8% in local currency terms.
Economic development in South America was weaker
than we had expected. Our sales declined slightly. Higher
prices only partly compensated for negative currency effects.
While sales decreased in the chemicals business, they
rose in the crop protection business, especially through the
launch of innovative products. Sales also grew in the Oil & Gas
segment.
Companies in Africa posted a slight, volumes-driven
boost in sales. Sales also increased slightly in the Middle
East. Through higher volumes and prices, we were able to
more than compensate for negative currency effects there.
Income from operations before special items rose by 8%
to €418 million, largely on account of improved earnings in
the Performance Products and Functional Materials & Solutions segments as well as in Other.
In South America, we continued to implement our growth
strategy, enhancing our focus on customer and market
needs. By opening two new laboratories for the Nutrition &
Health division, we are strengthening our research and development in the region. We are also supporting our long-term
growth with the construction of a production complex for
acrylic acid and superabsorbents in Camaçari, Brazil, which
will begin operations at the beginning of 2015. In order to
­respond to the weak economic development expected in the
region for the medium term, we started a program to increase
efficiency. We are analyzing processes and structures in order
to make even better use of our resources and further raise
productivity.

Strategy
With our sustainability-oriented supply chain management,
we contribute to risk management by boosting our suppliers’
awareness of our expectations and standards, and by supporting them in carrying out our specifications. We count on reliable
supply relationships and want to make our suppliers’ contribution to sustainable development transparent. Furthermore, we
support BASF’s business units in developing solutions to stand
out from the competition in addressing market-specific requirements. Our suppliers are evaluated based on risk due to the
size and scale of our supplier portfolio.

Worldwide procurement
From our suppliers, we obtain raw materials and technical
goods as well as all kinds of services, from technical to logistics and building facility services. BASF acquired raw materials, goods and services for our own production totaling
around €40 billion in value from more than 75,000 suppliers
around the world in 2014. Around 90% of this was locally
sourced. In terms of our ­suppliers, there were no substantial
changes in our value chain in 2014.

Customers

What we expect from our suppliers
▪▪ Global Supplier Code of Conduct
▪▪ Country-specific risk analysis forms
basis of new supplier selection
Both new and existing suppliers are selected and evaluated
not only on the basis of economic criteria, but also with
respect to environmental, social and corporate governance
standards. Our Supplier Code of Conduct is founded on internationally recognized guidelines, such as the principles of
the United Nations’ Global Compact, the International Labor
Organization (ILO) conventions and the topic areas of the
Responsible Care ­
Initiative. Available in 26 languages, the
Code of Conduct covers environmental protection as well as
compliance with human rights, labor and social standards,
and antidiscrimination and anticorruption policies.
A country-based risk analysis forms the basis of our
selection process for new suppliers. Due to the country-­
related risks identified in South America and Asia, we queried
around 700 new suppliers there in 2014 on their commitment
to the values of our Supplier Code of Conduct. Moreover, we
provided training to a total of 495 suppliers with an elevated
sustainability risk, especially in Asia and South America.
In addition, we instructed 519 procurement employees
on sustainability-oriented supplier management. These are
ways in which potential supply chain risks can be identified
and ­minimized together with our suppliers.

Evaluating our suppliers
▪▪ Together for Sustainability initiative aims to h
­ armonize
and standardize supplier assessment and audits
▪▪ 120 raw material supplier sites audited
▪▪ Cooperations begun in China and Brazil for supplier
training
BASF is a founding member of the Together for Sustaina­bility
(TfS) initiative of leading chemical companies for the global
standardization of supplier evaluations and auditing. This
­initiative aims to develop and implement a global program for
the responsible supply of goods and services and improve
suppliers’ environmental and social standards. The evaluation process is simpliﬁed for both suppliers and TfS member
­companies through a globally uniform questionnaire. The
­initiative’s members conducted a total of 2,605 sustainability
assessments and 93 audits in 2014. The number of initiative
members rose from six to twelve. As part of the TfS initiative,
we conducted a Supplier Day in Shanghai, China, in 2014.
The activities in Brazil and India were also expanded.
Based on TfS evaluations, we pursue a risk-oriented
approach with clearly defined, BASF-specific follow-up
­
processes rolled out in 2014 worldwide using an IT tool. We
have developed risk matrices that help us identify suppliers
with a high sustainability risk given their respective country
risks. Our purchasers indicate the suppliers for whom they
see a potentially elevated sustainability risk. Furthermore, we
check ­various information sources to see if any suppliers have
been observed in connection with negative sustainability
incidents. Based on these analyses, we audited a total of
120 raw m
­ aterial supplier sites on sustainability standards
and initiated 538 sustainability assessments through an external service provider in 2014. Our goal is supplier enhancement. If we identify potential for improvement, we support this
supplier in developing measures to fulﬁll our standards. We
conduct ­
another review according to a deﬁned timeframe
based on the sustainability risk measured. If the weak points
discovered were particularly severe and we cannot ﬁnd any
improvement, we reserve the right to terminate the business
relationship. This occurred in seven cases in 2014. We use
this approach to evaluate suppliers with an elevated sustainability risk at least every five years. The approach itself is
­reviewed every two years to identify possibilities for improvement.

BASF Report 2014

In addition, we initiated cooperations in China and Brazil in
2014 to instruct suppliers on sustainability standards. We
have developed a training program together with the East
China University of Science and Technology in Shanghai, and
plan to educate around 2,000 suppliers over the next five
years. We are pursuing the same approach in Brazil together
with the Espaço ECO® Foundation. Through these cooperations, 65 suppliers already received training in 2014.

Audit results
Our audits have revealed some reservations with respect to
working hours, payment of the minimum wage, and payment
of overtime, especially in China. Here, we have called for
improvements on the part of our suppliers. Our 2014 audits
did not identify any cases of child labor. For the suppliers
we reviewed, persons under 18 were excluded from overtime, night shifts and dangerous work. We did not find any
incidences of forced labor in 2014. We were also able to rule
out human rights violations.

Responsibility along the value chain — Raw materials﻿

Raw materials

Suppliers

Transportation

Production

Responsible resource management is an integral part of
our strategy. It is applied within the company through our
Verbund concept, our innovative products and the use of
renewable raw materials. In the search for alternative raw
materials, we employ solutions that contribute to sustainability. We as a company are dependent on ecosystem
services and also have an impact on them. Examples
include the availability of clean water and renewable
­
­resources, or even the effects of ecosystem services on
the preservation of air, water and soil quality.

Strategy
The Verbund system is an important component of our ­resource
efﬁciency strategy: The by-products of one plant often serve as
feedstock elsewhere, thus helping us to use raw materials
more efficiently. In 2014, BASF purchased a total of around
30,000 different raw materials from more than 6,000 suppliers.
Some of our most important raw materials are naphtha, natural
gas, methanol, ammonia and benzene. We examine the use of
renewable resources in our Verbund system and are involved in
the responsible cultivation and utilization of renewables in
­numerous projects along the value chain.

Renewable resources
▪▪ “Mass balance” method established
▪▪ Facility begins operations for commercial
production of bio-based succinic acid
In 2014, around 4.5% of the raw materials we purchased
worldwide were from renewable resources. We are advancing
our research and development activities for products and
production processes based on renewable raw materials.
­
We also further established our “mass balance” method on
the market in 2014. This method uses renewable raw materials from certified sustainable production in place of fossil
resources from the very beginning of the value chain in the
existing Production Verbund. Savings of fossil resources are
calculated for each product. The formulation and quality of
the end products remain unchanged. The method is currently
applied for BASF products, such as superabsorbents, engineering plastics and dispersions, that are accordingly independently certified. We have been selling mass-balanced
BASF polyamide since 2014.

Customers

Succinity GmbH, our joint venture with Corbion Purac, started
up a facility for the commercial production of bio-based
succinic acid in 2014. The plant, located in Montmeló, Spain,
has an ­annual capacity of 10,000 metric tons. This process
employs a bacterium that creates succinic acid naturally from
various r­ enewable raw materials. The succinic acid generated
through these means has a better carbon footprint than that
produced from fossil resources, which allows us to provide
our customers with an economically and environmentally
viable alternative to petrochemical raw materials. Succinic
acid is a versatile c
­ hemical intermediate, used for example in
the production of bioplastics, solvents, polyurethanes and
plasticizers.
Since 2013, we have also provided our customers with
1,4-butanediol on a commercial scale using sugars as a
renewable feedstock based on a licensing agreement with the
company Genomatica Inc. Butanediol and its derivatives are
used, for example, to manufacture plastics for the automotive
and textile industries. In 2014, the polymer and fiber manufacturer INVISTA announced the commercial availability of
bio-based LYCRA® brand spandex fibers; based on BASF’s
butanediol, these are made from renewable raw materials.
BASF is invested in the technology company Renmatix
Inc., which owns a method for obtaining industrial sugar from
­biomass. This technology can expand the base of renewable
resources for future processes. The partners announced a
­collaboration for the further development of the method at the
end of 2013.
Together with Cargill and the German governmental agency for international cooperation, we also continued our project
for the economical, environmentally friendly and socially
responsible production of coconut oil in the Philippines. Our
goal is to d
­ evelop and implement sustainability standards
for the certification and production of this oil. As a member
of the Roundtable on S
­ ustainable Palm Oil, BASF is involved
in projects which include the conservation of biodiversity in
the cultivation of palm oil. By 2015, we aim to use palm and
palm kernel oil only from agriculture certified according to
sustainability criteria.

Mineral raw materials
We investigate the origins of the minerals we use to see if they
come from conflict mines, and reserve the right to conduct an
external audit; we also reserve the right to, if necessary,
­terminate our business relationship with that supplier. Through
a standardized questionnaire, new suppliers must disclose
to us in advance if their products contain conflict minerals.
Our ­suppliers have conﬁrmed to us that they do not source
their minerals from the Democratic Republic of Congo or its
neighboring countries.

Preserving ecosystems
▪▪ Our production sites reviewed for proximity
to internationally protected areas
▪▪ MAQS® Beehive Strip launched in key European
­markets
Biodiversity forms the foundation of ecosystem services.
Internationally protected areas play a critical role in maintaining biodiversity around the world. This is why, in 2014, we
once again investigated our production sites to discover
which are located near internationally protected areas: 2% of
our production sites (excluding Oil & Gas) are adjacent to a
Ramsar Site and 1% to a Category I, II or III protected area of
the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
None of our production sites are adjacent to a UNESCO
protected area. We did not discover any impact of our activities on biodiversity in these areas in 2014.
Moreover, we develop products that contribute to the
­preservation of biodiversity. For example, together with our
Canadian partner NOD Apiary Products, we launched the
MAQS® Beehive Strip in numerous key markets in Europe in
2014. These strips offer honeybees protection from the varroa
mite, which is considered the greatest threat to bee health.

Strategy
▪▪ Updated process safety strategy
▪▪ Review of management system for process
safety ­intensified in all regions
▪▪ Further standardization of safety review
documentation
BASF’s Responsible Care Management System comprises
the global rules, standards and procedures for environmental
and health protection, safety and security for the various
stations along our value chain. Our regulations cover the
­
transportation of raw materials, activities at our sites and
warehouses, and distribution of our products as well as our
customers’ application of the products. At our sites, we
­address energy and climate protection as one of the topics
covered by our energy management. Speciﬁcations for implementing these measures are laid out in binding directives that
are introduced in consultation with employee representatives.
These describe the relevant responsibilities, requirements and
assessment methods. We regularly conduct audits to monitor
our performance and progress, and apply the ﬁndings for our
continual improvement.
We set ourselves ambitious goals for environmental and
health protection, safety and security. Our guidelines and
­requirements are constantly updated. In 2014, for example,
we updated our safety strategies for the continual improvement of process safety and intensified management system
reviews in all regions. We also standardized the reporting of
safety reviews through the use of a software program.
We assess risks in all areas ranging from research and
production to logistics, and how these could affect the
­environment, the surrounding community or the safety and
security of our employees. In our databases, we document
accidents, near­misses and safety-­related incidents at our
sites as well as along our transportation routes. We foster
awareness of workplace safety and safe behavior in every
indi­vidual with our worldwide safety initiatives.

Audits
▪▪ Short-notice audits conducted at 28 sites
Regular audits help ensure that standards are met for environmental and health protection, safety and security. We carry
out audits at BASF sites and at companies in which BASF is
a majority shareholder. We have defined our regulations for
Responsible Care audits in a global Group directive. During
our audits, we create an environmental, safety and security
proﬁle that shows if our performance is sufﬁcient to properly
address the existing hazard potential. If this is not the case,
we agree on measures and conduct follow-up audits on their
implementation soon afterward. One result of the audits
showed the necessity of swiftly implementing new guidelines
and processes, for example.
Our internal audit system complies with the standards for
external auditing procedures ISO 19011 and OHSAS 18001.
Worldwide, 191 BASF production sites are certified in accordance with ISO 14001 (2013: 200). We conducted shortnotice audits on various topics worldwide in 2014, which
included facility i­nspections and document reviews. In 2014,
121 environmental, safety and security audits were carried
out at 88 sites, along with 73 short-notice audits. We audited
48 sites with respect to occupational medicine and health
protection.

Our regulations and measures for transportation and
warehouse safety cover the delivery of raw materials, the
storage and distribution of chemical products among
BASF sites and customers, and the transportation of
waste from our sites to the disposal facilities.

Strategy
▪▪ Revised Group directive for transportation safety
▪▪ Updated process descriptions for classification of
hazardous materials
We applied the experiences of past years to update our
Group directive for transportation safety in 2014. This i­ncluded
specifying responsibilities within our worldwide network and
ensuring consistent standards. We also revised process
descrip­tions for classification and product clearance in accordance with dangerous goods regulations. In doing so, we
ensure that chemical products are classified according to
globally uniform standards in line with transportation law, and
are cleared for their various modes of transport.
In 2014, we nearly achieved our goal of reducing the
number of transportation accidents worldwide by 70%, or to
0.17 per 10,000 shipments, between 2003 and 2020 (0.20
accidents, which represents a reduction of 64.3%). At 35, the
absolute number of transportation accidents was at a very

Accident prevention and assistance
▪▪ Audits conducted for safety in container s
­ hipping
▪▪ Risk assessment guideline implemented
We stipulate worldwide requirements for our logistics service
providers and assess them in terms of safety and quality. In
2014, we evaluated around 600 companies in all regions. Our
experts use our own evaluation and monitoring tools as well
as internationally approved schemes.
We audited large-scale warehouses at our two European
Verbund sites in 2014 to increase safety in container shipping,
focusing on container loading and the accompanying documents.
We evaluate the risks in transporting raw materials with
high hazard potential: To further push uniform transportation
safety standards in the chemical industry, we worked with the
European Chemical Industry Council, CEFIC, to develop a
guideline for conducting risk assessments in 2013. We implemented this guideline worldwide in 2014. Based on it, risk
assessments were conducted for naphtha in China, acrylic
acid in Thailand and butyl acrylate in Brazil. More than 1,000
employees at our three European sites in Antwerp, Belgium,
and Schwarzheide and Ludwigshafen, Germany, took part in
our practical dangerous goods training using walk-in tank
wagons and tank containers.
Furthermore, we raised our supply chain safety standards
even higher in 2014. We specified measures for the dangerous goods inspections performed in our logistics processes.
The new process description based on this is initially valid
throughout Europe, and will be subsequently carried over to
the other regions.

Activities in external networks
We are actively involved in external networks that quickly
provide information and assistance in emergencies. These
include the International Chemical Environmental (ICE) initiative and the German Transport Accident Information and
Emergency Response System (TUIS), in which BASF plays a
coordinating role. In 2014, we provided assistance to other
companies in around 200 cases worldwide. We apply the
experience we have gathered to set up similar systems in
other countries: In 2014, we provided support in the form of
tutorials and seminars, for example.

We never compromise on safety. For occupational safety
and health protection, we rely on comprehensive preventive measures in addition to the involvement of all
­employees and contractors. Our global safety and security concepts serve to protect our employees, contractors
and neighbors as well as to prevent property damage and
protect information and company assets. In this way, we
help prevent production outages and damage to the
­environment.

In 2014, 1.5 work-related accidents per million working hours
occurred at BASF sites worldwide (2013: 1.4), of which 5%
were related to chemicals. Compared with baseline 2002, the
lost­-time injury rate declined by 54.5%. We want to achieve
further reductions by constantly strengthening our safety culture. There were 1.8 work-related accidents per million working
hours for contractors in 2014 (2013: 2.1). We recorded no fatal
work-related accidents in 2014.

Global goals

Lost-time injuries per million working hours

We have set ourselves ambitious goals for occupational
­safety and health protection. By 2020, we want to reduce the
number of work-related accidents per million working hours
by 80% to 0.65 work-related accidents compared with baseline 2002. We measure our performance in health protection
using the Health Performance Index (HPI). The HPI comprises
ﬁve components: conﬁrmed occupational diseases, medical
emergency drills, ﬁrst aid training, preventive medicine and
health promotion1.

▪▪ Employees receive training worldwide on improving
skills in safe behavior
In order to achieve our ambitious goal for occupational
safety, we particularly rely on the commitment of our employees and on clearly deﬁned safety rules. In 2014, approxi­mately
75,000 employees and contractors at around 300 sites
actively participated in our worldwide safety initiatives.
We especially promote safe conduct through our systematic risk assessments, seminars and worldwide safety standards, and we regularly audit their implementation. ­Beyond
legally prescribed safety instructions, we provided more than
49,000 employees around the world with intensive training on
the topic of occupational safety in 2014. This included further
training for around 14,000 employees at our “Safety Champions Training Center” at the Ludwigshafen site in order to boost
safety-conscious behavior and prevent work-related accidents.

▪▪ 2014 focuses on back health
▪▪ Regular health promotion programs offered to
­employees
Our global health management serves to promote and maintain the health and productivity of our employees. This was
supported by numerous emergency drills and health promotion measures in 2014. Worldwide standards for occupational
medicine and health protection within BASF are speciﬁed in a
directive that is implemented by a global network of experts.
We regularly conduct occupational medical audits to monitor
our performance.
With a Health Performance Index of 0.91, we were able to
fulﬁll the ambitious goal of exceeding 0.9 each year (2013:
0.89). Our 2014 global employee health campaign centered
on maintaining a healthy back. In 2015, the focus will be on
good nutrition. We raise employee awareness of these topics
through offers tailored toward specific target groups.
The BASF health checks introduced in 2013 form the
foundation of our global health promotion program and are
offered to employees at regular intervals.
For more on occupational medicine, health promotion campaigns and
the HPI, see basf.com/health_protection

Each component contributes a maximum of 0.2 to the total score. The highest possible score is 1.0. Our goal is to reach a value of more than 0.9 every year.

Process safety

Hazard prevention and corporate security

▪▪ Safety concepts updated and improved
▪▪ Global requirements introduced for explosion
­protection

▪▪ Requirements defined for emergency response and
fire prevention
▪▪ SPIDER Emergency Response and Information
Center Verbund implemented in Europe

When designing a new facility, we focus on prevention and
apply a ﬁve-step review system from conception to startup.
It involves early consideration of the most important aspects
of safety and protection of health and the environment,
and monitors these in every stage of planning. We use a risk
matrix to assess the estimated probability and potential
­
impact of risks, and stipulate appropriate protective mea­
sures.
In order to constantly improve the safety of our production facilities worldwide, we are continuing to update the
safety concepts in all of our plants. We review their implementation in ten-year intervals in plants with a medium to high
hazard potential. In 2014, we used software to standardize
the documentation of safety reviews. Moreover, we further
intensified the supervision of the process safety management
system in all regions. In order to further improve explosion
protection in our production plants, we introduced a
global requirement in 2014. We enhanced our training
measures for process safety in 2014 and instructed more
than 11,000 employ­ees worldwide.
Since 2008, we have used the number of process safety
incidents as a key indicator, using the definition set by the
European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC). This KPI comprises fire, explosions and the release of substances. In 2014,
this KPI was at 2.1 incidents per million working hours. We
perform a detailed investigation into every incident, analyze
the root causes and use the findings to further optimize our
process safety.
We continue to take part in a working group of the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA) for the
­development of a globally standardized KPI system for process safety.
For more on process safety, see basf.com/process_safety

In order to ensure uniformly high standards around the world
for safety and security, health and environmental protection,
we stipulated requirements for emergency response planning
and fire prevention in the BASF Group in 2014. We are prepared for potential incidents in our production plants with
speciﬁc emergency response plans that involve, depending
on the situation, partners and suppliers as well as cities,
communities and neighboring companies.
We regularly check our emergency systems and drill
procedures with employees, contractors and local authorities.
In 2014, we implemented our SPIDER Emergency Response
and Information Center Verbund in Europe, which enables
experts from the site fire department, emergency medical
­
team, site security and environmental protection around
Europe to work together even more quickly and reliably across
different sites. Our central emergency response supports
local emergency ­response units around the world and around
the clock.
We audit and review how measures are implemented
for the comprehensive protection of our employees and
the company – for example, from loss of knowledge – as well
as for the worldwide protection of our sites against thirdparty interference. All of our security personnel have been
instructed on aspects of human rights related to site security,
such as the right to liberty and security of person. We also
require all c
­ ontractors involved in this area to comply with
human rights and we conduct regular inspections. Investment projects are analyzed for potential risks in planned
production facilities and for the safety, security and health
of our employees. Business travelers, transferees, and local
employees in countries with e
­levated security risks are
informed about appropriate protection measures and indi
­
vidu­ally counseled where necessary.
In 2014, we built up our worldwide network of information
protection officers to more than 600. They carry out our
globally mandatory requirements and conduct seminars on
safety-conscious behavior. In addition, more than 2,800
employ­ees took part in information protection training measures in 2014.

Global goals
By 2020, we will conduct risk assessments for all substances
and mixtures BASF sells worldwide in quantities of more than
one metric ton per year. We already reached 61.4% of this
goal in 2014 (2013: 56%). The risk associated with using a
­substance is determined by the combination of its hazardous
properties and its potential exposure to people and the
­environment.

2020 Goals
We ensure uniformly high standards for product stewardship
worldwide and our voluntary initiatives go beyond legal
­requirements. We monitor the implementation of our guidelines with regular audits.
We provide extensive information on our chemical sales
products to our customers and the public with safety data
sheets in more than 30 languages. This is achieved with the
help of a global database in which we maintain and evaluate
continuously updated environmental, health and safety data
for our substances and products. Our global emergency
­hotline network provides information around the clock.
We offer our customers training in the safe use of our
products and keep them informed early on of any changes in
regulations. For example, a new E.U. directive requires
­customers to mark their products with additional warnings for
allergy sufferers starting in 2015. We assist them by providing
comprehensive information so that our customers can fulfill
these additional obligations. With an eye on consumer protection criteria, we also work continuously with our customers
on the optimization of our products. Furthermore, we use our
Eco-Efﬁciency Analysis to advise our c
­ ustomers on the evaluation of product risks and support them in improving the
carbon footprint of their products.
With our global goals for risk assessment, we are supporting the implementation of initiatives such as the Global
Product Strategy (GPS) of the International Council of Chemi­
cal Associations (ICCA). GPS is establishing worldwide standards and best practices to improve the safe management of
chemical substances. In addition, we are also involved in
workshops and training seminars in developing countries and
emerging markets. In 2014, for example, we conducted training sessions for chemical industry representatives on GPS in
China, Ghana, India, Russia and Thailand. In order to facilitate
public access to information, we are participating in the setup
of an ICCA online portal that provides more than 4,100 GPS
safety summaries.

After completing the second registration phase in 2013, we
are now working continually on registering substances
­produced in volumes between one and one hundred metric
tons per year for the third registration deadline of the E.U.
chemicals regulation, REACH. We expect to be done by
2018. At the same time, we also constantly update the
­existing registration dossiers and support the relevant E.U.
member state authorities in evaluating an increasing number
of substances. When it comes to REACH, we maintain close
contact with our customers and suppliers.
Another contribution BASF makes to international
­chemical safety is through our support of the United Nations’

Ecological and toxicological testing

Management of new technologies

▪▪ Use of alternative and complementary methods for
animal studies

▪▪ Continual safety research on nano- and
­biotechnology

Before launching products on the market, we subject them to
a variety of ecological and toxicological testing. We apply
state-of-the-art knowledge in the research and development
of our products. We only conduct animal studies when they
are required by law. In some cases, animal studies are stipulated by REACH and other national legislation outside the
European Union in order to obtain more information on the
properties and effects of chemical products.
We adhere to the speciﬁcations laid down by the German
Animal Welfare Act as well as the requirements of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care – the highest standard for laboratory animals in the
world. We are continually developing and optimizing alternative and complementary methods, and put these into practice
whenever possible and accepted by the authorities. BASF
spent €2.8 million for this purpose in 2014. We use alternative
and complementary methods in more than a third of our tests.
Currently, 27 alternative methods are being used in our labs
and another 16 are in the development stage. One focus area
of our research in 2014 and subsequent years is the development of alternative methods for testing the potential of
substances that negatively affect organisms’ growth and
­
­development.
Furthermore, our “Experimental Toxicology and Ecotoxicology” department became a member of the European
Union Network of Laboratories for the Validation of Alternative
Methods (EU-NETVAL) in 2014.

New technologies such as nanotechnology or biotechnology
offer solutions for key societal challenges – for example, in the
areas of climate protection or health and nutrition.
We developed a “Nanotechnology Code of Conduct” that
stipulates the safe handling of nanomaterials. We are
­constantly expanding our knowledge of nanomaterial safety.
Over the past years, we have conducted more than 180 toxicological and ecotoxicological studies and participated in
around 30 different projects related to the safety of nanomaterials. We published the results in 66 scientiﬁc articles. One
important finding is that toxicity is determined not by the size
of the particles but by the intrinsic properties of the substance.
Since 2014, we have been developing a strategy for the
targeted study and classification of nanomaterials within the
framework of the European Centre for Ecotoxicology and
Toxicology of Chemicals (ECETOC). Based on the results of
our investigations into nanomaterial safety, we have proposed
a tiered approach for testing and evaluating nanomaterials
for REACH. We are working with the European Chemicals
­Agency (ECHA), the OECD and national authorities on its
­further development.
In the use of biotechnology, we follow the code of conduct
of EuropaBio, the European association for biotechnology
­industries. We constantly improve our product safety activities
in the ﬁeld of biotechnology in order to effectively minimize
potential risks and ensure that all standards and national laws
are met. Our internal risk management is based on the
­protection of people, animals and the environment. We implemented a scorecard system to monitor the risks of working
with biotechnology. It ensures compliance with standards and
transparent processes at BASF.

We offer our customers solutions that help prevent greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efﬁciency. About a
third of our total annual research spending goes toward the
development of these products and the optimization of our
processes.
Our climate protection activities are based on compre­
hensive emissions controlling. We report on greenhouse
gas emissions in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas
Protocol Standard, as well as the sector-speciﬁc standard for
the chemical industry. According to CDP, an international
organization that analyzes companies’ climate protection
data, BASF is among the top companies in the world in terms
of transparency and completeness in climate protection
reporting. In ­reporting to CDP, our experts perform an annual
analysis of the opportunities and risks that climate change
poses for BASF.
For more on climate protection, see basf.com/climate_protection

We want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our production and along the entire value chain. We have thoroughly
analyzed the greenhouse gas emissions from our production
in the past few years and implemented comprehensive reduction measures. This is how, for example, we have been able
to reduce nitrous oxide emissions by 95% since 1997.
To supply our production sites with energy, we rely on
highly efficient combined heat and power plants with gas and
steam turbines and the use of heat released by production
processes. Comparisons with European emissions trading
benchmarks show that our greenhouse gas-intensive chemical plants also operate at above-average efficiency. Around
50% of BASF Group emissions in 2014 resulted from steam
and electricity generation in our power plants as well as in our
energy suppliers’ power plants.
Our success also depends on the long-term security and
competitiveness of our energy supplies. Furthermore, we are
committed to energy management that helps us analyze and
continue to improve the energy efﬁciency of our plants. In
2014, we were able to finalize the DIN EN ISO 50001 certification of our energy management systems at BASF SE as
well as the great majority of German production sites. Moreover, our site in Tarragona, Spain, and our four sites in South
Korea also received this certification.

Energy supply and efficiency
▪▪ Verbund system as important component of our
­energy efficiency strategy
▪▪ Research projects initiated on use of renewable
energy sources
Gas and steam turbines in our combined heat and p
­ ower
plants enable us to fulfill around 70% of the electricity ­demand
of the BASF Group. Compared with separate methods of
generating steam and electricity, we saved 11.8 million MWh
of fossil fuels and prevented 2.4 million metric tons of carbon
emissions in 2014. The Verbund system is an important
­component of our energy efﬁciency strategy: Waste heat from
one plant’s production process is used as energy in other
plants. In this way, we saved around 17.9 million MWh in
2014, which corresponds to a savings of 3.6 million metric
tons’ worth of carbon emissions. With combined power and
steam generation as well as our continuously enhanced
­Energy Verbund, we were thus able to prevent 6 million metric
tons of carbon emissions in 2014.
We were able to further optimize the resource and energy
consumption of our production in numerous projects around
the world in 2014. Various process improvements led to
steam and electricity savings. We further intensified heat
­integration so that usable heat from production processes is
not released into the environment, but instead provides
energy to the plants. For example, we increased energy
­
­efficiency for our butadiene and ethylene oxide facilities in
Ludwigshafen by optimizing the plant control systems.
We also rely on locally available energy sources for the
supply of energy at our sites. Especially in the growing Asian
market, we and our energy suppliers must make use of coal
as an energy source to a certain extent, since the more
­climate-friendly natural gas is not available in sufﬁcient quantities at competitive prices.

36.8 million MWh

We are exploring the use of renewable energies. These can
only become a permanent part of our energy mix if they are
competitive in terms of supply security and cost. With
numerous research projects, we contribute to increasing
­
the e
­ fficiency of technologies for the use of renewable energy
sources. For example, Deutsche Nanoschicht GmbH – a
100% subsidiary of BASF – has developed an innovative
method for producing high-temperature superconductors in
a more efficient and environmentally friendly manner. In
cooperation with the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,­­
­
high-temperature superconductors are to be optimized for
various applications in energy technology.

Corporate carbon footprint and climate
­protection products
▪▪ Reporting on greenhouse gas emissions along the
entire value chain
▪▪ Customers’ use of climate protection products sold
in 2014 avoids 520 million metric tons of carbon
equivalents
BASF has been publishing a comprehensive corporate c
­ arbon
footprint since as early as 2008. This reports on all emissions
along the value chain and shows the volume of emissions
prevented through the use of our climate protection products.
We plan our climate protection activities along the value chain
based on our corporate carbon footprint. In 2014, for
­example, we implemented a technical improvement in our
steel drums together with one of our packaging material
­suppliers. This reduced the amount of raw materials needed
for production and decreased the emission of greenhouse
gases.
Through various measures to reduce our raw material
require­ments, the emission of greenhouse gases associated
with producing these raw materials was decreased by a total
of around 100,000 metric tons in 2014.
We reevaluated our product portfolio in terms of sustainability considerations in 2014. This included identifying solutions whose application makes a positive contribution in
terms of climate protection and energy. Dubbed “Accelerator”
products, these are what we focus on when referring to
­climate protection products. One example is synthetic sodium
nitrate, used as a heat transfer medium in solar thermal ­power
plants. This product is used instead of thermal oils. It increases the operating temperature, and with that, electricity yield.

An analysis of 24 climate protection product groups revealed
that customers’ use of products sold in 2014 avoids 520 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents. The calculation of avoided
greenhouse gas emissions was based on the new chemical
industry standard of the ICCA and the World Business C
­ ouncil
for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). Every product makes
an individual contribution in the value chain. Value chains are
assessed in terms of BASF’s economic share of the respective climate protection product. On average, 11% of the
emissions avoided were attributable to BASF in 2014.

Water is a fundamental component in our production. We
use water as a coolant, solvent and cleaning agent, as

for Access to Safe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene at the
Workplace at the end of 2013.

Strategy

▪▪ Reduction of emissions to water
▪▪ High standards, especially for water stress areas

▪▪ BASF products contribute to sustainable water
­management
We aim to use water as sparingly as possible and further
­reduce emissions to water. To do so, we have set out a Group
directive with globally applicable standards. We are exploring
measures for implementing sustainable water management,
especially at production sites in water stress areas. One of our
aims here is to identify savings potential in order to use as little
water as possible, particularly in water stress areas.
We offer our customers solutions that help purify water,
use it more efficiently and reduce pollution. Our water solution
products such as inge® ultrafiltration technology and the
Sokalan® product line make a major contribution to sustainability. In Accra, Ghana, these products were used in the
construction of a desalination plant that can generate up
to 60,000 cubic meters of drinking water per day – enough to
supply half a million people. A future desalination plant in
Jamnagar, India, will feature inge®’s T-Rack® 3.0 ultrafiltration
modules. This will supply one of the largest refinery com­
plexes in the country with up to 170,000 cubic meters of
­purified process water per day.
In order to ensure transparency in our reporting on water,
we once again took part in CDP reporting in 2014. We
consider all aspects of the topic of water, including societal

Global goals

We have set ourselves the goal of reducing emissions to
­water of organic substances and nitrogen by 80% by 2020
compared with baseline 2002; we want to reduce emissions
of heavy metals by 60%.
By 2020, we aim to reduce the withdrawal of drinking
water from supply sources for production by half compared
with baseline 2010. In 2014, we were able to reduce this
amount by 26.3% (2013: 25.3%).
In 2014, we achieved 29.7% of our goal to establish sustainable water management at all sites in water stress areas
by 2020. We pursue this by applying the European Water
Stewardship (EWS) standard. After introducing the standard
at our European sites in 2013, we began its implementation in
North America and China in 2014. We have also introduced
the EWS standard at the Ludwigshafen site, even though it is
not located in a water stress area. An external audit awarded
us gold-level certiﬁcation in 2014 for our water management
and extensive application of the EWS standard in Ludwigshafen and at the p
­ roduction site in Tarragona, Spain. In
total, around 22% of our production sites were located in
water stress areas in 2014. Around 6.5% of total water used
by BASF was a
­ bstracted from these areas, of which 85.2%
was seawater.

Fewer emissions
We want to reduce emissions to water of organic substances
and nitrogen by 80% and of heavy metals by 60% compared
with baseline 2002.
BASF operations excluding Oil & Gas

Our wastewater is treated through different methods depending on the type and degree of contamination – including
biological processes, oxidation, membrane technologies,
­
precipitation or adsorption.
To avoid unanticipated emissions, we will review our water
protection concepts at all production sites by the end of
2015. At our sites in Ludwigshafen, Germany, and Geismar,
Louisiana, we expanded online wastewater monitoring in
­order to detect unanticipated emissions at an even earlier
stage. These new monitoring systems allow us to track and
analyze relevant pollutants even more quickly and reliably,
and to take measures if necessary. We were also able to further optimize the performance of the wastewater treatment
facilities at our Kuantan site in Malaysia.

Water use
Further reduction of emissions
▪▪ Using water responsibly
▪▪ Goal achieved to reduce emissions to water
Around 194 million cubic meters of wastewater were discharged
from BASF production sites in 2014 (2013: 192 million cubic
meters). At 3,200 metric tons (2013: 2,900 metric tons), emissions of nitrogen to water were reduced by 85.4% compared
with 2002. Around 18,700 metric tons of organic substances
were emitted in wastewater (2013: 19,700 metric tons), representing a reduction of 79.5% since 2002. Our wastewater
contained 21.5 metric tons of heavy metals (2013: 21.9 metric
tons), representing a worldwide reduction of 64.8% compared
with 2002. Phosphorus emissions amounted to 341 metric tons
(2013: 339 metric tons). This means we have achieved our goal
of reducing emissions to water.

We recirculate water as much as it is feasible in order to withdraw less from supply sources. Our larger sites have recooling
plants that allow water to be reused several times and that
reduce the temperature of used cooling water before it is
­discharged back into a body of water. To protect the Rhine
River, we have committed to the step-by-step reduction of
heat input from the Ludwigshafen site when set temperature
limits are exceeded, for example as a result of long heat waves
or low river levels.
The supply, treatment, transportation and recooling of
water is associated with a high energy demand. We employ
various means in our efforts to keep this as low as possible.

Production

We want to further reduce emissions to air from our production, protect the soil and prevent waste. We have set
ourselves standards for doing so in a global directive. If
no recovery options are available, we dispose of waste in
a correct and environmentally responsible manner.

Strategy
▪▪ Raw Material Verbund helps prevent and reduce
waste
▪▪ Professional disposal of hazardous waste
Regular monitoring of our emissions to air is a part of environmental management at BASF. Aside from greenhouse gases,
we also measure emissions of other pollutants into the atmosphere. Our reporting does not take into account air pollutant
emissions from oil and gas operations due to their substantial
ﬂuctuation during exploration phases.
Our Raw Material Verbund helps us prevent and reduce
waste. We regularly carry out audits to inspect external waste
management companies, ensuring that our hazardous waste
is properly disposed of.

Emissions to air
▪▪ Further reduction of emissions
By 2020, we aim to decrease absolute emissions of air pollutants from our chemical plants worldwide by 70% in comparison
with baseline 2002. In 2014, this reduction was at 63.2%, to
31,505 metric tons (2013: 32,385 metric tons). Emissions of
ozone-depleting substances as deﬁned by the Montreal Protocol totaled 36 metric tons in 2014 (2013: 28 metric tons).
Emissions of heavy metals totaled 4 metric tons (2013:
4 metric tons).
We were able to considerably reduce our emissions of
nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) in 2014.
This was largely thanks to the increased use of a solvent
recovery plant at our site in Australia, through which around
550 metric tons of emissions can be avoided every year.
In addition, we have, for example, replaced 30 oldermodel locomotives with a new fleet of diesel locomotives at
our sites in Ludwigshafen and Schwarzheide in Germany, and
in Antwerp, Belgium, since 2014. The modern locomotives
increase productivity and reduce emissions to air, further
avoiding 300 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year.

Management of waste and contaminated sites
▪▪ Reduction of total waste volume
▪▪ New database being set up for contaminated sites
We regularly explore possibilities for preventing waste. If
waste is unavoidable, we perform an analysis for recycling or
energy recovery. Total waste volume decreased by 16% in
2014. This was largely attributable to more detailed assessment of waste streams as well as to the reduction in mineral
waste from construction activities.
We develop remediation solutions in order to balance
costs, nature conservation, climate protection concerns, legal
requirements and transportation volumes. After stipulating
global standards for contaminated site management in 2013,
we began working on a database in 2014 containing the most
significant sites. Current reme­diation measures around the
world continued to run on schedule in 2014 and planning was
concluded on future landfill remediation projects.

The goal of BASF’s risk management is to identify and
evaluate opportunities and risks as early as possible and
to take appropriate measures in order to seize opportunities and limit business losses. The aim here is to avoid
risks that pose a threat to BASF’s continued existence
and to make improved managerial decisions to create
lasting value. We understand risk to be any event that can
negatively impact the achievement of our short-term
operational or long-term strategic goals. We define

In order to effectively measure and manage identiﬁed opportunities and risks, we quantify these in terms of probability
and economic impact in the event they occur. We use statistical methods to aggregate opportunities and risks into risk
factors. This way, we achieve an overall view of opportunities
and risks at a portfolio level, allowing us to take effective
measures for risk management.

▪▪ Significant risks arise from overall economic
developments and volatility in exchange rates

▪▪ No threat to continued existence of BASF

Other ﬁnancial opportunities and risks

We expect the global economy to continue to grow in the
next two years. We see significant risks in a considerable
slowdown of the Chinese economy that would result from a
potential real estate market crisis. Such a development
would negatively impact international trade, lower consumer
and investor confidence and majorly dampen global eco­
nomic growth. Any escalation of geopolitical conflicts,
especially that in Ukraine, also poses risks to the global
­economy. Impor­tant opportunities and risks for our earnings
are also associated with uncertainty regarding growth in
Europe, the development of key customer industries, and
­
volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and margins.

Risk management process
▪▪ Integrated process for identification, assessment

▪▪ Decentralized management of speciﬁc opportunities
and risks
▪▪ Aggregation at a Group level
The BASF Group’s risk management process is based on the
international risk management standard COSO II Enterprise
Risk Management – Integrated Framework (2004), and has
the following key features:
Organization and responsibility
––Risk management is the responsibility of the Board of
­Executive Directors, which also determines the processes
for approving investments, acquisitions and divestitures.
––The Board of Executive Directors is supported by the corporate units Finance, Corporate Controlling, Strategic
Planning & Controlling and Legal, Taxes & Insurance, as well
as the Chief Compliance Officer. They coordinate the risk
management process at a Group level and provide the
structure and appropriate methodology. Opportunity and
risk management is thus integrated in the strategy, planning
and budgeting processes.
––A network of risk managers in the business and central units
advances the implementation of appropriate risk management practices in daily operations.
––The management of specific opportunities and risks is
largely delegated to the business units and is steered at a
local level. Risks relating to exchange rates and raw mate­
rial prices are an exception. In this case, there is an initial
consolidation at a Group-wide level before derivative hedging instruments, for example, are used.
––The internal auditing unit (Corporate Audit) is responsible for
regularly auditing the risk management system established

by the Board of Executive Directors in accordance with
Section 91(2) of the German Stock Corporation Act. Furthermore, as part of its monitoring of the Board of Executive
Directors, the Supervisory Board considers the effectiveness of the risk management system. Our external auditor
evaluates the establishment and suitability of an early
­detection system for risks.
Instruments
––The Risk Management Process Manual, applicable throughout the Group, forms the framework for risk management
and is implemented by the business units according to their
particular business conditions.
––A catalog of opportunity and risk categories helps to iden­tify
all relevant opportunities and risks as comprehensively as
possible.
––We use standardized evaluation and reporting tools for the
identiﬁcation and assessment of risks. The aggregation of
opportunities, risks and sensitivities at the business and
Group level using a Monte Carlo simulation helps us to
identify effects and trends across the company.
––Company management is informed about operational
­opportunities and risks (observation period of up to one
year) in the monthly management report produced by the
Corporate Controlling unit. In addition, the corporate units
Corporate Controlling and Finance provide information
twice a year about the aggregated opportunity/risk exposure of the BASF Group. Furthermore, if a new individual
risk is identified which has a more than €10 million impact
on earnings or which bears reputational risks, it must be
immediately reported.
––As part of our strategy development, the Strategic Planning
unit conducts strategic opportunity/risk analyses with a
­ten-year assessment period. These analyses are annually
reviewed as part of strategic controlling and are adapted if
necessary.

Signiﬁcant features of the internal control and
risk management system with regard to the
Group ﬁnancial reporting process
▪▪ Conducted in accordance with standardized
Group guidelines
▪▪ Segregation of duties, four-eyes principle and
clearly r­ egulated access rights
▪▪ Annual evaluation of the control environment and
­relevant processes at significant companies and
­divisions
The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared by a unit
in the corporate division Finance. BASF Group’s accounting
process is based on a uniform accounting guideline that sets
out accounting policies and the signiﬁcant processes and
deadlines on a Group-wide basis. There are binding directives
for the internal reconciliations and other accounting operations. Standard software is used to carry out the accounting
processes for the preparation of the individual financial statements as well as for the Consolidated Financial Statements.
There are clear rules for the access rights of each participant
in these processes.
Employees involved in the accounting and reporting
­process meet the qualitative requirements and participate in
training on a regular basis. There is a clear assignment of
­responsibilities between the specialist units, companies and
regional service units involved. We strictly adhere to the
­segregation of duties and the four-eyes principle. Complex
actuarial reports and evaluations are produced by specialized
service providers or specially qualified employees.
Our internal control system for ﬁnancial reporting continuously monitors these principles. To this end, methods are
provided for the structured and Group-wide uniform evaluation of the internal control system in ﬁnancial reporting.
The signiﬁcant risks for the BASF Group regarding a reliable control environment and proper ﬁnancial reporting are
reviewed and updated on an annual basis. Risks are compiled
into a standardized questionnaire and presented in a central
risk catalog.

Management’s Report
Forecast — Opportunities and risks report﻿

A centralized selection process identifies companies and
units that are exposed to particular risks, that have a mate­rial
­impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the BASF
Group, or that provide service processes. The selection process is conducted annually. In the relevant companies and
units, one person is given the responsibility of monitoring the
execution of the annual evaluation process.
This process consists of the following steps:
– Evaluation of the control environment
The adherence to internal and external guidelines that are
relevant for the maintenance of a reliable control environment
is checked by means of a standardized questionnaire. This is
supported by sample taking.
– Identiﬁcation and documentation of control activities
In order to mitigate the risks to the financial reporting process
listed in our central risk catalog, corresponding control activities are conducted and documented.
– Assessment of the control activities
After documentation, a test is performed to verify whether the
described controls are capable of adequately mitigating the
risks. In the subsequent test phase, samples are taken to test
whether, in practice, the controls were executed as described
and whether they were effective.
– Monitoring of control weaknesses
The managers responsible receive reports on any control
weaknesses identified and their resolution, and an interdisciplinary committee investigates their relevance for the BASF
Group. The Board of Executive Directors and the Audit Committee are informed once control weaknesses have been
identiﬁed that have a considerable impact on the ﬁnancial
­reporting.
– Internal conﬁrmation of the internal control system
The managing director and chief ﬁnancial ofﬁcer responsible
for each consolidated Group company conﬁrm to the Board
of Executive Directors of BASF SE at the end of the annual
cycle the effectiveness of the internal control system with
­regard to accounting as well as the accuracy and reliability of

Short-term opportunities and risks
Development of demand
▪▪ Development of our sales markets among greatest
opportunity and risk factors
▪▪ Negative impact from economic slowdown in China
and escalation of geopolitical conflicts possible
The development of our sales markets is one of the strongest
drivers of opportunities and risks. More details on our
assump­tions regarding short-term growth rates for the global
economy, regions and key customer industries, such as the
chemicals, automotive and construction sectors, can be
found from pages 119 to 121. In accordance with this baseline scenario, we are planning to achieve volume growth in our
chemicals business in all segments.
In addition to the baseline scenario, we also consider risk
scenarios. We see a significant macroeconomic risk in a
sharper deceleration of China’s economic growth, which
could result from an abatement in the Chinese real estate
market. This would ­impact the construction industry and its
suppliers, like the concrete, steel and chemical industries, in
addition to real estate services and the finance sector. Such
dampening ­effects would impair not only China’s domes­tic
economy, but also chemical industry imports and customer
industries. Furthermore, increasing economic uncer­
tainty
would lead to lower consumer and investor confidence. We
also see risks to the global economy in the further escalation
of geopolitical conflicts, especially in Ukraine.
In these risk scenarios, a demand-related decrease in the
price of oil would be expected, in comparison with our baseline scenario. The euro would slightly depreciate relative to the
dollar, since economic recovery in the eurozone is fragile and
largely dependent on the development of export demand.
This makes it especially sensitive to changes in the global
economic environment.
Weather-related inﬂuences can result in positive or negative ­effects on our crop protection business.
Margin volatility
▪▪ Oversupply with resulting lower margins possible in
some value chains
▪▪ Lower raw material costs result in opportunities and
risks
We mostly anticipate stable margins in 2015. For some products and value chains, it is possible that margin pressure
could be increased by new capacities, for example. This
would have a negative effect on our earnings.

BASF Report 2014

The year’s average oil price for Brent crude was around $99
per barrel in 2014, lower than in the previous year. For 2015,
we anticipate an average oil price of between $60 and $70
per barrel. We therefore expect a low price level for the raw
materials and petrochemical basic products that are impor­
tant to our business. This could positively affect our margins;
however, it would also pose risks for our oil and gas business,
whose earnings dip by approximately €20 million for every $1
decrease in the a
­ verage annual barrel price of Brent crude.
Regulation and political risks
▪▪ Risks posed by factors such as regulation of
­chemicals use
▪▪ Intensiﬁcation of geopolitical tensions
▪▪ Opportunities for our catalysts business from
­tightening automobile emissions regulations
▪▪ Energy policy gives rise to both risks and
­opportunities
Due to the European chemicals regulation REACH, which
came into force in 2007, BASF and our European customers
face the risk of being placed at a disadvantage to our non-­
European competitors due to the cost-intensive test and
registration procedures.
Other risks for us include further regulation, for example,
of the use of chemicals; the intensiﬁcation of geopolitical
tensions; the destabilization of political systems; and the
imposition of trade barriers, such as sanctions in Ukraine
­
­crisis or OPEC quotas for oil production. Moreover, we are
closely observing the political situation in Argentina, where
foreign exchange restrictions are making for an increasingly
difficult business environment.
At the beginning of August 2014, the new law for promoting renewable energy sources (“EEG surcharge”) came into
force in Germany. As a result, existing power plants for
self-generated energy will not be subject to the EEG surcharge.
For new power plants, 40% of the EEG surcharge must be
paid. This means that there is currently no additional financial
burden for the electricity BASF generates in its own power
plants. By 2017, however, this different treatment for existing
and new power plants will be checked for compliance with
E.U. law. It is possible that the self-generated energy from
existing power plants would then be partly included in the
EEG surcharge system. That would mean that BASF would
have to pay a proportion of the EEG surcharge, which would
significantly impair our competitiveness at German production
sites.
We view the worldwide support for the expansion of
­renewable energy and measures to increase energy efﬁciency
as an opportunity for increased demand for our products.­
For example, we offer diverse solutions for wind turbines in
addition to insulation foams for buildings. Our catalysts
­business beneﬁts from the tightening of automobile emissions
regulations.

Delivery bottlenecks

Litigation and claims

We try to prevent unscheduled plant shutdowns by adhering
to high technical standards and continuously improving our
plants. We reduce the effects of unscheduled shutdowns
through diversification within our global production Verbund.
We minimize procurement risks through our broad portfolio, global purchasing activities and the purchase of additional
quantities of raw materials on spot markets. If possible, we
avoid procuring raw materials from a single supplier. When
this cannot be avoided, we try to foster competition or we
knowingly enter into this relationship and assess the consequences of potential non-delivery. We continuously monitor
the credit risk of important business partners, both customers
as well as suppliers.

▪▪ Internal control system to limit risks
▪▪ Employee training as part of Group-wide
Compliance Program

Information technology risks
▪▪ Global procedures and systems for IT security
▪▪ Regular training for employees
BASF relies on a number of IT systems. Their nonavailability,
violation of confidentiality or the manipulation of data in critical
IT systems and applications can all have a direct impact on
production and logistics processes. If data are lost or manipulated, this can, for example, negatively affect process safety
and the accuracy of our ﬁnancial reporting. Unauthorized
­access to sensitive data, such as personnel records, competition-related information or research results, can result in legal
liability consequences or jeopardize our competitive position,
in addition to the loss of reputation associated with this.
To minimize such risks, BASF has global procedures
and systems in place to ensure IT security. These include
stable and redundantly designed IT systems, backup processes, ­virus and access protection, encryption systems, and
inte­
grated, Group-wide standardized IT infrastructure and
applications. The systems used for information security are
continuously tested and updated. In addition, our employees
receive regular training on information and data protection.
IT-related risk management is conducted using uniform regulations for organization and application, as well as an internal
control system based on these regulations.

In order to assess the risks from current legal disputes and
proceedings and any potential need to recognize provisions,
we prepare our own analysis and assessment of the circumstances and claims considered. In addition, in individual
­cases, we consider the results of comparable proceedings
and independent legal opinions. Furthermore, we make
­assumptions regarding the probability of occurrence and the
range of potential claims. The actual costs can deviate from
these estimates.
We use an internal control system to limit risks from
poten­tial infringements of rights or laws. For example, we try
to avoid patent and licensing disputes whenever possible
through ­extensive clearance research. As part of our Groupwide Compliance Program, our employees receive regular
training.
For more on our Group-wide Compliance Program,
see page 134 onward

Financial opportunities and risks
The management of liquidity, currency and interest rate risks
is conducted in the Treasury unit. The management of
commodity price risks takes place in the Procurement
­
­competence center or in the appropriately authorized Group
companies. Detailed guidelines and procedures exist for
dealing with financial risks. Among other things, they provide
for the segregation of trading and back office functions.
Exchange rate volatility
▪▪ Opportunities and risks especially from U.S. dollar
exchange rate ﬂuctuations
Our competitiveness on global markets is influenced by fluctuations in exchange rates. For BASF’s purchasing, opportunities and risks arise in particular when the U.S. dollar
­exchange rate ﬂuctuates. A full-year rise in the value of the
U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate by $0.01 would result in an
increase of around €50 million in BASF’s earnings, assuming
other conditions remain the same. On the production side, we
mitigate foreign currency risks by having production sites in
the respective currency zones.
Financial currency risks result from the translation of
­receivables, liabilities and other monetary items in accordance
with IAS 21 at the closing rate into the functional currency of
the respective Group company. In addition, we incorporate
planned purchase and sales transactions in foreign currencies
in our financial foreign currency risk management. These risks
are hedged using derivative instruments, if necessary.

Interest rate risks
▪▪ Market interest rates and credit risk premiums
to be paid have major impact on financing costs
Interest rate risks result from potential changes in prevailing
market interest rates. These can cause a change in the fair
value of fixed-rate instruments and fluctuations in the ­interest
payments for variable-rate instruments, which would posi­
tively or negatively affect earnings. To hedge these risks, interest rate swaps and combined interest rate and currency
­derivatives are used in individual cases.
In addition to market interest rates, BASF’s ﬁnancing
costs are determined by the credit risk premiums to be paid.
These are mainly inﬂuenced by our credit rating and the
­market conditions at the time of issue. In the short to medium
term, BASF is largely protected from the possible effects on
its interest result thanks to the balanced maturity profile of its
financial debt.

BASF Report 2014

risks for our financial investments by engaging in transactions
only with banks with good credit ratings and by adhering to
fixed limits. The credit ratings are continuously monitored and
the limits are adjusted accordingly. We reduce the risk of
­default on receivables by continuously monitoring the creditworthiness and payment behavior of our customers and by
setting appropriate credit limits. Due to the global activities
and diversified customer structure of the BASF Group, there
are no major concentrations of credit default risk. Risks are
also limited through the use of credit insurance and bank
guarantees.
Risk of impairment
The risk of an asset impairment occurs if the assumed interest
rate in an impairment test increases or the predicted cash
flows decline. In the current business environment, we
­consider the risk of impairment of individual assets such as
customer relationships, technologies and brands, as well­
as goodwill, to be nonmaterial.

Risks from metal and raw material trading
Long-term incentive program for senior executives
In the catalysts business, BASF employs commodity derivatives for precious metals and trades precious metals on behalf
of third parties and on its own account. In addition, we use
our knowledge of the markets for crude oil and oil products to
generate earnings from the trade of raw materials. To address
specific risks associated with these trades, which are not part
of our operating business, we set and continuously monitor
limits with regard to the type and size of the deals concluded.

Our senior executives have the opportunity to participate in a
share-price-based compensation program. The need for
provisions for this program varies according to the development of the BASF share price and the MSCI World Chemicals
Index; this leads to a corresponding increase or decrease in
personnel costs.
Risks from pension obligations

Liquidity risks
Risks from ﬂuctuating cash ﬂows are recognized in a timely
manner as part of our liquidity planning. We have access to
extensive liquidity at any time thanks to our good ratings, our
unrestricted access to the commercial paper market and
committed bank credit lines. In the short to medium term,
BASF is largely protected against potential reﬁnancing risks
by a balanced maturity proﬁle for ﬁnancial indebtedness as
well as through diversiﬁcation in various ﬁnancial markets.
For more on ﬁnancial risks, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements from page 210 onward
For more on the maturity proﬁle of our financial indebtedness, see the
Notes to the Consolidated ­Financial Statements on page 206

Risk of asset losses
We limit country-speciﬁc risks with measures based on internally determined country ratings, which are continuously
updated to reﬂect changing environment conditions. We
­
­selectively use export credit insurance and investment guarantees to limit specific country-related risks. We lower credit

We predominantly finance company pension obligations
externally through separate plan assets. This particularly
­
includes BASF Pensionskasse VVaG and BASF Pensions­
­
treuhand e.V. in Germany, in addition to the large pension
plans of our Group companies in North America, the United
Kingdom and Switzerland. To address the risk of underfunding due to market-related fluctuations in plan assets, we have
investment strategies that align return and risk optimization to
the structure of the pension obligations. Stress scenarios are
also simulated regularly by means of portfolio analyses.
Furthermore, new employees are almost always offered
­
deﬁned contribution plans. An adjustment to the interest rates
used in discounting pension obligations leads immediately to
changes in equity.

Long-term opportunities and risks

Innovation

Long-term demand development

▪▪ Chances of success in research and development
increased by Know-How Verbund

▪▪ Annual average growth of around 4% expected in
global chemical production
▪▪ BASF aims for above-average growth
In our “We create chemistry” strategy, we continue to operate
under the assumption that chemical production (excluding
pharmaceuticals) will grow worldwide by an average of around
4% annually until 2020, faster than global gross domestic
product. Although the worldwide chemical industry has grown
more vigorously than the global economy over the last few
years, growth rates in both gross domestic product and in
chemical production have nevertheless been slower than the
“We create chemistry” strategy had predicted. We continue to
strive for sales growth 2 percentage points above the market
through our broad, market-oriented portfolio, which we will
keep strengthening in the years ahead through ­investments in
new production capacity, R&D activities and acquisitions.
If the continuing sovereign debt crises and other political
crises result in a slackening of global economic growth, these
goals could prove to be too ambitious. As a result of our high
degree of diversification across various customer industries
and regions, we would still expect our growth to be above the
market average, even under these conditions.
For more on the “We create chemistry” strategy, see page 22 onward

Development of the competitive and customer
­landscape
▪▪ Opportunities from active portfolio management
and focus on innovative business areas
We expect competitors from emerging markets to become
increasingly important in the coming years. Furthermore, we
anticipate that many raw material suppliers will broaden their
value chains. We are addressing this risk through active portfolio management. We exit markets where risks outweigh
opportunities, and in which we do not see satisfactory opportunities to stand out from our competitors in the long term.
For example, we sold our 50% share in the Styrolution Group,
which produces styrenic plastics.
In order to remain competitive, we continuously improve
our operational excellence. Our strategic excellence program,
STEP, is also contributing to this. Starting at the end of 2015,
we now expect the more than 100 individual projects to
contribute around €1.3 billion to our earnings each year, compared with baseline 2011.
In order to achieve long-term profitable growth, our
­research and business focus is on highly innovative business
areas, which we sometimes enter into through strategic
­cooperative partnerships.

We are observing a trend toward more sustainability in our
customer industries. We want to take advantage of the resulting opportunities with innovations – particularly in the growth
fields we have identified. These include Batteries for Mobility,
Functional Crop Care to improve agricultural efﬁciency, solutions for water treatment and technologies for the use of
­renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar thermal and
photovoltaic power.
New products launched on the market between 2011
and 2020 are expected to contribute €30 billion to sales in
2020. To achieve this goal, we want to continue investing
around 3% of our sales (excluding Oil & Gas) in research and
development. An important success factor is the continuous
development of our research organization in order to further
­enhance our connectivity around the globe. Starting January
2015, we are pooling our research expertise into three global
platforms, each headquartered in a region signifi­cant for us:
Europe, Asia Pacific and North America. Stronger regional
presence opens up new opportunities to participate in local
innovation processes and gain access to local talent. We
also address the risk of the technical or economic failure
of ­research and development projects by maintaining a balanced and diversiﬁed project portfolio, as well as through
professional, milestone-based project management (R&D
controlling).
We optimize the effectiveness and efficiency of our
­research activities through our global Know-How Verbund as
well as through collaboration with partners and customers.
Furthermore, in a program and project management process,
we continuously review the chances of success and the
underlying assumptions of research projects; this review
­
­includes all phases from idea generation to product launch.
The trust of customers and consumers is essential for the
successful introduction of new technologies. That is why we
enter into dialog with stakeholders at an early stage of
­development.
For more on innovation, see page 33 onward

Portfolio development through investments
▪▪ 2011–2020: More than one-third of our investing
volume to go into emerging markets
We expect the increase in chemical production in emerging
markets in the coming years to be signiﬁcantly above the
global average. This will create opportunities that we want to
exploit by e
­ xpanding our presence in these economies; therefore, more than one-third of our investment volume between
2011 and 2020 will be spent in emerging markets. We also

117

118

Management’s Report
Forecast — Opportunities and risks report ﻿

want to intensify investment in North America in light of the
attractive growth prospects and low raw material prices: For
example, we are planning the construction of an ammonia
production plant with Yara in Freeport, Texas. In addition, we
are exploring an invest­
ment in a world-scale methane-topropylene complex on the U.S. Gulf Coast.
Our decisions on the type, size and locations of our
invest­ment projects are based on assumptions related to the
long-term development of markets, margins and costs, as
well as raw material availability and country, currency and
tech­
nology risks. Opportunities and risks arise when real
develop­ments deviate from our assumptions, particularly with
respect to demand development and competition intensity.
In the implementation phase, we use our experience in
project management and controlling to minimize short-term
technical risks as well as risks from cost overruns or missed
deadlines.
For more on our investment plans, see page 123 onward

Acquisitions
▪▪ Detailed assessment of opportunities and risks
as part of due diligence
In the future, we will continue to refine our portfolio through
acquisitions that promise above-average profitable growth,
are innovation-driven and offer added value for our customers
while reducing the cyclicality of our earnings.
The evaluation of opportunities and risks already plays a
signiﬁcant role during the assessment of potential acquisition
targets. Detailed analysis and quantification are conducted as
part of due diligence. Examples of risks include increased
staff turnover, delayed realization of synergies, and the
­assumption of obligations that were not precisely quantifiable
in advance. If our expectations in this regard are not fulﬁlled,
risks could arise, such as the need to impair intangible assets;
however, there could also be opportunities, for example, from
additional synergies.
For more on our acquisitions, see page 38 onward

Recruitment and long-term retention of qualified
­employees
▪▪ Intensified competition for highly-qualified
­specialists and leaders
▪▪ Risk of loss of expertise from retirements
Global competition for highly qualified specialists and leaders
has grown in recent years; in the medium to long term, this
will likely be further intensified by demographic change. As a
result, there is an increased risk that job vacancies cannot be
filled with suitable applicants, or only after a delay.

BASF Report 2014

Business could be negatively affected in the medium and long
term by the loss of expertise in North America and Europe
due to disproportionately high retirement numbers, as well as
by the challenge arising from additional recruitment demand
in Asia as a result of our targeted growth. We address these
risks with our Best Team Strategy and the global initiatives
derived from it, covering topics such as demographic and
knowledge management, Diversity + Inclusion, employee and
leadership development, intensified employer branding, and
supplementary regional initiatives. With these measures, we
increase BASF’s attractiveness as an employer and retain our
employees in the long term.
For more on the individual initiatives and our goals,
see page 41 onward

Sustainability
▪▪ Identifying opportunities and risks through
­materiality analysis
▪▪ Global monitoring for compliance with standards
BASF is committed to integrating environmental protection
and socially responsible conduct into its business activities.
Infringements of our voluntary commitments and legal violations also represent a reputational risk and could lead to
­operational or strategic risks. Before acquiring a company,
we take into account its focus on sustainability and we consider this in the acquisition process. Based on our materiality
analysis, we initiate change processes in the company in
­order to be prepared for any potential risks and to exploit
opportunities. We have established global monitoring systems
which also include our supply chain – these enable us to
­ensure adherence to laws and our voluntary commitments in
the areas of environment, safety, security and health as well
as to labor and social standards. In order to assure society’s
acceptance of our business activities, we engage in ongoing
dialog with relevant stakeholders. The Nano Dialog Forum of
BASF is an example. Ultimately, however, residual risks
­remain in all entrepreneurial activities which even comprehensive risk management cannot exclude.

Forecast — Economic environment in 2015﻿

Economic environment in 2015
The global economy will likely grow by 2.8% in 2015,
somewhat faster than in 2014 (+2.5%), with momentum
coming predominantly from the United States. We presume that growth in western Europe will not accelerate
further, and that China will continue its slight slowdown.
In light of this, we anticipate global chemical production
growth of 4.2%, marginally faster than in 2014 (+4.0%).
The global economy will continue to face substantial
risks. For 2015, we assume an average price for Brent
crude oil between $60 and $70 per barrel and an ­exchange
rate of $1.20 per euro.

We do not expect the economy in the European Union to
grow faster in 2015 than in 2014. Growth will be supported by
lower oil prices, the depreciation of the euro relative to the
dollar, and the expansive monetary policy of the European
Central Bank. The French and Italian economies will barely
grow, however; in Germany, growth will probably match the
slow pace of 2014. We assume that Spain will be able to
continue its slow economic recovery. The United Kingdom is
likely to keep growing vigorously, although not as much as
in the previous year. We anticipate continued solid growth
for the eastern E.U. countries. Our forecast assumes that
the conflict in Ukraine will not escalate further and that no
major new economic sanctions will be ­imposed on trade with
Russia.
We anticipate stronger growth in the United States economy than in 2014. Leading indicators point to a continuation
of the positive development of the last three quarters of 2014.
The ongoing recovery of the job market and continuing low
interest rates will support private consumption. Our forecast
is based on the assumption that the U.S. Federal Reserve will
be very careful about raising interest rates and that the new
distribution of power in Congress will not lead to renewed
blocking of fiscal measures.

South America

2.0%

Emerging markets of Asia 6.3%

In the emerging markets of Asia, we anticipate growth rates
comparable with the high levels of 2014. We expect slower
growth in China. The Chinese government will likely not implement strong stimulus measures to counterbalance the dampening effects of a slackening real estate market. By contrast,
we expect higher growth in India, Indonesia and Thailand.
We assume that the Japanese economy will not grow
significantly faster in 2015. Although the government does
intend to delay the sales tax increase planned for October
2015, the structural reforms needed to boost growth are
making slow progress and will only bear fruit in the long term.
For South America, we do not foresee widespread
improvement. The Brazilian economy will no longer be
­
weighed down by the political uncertainty surrounding the
outcome of the presidential elections; nevertheless, considering the high rate of inflation, dampening fiscal effects and the
lack of invest­ment in infrastructure, strong growth impetus is
unlikely. In Argentina, a settlement of the dispute with international creditors would improve access to capital markets in
the medium term, however, Argentina is likely to face another
year of recession.

Management’s Report
Forecast — Economic environment in 2015 ﻿

Outlook for key customer industries
▪▪ Marginally higher growth in global industrial
production expected for 2015
Global industrial production is likely to grow at 3.6% in 2015,
marginally faster than the +3.4% rate in 2014. At 2.4%, the
growth rate in the industrialized countries will be roughly comparable with that of the previous year. We expect a slight upturn in the emerging markets (2015: +4.7%; 2014: +4.3%).
In the transportation sector, we anticipate faster growth
than in 2014. Development will vary markedly by region. In
western Europe, we expect growth rates in the automobile
industry to slow down again after the catch-up effects of
2014. We also foresee a smaller increase in automobile
production in the United States. A significant slowdown is
expec­ted in Japan; however, we foresee considerably higher
growth rates in India and Thailand. The market in China
should continue its solid growth. After the previous year’s
sharp drops, we also assume that the automobile industry will
decline only slightly in Russia and grow slightly in Brazil.
The energy and resources sector is likely to continue its
slight growth in 2015. In Europe, we expect energy consumption to stagnate after the previous year’s warm winter resulted
in a considerable decline. Raw material production in the
United States should continue to grow in the wake of the
boom in shale gas. There is also likely to be a further significant increase in the demand for energy and raw materials in
the emerging markets of Asia.
In the construction industry, we foresee growth at
approxi­mately the level of 2014. The western European market is expected to continue on its slow path to recovery. For
the first time in a while, we also anticipate a marginal increase
in Spain’s construction sector, as well. The industry will keep
shrinking in France and Italy. We anticipate somewhat slower
growth in the more robust markets in Germany and the United
Kingdom. We expect the U.S. construction sector to grow
slightly faster, driven largely by residential and commercial
building projects. In China, however, the construction of new
– especially residential – buildings will probably continue to
slow down.

BASF Report 2014

We assume that the consumer goods industry will once
again grow faster in 2015 than in the year before, primarily
supported by the advanced economies. We now anticipate
slight growth in western Europe after the increasingly smaller
declines over the past three years. We foresee a slight upturn
for the United States. In the emerging markets of Asia, growth
rates will once again reach the high levels of 2014. Following
the sharp declines of the previous year, we predict widespread
stagnation in the consumer goods industry in Brazil.
The electronics industry will probably grow somewhat
faster than in 2014. We anticipate some slight deceleration in
Europe but stronger growth in the United States. For the
emerging markets of Asia, which contribute more than a third
of the global value added and more than half of global production, the economic slowdown in China will probably lead
to a slight growth decline at a high level. In Japan, we assume
that the industry will grow again after the previous year’s
­decline.
We predict robust growth approximating prior-year ­levels
for production in the health and nutrition sector. In western
Europe, we expect growth to remain consistent at a low level
but stay slightly ahead of overall economic growth. While the
industry in the United States should grow somewhat faster
than in the previous year, we anticipate a slight decline at a
high level in the emerging markets of Asia.
For agriculture, we foresee similar growth rates as in the
previous year. Even if growth is likely to be curbed by ongoing
low prices for agricultural commodities, this still means that
agricultural production in 2015 will continue to grow at its
average long-term pace. Furthermore, the lower price of oil
will dampen demand for bioethanol.

BASF Report 2014 

Outlook for the chemical industry
▪▪ Growth expected to be slightly above 2014 level
In line with the somewhat higher growth anticipated for the
industry in general, we expect chemical production (excluding
pharmaceuticals) to grow by 4.2% in 2015 (2014: +4.0%).
This will be largely attributable to the advanced economies
(2015: +2.2%; 2014: +1.6%). At 5.8%, growth will probably
decrease slightly in the emerging markets (2014: +6.1%).
The chemical industry in the European Union is not
­expected to grow appreciably faster in 2015 than in 2014.
Despite falling raw material prices, the European market continues to be subject to intense international competition. We
assume that production in Germany will cease to shrink and
start growing slightly. In France, Spain and the United Kingdom, however, we expect smaller gains in growth compared
with the previous year.
We expect somewhat stronger chemical production
growth in the United States in 2015, supported by low costs
for energy and raw materials as well as by a solid domestic
economy. Most of the chemical industry’s customer sectors
will probably show robust, and for the most part somewhat
higher, growth in 2015 than 2014.
In the emerging markets of Asia, we assume strong
growth rates for the chemical industry, albeit somewhat
weaker compared with 2014. Although we expect to see a
sharper increase in demand from the automobile industry,
demand is likely to be lower from the construction industry as
a result of the downturn of the construction sector in China.

Management’s Report
Forecast — Economic environment in 2015﻿

For Japan, we forecast that chemical production will stabilize
following a slight decline in 2014. Against the backdrop of
falling automotive production and weaker growth in the construction industry, we anticipate only slight growth.
After the previous year’s decline, we expect the chemical
industry to grow again slightly in South America. We anticipate recovery in Brazil, driven by higher production in the
transportation and construction sectors. The market will
probably continue to shrink slightly in Argentina. We do, however, expect vigorous production growth at 2014 levels in
Chile, Ecuador and Colombia, and considerable gains in
Peru.

BASF Report 2014

Outlook 2015
The development of the second half of 2014 has continued into the beginning of 2015: Oil and raw material
prices are volatile, as are currencies; the emerging markets are growing more slowly; and the global economy is
being dampened by geopolitical conflict. For 2015, we
nevertheless anticipate somewhat stronger growth in the
global economy, industrial production and the chemical
industry than in 2014, partly as a consequence of the
lower price of oil. This expectation assumes an average
price for Brent crude oil ranging from $60 to $70 per barrel and an exchange rate of $1.20 per euro. The global
economy will continue to face substantial risks. In this
volatile and challenging environment, we aim to perform
well and increase sales slightly in 2015. Income from
opera­tions before special items will likely match the level
of 2014.
For more information on our expectations for the economic
environment in 2015, see page 119 onward

BASF Group sales are expected to increase slightly in 2015,
largely supported by the sales growth anticipated in the
Functional Materials & Solutions and Performance Products
segments. We want to raise our sales volumes overall,
excluding the ­effects of acquisitions and divestitures. Income
from operations before special items in 2015 will likely match
the previous year’s level. We anticipate larger contributions
from our chemi­cals and crop protection businesses1, whereas
earnings in the Oil & Gas segment are expected to decrease
considerably due to the lower price of oil.
We expect a slight decline in income from operations. In
2014, high levels of special income had arisen primarily from
the disposal of our 50% share in Styrolution Holding GmbH.
As a result, there is likely to be a considerable decline in EBIT
after cost of capital.
The signiﬁcant risks and opportunities that could affect the
attainment of our forecast are described on pages 111 to 118.

Sales and earnings forecast for the segments
Sales in the Chemicals segment are expected to decrease
slightly in 2015. Substantially lower oil and raw material
prices will lead to price reductions in some business areas.
Anticipated volumes growth in all three divisions – due in
part to the startup of new plants – will not be able to fully
compensate for this development. We foresee higher volumes
in the Monomers division, especially of isocyanates and
poly­amide-6 extru­sion polymers. In the Intermediates division,
we especially expect sales volumes to rise in the amines and
polyalcohols businesses. Overall, income from operations
before special items is likely to decline slightly because of
expenses for starting up several plants.
We want to considerably increase our sales in the Performance Products segment in 2015, mainly through organic
growth. In the Dispersions & Pigments and Care Chemicals
divisions, this endeavor will be supported by factors like new
production capacities. We anticipate a considerable increase
in volumes in the Nutrition & Health division. Sales prices are
likely to ­remain under pressure, however. In the Performance
Chemicals division, we plan on increasing sales volumes. The
textile chemicals business will be sold to Archroma in the first
half of 2015. Income from operations before special items is
­expected to considerably exceed the level of 2014, supported
in all divisions by strict cost discipline and measures to
­increase competitiveness.
In the Functional Materials & Solutions segment in
2015, we anticipate higher demand from our key customer
sectors, the automotive and construction industries. We
predict a significant increase in volumes of our innovative
specialties and system solutions. We want to considerably
boost our sales. The startup of new plants in the Catalysts
and Performance Materials divisions will support this growth.
We are also striving for a considerable increase in income
from operations before special items. All divisions will likely
contribute to this development.

Our chemicals business comprises the Chemicals, Performance Products and Functional Materials & Solutions segments.

Forecast 2015

For sales, “slight” represents a change of 1–5%, while “considerable” applies for changes of 6% and higher. “At prior-year level” indicates no change (+/–0%). For earnings, “slight”
means a change of 1–10%, while “considerable” is used for changes of 11% and higher. “At prior-year level” indicates no change (+/–0%).

In the Agricultural Solutions segment, we expect prices for
agricultural products to remain at the level of the second half
of 2014. With exchange rates developing more favorably
overall, we anticipate high market volatility. In this environment, we set ourselves the ambitious goal of increasing sales
volumes and considerably improving sales and income from
operations before special items.
We foresee a slight decrease in sales as well as considerably reduced income from operations before special items in
the Oil & Gas segment as a result of the lower price of oil. In
the Exploration & Production business sector, the negative
effects of the decreased price of oil will probably be partly
offset by the expansion of our activities in Norway and the
growth in Achimgaz production in Russia. We also expect to
partially resume our onshore production in Libya. Our portfolio
optimization measures will continue. For the Natural Gas
Trading business sector, we anticipate considerable earnings
improve­ment thanks to a higher contribution from the transportation business as well as to rising sales volumes.
Sales in Other will decrease considerably, largely on
­account of lower raw material prices and lower plant availa­
bility due to a plant outage at the Ellba C.V. joint operation in
Moerdijk, Netherlands. For income from operations before
special items, we assume a slight decline, partly because of
the lack of earnings from our share in Styrolution Holding
GmbH, which was sold in 2014.

Investment planning
▪▪ Investments of around €4.0 billion planned for 2015
For the period from 2011 to 2020, we have planned capital
expenditures between €30 billion and €35 billion. More than a
third of this sum will be invested in emerging markets, further
strengthening our presence in these growth markets. Compared with 2014, we plan on lower annual investments for the
period from 2015 to 2020. The bulk of our spending in 2014
was on major projects that will start up in 2015, such as an
MDI plant in Chongqing, China; a TDI plant in Ludwigshafen,
Germany; and an acrylic acid and superabsorbent complex in
Camaçari, Brazil.
In particular, we are already planning or carrying out the
following projects:

Financing

In the Oil & Gas segment, our investments of around €4.1 billion by 2019 will focus mainly on the development of proven
gas and oil deposits in Argentina, Norway and Russia, as well
as on the exploration of new oil and gas reserves.
For 2015, we plan investments totaling around €4.0 billion1, particularly for the major projects listed above.

Our ﬁnancing policy is aimed at ensuring our solvency at all
times, limiting the risks associated with ﬁnancing and optimizing our cost of capital. We strive to maintain at least a solid
“A” rating, which allows the BASF Group unrestricted access
to money and capital markets.
From the scheduled repayment of bonds, we expect cash
outflows in the equivalent amount of around €2.2 billion. To
reﬁnance mature bonds and to optimize our maturity proﬁle,
we continue to have medium to long-term corporate bonds
and our commercial paper program at our disposal.

Corporate governance refers to the entire system for
managing and supervising a company. This includes the
organization, values, corporate principles and guidelines
as well as internal and external control and monitoring
mechanisms. Effective and transparent corporate governance guarantees that BASF is managed and monitored
in a responsible manner focused on value creation. This
fosters the confidence of our domestic and international
investors, the financial markets, our customers and other
business partners, employees, and the public in BASF.
The fundamental elements of BASF SE’s corporate governance system are: its two-tier system, with a transparent and
effective separation of company management and super­
vision between BASF’s Board of Executive Directors and the
Supervisory Board; the equal representation of shareholders
and employees on the Supervisory Board; and the share­
holders’ rights of co-administration and supervision at the
Annual Shareholders’ Meeting.

Direction and management by the
Board of Executive Directors
▪▪ Board of Executive Directors strictly separated from
Supervisory Board
▪▪ Determines corporate goals and strategic orientation
▪▪ Reports to Supervisory Board
The Board of Executive Directors is responsible for the
manage­ment of the company, and represents BASF SE in
business undertakings with third parties. BASF’s Board of
Executive Directors is strictly separated from the Supervisory
Board: A member of the Board of Executive Directors cannot
simultaneously be a member of the Supervisory Board.
The Board of Executive Directors agrees on the corporate
goals and strategic orientation of the BASF Group as well
as their individual business areas, and determines the com­
pany’s inter­nal organization. It also manages and monitors
BASF Group business through the planning and setting of
the corporate budget, the allocation of resources and management capacities, the monitoring and decision-making
regar­
ding significant individual measures, and the control
of the operational management.

The Board’s actions and decisions are aligned with the company’s best interests. It is committed to the goal of sustainably
increasing the company’s value. Among the Board’s responsibilities is the preparation of the consolidated and individual
financial statements of BASF SE. Furthermore, it must ensure
that the company’s activities comply with legal requirements
and internal corporate directives. This includes the establishment of appropriate controls and risk management systems.
Decisions that are reserved for the Board as a whole
by law, through the Board of Executive Directors’ Rules of
Procedure or through resolutions adopted by the Board, are
made at regularly held Board meetings called by the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors. Board decisions are
generally based on detailed information and analyses of the
business areas and specialist units, and, if deemed necessary, by external consultants. Board decisions can generally
be made via a simple majority. In the case of a tied vote, the
casting vote is given by the Chairman of the Board. However,
the Chairman of the Board does not have the right to veto the
decisions of the Board of Executive Directors. Members of the
Board of Executive Directors are authorized to make decisions individually in their assigned areas of responsibility.
The Board can set up Board Committees to consult and
decide on individual issues; these must include at least three
members of the Board of Executive Directors. For the preparation of important decisions, such as those on acquisitions,
divestitures, investments and personnel, the Board has various commissions at the level below the Board that carefully
assess the planned measure and evaluate the associated
opportunities and risks, and based on this information, report
and make recommendations to the Board – independently of
the affected business area.
The Board of Executive Directors informs the Supervisory
Board regularly, without delay and comprehensively, of all
­issues important to the company with regard to planning,
business development, risk situation, risk management and
compliance. Furthermore, the Board of Executive Directors
coordinates the company’s strategic orientation with the
Super­visory Board.

The Statutes of BASF SE define certain transactions that

include the acquisition and disposal of enterprises and parts
of enterprises, the issue of bonds or comparable financial
instru­ments; however, this is only necessary if the acquisition
or disposal price or the amount of the issue in an individual
case exceeds 3% of the equity reported in the last approved
Consolidated Financial Statements of the BASF Group.

The members of the Board of Executive Directors, including their areas
of responsibility and memberships on the supervisory bodies of other
companies, are listed on page 136. Compensation of the Board of
­Executive Directors is described in detail in the Compensation Report
from pages 138 to 144

Supervision of company management by the
Supervisory Board
▪▪ Supervisory Board appoints, monitors und advises
Board of Executive Directors
▪▪ Three Supervisory Board committees
The Supervisory Board appoints the members of the Board of
Executive Directors and supervises and advises the Board on
management issues. As members of the Supervisory Board
cannot simultaneously be members of the Board of Executive
Directors, a high level of autonomy is already structurally
­ensured with regard to the supervision of the Board of Execu­
tive Directors.

Together with the SE Council Regulation, the Statutes of
BASF SE and the Agreement Concerning the Involvement of
Employees in BASF SE (Employee Participation Agreement)
constitute the relevant legal basis for the size and composition of the Supervisory Board. The German Codetermination
Act does not apply to BASF as a European stock corporation
(Societas Europaea, SE).
The Supervisory Board of BASF SE comprises twelve
members. Six members are elected by the shareholders at
the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. The remaining six members are elected by the BASF Europa Betriebsrat (European
Works Council), the European employee representation body
of the BASF Group.
Resolutions of the Supervisory Board are passed by a
simple majority vote of the participating members. In the
event of a tie, the vote of the Chairman of the Supervisory
Board, who must always be a shareholder representative,
shall be the casting vote. This resolution process is also applicable for the appointment and dismissal of members of the
Board of Execu­tive Directors by the Supervisory Board.
BASF SE’s Supervisory Board has established a total of
three Supervisory Board Committees: the Personnel Committee, the Audit Committee and the Nomination Committee.

Agreement, see basf.com/investor/cg_e

Objectives for the composition of the
Supervisory Board
▪▪ Composition criteria: professional and personal
qualifications, diversity, and independence
One important concern of good corporate governance is to
ensure that seats on the responsible corporate bodies, the
Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board, are
appropriately filled. The criteria comprise professional and
personal qualifications, the diversity of the members and the
independence of the Supervisory Board. Seats on the Board
of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board should be filled
with members who ensure a well-balanced consideration of
all the knowledge, skills and personal qualifications necessary
to manage and supervise BASF as a large, globally operating,
capital market-oriented company in the chemical industry.
On October 21, 2010, the Supervisory Board agreed
upon objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board
in accordance with Section 5.4.1 of the German Corporate
Governance Code; in its meeting of December 20, 2012, an
objective was added for the number of independent Super­
visory Board members. According to these objectives, the
Super­visory Board is to be composed in such a way that the
members as a group possess knowledge, ability and expert
experience in:
––The management of an internationally operating company
––Cross-industry value creation along different value chains
––The application of accounting principles and internal control
procedures
––The field of technical and scientific innovations in the chemi­
cal sector and associated industries as well as in the sectors
using chemical products

BASF Report 2014

In terms of diversity, the Supervisory Board shall consider a
variety of professional and international experience as well as
the participation of women. At least two women shall belong
to the Supervisory Board. With regard to independence, the
Supervisory Board aims to ensure that all Supervisory Board
members are independent as defined by the terms of the
Code. Individuals who may have a conflict of interest shall not
be nominated for election to the Supervisory Board. The
same applies to candidates who will have reached the age of
70 by the day of the election.
There have been three women on the Supervisory Board
since May 2014. Two out of six shareholder representatives
elected at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting are women. In
assessing independence, the Supervisory Board assumes
that neither election as an employee representative, nor
membership on the Board of Executive Directors more than
two years in the past, by itself precludes the classification as
independent.
On this basis, the Super­visory Board has determined that
all of its current members can be considered indepen­dent.
We firmly believe the current composition fulfills the objectives
agreed on by the Super­visory Board.

BASF Report 2014 

Shareholders’ rights
▪▪ Shareholders’ rights of co-administration and
supervision at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting
▪▪ One share, one vote
Shareholders exercise their rights of co-administration and
supervision at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. The Annual
Shareholders’ Meeting elects half of the members of the
Super­visory Board and, in particular, decides on the formal
discharge of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board, the distribution of profits, capital measures, the
authorization of share buybacks, changes to the Statutes and
the selection of the auditor.
Each BASF SE share represents one vote. All of BASF SE’s
shares are registered shares. Shareholders are obliged to
have themselves entered with their shares into the company
share register and to provide the information necessary for
registration in the share register according to the German
Stock Corporation Act. There are no registration restrictions
and there is no limit to the number of shares that can be
registered to one shareholder. Only the persons listed in
the share register are entitled to vote as shareholders.
Listed shareholders may exercise their voting rights at the
Annual Shareholders’ Meeting either personally, through
a representative of their choice or through a company-­
appointed proxy authorized by the shareholders to vote
accor­ding to their instruc­tions. There are neither voting caps
to limit the number of votes a shareholder may cast nor
special voting rights. BASF has thus fully implemented the
principle of “one share, one vote.”
All shareholders entered in the share register are entitled
to participate in the Annual Shareholders’ Meetings, to have
their say concerning any item on the agenda and to request
information about company issues insofar as this is necessary
to make an informed judgment about the item on the agenda
under discussion. Registered shareholders are also entitled to
file motions pertaining to proposals for resolutions made by
the Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board at
the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting and to contest resolutions
of the Meeting and have them evaluated for their lawfulness in
court. Shareholders who hold at least €500,000 of the company’s share capital, a quota corresponding to 390,625 shares,
are furthermore entitled to request that additional items be
added to the agenda of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting.

Implementation of the German Corporate
Governance Code
▪▪ BASF SE follows all recommendations of German
Corporate Governance Code
BASF supports the German Corporate Governance Code,
which is an important tool in the continuing, capital market-­
oriented development of corporate governance and control,
and advocates responsible corporate governance that
­focuses on sustainably increasing the value of the company.
BASF SE follows all recommendations of the German
Corporate Governance Code in its most recently revised version of June 2014. In the same manner, BASF follows nearly
all of the non-obligatory suggestions of the German Corporate
Governance Code. We have not implemented the suggestion
to enable shareholders to follow the proceedings of the entire
Annual Shareholders’ Meeting online. The Annual Share­
holders’ Meeting is publicly accessible via online broadcast
until the end of the speech by the Chairman of the Board of
Executive Directors. The subsequent discussion of items on
the agenda is not accessible online in order to preserve the
character of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting as a meeting
attended by our shareholders on-site.
The joint Declaration of Conformity 2014 by the Board of Executive
Direc­tors and Supervisory Board of BASF SE is rendered on page 150

Disclosure persuant to Section 315(4) of the
German Commercial Code and the explanatory
report of the Board of Executive Directors
persuant to Section 176(1) Sentence 1 of the
German Stock Corporation Act
As of December 31, 2014, the subscribed capital of BASF SE
was €1,175,652,728.32, divided into 918,478,694 registered
shares with no par value. Each share entitles the holder to one
vote at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. Restrictions on the
right to vote or transfer shares do not exist. The same rights
and duties apply to all shares. According to the Statutes,
shareholders are not entitled to receive share certificates.
There are neither different classes of shares nor shares with
preferential voting rights (golden shares).
The appointment and dismissal of members of the Board
of Executive Directors is legally governed by the regulations in
Article 39 of the SE Council Regulation, Section 16 of the SE
Implementation Act and Sections 84, 85 of the German Stock
Corporation Act, as well as Article 7 of the BASF SE Statutes.
Accordingly, the Supervisory Board determines the number of
members of the Board of Executive Directors (at least two),
appoints the members of the Board of Executive Directors,
and can nominate a chairperson, as well as one or more
vice-chairpersons. The members of the Board of Executive
Directors are appointed for a maximum of five years, and
reappoint­ments are permissible. The Supervisory Board can
dismiss a member of the Board of Executive Directors if
there is serious cause to do so. Serious cause includes, in
particular, a gross breach of the duties pertaining to the Board
of Executive Directors and a vote of no confidence at the
Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. The Supervisory Board decides
on appointments and dismissals according to its own best
judgment.
According to Article 59(1) SE Council Regulation, amendments to the Statutes of BASF SE require a resolution of the
Annual Shareholders’ Meeting adopted with at least a twothirds majority of the votes cast, provided that the legal
provisions applicable to German stock corporations under the
German Stock Corporation Act do not stipulate or allow for
larger majority requirements. In the case of amendments to
the Statutes, Section 179(2) of the German Stock Corporation
Act requires a majority of at least three-quarters of the
subscribed capital represented. Pursuant to Article 12(6) of
the Statutes of BASF SE, the Supervisory Board is authorized
to resolve upon amendments to the Statutes that merely
concern their wording. This applies in particular to the adjustment of the share capital and the number of shares after the
redemp­tion of repurchased BASF shares and after a new
­issue of shares from the authorized capital.

BASF Report 2014

Until May 1, 2019, the Board of Executive Directors of
BASF SE is empowered by a resolution passed at the Annual
Shareholders’ Meeting of May 2, 2014, to increase the
subscribed capital – with the approval of the Supervisory
Board – by up to €500 million through the issue of new shares
against cash or contribution in kind (authorized capital).
A right to subscribe to the new shares shall be granted to
shareholders. This can also be done by a credit institution
acquiring the new shares with the obligation to offer these
to shareholders (indirect subscription right). The Board of
Execu­
tive Directors is authorized to exclude the statutory
subscription right of shareholders to a maximum amount of a
total of 20% of share capital in certain exceptional cases that
are defined in Section 5(8) of the BASF SE Statutes. This
­applies in particular if, for capital increases in return for cash
contributions, the issue price of the new shares is not substantially lower than the stock market price of BASF shares
and the total number of shares issued under this authorization
is not more than 10% of the stock of shares on the date of
issue or, in eligible individual cases, to acquire companies or
shares in companies in exchange for surrendering BASF
shares.
At the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on April 27, 2012,
the Board of Executive Directors was authorized to purchase
up to 10% of the shares existing at the time of the resolution
(10% of the company’s share capital) until April 26, 2017.
At the discretion of the Board of Executive Directors, the
purchase can take place on the stock exchange or by way
of a public purchase offer directed to all shareholders.
The Board of Executive Directors is authorized to sell the
repur­chased company shares (a) through a stock exchange,
(b) through a public offer directed to all shareholders and –
with the ­approval of the Supervisory Board – to third parties,
(c) for a cash payment that is not significantly lower than the
stock exchange price at the time of sale and (d) for contributions in kind, particularly in connection with the acquisition of
companies, parts of companies or shares in companies or in
connection with mergers. In the cases specified under (c)
and (d), the shareholders’ subscription right is excluded.
The Board of Executive Directors is furthermore authorized to
­redeem the shares bought back and to reduce the share
capital by the proportion of the share capital accounted for by
the redeemed shares.

120 days after the change-of-control event.
In the event of a change of control, members of the Board
of Executive Directors shall, under certain additional conditions, receive compensation (details of which are listed in the
Compensation Report on page 144). A change of control is
assumed when a shareholder informs BASF of a shareholding
of at least 25% or the increase of such a holding. In addition,
employees of BASF SE and its subsidiaries who are classified
as senior executives will receive a severance payment if
their contract of employment is terminated by BASF within
18 months of the occurrence of a change of control, provided
the employee has not given cause for the termination. The
employee whose service contract has been terminated in
such a case will receive a maximum severance payment of
1.5 times the annual salary (fixed component) depending on
the number of months that have passed since the change-ofcontrol event.
The remaining specifications stipulated in Section 315(4)
of the German Commercial Code refer to situations that are
not applicable to BASF SE.

acti­
vities of members of the Board of Executive Directors
and the Supervisory Board (D&O insurance). This policy provides for the level of deductibles for the Board of Executive
Directors as prescribed by Section 93(2)(3) of the German
Stock Corporation Act and for the level of deductibles for the
Supervisory Board as recommended in Section 3.8(3) of the
German Corporate Governance Code.

on compliance

With our Group-wide Compliance Program, we aim to
ensure adherence to legal regulations and the company’s
internal guidelines. We have integrated compliance into
our “We create chemistry” strategy. Our employee Code
of Conduct firmly embeds these mandatory standards
into everyday business. Members of the Board of Executive Directors are also expressly obligated to follow these
principles.
Based on international standards, BASF’s Compliance Program combines important laws and company-internal policies
– which themselves often exceed legal requirements – to
create a framework that regulates how all BASF employees
interact with business partners, officials, colleagues and
society. At the core of our Compliance Program is the global,
standardized Code of Conduct that we distributed to all
employ­ees. It describes our guidelines for proper conduct
and comprises not only topics like corruption and antitrust
laws, but also issues such as human rights, labor and social
standards, conflicts of interest and trade control, as well as
protection of data privacy.

Abiding by compliance standards is part of responsible
leadership. This has been expressly embedded in our values,
where we state: “We strictly adhere to our compliance
standards.” We are convinced that compliance with these
standards will not only avoid the disadvantages associated
with violations, such as penalties and fines. We also view
compliance as the right path toward securing our company’s
long-term success.
Our efforts are principally aimed at preventing violations
from the outset. To this end, all employees are required
within a prescribed timeframe to take part in basic compliance
training, refresher courses and special tutorials dealing
with, for example, antitrust law or trade control regulations.
Training takes place in different formats, including faceto-face training, e-learning or workshops. In addition, we
­introduced a new e-learning program on compliance in 2014.
In total, more than 59,000 employees worldwide took part in
around 65,000 hours of compliance training in 2014.

BASF’s Code of Conduct
Our actions are based on behavior compliant with the Code of Conduct, which comprises important laws as well as company-internal policies that often exceed
­legal ­requirements.
Protection of Company Property and
Property of Business Partners

Protection of Data Privacy

Protection of Environment,

Monitoring adherence to compliance principles
▪▪ Central role of Chief Compliance Officer and
compliance officers
▪▪ 50 external hotlines worldwide
▪▪ Compliance Management System audited internally
BASF’s Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) manages the implementation of our Compliance Management System, supported by 89 compliance officers worldwide. The CCO regularly
reports to the Board of Executive Directors on progress in the
program’s implementation as well as on any significant findings. Furthermore, the CCO reports to the Supervisory
Board’s Audit Committee in at least one of its meetings each
year on the status of the Compliance Program as well as any
major developments. In the event of significant incidents, the
Audit Committee is immediately informed by the Board of
Executive Directors.
We particularly encourage our employees to actively and
promptly seek guidance if in doubt. For this, they can consult
not only their managers but also dedicated specialist departments and company compliance officers. We have also set
up 50 external hotlines worldwide which our employees can
turn to anonymously. We make sure that all concerns are
processed and answered within a short amount of time.
In 2014, 276 calls and emails were received by our external hotlines (2013: 304). Concerns involved topics ranging
from questions on personnel management and handling of
company property to information on the behavior of business
partners. We launched investigations into all cases of
suspected misconduct that we became aware of. Confirmed
violations were penalized, up to and including dismissal. This
involved making sure that the necessary action was taken in
accordance with standardized company criteria. A notification
was sent to the appropriate authority in one case of suspected corruption.
BASF’s Corporate Audit department monitors adherence
to compliance principles, covering all areas in which compliance violations could occur. They check that employees
­adhere to regulations and make sure that the established
processes, procedures and monitoring tools are appropriate
and sufficient to minimize potential risk or preclude violations
in the first place. In 2014, 104 Group-wide audits of this kind
were performed (2013: 111), predominantly in the areas of
antitrust law, imports and exports, and gifts and e
­ ntertainment.

Corporate Governance
Compliance﻿

Our compliance management system itself is also regularly
audited, most recently in August 2014. If compliance audits
demonstrate a need to optimize procedures or hone control
measures, we implement them immediately. Furthermore, we
intensified the audits of our business partners in the area of
sales. The audits’ content and scope are prescribed by a
global directive.
Even outside of our company, we support the respect of
human rights and the fight against corruption: We are a
founding member of the United Nations Global Compact, and
are committed to our responsibility in accordance with the
U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. As a
member of Transparency International Deutschland and the
Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI) of the World
Economic Forum, we assist in the implementation of these
organizations’ objectives. As a member of the U.N. Global
Compact LEAD, we report in accordance with the Blueprint
for Corporate Sustainability Leadership. This action plan
comprises measures to support the U.N. Millennium Development Goals, addressing topics such as transparency and
stakeholder engagement.

Compensation report ﻿

BASF Report 2014

Compensation report

This report outlines the main principles of the compensation for the Board of Executive Directors and discloses
the amount and structure of the compensation of each
Board member. Furthermore, it provides information on
end-of-service undertakings with respect to Board members, as well as information on the compensation of
Super­visory Board members.

Compensation of the Board of Executive
Directors
This report meets the disclosure requirements of the German
Commercial Code, supplemented by the additional requirements based on the German Act on Disclosure of Management Board Remuneration (Vorstandsvergütungs-Offenlegungsgesetz) as well as the German Act on the Appropriateness of Management Board Remuneration (Gesetz zur Angemessenheit der Vorstandsvergütung), and is aligned with the
recommendations of the German Corporate Governance
Code in its version of June 24, 2014.
Based on a proposal by the Personnel Committee, the
Supervisory Board determines the amount and structure of
compensation of members of the Board of Executive Directors.
The amount and structure of compensation is determined
by the company’s size, complexity and financial position, as
well as the performance of the Board of Executive Directors.
Internal and external appropriateness of the Board’s compensation is reviewed by external auditors on a regular basis.
Globally operating companies based in Europe serve as an
external reference. For internal comparison, compensation is
considered in total as well as over time, especially for senior
executives.
For more on the Supervisory Board and its committees, see page 137
and from page 148 onward

Principles
The compensation of the Board of Executive Directors is
­designed to promote sustainable corporate development. It is
marked by a pronounced variability in relation to the performance of the Board of Executive Directors and BASF Group’s
return on assets.

The compensation of the Board of Executive
Directors comprises:
1. Fixed salary
2. Annual variable compensation
3. Share-price-based, long-term incentive (LTI) program
4. Nonmonetary compensation and other additional
compensation
5. Company pension benefits

The compensation components are shown in
detail below:
1. The fixed salary is a set amount of yearly compensation
paid out in even installments. It is regularly reviewed by the
Supervisory Board and adjusted, if necessary.
2. The actual annual variable compensation (variable
bonus) is based on the performance of the entire Board of
Executive Directors and the return on assets. The return on
assets is also used to determine the variable compensation of
all other employee groups.
In order to assess the sustainable performance of the
Board of Executive Directors, each year the Supervisory
Board sets a target agreement with the entire Board of Execu­
tive Directors that primarily contains medium and long-term
goals.
The Supervisory Board assesses the goal achievement of
the current year and the previous two years. A performance
factor with a value between 0 and 1.5 is determined on the
basis of the goal achievement ascertained by the Supervisory
Board. The variable bonus for the prior fiscal year is payable
after the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting.
Board members, like other employee groups, may contribute a portion of their annual variable bonus into a deferred
compensation program. For members of the Board of Executive Directors, as well as for all other senior executives of the
German BASF Group, the maximum amount that can be
contributed to this program is €30,000. Board members have
taken advantage of this offer to varying degrees.
3. A share-price-based, long-term incentive (LTI) program exists for members of the Board of Executive Directors.
It is also offered to all other senior executives of BASF Group.
Members of the Board of Executive Directors are subject to a
stricter set of rules than are contained in the general program
conditions: They are required to participate in the program
with at least 10% of their variable bonus. This mandatory
invest­ment consisting of BASF shares is subject to a holding
period of four years. For any additional voluntary investment
of up to 20% of the variable bonus, the general holding period
of two years applies. Members of the Board of Executive
Directors may only exercise their options at least four years
after they have been granted (vesting period). This compensation component is limited, too, by the structure of the LTI
program as well as by the upper limit on the options’ exercise
value. Because the exercise period spans multiple years, it
can occur that gains allocated from several LTI program years
all accumulate into one year; there can also be years in which
no gains are allocated.
For more on share ownership by members of the Board of Executive
­Directors, see page 133
For more on the LTI progam, see page 45 and from page 219 onward

BASF Report 2014 

4. Included in nonmonetary compensation and other
addi­tional compensation (fringe benefits) are the following:
delegation allowances, accident insurance premiums and
other similar benefits, and benefits from means of transport
and security measures provided by the company. The members of the Board did not receive loans or advances from the
company in 2014.
The members of the Board are covered by loss liability
insurance concluded by the company (D&O insurance) which
includes a deductible.
For more on the D&O insurance of the Board of Executive Directors,
see page 133

5. As part of the pension benefits granted to the Board of
Executive Directors (“Board Performance Pension”), company
pension benefits are intended to accrue annual pension units.
The method used to determine the amount of the pension
benefits generally corresponds to that used for the other
­senior executives of the German BASF Group. The method is
designed such that both the performance of the company
and the progression of the individual Board member’s career
significantly affect the pension entitlement.
The annual pension benefits accruing to Board members
in a given reporting year (pension unit) are composed of a
fixed and a variable component. The fixed component is calculated by multiplying the annual fixed salary above the Social
Security Contribution Ceiling by 32% (contribution factor).
The variable component of the pension unit is the result of
multiplying the fixed component with a factor that is dependent on the return on assets in the reporting year and the
performance factor, which is also decisive for the variable
bonus. The amount resulting from the fixed and the variable
component is converted into a pension unit (lifelong pension)
using actuarial factors based on an actuarial interest rate
(5%), the probability of death, invalidity and bereavement
accor­ding to Heubeck Richttafeln, 2005G (modified), and an
assumed pension increase (at least 1% per annum).
The sum of the pension units accumulated over the repor­ting years determines the respective Board member’s pension
benefit in the event of a claim. This is the amount that is payable upon retirement. Pension benefits take effect at the end
of service after completion of the member’s 60th year of age,
or on account of disability or death. Pension payments are
reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted by at least 1% each
year.

Corporate Governance
Compensation report﻿

The pension units also include survivor benefits. Upon the
death of an active or former member of the Board, the surviving spouse receives a survivor pension amounting to 60% of
the Board member’s pension entitlement. The orphan pension
amounts to 10% for each half-orphan, 33% for an orphan,
25% each for two orphans and 20% each for three or more
orphans of the pension entitlement of the deceased (former)
Board member. Total survivor benefits may not exceed 75%
of the Board member’s pension entitlement. If the survivor
pensions exceed the upper limit, they will be proportionately
reduced.
Board members are members of the BASF Pensionskasse
VVaG, as are generally all employees of BASF SE. Contributions and benefits are determined by the Statutes of the
BASF Pensionskasse VVaG and the General Conditions of
Insurance.

Amount of total compensation
The tables on pages 140-143 show the granted and allocated
compensation as well as service cost of each member of the
Board of Executive Directors in accordance with Section
4.2.5(3) of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC)
in its version of June 24, 2014.
Compensation granted in accordance with the German
Corporate Governance Code (GCGC)
The table “Compensation granted in accordance with GCGC”
shows: fixed salary, fringe benefits, annual variable target
compensation, LTI program measured at fair value at the
grant date, and service cost. The individual compensation
components are supplemented by individually attainable
minimum and maximum compensation.
Furthermore, a reconciliation statement for total compensation to be reported is provided below the table “Compensation granted in accordance with GCGC” due to the disclosures
required by Section 314(1)(6a) of the German Commercial
Code (HGB) in connection with the German Accounting
Standard Number 17 (GAS 17).
The fixed salary and annual variable target compensation
were both raised on January 1, 2014, for the first time since
January 1, 2011.

Accounting valuation of multiple-year variable
compensation (LTI programs)
While the options granted had resulted in an expense for BASF
in 2013, they led to income in 2014, except in the case of
Dr. Andreas Kreimeyer. This income refers to the total of all
options from the LTI programs 2006 to 2014 and is calculated
as the difference in the value of the options on December 31,
2014, compared with the value on December 31, 2013, considering the options exercised and granted in 2014. The value
of the options is based primarily on the development of the
BASF share price and its relative performance compared with
the benchmark i­ndex specified for the LTI programs 2006 to
2014. Because the value of options on December 31, 2014,

was lower than that of December 31, 2013, a gain rather than
an expense arose for 2014.
The expenses and gains reported below are purely accoun­
ting figures which do not equate with the allocated actual gains
should options be exercised. Each member of the Board may
decide individually on the timing and scope of the exercise of
options of the LTI programs, while taking into account the
terms and conditions of the program.
The gains for 2014 relating to all options issued were as
follows: Dr. Kurt Bock €97 thousand (2013: expense of
€1,870 thousand); Dr. Martin Brudermüller €333 thousand
(2013: expense of €1,773 thousand); Dr. Hans-Ulrich Engel
€90 thousand (2013: expense of €1,593 thousand); Michael
Heinz €146 thousand (2013: expense of €477 thousand);

143

144

Corporate Governance
Compensation report ﻿

Dr. Harald Schwager €388 thousand (2013: expense of
€1,716 thousand); Wayne T. Smith €165 thousand (2013:
expense of €312 thousand); and Margret Suckale €145 thousand (2013: expense of €390 thousand). For Dr. Andreas
Kreimeyer, the expense for 2014 amounted to €446 thousand
(2013: expense of €1,477 thousand).
For more on the LTI progam, see page 45 and from page 219 onward

Pension benefits
The values for service cost incurred in 2014 contain service
cost for BASF Pensionskasse VVaG and Performance Pension.
Service cost for the members of the Board of Executive Directors is shown individually in the tables “Compensation granted
in accordance with GCGC” and “Compensation allocated in
accordance with GCGC.”
The present value of pension benefits (defined benefit obligation) is an accounting figure for the entitlements that the
Board members have accumulated in their years of service at
BASF. The defined benefit obligations up to and including 2014
are as follows: Dr. Kurt Bock €18,571 thousand (2013:
€13,154 thousand); Dr. Martin Brudermüller €13,259 thousand
(2013: €9,070 thousand); Dr. Hans-Ulrich Engel €10,165 thousand (2013: €7,165 thousand); Sanjeev Gandhi €1,193 thousand; Michael Heinz €8,295 thousand (2013: €5,313 thousand); Dr. Andreas Kreimeyer €14,582 thousand (2013:
€11,275 thousand); Dr. Harald Schwager €9,680 thousand
(2013: €6,707 thousand); Wayne T. Smith €1,933 thousand
(2013: €935 thousand); and Margret Suckale €3,290 thousand
(2013: €2,148 thousand). The increase in the ­defined benefit
obligations compared with the previous year was largely attributable to the lower discount rate.

End-of-service benefits
In the event that a member of the Board of Executive Directors
retires from employment before the age of 60, either because
their appointment was not extended or was revoked for an
important reason, they are entitled to pension benefits if they
have served on the Board for at least ten years or if the time
needed to reach legal retirement age is less than ten years. The
company is entitled to offset compensation received for any
other work done against pension benefits until the legal retirement age is reached.
The following applies to end of service due to a changeof-control event: A change-of-control event, in terms of this
provision, occurs when a shareholder informs BASF of a
share­holding of at least 25%, or the increase of such a holding.
If a Board member’s appointment is revoked within one
year following a change-of-control event, the Board member
will receive the contractually agreed payments for the remaining
contractual term of office as a one-off payment (fixed salary
and annual variable target compensation). The Board member
may also receive the fair value of the option rights acquired in
connection with the LTI program within a period of three months
or may continue to hold the existing rights under the terms of

BASF Report 2014

the program. For the determination of the accrued pension
benefits from the “Board Performance Pension,” the time up to
the regular expiry of office is taken into consideration.
There is a general limit on severance pay (severance payment cap) for all Board members. Accordingly, payments made
to a Board member upon premature termination of their
contract, without serious cause, may not exceed the value of
two years’ compensation, including fringe benefits, nor
compensate more than the remaining term of the contract.
The severance payment cap is to be calculated on the basis of
the total compensation for the past full financial year and, if
appropriate, also the expected total compensation for the
current financial year. If the appointment to the Board of Execu­
tive Directors is prematurely terminated as the result of a
change of control, the payments may not exceed 150% of the
severance compensation cap.

Former members of the Board of Executive
Directors
Total compensation for previous Board members and their
surviving dependents amounted to €6.5 million in 2014 (2013:
€10.5 million). This figure also contains payments that previous
Board members have themselves financed through the
­deferred compensation program and the gain or expense for
2014 relating to options that previous members of the Board
still hold from the time of their active service period.
The continuation of the options that have not yet been
exer­cised at the time of retirement, along with the continuation
of the associated holding period for individual investment in
BASF shares under the conditions of the program, is intended
in order to particularly emphasize how sustainability is incorporated into the compensation for the Board members. Pension
provisions for previous Board members and their surviving
depen­dents amounted to €143.5 million (2013: €131.8 million).

Compensation of Supervisory Board members
The disclosure of compensation of the Supervisory Board is
based on the German Commercial Code and is aligned with
the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance
Code. The compensation of the Supervisory Board is regulated
by the Statutes of BASF SE passed by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting.
Each member of the Supervisory Board receives an annual
fixed compensation of €60,000 and a performance-related
variable compensation for each full €0.01 by which the earnings per share of the BASF Group, as declared in the BASF
Group Consolidated Financial Statements for the year for which
the remuneration is paid, exceeds the minimum earnings per
share. For the 2014 business year, minimum earnings per
share amounted to €1.65 (2013: €1.60). The performance-­
related variable remuneration is €800 for each €0.01 of earnings per share up to an earnings per share of €2.40, €600 for
each further €0.01 of earnings per share up to an earnings per
share of €2.90, and €400 for each €0.01 beyond this. The

BASF Report 2014 

Corporate Governance
Compensation report﻿

minimum earnings per share and the corresponding thresholds
shall increase by €0.05 for each subsequent financial year. The
performance-related variable compensation is limited to a
maximum amount of €120,000.
Based on the earnings per share of €5.61 published in the
BASF Group Consolidated Financial Statements 2014, the
performance-related compensation reached the maximum
amount of €120,000 (2013: €120,000).
The chairman of the Supervisory Board receives two-anda-half times and a vice chairman one-and-a-half times the
compensation of an ordinary member. Members of the Supervisory Board who are members of a committee, except for the
Nomination Committee, receive a further fixed compensation
for this purpose in the amount of €12,500. For the Audit
Committee, the further fixed compensation is €50,000. The
chairman of a committee shall receive twice and a vice chairman one-and-a-half times the further fixed compensation.

The company reimburses members of the Supervisory Board
for out-of-pocket expenses and value-added tax to be paid
with regard to their activities as members of the Super­visory
Board or of a committee. The company further grants the
members of the Supervisory Board a fee of €500 for atten­ding
a meeting of the Supervisory Board or one of its committees to
which they belong and includes the performance of the duties
of the members of the Supervisory Board in the cover of a loss
liability insurance concluded by it (D&O insurance), which
­includes a deductible.
For more on the D&O insurance of the Supervisory Board, see page 133

Total compensation of the Supervisory Board of the company
for activities in 2014, including the attendance fees, was around
€3 million (2013: around €3 million). The compensation of the
individual Supervisory Board members is as follows:

BASF Report 2014

Report of the Supervisory Board

Despite a sluggish business environment and growing uncertainty in the global economy, BASF continued to grow in
2014. Our goal of once again increasing earnings was
achieved. This was not automatically a given. The will and the
ability to consistently implement the “We create chemistry”
strategy and to constantly improve efficiency and resilience
determine today’s and tomorrow’s success. The further pursuit of this entrepreneurially ambitious path is the managerial
responsibility of the Board of Executive Directors. In this, they
have the full support of the Supervisory Board.

Monitoring and consultation in an ongoing
­dialog with the Board of Executive Directors

Outside of Supervisory Board meetings, the Chairman of the
Board of Executive Directors also regularly i­nformed the
Chairman of the Supervisory Board with regard to current
developments and individual events significant for the company. The Supervisory Board was always involved at an early
stage in decisions of major importance. The Super­
visory
Board passed resolutions on all of those individual measures
taken by the Board of Executive Directors which by law or
the Statutes required the approval of the Supervisory Board.
In 2014, these pertained to approval for the acquisition of
further investments in oil and gas fields in Norway from Statoil
Petroleum AS.

Composition of the Supervisory Board
In 2014, the Supervisory Board of BASF SE exercised its
­duties as required by law and the Statutes with the utmost
care. We regularly monitored the management of the Board of
Executive Directors and provided advice on the company’s
strategic development and important individual measures,
about which the Supervisory Board was regularly and thoroughly informed by the Board of Executive Directors. This
occurred in the form of written and oral reports on, for example, all of the company’s and the segments’ major financial
KPIs for the general economic situation in the main sales and
procurement markets, and on deviations in business developments from original plans. Furthermore, the Supervisory
Board tackled fundamental questions of corporate planning,
including financial, investment, sales volumes and personnel
planning, as well as measures for designing the future of
­research and development.
The Supervisory Board discussed in detail the reports
from the Board of Executive Directors, and also deliberated
on prospects for the company and its individual business
­areas with the Board of Executive ­Directors.

The Supervisory Board’s term of office ended with the Annual
Shareholders’ Meeting on May 2, 2014. Of the shareholder
representatives serving up to that point, Chairman of the
Super­visory Board Dr. h. c. Eggert Voscherau and Chairman
of the Audit Committee Max Dietrich Kley were no longer
eligible for reelection. The Annual Shareholders’ Meeting
elected Dame Alison Carnwath DBE and the former Chairman
of the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE, Dr. Jürgen
Hambrecht, both of whom were nominated for the first
time, to represent the shareholders together with the
reelected Supervisory Board members Michael Diekmann,
Prof. Dr. François Diederich, Franz Fehrenbach and Anke
Schäferkordt. The six employee representatives in the Supervisory Board of BASF SE, Ralf-Gerd Bastian, Wolfgang Daniel,
Francesco Grioli, Robert Oswald, Denise Schellemans and
Michael Vassiliadis, were appointed by BASF Europa
Betriebsrat (Europe Works Council) in accordance with the
regulations of the Employee Participation Agreement of
Novem­ber 15, 2007. The term of office of the newly elected
Supervisory Board will end upon the conclusion of the 2019
Annual Meeting.

BASF Report 2014 

Supervisory Board meetings
The Supervisory Board held six meetings in the 2014 reporting year. With the exception of two meetings at which one
member of the Supervisory Board was absent, all twelve
Super­visory Board members attended the meetings of the
Supervisory Board in 2014. The members of the Supervisory
Board elected by shareholders and those elected by the
employ­ees prepared for the meetings in separate preliminary
discussions.
Directly following the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on
May 2, 2014, the Supervisory Board redefined its own organization in its constituent assembly with the election of
Dr. ­
Jürgen Hambrecht as Chairman, Michael Diekmann
and Robert Oswald as Vice Chairmen, and the new composition of the Supervisory Board Committees. Dame Alison
Carnwath DBE was appointed the new Chair of the Audit
Committee.
A significant component of all Supervisory Board meetings was the Board of Executive Directors’ reports on the
current business situation with detailed information on sales
and earnings growth, as well as on opportunities and risks for
business development, the status of important current and
planned investment projects, developments on the capital
markets and significant managerial measures taken by the
Board of Executive Directors.
In its meetings, the Supervisory Board additionally discussed the further development of the BASF Group’s business activities through acquisitions, divestitures and investment projects. The 2014 business year was marked by a
number of medium-sized divestitures which enabled BASF to
undergo organic development and exit businesses that no
longer fit with the core areas pursuant to the “We create
chemistry” strategy supported by the Supervisory Board.
These include the disposal of BASF’s share in the styrenic
plastics supplier Styrolution to INEOS; the disposal of BASF’s
share in Ellba Eastern, which produces styrene and propylene
oxide in Singa­pore, to its joint venture partner Shell; the divestiture of the expandable polystyrene (EPS) business in North
and South America; and the agreement to sell the global
textile chemicals business. The Board of Executive Directors
reported on current developments in the projects negotiated
with Gazprom at all meetings of the Supervisory Board. These
included the planned swap of BASF’s share in the jointly
­
opera­ted natural gas trading and storage business for a further share in gas fields in western Siberia as well as an investment in the South Stream gas pipeline through the Black Sea.
Both projects were no longer able to be implemented in the
existing political environment and were terminated by both
parties.

Corporate Governance
Report of the Supervisory Board﻿

Major, capital-intensive investment projects were once again
a recurring element in the reports of the Board of Executive
Directors, such as the construction of a TDI plant in Ludwigs­
hafen, Germany; an MDI plant in Chongqing, China; and an
ammonia plant with Yara on the United States Gulf Coast.
In the meeting on July 17, 2014, we received reports on
the business prospects in the Performance Products segment
and especially the reorganization of the paper chemicals
business. Moreover, we discussed the implementation status
of the “We create chemistry” strategy, introduced in 2011,
with the Board of Executive Directors.
At the meeting on October 23, 2014, we thoroughly deliberated on the prospects and strategy of the Coatings division.
At the meeting on December 12, 2014, we discussed and
approved the Board of Executive Directors’ operative and
finan­
cial planning for 2015, and as usual empowered the
Board of Executive Directors to procure necessary financing
in 2015. The strategic direction of the Engineering & Maintenance function was furthermore discussed.
The Supervisory Board considered personnel issues of
the Board of Executive Directors during the meetings of February 20, October 23 and December 12, 2014. Based on the
recommendations of the Personnel Committee, the Super­
visory Board at its meeting on February 20, 2014, conducted
its regularly scheduled review of the structure and amount of
the compensation of the Board of Executive Directors and
adjusted the fixed compensation and annual variable compensation for the first time since 2011. The topic of the October 23, 2014, meeting was the composition of the Board of
Executive Directors. In view of the departure of Dr. Andreas
Kreimeyer from the Board of Executive Directors on conclusion of the 2015 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, the Super­
visory Board appointed the former head of the Intermediates
division, Sanjeev Gandhi, as a further member of the Board of
Executive Directors, effective December 1, 2014. The term of
this first-time appointment runs until the 2018 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board exten­
ded the term of Board of Executive Directors member Wayne
T. Smith, originally ending in 2015, until the conclusion of the
2020 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. Based on preparations
conducted by the Personnel Committee, the Supervisory
Board determined the performance evaluation of the Board of
Executive Directors for the 2014 business year. Together with
the return on assets of the BASF Group, this evaluation is
essential in ascertaining the performance-related component
of the compensation of the Board of Executive Directors.

Report of the Supervisory Board ﻿

Committees
BASF SE’s Supervisory Board has a total of three committees:
1) the committee for personnel matters of the Board of Execu­
tive Directors and the granting of loans in accordance with
Section 89(4) of the German Stock Corporation Act (Personnel Committee), 2) the Audit Committee and 3) the Nomination Committee. Following each Committee meeting, the
chairpersons of the Committees reported in detail about the
meetings and the activities of the Committees at the subsequent meeting of the Supervisory Board.
The Personnel Committee met four times during the
repor­ting period. With the exception of one meeting at which
one member was absent, all committee members participated in the meetings. At the meeting on February 20, 2014,
the committee considered adjustments to the compensation
of the Board of Executive Directors and prepared a corresponding proposal for the Supervisory Board. At the meetings
on July 17 and October 23, 2014, the Personnel Committee
particularly discussed leadership development and the composition of the Board of Executive Direc­tors; topics included
diversity and the proper involvement of women in leadership
positions. At the meeting of October 23, 2014, the Super­
visory Board received the proposals to appoint Sanjeev
Gandhi to the Board of Executive Directors and extend the
term of Wayne T. Smith. At the meeting of December 12,
2014, the primary topic was the evaluation of the Board of
Executive Directors’ performance in 2014.
The Audit Committee is responsible for all the tasks listed
in Section 107(3)(2) of the German Stock Corporation Act and
in Subsection 5.3.2 of the German Corporate Governance
Code in its version of June 24, 2014. The Audit Committee
met five times during the reporting period. All committee
members attended all meetings. The core duties were to
review BASF SE’s Financial Statements and Consolidated
­
Finan­cial Statements, as well as to discuss the quarterly and
first-half financial reports with the Board of Executive Directors prior to their publication.
At the meeting on February 24, 2015, the auditor reported
in detail on its audits of BASF SE’s consolidated and indivi­dual
financial statements for the 2014 business year and discussed
the audit’s results with the Audit Committee.
Other important activities included advising the Board of
Executive Directors on accounting issues and the internal
­
control system. The internal auditing system and compliance
in the BASF Group were each a focus at one meeting of the
Audit Committee. In these meetings, the head of the Corporate Audit department and the Chief Compliance Officer
­reported to the Audit Committee and answered its questions.
In its meeting of July 22, 2014, the Audit Committee charged
KPMG – the auditor elected at the Annual Shareholders’
Meeting – with the audit for the 2014 reporting year and
agreed on the auditing fees. The focus areas for the annual
audit were discussed and defined together with the auditor.
The Audit Committee approved certain nonaudit services and
authorized the Board of Executive Directors to engage KPMG

BASF Report 2014

for such services. The authorization applies for one reporting
year and is limited in amount. Other services provided by the
auditor must be individually approved by the Audit Committee. Furthermore, the committee recommended to the Supervisory Board that KPMG once again be nominated for the
election of the auditor at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting
in 2015.
The Audit Committee once again conducted a self-evaluation of its activities in 2014. No new steps were found to be
­necessary in terms of the duties of the committee or the
­content, frequency and procedure of meetings.
The Nomination Committee is responsible for preparing
candidate proposals for the election of those Supervisory
Board members who are elected by the Annual Shareholders’
Meeting. The Nomination Committee is guided by the objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board that were
adopted by the Supervisory Board in 2010, revised in 2012
and adjusted to conform to the new recommendations of the
German Corporate Governance Code. With a view to the
regular election of the Supervisory Board members con­
ducted at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 2, 2014,
the Nomination Committee was intensely occupied with the
­requirements for its composition in 2013 and at the beginning
of 2014, considering the search for, and selection of, persons
who would complete the required profile of the Supervisory
Board as a whole. The selection of candidates took place at
the meeting on February 19, 2014, including a proposal for
the election of the future Chairman of the Supervisory Board.
The Supervisory Board accepted the Nomination Committee’s suggestion in unmodified form for its candidate proposal. The nominated candidates were all elected by a large
­majority at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting.

Corporate governance and Declaration of
­Conformity
The Supervisory Board places great value on ensuring good
corporate governance: In 2014, we were therefore once again
intensely engaged with the corporate governance standards
practiced in the company and with the implementation of the
German Corporate Governance Code’s recommendations
and suggestions. At our meeting of October 24, 2014, we
discussed the current recommendations and proposals made
for the German Corporate Governance Code and their implementation at BASF.
At its meeting of December 12, 2014, the Supervisory
Board approved the joint Declaration of Conformity by the
Supervisory Board and the Board of Executive Directors in
accordance with Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act, and carried out assessments of efficiency and
independence. BASF complies with the recommendations of
the German Corporate Governance Code in its version of
June 24, 2014, without exception.
 he entire Declaration of Conformity is rendered on page 150 and can
T
also be found at basf.com/governance_e

BASF Report 2014 

An important aspect of good corporate governance is the
independence of Supervisory Board members and their
­
freedom from conflicts of interest. According to estimations
of the Supervisory Board, all of its members can be considered ­
independent as defined by the German Corporate
Governance Code. The criteria used for this evaluation can be
found in the Corporate Governance Report on page 130. In
cases where Supervisory Board members hold supervisory or
manage­ment positions at companies with which BASF has
business relations, we see no i­mpairment of their independence. The scope of these ­businesses is relatively marginal
and furthermore takes place under conditions similar to those
of a third party. The Corporate Governance Report of the
BASF Group provides extensive information on BASF’s corporate governance. It also ­includes the Compensation R
­ eport,
containing full details on the compensation for the Board of
Execu­tive Directors and the Supervisory Board.

Annual Financial Statements of BASF SE and
Consolidated Financial Statements
KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, the auditor
­elected by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting for the 2014
reporting year, has audited the Financial Statements of
BASF SE and the BASF Group Consolidated Financial
Statements, includ­
­
ing the Management’s Report and the
­accounting ­records from which they were prepared, and have
approved them free of qualification. Furthermore, the auditor
certified that the Board of Executive Directors had taken the
measures incumbent on it under Section 91(2) of the German
Stock Corporation Act in an appropriate manner. In particular,
it had instituted an appropriate information and monitoring
system that fulfilled the requirements of the company and is
applicable for the early identification of developments that
could pose a risk to the continued existence of the BASF
Group.
The documents to be examined and the auditor’s reports
were sent in a timely manner to every member of the Super­
visory Board. The auditor attended the accounts review
meeting of the Audit Committee on February 24, 2015, as
well as the accounts meeting of the Supervisory Board on
February 25, 2015, and reported on the main findings of the
audit. The auditor also provided detailed explanations of the
reports on the day before the accounts meeting of the Supervisory Board.
The Audit Committee reviewed the Financial Statements
and Management’s Report at its meeting on February 20,
2015, and discussed them in detail with the auditor. The
Chairwoman of the Audit Committee gave a detailed account
of the preliminary review at the Supervisory Board meeting on
February 25, 2015. On the basis of this preliminary review
by the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board has examined
the Financial Statements and Management’s Report of
BASF SE for 2014, the proposal by the Board of Executive
Directors for the appropriation of profit as well as the Consolidated Finan­cial Statements and Management’s Report for

Corporate Governance
Report of the Supervisory Board﻿

the BASF Group for 2014. We have reviewed, acknowledged
and ­approved the auditor’s reports. The results of the preliminary review by the Audit Committee and the results of our
own examination fully concur with those of the audit. The
Super­visory Board sees no grounds for objection to the management and submitted reports.
At the Supervisory Board’s accounts meeting on February 25, 2015, we approved the Financial Statements of
BASF SE and the Consolidated Financial Statements of the
BASF Group prepared by the Board of Executive Directors,
making the BASF SE Financial Statements final. We concur
with the proposal of the Board of Executive Directors regarding the appropriation of profit and the payment of a dividend
of €2.80 per share.

Thanks
The Supervisory Board thanks all employees of the BASF
Group worldwide and the management for their personal
contribution to the successful 2014 business year.
On conclusion of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on
May 2, 2014, the long-time Board of Executive Directors
and Supervisory Board members Max Dietrich Kley and
Dr. h. c. Eggert Voscherau, together with employee representative Ralf Sikorski, left the Supervisory Board. Eggert
Voscherau had held the office of Chairman of the Supervisory
Board since 2009. Max Dietrich Kley had been Chairman of
the Audit Committee since it was first assembled in 2003.
In their many years of service, both left a decisive mark on
BASF and had a major hand in the company’s success. The
Supervisory Board e
­ xpresses its very sincere thanks to them.

Statement by the Board of Executive Directors﻿

Statement by the Board of Executive Directors
and ­assurance pursuant to Sections 297(2) and 315(1)
of the German Commercial Code (HGB)
The Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE is responsible
for preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements and
Management’s Report of the BASF Group.
The Consolidated Financial Statements for 2014 were
prepared according to the International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS), which are published by the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB), London, and have been
endorsed by the European Union.
We have established effective internal control and steering
systems in order to ensure that the BASF Group’s Consoli­
dated Finan­cial Statements and Management’s ­Report comply with ­applicable accounting rules and to ensure proper
corporate reporting.
The risk management system we have set up is designed
such that the Board of Executive Directors can identify
material risks early on and take appropriate defensive
­
­measures as necessary. The reliability and effectiveness of
the internal control and risk management system are
­continually audited throughout the Group by our internal audit
department.

To the best of our knowledge, and in accordance with the
applicable accounting principles, the Consolidated Financial
Statements of the BASF Group give a true and fair view of the
net assets, financial position and results of operations of the
Group, and the Management’s Report of the BASF Group
­includes a fair review of the development and performance
of the business as well as position of the BASF Group,
together with a description of the principal opportunities
and risks asso­ciated with the expected development of the
BASF Group.

Auditor’s report

We have audited the Consolidated Financial Statements
­prepared by BASF SE, Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Germany,
comprising the statement of income, statement of income
and expense recognized in equity, balance sheet, statement
of cash flows, statement of equity and the Notes to the
­Consolidated Financial Statements together with the Group
Management’s Report for the business year from January 1 to
December 31, 2014. The preparation of the Consolidated
Finan­cial Statements and the Group Management’s Report in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union,
and the additional requirements of German commercial law
pursuant to Section 315a(1) of the German Commercial Code
(HGB) are the responsibility of the parent company’s Board
of Executive Directors. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements and on the
Group Management’s Report based on our audit. In addition,
we have been instructed to express an opinion as to whether
the Consolidated Financial Statements comply with full IFRS.
We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial
Statements in accordance with Section 317 HGB and
German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institute of Public Auditors
in Germany (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer, IDW). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit such
that misstatements materially affecting the presentation of
the net assets, financial position and results of operations
in the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance
with the applicable financial reporting framework and in the
Group Management’s Report are detected with reasonable

assurance. Knowledge of the business activities and the
economic and legal environment of the Group and expectations as to possible misstatements are taken into account in
the determination of audit procedures. The effectiveness of
the accounting-­
related internal control system and the
evidence supporting the disclosures in the Consolidated
­
­Financial Statements and the Group Management’s Report
are examined primarily on a test basis within the framework of
the audit. The audit ­includes assessing the annual financial
statements of those entities included in consolidation, the
determination of entities to be included in consolidation, the
accounting and consolidation principles used and significant
estimates made by the Board of Executive Directors, as well
as evaluating the overall presentation of the Consolidated
­Financial Statements and the Group Management’s Report.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
Our audit has not led to any reservations.
In our opinion, based on the findings of our audit, the
Consolidated Financial Statements comply with IFRSs as
adopted by the E.U., the additional requirements of German
commercial law pursuant to Section 315a(1) HGB and full
IFRS and give a true and fair view of the net assets, financial
position and results of operations of the Group in accordance
with these requirements. The Group Management’s Report is
consistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements and as
a whole provides a suitable view of the Group’s position and
suitably presents the opportunities and risks of future
­development.

Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes — Policies and scope of consolidation

BASF Report 2014

1–S
 ummary of accounting policies
1.1 – General information
BASF SE is a publicly listed corporation headquartered in
Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Germany. Its official address is
­Carl-Bosch-Str. 38, 67056 Ludwigshafen am Rhein, G
­ ermany.
The Consolidated Financial Statements of BASF SE as of
December 31, 2014, have been prepared in accordance with
the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) of the
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and Section
315a(1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). IFRSs are,
as a rule, only applied after they have been endorsed by the
European Union. For the 2014 fiscal year, all of the binding
IFRSs and pronouncements of the International Financial
­Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) were applied.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in
euros. All amounts, including the figures for previous years,
are given in million euros unless otherwise indicated.
The individual financial statements of the consolidated
companies are prepared as of the balance sheet date of the
Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies
that have been applied are the same as those in 2013, with
the exception of any changes arising from the application of
new or revised reporting standards.
In its meeting on February 23, 2015, the Board of
Executive Directors prepared the Consolidated Financial
­
Statements, submitted them to the Supervisory Board for
approval, and released them for publication.

1.2 – Restatement due to dissolution of gas
trading business disposal group
BASF and Gazprom agreed on December 18, 2014, not to
proceed with the asset swap planned for the end of 2014.
The arrangement had been for Wintershall to give Gazprom
its share in the jointly operated natural gas trading and
storage business as well as a 50% share in Wintershall
Noordzee B.V., Rijswijk, Netherlands. In return, BASF would
have ­received 25% plus a share in blocks IV and V of the
Achimov formation of the Urengoy natural gas and condensate field in western Siberia. At the end of 2012, the assets
and liabilities affected by the swap were reclassified into a gas
trading business disposal group in the financial statements.
As a result of the trans­
action’s c
­ancellation in December
2014, the reporting as a disposal group in accordance with
IFRS 5 – Noncurrent ­Assets Held for Sale and Dis­continued
Operations was ceased, and the amortization and depre­
ciation as well as equity-accoun­
ted income from the joint
ventures that had been contained in the disposal group –
and thus suspended since 2012 – were a
­ ccounted for. The
restate­
ment of the 2012 business year reduced ­
retained
earnings by €10 million and minority interests by €38 million in
the ­adjusted opening balance of J­ anuary 1, 2013. In the 2013
business year, reintegrated depre­
ciation and amortization
­reduced r­estated i­ncome from operations by €118 million.
Depreciation and amortization led to a €93 million increase in
cost of sales in 2013; selling e
­ xpenses rose by €3 million,
research expenses by €14 million, and other ­
­
operating
­expenses by €8 million. Further a
­ djustments p
­ redominantly
affected i­ncome from companies accounted for using the
equity ­method.
The necessary adjustments for the 2013 business year
are summarized below.

1.3 – Changes in accounting principles
Accounting regulations with first-time
­application in 2014
IFRS Annual Improvements: Cycle 2011–2013
The standards IFRS 3, IFRS 13 and IAS 40 were amended as
part of the Annual Improvements project. The amendments
address details of the recognition, measurement and disclosure of business transactions or serve to standardize terminology. These changes have no material impact on the
­Consolidated Financial Statements of the BASF Group.

IFRSs and IFRICs not yet to be considered
The effects on the BASF Group financial statements of the
IFRSs and IFRICs not yet in force or not yet endorsed by the
European Union in 2014 were reviewed and are explained
below. Other new standards or interpretations and amendments of existing standards and interpretations have no
­material impact on the BASF Group. Early implementation of
the standards before endorsement by the European Union is
not planned.

IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments
On July 24, 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9
– Financial Instruments, concluding the multiyear project to
replace IAS 39 – Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement. IFRS 9 contains new requirements for the
­
classification and measurement of financial instruments,
­fundamental changes regarding the accounting treatment of
financial asset impairments, and a reformed approach to
hedge accounting.
IFRS 9 retains “amortized cost” and “fair value” as the
criteria for measuring financial instruments. Whether financial
assets are measured at amortized cost or fair value depends
on two factors: the entity’s business model for managing the
portfolio to which the financial asset belongs and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.
According to IFRS 9, the recognition of financial asset
impairments is to be based on expected losses, whereas
IAS 39 had only allowed impairments for losses that had
­already been incurred. The general approach adopts a threestage model to assess the provisions for risks. The model
requires different degrees of impairment based on the credit
default risk of the counterparties. For certain financial instruments, such as trade accounts r­ eceivable, operational simplifications for recognizing impairment losses apply.

Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes — Policies and scope of consolidation

The IFRS 9 regulations on hedge accounting aim for a closer
alignment of hedge accounting with the entity’s risk management strategy.
The new standard will be effective for reporting periods
beginning on or after January 1, 2018. An endorsement by
the European Union is still pending. The potential impact on
BASF is being analyzed.
IFRS 15 – Revenues from Contracts with Customers
The IASB published the new standard on revenue recognition,
IFRS 15 – Revenues from Contracts with Customers, on
May 28, 2014. The revised standard particularly aims to
standardize existing regulations and thus improve trans­
­
parency and the comparability of financial information. The
rules and definitions of IFRS 15 supersede the content of
IAS 11, IAS 18, IFRIC 13, IFRIC 15, IFRIC 18, and SIC 31.
The new standard does not differentiate between different
types of contracts and services, but rather introduces uniform
criteria for the timing of revenue recognition. According to
IFRS 15, sales revenue is recognized when control of the
agreed-upon goods or services and the benefits obtainable
from them are transferred to the customer. The transfer of
major risks and rewards of ownership of the goods is no longer the deciding factor. Sales revenue is measured as the
amount the entity expects to receive in exchange for goods
and ­services.
The new model involves five steps for the recognition of
sales revenue with the first steps being the identification of the
contract with the customer and the separate performance
obligations it contains. The transaction price is then determined and allocated to the performance obligations in the
contract. Finally, sales are recognized for each performance
obligation in the amount of the allocated portion of the
­transaction price as soon as the agreed-upon good or service
has been provided or the customer receives control over it.
Principles are set out for determining whether the good or
service has been provided over time or at one point in time.
The new standard will be effective for reporting periods
beginning on or after January 1, 2017. An endorsement by
the European Union is still pending. The potential impact on
BASF is currently being analyzed.
Amendments to IAS 1: Disclosure Initiative
On December 18, 2014, the IASB issued amendments made
to IAS 1. The revisions pertain to various disclosure requirements, and clarify that information needs to be disclosed in
the notes only if it is not immaterial. Materiality considerations
also explicitly apply if a standard calls for a list of m
­ inimum
disclosures. Explanations are moreover provided on the
­aggregation and disaggregation of line items in the ­balance
sheet and income statement. Furthermore, the r­evised
­standard clarifies how an entity’s share of the other comprehensive income of equity-accounted companies is to be

BASF Report 2014

­ resented in the income statement. Finally, the structure of
p
the notes can be designed in a manner relevant for each
­individual company. The changes will be effective for reporting
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016. An ­endorsement
by the European Union is still pending. The amendments are
not expected to have a material effect on BASF.
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of
­Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortization
The IASB issued amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 on
May 12, 2014. These revisions provide further guidance on
determining an acceptable method of depreciation and
­amortization. Revenue-based methods are not permissible
for property, plant and equipment and are only permissible for
intangible assets in specific exceptional cases (rebuttable
presumption of inappropriateness). The changes will be
­effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1,
2016. An endorsement by the European Union is still pending.
The potential impact on BASF is currently being analyzed.
Amendments to IAS 19 – Defined Benefit Plans: ­
Employee Contributions
The IASB issued amendments to IAS 19 on November 11,
2013. The revisions clarify the requirements that relate to how
contributions from employees or third parties that are linked
to service should be attributed to periods of service. In
­addition, practical expedients are permitted if the amount of
the contributions is independent of the number of years of
service. The European Union endorsed the changes on
­January 9, 2015. In a deviation from the IASB’s effective d
­ ate
(reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 2014),
­
­IFRS-based financial statements of the European Union must
apply the changes for reporting periods beginning on or after
February 1, 2015. The potential impact on BASF is currently
being analyzed.
IFRS Annual Improvements: Cycle 2010–2012
Under its Annual Improvement Project, the IASB issued
amendments to several standards on December 12, 2013.
The affected standards are IFRS 2, IFRS 3, IFRS 8, IAS 16,
IAS 24, and IAS 38. The amendments address details of the
recognition, measurement and disclosure of business
transactions or serve to standardize terminology. The
­
­European Union endorsed the changes on January 9, 2015.
In a deviation from the IASB’s effective date (reporting
periods beginning on or after July 1, 2014), IFRS-based
­
­financial statements of the European Union must apply the
changes for reporting periods beginning on or after February 1, 2015. The amendments are not expected to have a
material effect on BASF.

BASF Report 2014 

IFRS Annual Improvements: Cycle 2012–2014
Under its Annual Improvement Project, the IASB issued
amendments to several standards on September 25, 2014.
The affected standards are IAS 19, IAS 34, IFRS 5 and IFRS 7.
The amendments address details of the recognition,
measurement and disclosure of business transactions or
­
serve to ­standardize terminology. The changes will be effective for ­reporting periods beginning on or after January 1,
2016. An endorsement by the European Union is still pending.
The amendments are not expected to have a material effect
on BASF.

1.4 – Group accounting principles
Scope of consolidation: The scope of consolidation is based
on the application of the standards IFRS 10 and 11.
According to IFRS 10, a group consists of a parent entity
and the subsidiaries controlled by the parent. “Control”
­assumes the simultaneous fulfillment of the following three
criteria:
––The parent company holds decision-making power over the
relevant activities of the investee.
––The parent company has rights to variable returns from the
investee.
––The parent company can use its decision-making power to
affect the variable returns.
Based on corporate governance and potential supplementary
agreements, companies are analyzed for their relevant activities
and variable returns, and the link between the variable returns
and the extent to which their relevant activities could be
­influenced.
According to IFRS 11, which regulates the accounting of
joint arrangements, a distinction must be made between joint
ventures and joint operations. In the case of a joint venture, the
parties that have joint control of a legally independent company
have rights to the net assets of that arrangement. In joint
­operations, the parties that have joint control have direct rights
to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the
arrangement. This requirement is particularly fulfilled if the
­production output of the joint arrangement is almost entirely
transferred to the partners, through which the partners
­guarantee the joint arrangements’ ongoing financing.
Companies whose corporate governance structures
­classify them as joint arrangements are analyzed to determine
if they meet the criteria for joint ventures or joint operations as
per IFRS 11. This requires an analysis of the joint arrangement’s
structure and, if the arrangement is structured through a
­separate vehicle, its legal form, contractual arrangements and
all other facts and circumstances are reviewed.

Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes — Policies and scope of consolidation

Consolidation: In addition to BASF SE, the Consolidated
Financial Statements include all material subsidiaries on a
­
fully consolidated and all material joint operations on a
­proportionally consolidated basis. Companies whose business is dormant or of low volume, and are of minor importance for the presentation of a true and fair view of the net
assets, financial position and results of operations, are not
consolidated, but rather are reported under other share­
holdings. These companies are carried at amortized cost and
are written down in the case of an impairment. The aggregate
assets and equity of these companies amount to less than
1% of the corresponding value at the Group level.
Joint ventures and associated companies are accounted
for in the Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity
method. Associated companies are entities in which
­significant influence can be exercised over their operating and
financial policies and which are not subsidiaries, joint ventures
or joint operations. In general, this applies to companies in
which BASF has an investment of between 20% and 50%.
­Equity-accounted income is reported as part of income from
operations (EBIT).
Consolidation methods: Assets and liabilities of con­
solidated companies are uniformly recognized and measured
in accordance with the principles described herein. For
­equity-accounted companies, material deviations in measurement resulting from the application of other accounting
­principles are adjusted for.
Transactions between consolidated companies as well as
intercompany profits resulting from trade between con­
solidated companies are eliminated in full; for joint operations,
they are proportionally eliminated. Material intercompany
profits related to companies accounted for using the equity
method are eliminated.
Capital consolidation is conducted at the acquisition date
according to the purchase method. Initially, all assets,
liabilities and additional intangible assets that are to be
­
­capitalized are measured at fair value. Finally, the acquisition
costs for the investment are balanced with the proportionally
acquired, remeasured equity. Any resulting positive d
­ ifferences
are capitalized as goodwill. Negative differences are reviewed
once more, then recognized directly in the income statement.
The incidental acquisition costs of a business combination
are recognized in the income statement under other operating
expenses.
Foreign currency translations: The cost of assets acquired
in foreign currencies and revenue from sales in foreign currencies are determined by the exchange rate on the date of the
transaction. Foreign currency receivables and liabilities are
valued at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date.
­
Changes in assets and liabilities arising from foreign currency
translation are recognized in the income statement and reported
under other operating expenses or income, other financial
­result, and available-for-sale financial assets in other comprehensive income.

Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes — Policies and scope of consolidation

BASF Report 2014

Translation of foreign currency financial statements: The
translation of foreign currency financial statements depends
on the functional currency of the consolidated companies.
For companies whose functional currency is not the euro but
a local currency other than the euro, translation into the repor­
ting currency is based on the closing rate method: B
­ alance
sheet items are translated into euros using closing rates on
the balance sheet date; expenses and income are translated
into euros at monthly average rates and accumulated for the
year. The difference between a company’s translated equity at
historical rates at the time of acquisition and its equity at
closing rates on the balance sheet date is reported separately in equity under other comprehensive income (translation adjustments) and is recognized in income only upon the
company’s disposal.
For certain companies outside the eurozone or U.S. dollar
zone, the euro or U.S. dollar is the functional currency. In
such cases the translation into the functional currency of
­financial statements prepared in the local currency is done
according to the temporal method: All non-monetary assets
and ­related depreciation and amortization as well as equity
are translated at the exchange rate applying to the respective
transactions. All other balance sheet items are translated
­using closing rates on the balance sheet date; other expenses
and income are translated at monthly average rates. The
­resulting translation differences are recognized in the income
statement under other operating income or expenses. If
­necessary, financial statements in the functional currency are
translated into the presentation currency according to the
closing rate method.

1.5 – Accounting policies
Revenue recognition
Revenues from the sale of goods or the rendering of services
are recognized upon the transfer of ownership and risk to the
buyer. They are measured at the fair value of the consideration
received. Sales revenues are reported without sales tax.
­Expected rebates and other trade discounts are accrued or
deducted. Provisions are recognized according to the
­principle of individual measurement to cover probable risks
related to the return of products, future warranty obligations
and other claims.

Revenues from the sale of precious metals to industrial
­customers as well as revenues from natural gas trading are
recognized as sales at the time of delivery and the
­corresponding purchase price is reported as cost of sales. In
the trading of precious metals and their derivatives with
­broker-traders, where there is usually no physical delivery,
revenues are netted against their corresponding costs.
Revenues from ­marketing the natural gas from the Yuzhno
Russkoye gas ﬁeld are treated in the same manner.
Income relating to the sale or licensing of technologies or
technological expertise are recognized in the income
statement according to the contractually agreed-upon
­
­transfer of the rights and obligations associated with those
technologies.

Assets
Acquired intangible assets (excluding goodwill) with defined
useful lives are measured at cost less straight-line amortization. The useful life is determined using the period of the
under­lying contract or the period of time over which the intangible asset can be expected to be used.
Impairments are recognized if the recoverable amount of
the asset is lower than the carrying amount. The recoverable
amount is the higher of either fair value less costs to sell or the
value in use. The value in use is determined on the basis of
the weighted average cost of capital after taxes, depending
on tax rates and country-related risks. If the reasons for an
­impairment no longer exist, the write-downs are reversed up
to the value of the asset, had an impairment not been recognized. Depending on the type of intangible asset, amortization
is reported under cost of sales, selling expenses, research
expenses or other operating expenses.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are trade
names and trademarks that have been acquired as part of
acquisitions. These are measured at cost and tested for
­impairment annually, or if there is an indication that their value
has declined.
Internally generated intangible assets primarily comprise internally developed software. Such software and other
internally generated assets are measured at cost and amortized over their estimated useful lives. Impairments are recognized if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the recoverable amount. In addition to those costs directly attributable to
the asset, costs of internally generated intangible assets also
include an appropriate portion of overhead costs. Borrowing
costs are capitalized to the extent that they apply to the purchase or the period of construction of qualifying assets.

BASF Report 2014 

Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes — Policies and scope of consolidation

The estimated useful lives and amortization methods of
­intangible assets are based on historical values, plans and
estimates. These estimates also consider the period and
­distribution of future cash inflows. The amortization methods,
useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance
sheet date. The weighted average amortization periods of
intan­gible assets amounted to:

Both movable and immovable fixed assets are for the most part
depreciated using the straight-line method. The estimated
­useful lives and depreciation methods applied are based on
historical values, plans and estimates. These estimates also
consider the period and distribution of future cash inflows. The
depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are
­reviewed at each balance sheet date. The weighted average
depreciation periods were as follows:

Emission rights: Emission right certificates granted free of
charge by the German Emissions Trading Authority (Deutsche
Emissionshandelsstelle) or a similar authority in other ­countries
are recognized at fair value at the time they are credited to the
electronic register run by the relevant governmental authority.
Certificates purchased on the market are capitalized at cost
as intangible assets. Emission right certificates granted
­free-of-charge are balanced out by deferred income in the
amount of the fair value. Emissions generated create an
­obligation to surrender the emission certificates and appropriate provisions are recognized. E
­ mission certificates received
free of charge and purchased are ­subsequently measured at
fair value, up to a maximum of the amount of the acquisition
costs. If the fair value is lower than the carrying amount on the
balance sheet date, the emission rights are impaired.
Goodwill is only written down if there is an impairment.
Impairment testing takes place once a year and whenever
there is an indication of an impairment.
Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less
depreciation and impairment over their useful lives. The revaluation method is not applied. Low-value assets are fully written
off in the year of acquisition and are reported as ­disposals.
The cost of self-constructed plants includes direct costs,
appropriate share of material and manufacturing costs, and a
share of the general administrative costs of the divisions
­involved in the construction of the plants. Borrowing costs are
capitalized to the extent that they apply to the purchase or the
period of ­construction of qualifying assets.
Expenditures related to the scheduled maintenance of
large-scale plants are separately capitalized and depreciated
using the straight-line method over the period until the next
turnaround. The costs for the replacement of components are
recognized as assets when an additional future benefit is
­expected. The carrying amount of the replaced components is
derecognized. Costs for maintenance and repair as part of
normal business operations are recognized as an expense.

Impairments are recognized if the recoverable amount of the
asset is lower than the carrying amount. The measurement is
based on fair value less costs to sell or the value in use. The
value in use is determined on the basis of the weighted average cost of capital after taxes, depending on tax rates and
country-related risks. An impairment is recognized for the
­
difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable
amount. If the reasons for an impairment no longer exist, the
write-downs are reversed up to the value of the asset, had an
impairment not been recognized.
Investment properties held to realize capital gains or ­rental
income are immaterial. They are valued at the lower of fair
value or acquisition cost less depreciation.
Leases: A lease is an agreement whereby the lessor
conveys to the lessee the right to use an asset for an agreed
period of time in return for a payment or series of payments.
Leasing contracts are classified as either finance or operating
leases.
Assets subject to operating leases are not capitalized.
Lease payments are recognized in the income statement in
the period they are incurred.
A lease is classified as a finance lease if it substantially
transfers all the risks and rewards related to the leased asset.
Assets subject to a finance lease are capitalized at the lower
of the fair value of the leased assets or the present value
of the minimum lease payments. A leasing liability is recorded
in the same amount. The periodic lease payments must be
divi­ded into principal and interest components. The principal
component reduces the outstanding liability, while the interest
component represents an interest expense. Depreciation
takes place over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or
the period of the lease.

168

Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes — Policies and scope of consolidation

Leases can be embedded within other contracts. If separation is required under IFRS, then the embedded lease is
­recorded separately from its host contract and each component of the contract is carried and measured in accordance
with the applicable regulations.
BASF acts as a lessor for finance leases to a minor extent
only.
Borrowing costs: Borrowing costs directly incurred as
part of the acquisition, construction or production of a
­qualifying asset are capitalized as part of the acquisition or
production cost of that asset. A qualifying asset is an asset for
which the time period necessary to make it ready for its inten­
ded use or sale is longer than one year. Borrowing costs are
capitalized up to the date the asset is ready for its i­ntended
use. The borrowing costs were calculated based on a rate of
4.0% (2013: 4.5%), adjusted on a country-specific basis. All
other borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the
period in which they are incurred.
Government grants: Government grants related to the
acquisition or construction of property, plant and equipment
reduce the acquisition or construction cost of the respective
assets. Other government grants or government assistance
are recognized immediately as other operating income or
treated as deferred income and reversed over the underlying
period.
Investments accounted for using the equity method:
The carrying amounts of these companies are adjusted
­annually based on the pro rata share of income, dividends
and other changes in equity. Should there be indications of a
permanent reduction in the value of an investment, an impairment is recognized in the income statement.
Inventories are carried at cost. If the listed, market or fair
value of the sales product which forms the basis for the net
realizable value is lower, then this is applied and an impairment
is recognized. The net realizable value is based on the selling
price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated
costs of completing and selling the product.
In addition to direct costs, cost of conversion includes an
appropriate allocation of production overhead costs based on
normal utilization rates of the production plants, provided that
they are related to the production process. Pensions, social
services and voluntary social benefits are also included, as well
as allocations for administrative costs, provided they relate to
the production. Borrowing costs are not included in cost of
conversion.
Inventories may be impaired if the price for the sales
­products declines or in cases of excessive inventory coverage.
To measure inventories in precious metal trading, the
­Company applies the exception for commodity broker-traders
under IAS 2. This dictates that inventories held exclusively for
trading purposes are to be recognized at fair value. All changes
in value are recognized directly in the income statement.

BASF Report 2014

Deferred taxes: Deferred taxes are recorded for temporary
differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabili­
ties in the financial statements and the carrying amounts for
tax purposes as well as for tax loss carryforwards and unused
tax credits. This also comprises temporary differences ­arising
from business combinations, with the e
­ xception of g
­ oodwill.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the
respec­tive country-specific tax rates ­applicable for the period
in which the asset or liability is r­ealized or settled. Tax rate
changes enacted or substantively enacted on or before the
balance sheet date are taken into consideration.
Deferred tax assets are offset against deferred tax liabilities provided they are related to the same taxation authority
and have the same maturities. Surpluses of deferred tax
­assets are only recognized provided that the tax benefits are
likely to be realized. The valuation of deferred tax assets is
based on the e
­ stimated probability of a reversal of the differences and the ability to utilize tax loss carryforwards and
­unused tax credits. This depends on whether future taxable
profits will exist during the period in which temporary differences are reversed and in which tax loss carryforwards and
unused tax credits can be claimed. Based on experi­ence and
the expected development of taxable income, it is assumed
that the benefits of the recognized deferred tax a
­ ssets will be
realized. The valuation of deferred tax assets is based on
­internal projections of the future earnings of the particu­lar
Group company.
Changes in deferred taxes in the balance sheet are
­recorded as deferred tax expense or income if the underlying
transaction is not to be recognized directly in equity or in
­income and expenses recognized in equity. For those effects
which have been recognized in equity, changes to deferred
tax assets and tax l­iabilities are also recognized d
­ irectly in
equity.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for differences
­between the proportional IFRS equity and the tax base of the
investment in a consolidated subsidiary if a reversal of these
differences is expected in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax
liabilities are recognized for dividend distributions which are
planned for the following year if these distributions lead to a
­reversal of temporary differences.

Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized in the
balance sheet when the BASF Group becomes a party to a
financial instrument. Financial assets are derecognized when
the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial
­asset expire or when the financial asset, with all risks and
­rewards of ownership, is transferred. Financial liabilities are
derecognized when the contractual obligation expires, is
­discharged or cancelled. Regular way purchases and sales of
financial instruments are accounted for using the settlement
date; in precious metals trading, the day of trading is used.

BASF Report 2014 

The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. When pricing on an active market is
­available, for example on a stock exchange, this price is used
for the measurement. Otherwise, the measurement is based
on internal measurement models using current market
­parameters or external measurements, for example, from
banks. These internal measurements predominantly use the
net present value method and option pricing models.
If there is objective evidence of a permanent impairment
of a financial instrument that is not measured at fair value
through profit or loss, an impairment loss is recognized. If the
reason for the impairment of loans and receivables as well as
held-to-maturity financial instruments no longer exists, the
impairment is reversed up to the amortized cost and
­recognized in the income statement. Impairments on financial
instruments are booked in separate accounts.
Financial assets and liabilities are divided into the following
measurement categories:
––Financial assets and liabilities at fair value recognized
in the income statement consist of derivatives and other
trading instruments. At BASF, this measurement category
only includes derivatives. Derivatives are reported in other
assets or other liabilities. BASF does not make use of the
fair value option under IAS 39. The calculation of fair values
is based on market parameters or measurement models
based on such parameters. In some exceptional cases, the
fair value is calculated using parameters which are not
­observable on the market.
–– Loans and receivables comprise financial assets with fixed
or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active
market and are not derivatives or classified as available-forsale. This measurement category includes trade accounts
receivable as well as other receivables and loans reported
under other receivables and miscellaneous assets. Initial
measurement is done at fair value, which generally matches
the nominal value of the receivable or loan. Interest-free and
low-interest long-term loans and receivables are recorded at
present value. Subsequent measurement recognized in
­income is generally made at amortized cost using the effective interest method. ­	­
If there is objective evidence for an impairment of a
­receivable or loan, an individual valuation allowance is made.
When assessing the need for a valuation allowance, regional
and sector-specific conditions are considered. In addition,
use is made of internal and external ratings as well as the
assessments of debt collection agencies and credit insurers,
when available. A portion of receivables is covered by credit
insurance. Bank guarantees and letters of credit are used to
a limited extent. Valuation allowances are only recognized for
those receivables which are not covered by insurance or
other collateral. The valuation allowances for receivables
whose insurance includes a deductible are not recognized in
excess of the amount of the deductible. Impairments are
based on ­historical values relating to customer solvency and
the age, period overdue, insurance policies and customerspecific risks. In addition, a valuation allowance must be

Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes — Policies and scope of consolidation

recognized when the contractual conditions which form the
basis for the receivable are changed through renegotiation in
such a way that the present value of the future cash flows
decreases.
In addition, valuation allowances are made on receivables
based on transfer risks for certain countries.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the valuation
allowance decreases and the decrease can be related
­
­objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was
recognized, the previously recognized write-down is to be
reversed in the income statement. Reversals of valuation
allowances may not exceed amortized cost. Loans and
receivables are derecognized when they are definitively
­
found to be uncollectible.
–– Held-to-maturity financial assets consist of non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
and a fixed term, for which there is the ability and intent to
hold until maturity, and which do not fall under other
valuation categories. Initial measurement is done at fair
­
value, which matches the nominal value in most cases.
­
Subsequent m
­ easurement is carried out at amortized cost,
using the ­effective interest method.
For BASF, there are no material financial assets that fall
under this category.
–– Available-for-sale financial assets comprise financial assets
which are not derivatives and do not fall under any of the
previously stated valuation categories. This measurement
category comprises shareholdings reported under the item
other financial assets which are not accounted for using the
equity method as well as short and long-term securities.
The measurement is conducted at fair value. Changes in
fair value are recognized directly in equity under the item
other comprehensive income and are only recognized in the
income statement when the assets are disposed of or have
been impaired. Subsequent reversals are recognized
­directly in equity (other comprehensive income). Only in the
case of debt instruments are reversals up to the amount of
the original impairment recognized in the income statement;
reversals above this amount are recognized directly in
­equity. If the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets
drops below acquisition costs, the assets are impaired if the
decline in value is significant and can be considered lasting.
The fair values are determined using market prices.
­Shareholdings whose fair value cannot be reliably determined are carried at acquisition cost, as the acquisition
costs constitute the best e
­ stimate of their fair value; they are
only written down in the case of an impairment. This
­includes investments in other shareholdings, provided these
shares are not publicly traded. There are no plans to sell
significant stakes in these shareholdings.

Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes — Policies and scope of consolidation

––Financial liabilities which are not derivatives are initially
measured at fair value, which normally corresponds to the
amount received. Subsequent measurement is carried out
at ­amortized cost, using the effective interest method.
––Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on
hand and bank balances.
There were no reclassifications from one measurement
­category to another in 2014 and 2013. The same applies for
transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy.
Revenue from interest-bearing assets is recognized on
the outstanding receivables on the balance sheet date using
interest rates calculated by means of the effective interest
method. Dividends from shareholdings not accounted for
using the equity method are recognized when the share­
­
holders’ right to receive payment is established.
Derivative financial instruments can be embedded within
other contracts. If IFRS requires separation, then the embedded derivative is accounted for separately from its host
­contract and measured at fair value.
Financial guarantees of the BASF Group are contracts
that require compensation payments to be made to the
­guarantee holder if a debtor fails to make payment when due
under the terms of the financial guarantee. Financial guarantees
given by BASF are measured at fair value upon initial recognition. In subsequent periods, financial guarantees are carried at
the higher of amortized cost or the best estimate of the present
obligation on the financial reporting date.
Cash flow hedge accounting is applied for selected
deals to hedge future transactions. In doing so, the effective
portion of the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in equity under other comprehensive income,
taking deferred taxes into account. The ineffective portion is
recognized immediately in the income statement. In the case
of future transactions that will lead to a nonfinancial asset or a
nonfinancial debt, the cumulative fair value changes in equity
are either charged against the acquisition costs on initial
­recognition or recognized in profit or loss in the reporting
­period in which the hedged item is recorded in the income
statement. For hedges based on financial assets or debts, the
cumulative fair value changes of the hedges are transferred
from equity to the income statement in the reporting period in
which the hedged item is recognized in the income statement.
The maturity of the hedging instrument is determined based
on the effective date of the future transaction.

BASF Report 2014

Hedge accounting can be used to hedge the translation risk
from investments in foreign subsidiaries (hedge of a net
­investment in a foreign operation). The effective portion of
the hedge is recognized in equity. If the foreign operation is
disposed of, these amounts are reclassified to the income
statement. The ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately
recognized in the income statement.
When fair value hedges are used, the asset or liability is
hedged against the risk of a change in fair value. Here,
changes in the market value of the derivative financial
­
­instruments are recognized in the income statement. Furthermore, the carrying amount of the underlying transaction is
adjusted by the profit or loss resulting from the hedged risk,
offsetting the effect in the income statement.
The derivatives employed by BASF for hedging purposes
are effective hedges from an economic point of view. C
­ hanges
in the fair value of the derivatives almost completely offset the
changes in the value of the underlying transactions.

Debt
Provisions for pensions and similar obligations: Provisions
for pensions are based on actuarial computations made
­according to the projected unit credit method, which applies
valuation parameters that include: future developments in
compensation, pensions and inflation, employee turnover and
the life expectancy of beneficiaries. The resulting obligations
are discounted on the balance sheet date using the market
yields on high-quality corporate fixed-rate bonds with an AA
rating.
Similar obligations, especially those arising from com­
mitments by North American Group companies to pay the
healthcare costs and life insurance premiums of retired staff
and their dependents, are reported under provisions for similar obligations.
The calculation of pension provisions is based on actuarial
reports.
	For more information on provisions for pensions and similar obligations,
see Note 22 from page 199 onward

BASF Report 2014 

Other provisions: Other provisions are recognized when
there is a present obligation as a result of a past event and
when there is a probable outflow of resources whose amount
can be reliably estimated. Provisions are recognized at the
probable settlement value.
Provisions for German trade income tax, German
­corporate income tax and similar income taxes are determined and recognized in the amount necessary to meet the
expected payment obligations less any prepayments that
have been made. Other taxes to be assessed are considered
accordingly.
Provisions are established for certain environmental
protection measures and risks if there exist present legal or
constructive obligations arising from a past event, and the
expected cash outflow can be sufficiently reliably estimated.
Provisions for restoration obligations primarily concern the
filling of wells and the ­removal of production facilities upon the
termination of ­production in the Oil & Gas segment. When the
obligation arises, the provision is measured at the present
value of the future restoration costs. An asset is capitalized for
the same amount as part of the carrying amount of the plant
concerned and is depreciated along with the plant. The discount on the provision is unwound annually until the time of
the planned restoration.
Other provisions also include expected charges for the
rehabilitation of contaminated sites, the recultivation of landfills, the removal of environmental contamination at existing
production or storage facilities and other similar measures. If
BASF is the only responsible party that can be identified, the
provision covers the entire expected claim. At sites operated
together with one or more partners, the provision generally
covers only BASF’s share of the expected claim. The determination of the amount of the provision is based on the available
technical information on the site, the technology used, legal
regulations, and official obligations.
Provisions are recognized for expected severance
­payments or similar personnel expenses as well as for demolition expenses and other charges related to the closing of
operations that have been planned and publicly announced
by management.
Provisions for long-service and anniversary bonuses are
predominantly calculated based on actuarial principles.
For contracts signed under the early retirement programs,
­approved supplemental payments are accrued in installments
until the end of the exemption phase at the latest. Accounting
and measurement follow the German Accounting Standards
Committee e.V.’s Application Note 1 (IFRS) of December 2012.
Other provisions also cover risks resulting from legal disputes and proceedings, provided the criteria for recognizing a
provision are fulfilled. In order to determine the amount of the
provisions, the Company takes into consideration the facts
related to each case, the size of the claim, claims awarded in
similar cases and independent expert advice as well as
assump­tions regarding the probability of a successful claim
and the range of possible claims. The actual costs can deviate from these estimates.
	For more information, see Note 26 on page 209

Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes — Policies and scope of consolidation

The probable amount required to settle long-term provisions
is discounted if the effect of discounting is material. In this
case, the provision is recognized at present value. Assumptions must be made in determining the discount rate used for
calculating long-term provisions. Financing costs related to
unwinding the discount on provisions in subsequent periods
are shown in other financial result.

Other accounting policies
Acquisition of companies: In company acquisitions, the
­acquired assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value on
the date control is effectively obtained. The fair value of
acquired assets and assumed liabilities at the date of
­
­exchange, as well as the useful lives of the acquired assets,
are determined on the basis of assumptions. The measurement is largely based on projected cash flows. The actual
cash flows can differ significantly from the cash flows used to
determine the fair values. ­Independent external appraisals are
used for the purchase price allocation of material acquisitions.
Valuations in the course of business combinations are based
on existing information as of the acquisition date.
Groups of assets and liabilities held for disposal or
­disposal groups: These comprise those assets and directly
associated liabilities shown on the balance sheet whose sale
in the ­context of a single transaction is highly probable. The
assets and liabilities of disposal groups are recognized at the
lower of the sum of their carrying amounts or fair value less
costs to sell; this does not apply to assets which do not fall
under the valuation principles of IFRS 5. Depreciation of
noncurrent ­
­
assets and the use of the equity method are
­suspended.
Oil and gas exploration: Exploration and development
expenditures are accounted for using the successful efforts
method. Under this method, costs of successful exploratory
drilling as well as successful and dry development wells are
capitalized.
An exploration well is a well located outside of an area
with proven oil and gas reserves. A development well is a well
which is drilled to the depth of a reservoir of oil or gas within
an area with proven reserves.
Exploratory drilling is generally reported under construction in progress until its success can be determined. When
the ­
presence of hydrocarbons is proven such that the
economic development of the field is probable, the costs
­
­remain c
­ apitalized as suspended well costs. At least once a
year, all suspended wells are assessed from an economic,
technical and strategic viewpoint to see if development is still
intended. If this is not the case, the capitalized costs for the
well in question are impaired. When reserves are proven and
the development of the field begins, the exploration wells are
­reclassified as machinery and technical equipment.

171

172

Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes — Policies and scope of consolidation

Production costs include all costs incurred to operate, repair
and maintain the wells as well as the associated plant and
ancillary production equipment, including the associated
depre­ciation.
The unit of production method is used to depreciate
­assets from oil and gas exploration at the field or reservoir
level. Depreciation is generally calculated on the basis of the
production of the period in relation to the proven, developed
reserves.
Exploration expenses pertain exclusively to the Oil & Gas
segment and include all costs related to areas with unproven
oil or gas deposits. These include costs for the exploration of
areas with possible oil or gas deposits, among others. Costs
for geological and geophysical investigations are always
­reported under exploration expenses. In addition, this item
includes valuation allowances for capitalized expenses for
exploration wells which did not encounter proven reserves.
Depreciation of successful exploratory drilling is reported
­under cost of sales.
An Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement is a
type of contract in crude oil and gas concessions whereby the
expenses and profits from the exploration, development and
production phases are divided between the state and one or
more exploration and production companies using defined
keys. The revenue BASF is entitled to under such contracts is
reported as sales.
The intangible asset from the marketing contract for
­natural gas from the Yuzhno Russkoye natural gas field is
amortized based on BASF’s share of the produced and
­distributed volumes.
Intangible assets in the Oil & Gas segment relate primarily
to exploration and drilling rights. During the exploration phase,
these are not subject to scheduled amortization but are ­tested
for impairment annually. When economic success is determined, the rights are amortized in accordance with the unit of
production method.

Use of estimates and assumptions in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements
The carrying amount of assets, liabilities and provisions,
contingent liabilities and other financial obligations in the
­
Consolidated Financial Statements depends on the use of
estimates, assumptions and use of discretionary scope.
­Specific estimates or assumptions used in individual accounting or valuation methods are disclosed in their respective
sections. They are based on the circumstances and estimates
on the balance sheet date and affect the reported amounts of
income and expenses during the reporting periods. These
assumptions particularly concern discounted cash flows in
the context of impairment tests and purchase price allocations; the determination of useful lives of property, plant and

BASF Report 2014

equipment and intangible assets; the carrying amount of
investments; and the measurement of provisions for such
­
things as employee benefits, warranties, trade discounts,
environmental protection and taxes. Although ­uncertainty is
appropriately incorporated in the determination of value,
­actual r­esults can differ from these estimates.
Impairment tests on assets are carried out whenever certain
triggering events indicate that an impairment may be necessary. External triggering events include, for example, changes
in ­
customer industries, technologies used and economic
downturns. Internal triggering events for an impairment
­
include lower product profitability, planned restructuring
­
­measures or physical damage to assets.
Impairment tests are based on a comparison of the
­carrying amount and the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and
the value in use. The value in use is generally determined
­using the discounted cash flow method. The estimation of
cash flows and the assumptions used consider all information
available on the respective balance sheet date on the future
development of the operating business. Actual future
developments may vary. Impairment testing relies upon the
­
cash-generating unit’s long-term earnings forecasts, which
are based on e
­ conomic trends. The weighted average cost of
capital (WACC) based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model
plays an important role in impairment testing. It comprises a
risk-free rate, the market risk premium and the spread for
the credit risk. Additional important assumptions are the
forecasts for the detailed planning period and the terminal
growth rates used.
For more information, see Note 14 from page 189 onward

An impairment is recognized if the recoverable amount of
the asset is lower than the carrying amount. The impairment
of the asset (excluding goodwill) is made in the amount of the
difference between these amounts.
The goodwill impairment test is based on cash-generating
units. At BASF, the cash-generating units are predominantly
the business units, or in certain cases, the divisions. If there
is a need for a valuation allowance, the carrying amount
of goodwill is written down, and if necessary completely written off as a first step. If there is further need for a valuation
allowance, this is allocated to the remaining assets of the
cash-­
generating unit. Goodwill impairments are reported
­under other operating expenses. Impairment reversals are not
conducted for goodwill.

2.4 – Acquisitions and divestitures
Acquisitions
In 2014, BASF acquired the following activities:
––On October 31, 2014, BASF completed the acquisition of a
2.5% share in the Brage production field in the Norwegian
North Sea from Tullow Oil Norge AS, Oslo, Norway, in the
Oil & Gas segment. The transaction was concluded with
retroactive commercial ­effect as of January 1, 2014. With
this acquisition, BASF increased its investment in Brage to
a total of 35.2%.
––In the Oil & Gas segment, BASF concluded with Statoil the
agreed purchase of shares in the Gjøa (5%) and Vega
(24.5%) production fields, the Aasta Hansteen development
project (24%), the Asterix discovery (19%) and the Polarled
Pipeline Project (13.2%), as well as in four exploration
­licenses near Aasta Hansteen on December 1, 2014. The
purchase price amounted to $1.25 billion or €1.0 billion.
Furthermore, BASF has agreed to pay an additional $50 million if the Aasta Hansteen field is developed according to
current project plans. The transaction was concluded with
retroactive commercial effect as of January 1, 2014. For this
reason, earnings from shares in the production as well as
investments made have led to purchase price adjustments.
Furthermore, a provision has been recognized in the amount
of contingent consideration expected to be paid in the
­future.

The following overview shows the components of the total
purchase price for the acquisition of assets from Statoil on
December 1, 2014.

The transfer of assets from Statoil increased sales in the 2014
business year by €28 million and net income by €3 million.
If the acquired assets had been included as of January 1,
2014, pro forma sales and income would have amounted to
€365 million and €45 million, respectively.
The purchase prices for the businesses acquired in 2014
totaled €973 million, including noncash purchase price
­
components. The payments for acquisitions amounted to
­
€963 million. The purchase price allocations were carried
out in accordance with IFRS 3 and are based on estimates.
The purchase price allocations should be regarded as
preliminary and can be adjusted within one year after the
acquisition.
The preliminary purchase price allocation from the previous
year for the acquisition of assets from Statoil on July 31,
2013, was reviewed at the end of the 12-month evaluation
period as per IFRS 3; parts were adjusted on the basis of
more detailed information on the production profiles of the
acquired Vega, Brage and Gjøa fields. This led to a €20 million
reduction in noncurrent assets to €1,413 million, and a
€22 million reduction in noncurrent liabilities to €954 million.
Furthermore, the expected value of the payment obligation to
Statoil in connection with the development of the Vega field
rose by €42 million, resulting in a corresponding increase in
the total purchase price to €895 million. These adjustments

brought about a €40 million increase in goodwill, which
amounted to €683 million.
The purchase price allocations of the other acquisitions
from the previous year were not adjusted.
––On February 12, 2015 BASF concluded the acquisition of
the business from Taiwan Sheen Soon (“TWSS”) in Taiwan,
which had been announced on December 8, 2014. The
purchase price for these activities amounted to $36 million.
The purchase price allocation according to IFRS 3 is currently being prepared. TWSS is a leading manufacturer of
precursors for adhesives based on thermoplastic polyurethanes. The activities have been integrated in the Performance Materials division. The acquisition of further assets
on the Chinese mainland to complete the transaction is
dependent on external approvals which is expected in the
course of 2015.
BASF acquired the following businesses in 2013:
––On January 31, 2013, BASF took over all the shares of
Pronova BioPharma ASA, ­
Lysaker, Norway, which
researches, develops and p
­
­roduces highly concentrated
omega-3 fatty acids. With the acquisition of Pronova
­BioPharma ASA, BASF aims to take a leading position in
the global market for omega-3 fatty ­
acids. Pronova
­BioPharma ASA’s business has been merged with BASF’s
previous activities within the Nutrition & Health division into
a global business unit.
––Effective March 11, 2013, BASF completed its acquisition
of parts of Ciech Group’s TDI business, as announced in the
third quarter of 2012. The acquisition largely comprised
­intellectual property rights and access to customers. TDI is
used primarily in furniture and automotive industry applications. The acquired business has been integrated into the
Monomers division.
––BASF acquired an enzyme technology for detergents and
cleaners from Henkel AG & Co. KGaA, Düsseldorf, G
­ ermany,
on April 17, 2013. The transaction comprised production
hosts, various detergent enzymes, and the corresponding
intellectual property. The activities have been integrated into
the Care Chemicals division.
––BASF concluded the acquisition of assets from Statoil,
Stavanger, Norway, effective July 31, 2013. The transaction
included the acquisition of shares in the Brage (32.7%),
Vega (30%) and Gjøa (15%) ﬁelds and the activities were
integrated into the Oil & Gas segment. In return, Statoil
­received a 15% share in the Edvard Grieg development
project as well as financial compensation of $1.35 billion,
which translates to €1.02 billion. BASF will pay up to a
maximum of an additional $100 million contingent on the
successful development of the Vega field. The transaction
was concluded with retroactive financial effect as of January 1, 2013.
––Effective October 31, 2013, BASF completed the acquisition of all shares in the Verenium Corporation, based in San
Diego, California. Verenium Corporation develops and
­markets high-quality enzymes which, as catalysts, enable
and accelerate biological and chemical processes. At the
time of acquisition, the acquired activities were allocated to
the Performance Products segment as well as to Other.

Divestitures
In 2014, BASF divested the following activities:
––On March 25, 2014, BASF concluded the sale of selected
oil and gas investments in the North Sea to the Hungarian
MOL Group, as agreed upon on December 12, 2013. MOL
acquired 14 licenses, including those for the non-BASF-­
operated Broom field (29%) and for the Catcher (20%),
Cladhan (33.5%) and Scolty/Crathes (50%) developments.
The transaction also included the sale of BASF’s shares in
the infrastructure of the Sullom Voe Terminal and in the
Brent Pipeline System. The transaction was financially
­retroactive to January 1, 2013. The purchase price agreed
upon was $375 million; less adjustments, the total purchase
price amounted to €264 million as well as income of
€132 million.
––On June 2, 2014, BASF completed the sale of its PolyAd
Services business to Edgewater Capital Partners, L.P.
PolyAd Services provides services for a wide range of
plastic applications in various industries, such as the
­
automotive, construction, packaging and electronics
­
­industries. The activities had been allocated to the Performance Chemicals division.
––Effective as of November 17, 2014, BASF sold its 50%
share in Styrolution Holding GmbH to the INEOS Group.
The partnership agreement of 2011 already included a
cross option giving BASF an option to sell its share in
­Styrolution and INEOS an option to buy BASF’s share in
Styrolution. On June 30, 2014, the equity-accounted carrying amount of Styrolution and these options were reclassified into assets and liabilities of d
­ isposal groups and the

1,225

equity method was discontinued. At the time of the dis­
posal, a total income of €458 million was recognized as
other operating income. The share in Styrolution and the
related i­ncome was allocated to Other.
The following overview shows the individual components
of BASF’s profit realization from the sale of the 50% share in

––On December 31, 2014, BASF completed the sale of its
50% stake in the joint operation Ellba Eastern Private Ltd.,
Singapore, which produces propylene oxide and styrene
monomers, to its partner Shell. On account of the continued
importance of propylene oxide and its value chain, BASF
and Shell concluded an agreement to supply BASF with the
necessary volumes. As a result of the d
­ ivestiture a gain of
€109 million was recognized. The ­activities of Ellba Eastern
were allocated to BASF’s ­Petrochemicals division as well as
Other.

In 2013, BASF divested the following activities:

ROCKWOOL as announced on July 18, 2013. The com­
pany’s main business was in systems for internal and external building insulation as well as for the renovation and
­restoration of historical structures. The activities had been
part of the Construction Chemicals division.
––A supplementary agreement to the articles of association
for GASCADE Gastransport GmbH expired on December 31, 2013. With the resulting change in the corporate
governance structure, BASF lost control over GASCADE
Gastransport GmbH, and since that time, has only a significant influence over the shareholding. According to IFRS 10,
this resulted in a reclassification from fully consolidated
company to an associated company accounted for using
the equity method in the BASF Group Consolidated
Financial Statements as of the effective date. BASF
­
­continues to hold a 50.02% share in GASCADE Gastransport GmbH.

––Effective April 2, 2013, BASF concluded the sale of its
sprayed concrete technology business for tunneling and
mining to Atlas Copco, announced in the fourth quarter of
2012. The transaction comprised the production site in
Winterthur, Switzerland, and the sales and service activities
in Hermsdorf, Germany. The business had been part of the
Construction Chemicals division.
––On July 1, 2013, BASF sold its activities in the CONICA
Sports Surfaces business, including the site in Schaff­
hausen, Switzerland, to the Serafin Group, Munich, Germany. The sale included the development, production and
marketing of flooring systems for running tracks, gymnasiums, tennis courts and playgrounds as well as artificial turf
solutions. The activities had been part of the Construction
Chemicals division.
––On September 30, 2013 BASF concluded the sale of
­Industrial Water Management France S.A.S., Lyon, France,
to Degrémont, a subsidiary of SUEZ ENVIRONNEMENT, as
announced on May 15, 2013. The business had been part
of the Performance Chemicals division.
––On December 31, 2013, BASF concluded the sale of

4 – Reporting by segment and region
BASF’s business was conducted by 14 operating divisions
­aggregated into five segments for reporting purposes to the
end of 2014. The divisions are allocated to the segments
based on their ­business models.
The Chemicals segment comprises the classical chemicals business with basic chemicals and intermediates. It
forms the core of BASF’s Production Verbund and is the
starting point for a majority of the value chains. In addition to
supplying the chemical industry and other sectors, the
­segment ensures that other BASF divisions are supplied with
chemicals for producing downstream products. The Chemicals segment is made up of the Petrochemicals, Monomers
and Intermediates divisions.
The Performance Products segment consisted of the
­Dispersions & Pigments, Care Chemicals, Nutrition & Health,
Paper Chemicals and Performance Chemicals divisions to the
end of 2014. Customized products allow customers to make
their production processes more efficient or to give their products ­improved application properties. The Paper Chemicals
division was dissolved as of January 1, 2015. The paper
chemicals business will be continued in the Performance
Chemicals and Dispersions & Pigments divisions.
The Functional Materials & Solutions segment bundles
system solutions, services and innovative products for
­specific sectors and customers, especially the automotive,
electrical, chemical and construction industries. It comprises
the Catalysts, Construction Chemicals, Coatings, and Performance Materials divisions.
The Agricultural Solutions segment consists of the Crop
Protection division, whose products secure yields and guard
crops against fungal infections, insects and weeds, in addition
to serving as biological and chemical seed treatments. Plant
biotechnology research is not assigned to this segment; it is
reported in Other.

The Oil & Gas segment is composed of the Oil & Gas ­division
with its Exploration & Production and Natural Gas Trading
business sectors.
Activities not assigned to a particular division are reported
in Other. These include the sale of raw materials, engineering
and other services, rental income and leases, the production
of precursors not assigned to a particular segment, the
­steering of the BASF Group by corporate headquarters, and
corporate research.
With cross-divisional corporate research, BASF is creating
new businesses and ensuring its long-term competence with
regard to technology and methods. This includes plant biotechnology research.
Earnings from currency conversion that are not allocated
to the segments are also reported under Other, as are
­earnings from the hedging of raw material prices and foreign
currency exchange risks. Furthermore, revenues and ­expenses
from the long-term incentive (LTI) program are reported here.
Transfers between the segments are generally executed
at adjusted market prices which take into account the higher
cost efficiency and lower risk of Group-internal transactions.
Assets, as well as their depreciation and amortization, are
­allocated to the segments based on economic control. Assets
used by more than one segment are allocated based on the
percentage of usage.

(664)

Income from operations in Other increased by €531 million
year-on-year to minus €133 million.
This was primarily due to the disposal gains of €458 million, shown under other ­businesses, from BASF’s share in
Styrolution Holding GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, ­Germany; this
income was dampened by lower c
­ ontributions to i­ncome,
mainly as a result of lower plant availability at the Moerdijik site
of the joint operation Ellba C.V., Rotterdam, Netherlands.

Furthermore, the rise in income from operations in Other was
attributable to improvement in foreign currency results,
hedging and other measurement effects, largely due to
­
­income from a provision reversal for the long-term incentive
program of €54 million; in 2013, this had led to e
­ xpenses
of €104 million. The results from the translation of foreign
­currencies were an additional contributing factor.

Net income

The Oil & Gas reconciliation reporting reconciles the income
from operations in the Oil & Gas segment with the contribution of the segment to the net income of the BASF Group.
In income from operations, lower oil and gas prices, and
the currency-related decrease in earnings contributions from
BASF’s share in the Yuzhno Russkoye natural gas ﬁeld were
nearly offset by the activities acquired in Norway in the previous year. However, higher special charges and lower special
income compared with the previous year led to a d
­ ecline in
income from operations. In 2014, the sale of oil and gas
invest­ments in the North Sea to the MOL Group resulted in
special income of €132 million, whereas impairments on
explora­
tion licenses reduced income from operations by
€230 million. In 2013, there had been higher special income
of €429 million due to the reclassification of GASCADE

­ astransport GmbH, Kassel, Germany, and the disposal of a
G
15% share in the Edvard Grieg development project in return
for assets from Statoil ASA amounting to €164 million.
Net income from shareholdings improved significantly.
This was due to the sale of VNG – Verbundnetz Gas AG to
EWE AG.
The Oil & Gas segment’s other income relates to income
and expenses not included in the segment’s income from
operations, as well as the interest result and other financial
result. As in the previous year, other income largely consisted
of currency effects from Group loans. The tax rate remained
the same. In 2014, highly taxed operating income in Norway
had a negative effect on the tax rate. Counterbalancing this
were reversals of tax liabilities.

shares which will be granted in the future as a part of the BASF
share program “plus.” This applies regardless of the fact that
the necessary shares are acquired by third parties on the market on behalf of BASF, and the fact that there are no plans for
the issuance of new shares. The dilutive effect of the issue of
Plus shares amounted to €0.01 in 2014 (2013: €0.01).

6 – Functional costs
Under the cost-of-sales method, functional costs incurred by
the operating functions are determined on the basis of cost
center accounting. The functional costs contain in particular
the personnel costs, depreciation and amortization accumulated on the underlying final cost centers as well as allocated
costs within the cost accounting cycle. Operating expenses
that cannot be allocated to the functional costs are reported
as Other operating expenses.
	For more on Other operating expenses, see Note 8 from page 184
onward

Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes all production and purchase costs of
the Company’s own products as well as merchandise which
has been sold in the period, particularly plant, energy and
personnel costs.

Selling expenses
Selling expenses include in particular marketing and advertising costs, freight costs, packaging costs, distribution
management costs, commissions, and licensing costs.

General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses primarily include the
costs of the central units, the costs of managing business
units and divisions as well as costs of general management,
the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board.

Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses include the costs
resulting from research projects as well as the necessary
­
­license fees for research activities.

Reversal of provisions included income of €79 million from
the reversal of the provision for the long-term incentive (LTI)
program; this was due to the lower BASF share price in 2014.
In 2013, however, expenses of €104 million resulted from the
LTI program. These were reported under other operating
expen­ses.
	For more information, see Note 8 from page 184 onward

Furthermore, the reversal of provisions was predominantly
related to closures and restructuring measures, employee
obligations, and risks from lawsuits and damage claims, as
well as various other items as part of the normal course of
business. Provisions were reversed if the circumstances on
the balance sheet date were such that utilization was no longer expected or expected to a lesser extent.

Revenue from miscellaneous revenue-generating activities primarily contained income from rentals, property sales,
catering operations, cultural events and logistics services.
Income from foreign currency and hedging transactions concerned foreign currency translations of receivables
and payables as well as changes in the fair value of currency
deri­vatives and other hedging transactions. Compared with
the previous year, higher income arose particularly from
swaps for crude oil to hedge price risks from purchasing and
selling contracts for natural gas.
Income from the translation of financial statements in
foreign currencies included gains from the translation of
companies outside of the eurozone that use the euro as their
functional currency.

Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes — Notes on Statement of Income

Gains on the disposal of fixed assets and divestitures in
the amount of €458 million arose from the sale of the 50%
share in Styrolution Holding GmbH, Frankfurt am Main,
­Germany, to INEOS.
Income of €132 million was related to the sale of selected
oil and gas investments in the North Sea to the Hungarian
MOL Group. Additional income in the amount of €109 million
resulted from the sale of the share in the 50-50 joint operation
Ellba Eastern Private Ltd., Singapore, to Shell as well as
€31 million from the sale of the PolyAd Services business to
Edgewater Capital Partners, L.P., Cleveland, Ohio.
The previous year primarly included €429 million in gains
from the reclassification of GASCADE Gastransport GmbH,
Kassel, Germany, due to loss of control following changes in
corporate governance. In addition, there were disposal gains
of €164 million for a 15% share in the Edvard Grieg development project in return for assets from Statoil ASA, Stavanger,
Norway, in 2013.
Income on the reversal of valuation allowances for
business-related receivables resulted mainly from the settlement of customer-related receivables for which a valuation
allowance had been recorded.

BASF Report 2014

Other income included government grants and government
assistance to BASF from several countries amounting to
€112 million in 2014 and €136 million in 2013. In both years,
these were primarily attributable to price compensation from
the Argentinian government for gas producers, which was
introduced in connection with the New Gas Price Scheme
(NGPS) due to the lower, partly locally regulated gas prices.
Furthermore, other income in 2014 arose from insurance
­refunds in the amount of €53 million in connection with a plant
outage at the Ellba joint operation in Moerdijk, Netherlands,
as well as various settlements amounting to €43 million.
In addition, other income in 2013 had included a delayed
earnings contribution from the fertilizer business.
Moreover, income in both years was related to gains from
precious metal trading, additional insurance refunds, the reversal of impairments on property, plant and equipment, tax
­refunds and a number of other items.

Expenses for restructuring measures were primarily related
to severance payments amounting to €40 million in 2014
and €149 million in 2013. Further expenses for restructuring
measures amounting to €9 million concerned several sites in
the Care Chemicals division. In the Dispersions & Pigments
division, expenses arose in the amount of €12 million in 2014
and €18 million in 2013. In 2013, there had also been expen­
ses for restructuring measures at several sites in the Construction Chemicals division amounting to €14 million.

Expenses arose from environmental protection and safety
measures, demolition and removal, and planning expen­
ses related to capital expenditures that are not subject
to mandatory capitalization according to IFRS. Expen­ses
for demolition, removal and project planning totaled €286 million in 2014 and €314 million in 2013. These especially
pertained to the Ludwigshafen site in both years. Further
expen­ses of €19 million were due to additional environmental
provisions related to several discontinued sites in North

America. In 2013, there were additions of €32 million to environmental provisions related to the remediation of landfills,
particularly in Germany, Switzerland and North America.
Amortization, depreciation and impairments of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment resulted
from impairments in the Oil & Gas segment amounting to
€230 million in 2014 and €45 million in 2013. Further impairments of €42 million concerned the Functional Materials &
Solutions segment. Impairments in the Chemicals segment
amounted to €33 million in 2014 and €83 million in 2013.
Furthermore, there had been an impairment of €15 million
on property, plant and equipment at a site in the United Kingdom in 2013.
Costs from miscellaneous revenue-generating activities concerned the respective items presented in other
opera­ting income.
	For more information, see Note 7 from page 183 onward

Expenses from foreign-currency and hedging transactions as well as from the measurement of LTI options w
­ ere
related to foreign currency translations of receivables and
payables as well as changes in the fair value of currency deri­
vatives and other hedging transactions. Compared with the
previous year, higher expenses particularly arose from swaps
for crude oil to hedge price risks from purchasing and selling
contracts for natural gas. In addition, 2013 had included
expen­ses of €104 million from the long-term incentive (LTI)
program. This was due to the increased BASF share price at
the end of the previous year. In 2014, an ­expense of €25 million was recognized for newly issued LTI ­options at the end of
the year.

Losses from the disposal of fixed assets and divestitures
in 2014 arose predominantly from impairments in the amount
of €9 million in connection with the disposal of the Brattvåg
site in Norway in the Nutrition & Health division. In 2013, there
had mostly been losses from divestitures in the Construction
Chemicals division in the amount of €14 million.
Expenses from the addition of valuation allowances
for business-related receivables increased in comparison
with the previous year by €14 million. This was mainly due to
higher additions in Brazil compared with the previous year.
Expenses from the use of inventory measured at market value and the derecognition of obsolete inventory
had been attributable in the previous year to the use of
€63 million in inventory measured at fair value in the acqui­
sition of ­Pro­nova BioPharma ASA and Becker Underwood.
Other expenses concerned strike-related expenses in
connection with the construction of the acrylic acid production complex in Camaçari, Brazil in the amount of €16 million.
Further expenses arose from the implementation of further
projects, from REACH, and from the provision of services.

The largest portion of income from companies accounted
for using the equity method pertained to the Oil & Gas
segment, mostly from: GASCADE Gastransport GmbH,
Kassel, Germany, which was reclassified as an associated
company on December 31, 2013; Nord Stream AG, Zug,
Switzerland; and, OAO Severneftegazprom, Krasnoselkup,
Russia. Shareholdings in Styrolution Holding GmbH,
Frankfurt am Main, Germany, BASF SONATRACH Propanchem S.A., Tarragona, Spain, and Heesung Catalysts
Corporation, Seoul, South Korea, also contributed significantly to income.

Compared with the previous year, income from companies
accounted for using the equity method decreased mainly
due to the absence of contributions to income from the
onshore production in Libya, which had been suspended
to a large extent since July 2013. In addition, currency
effects relating to OAO Severneftegazprom as well as
­
declin­ing margins at BASF-YPC Company Ltd., Nanjing,
China, had a negative effect.

Compared with the previous year, income from the disposal
of share­holdings inceased particularly due to income in the
amount of €220 million from the dis­posal of the 15.79%
share in VNG – Verbundnetz Gas AG, Leipzig, Germany.
The interest result improved by €24 million compared with
the previous year. This was primarily attributable to higher
inter­est income from interest and currency swaps to achieve
a variable rate of interest on financial indebtedness. This was
in part offset by the increase in interest expenses arising
from bank loans.
Net interest expense from underfunded pension plans
and similar obligations declined compared with the previous
year, mainly as a result of the lower defined benefit obligation
as of December 31, 2013.

Compared with the previous year, income from the
­capitalization of borrowing costs increased as a result of
­investment projects, such as the construction of the TDI plant
in Ludwigshafen, Germany, the production complex for ­acrylic
acid and superabsorbents in Camaçari, Brazil, the MDI plant
in Chonqing, C
­ hina, as well as oil and gas production f­ acilities.
Miscellaneous financial expenses in 2014 predominantly included hedging costs from the hedging of loans
denominated in U.S. dollars, as well as expenses from the
market valuation of options for the disposal of BASF’s share in
the Styrolution joint venture, which amounted to €42 million.
Miscellaneous financial income in 2013 included
­effects from the market valuation of options for the disposal
of BASF’s share in the Styrolution joint venture amounting to
€119 million.

Income before taxes and minority interests totaled €7,203 million (2013: €6,600 million). Of this amount, €1,797 million was
attributable to Germany (2013: €1,860 million) and €5,406 million to foreign countries (2013: €4,740 million).
In Germany, a uniform corporate income tax rate of 15.0%
as well as a solidarity surcharge of 5.5% thereon is levied on
all paid out and retained earnings. In addition to corporate
income tax, income generated in Germany is subject to a
trade tax that varies depending on the municipality in which
the company is represented. In 2014, the weighted average
tax rate amounted to 13.4% (2013: 13.3%). Due to an
increase in the rate of assessment for Ludwigshafen, the
­
weighted average trade tax rate increased to 14% starting in
2015.
As a result, deferred taxes for German Group companies
were calculated using a 30% rate (2013: 29%).

These rates averaged 32.6% in 2014 and 30.8% in 2013.
Other taxes included real estate taxes and other comparable taxes of €96 million in 2014 and €99 million in 2013 and
are allocated to functional costs.
Changes in valuation allowances for deferred tax assets
for tax loss carryforwards resulted in income of €3 million in

Notes — Notes on Statement of Income

For planned dividend distributions of Group companies and
planned disposals, the resulting future income taxes and
withholding taxes are recognized as deferred tax liabilities as
long as they are expected to lead to a reversal of temporary
differences. A planning horizon of one year was assumed for
planned dividend distributions. A decrease in planned dividend distributions led to deferred tax income of €7 million in
2014 (2013: €16 million).
The increase in the average trade tax rate in Germany
­resulted in a deferred tax expense of €37 million. Increases to
the Group tax rate due to improved earnings in highly taxed
countries, especially Norway, were partly offset by largely

BASF Report 2014

tax-exempt income in connection with the disposal of investments, especially the share in Styrolution and VNG –
Verbundnetz Gas AG, as well as the sale of oil and gas fields
in the North Sea to the MOL Group. Reversals of tax obligations from prior years also contributed to a reduc­tion of the
Group tax rate. In 2013, the disposal of shares in the Edvard
Grieg development project as well as income from loss of
control over GASCADE Gastransport GmbH did not result in
tax expenses.

Deferred taxes result from temporary differences between tax
balances and the measurement of assets and liabilities according
to IFRS as well as from tax loss carryforwards and unused tax
credits. The remeasurement of all the assets and liabilities associated with acquisitions according to IFRS 3 has resulted in significant deviations between fair values and the values in the tax
­accounts. This leads primarily to deferred tax liabilities.
Deferred tax assets were offset against deferred tax liabilities
of the same maturity if they were related to the same taxation
­authority.
Undistributed earnings of subsidiaries resulted in temporary
differences of €7,472 million in 2014 (2013: €7,985 million) for
which deferred tax liabilities were not recognized, as they are
­either not subject to taxation on payout or they are expected to be
reinvested for indefinite periods of time.
The regional distribution of tax loss carryforwards is as

Tax loss carryforwards relate primarily to the regions Europe,
Asia and North America. German tax losses may be carried
forward indefinitely. In foreign countries, use of carry­forwards
is limited. The bulk of the tax loss carryforwards will expire
in Europe by 2018, in Asia by 2019 and in North America
by 2032. Valuation allowances on deferred tax assets
were r­ eversed for tax loss carryforwards of €14 million (2013:
€14 million). No deferred tax assets were recognized for tax
loss carryforwards of €1,441 million (2013: €1,350 million).
Tax obligations primarily include assessed income taxes
and other taxes as well as estimated income taxes not yet
assessed for the current year. Tax obligations amounted to
€1,079 million in 2014 (2013: €968 million).

Higher minority interests in profits primarily arose from BASF
TOTAL Petrochemicals LLC, Port Arthur, Texas, as a result of
the startup of the tenth furnace at its steam cracker facility in
Port Arthur, Texas, in March 2014, as well as a higher c
­ apacity
utilization rate for the condensation splitter.

Following positive contributions to income in the previous
year, there were minority interests in losses at BASF India
Limited, Mumbai, India, in 2014 mostly due to the costs
­incurred in relation to the construction of the Dahej site in
­India that could not be capitalized. The write down on intangible assets due to impairment testing at BASF HOCK Mining
Chemical (China) Co. Ltd., Ji’ning, Shandong, China, also led
to minority interests in losses.

13 – Personnel expenses and employees
Personnel expenses

Number of employees

Personnel expenses decreased by 0.7%, from €9,285 million
in 2013 to €9,224 million in 2014. This was largely due to
income from the reversal of provisions for the long-term
­
incentive program and currency effects. Offsetting these
­
­effects were the higher number of employees as well as wage
and salary increases.

The number of employees was 113,292 on December 31,
2014 and 112,206 employees on December 31, 2013.
The average number of employees was distributed over

Employees from joint operations are included in the average

On average 376 employees worked for joint operations in
2014 (2013: 344 employees).

14 – Intangible assets
The goodwill of BASF is allocated to 23 cash-generating
units (2013: 27) which are defined either on the basis of
­business units or on a higher level.
The annual impairment testing took place in the fourth
quarter of the year on the basis of the cash-generating units.
The recoverable amount was determined using the value in
use. This was done in general using five-year plans and their
respective cash flows which had been approved by company

management. For the time period after the fifth year, a terminal value is calculated using a forward projection from the last
detailed planning year as a perpetual annuity. In accordance
with IAS 36, the applied growth rates do not factor in
­capacity-increasing investments for which no cash outflows
have taken place. The planning is based on experience,
current performance and management’s best possible
­
­estimates on the future development of individual parameters,

189

Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes — Notes on Balance Sheet

such as raw material prices and profit margins. Market
­assumptions regarding, for example, economic development
and market growth are included based on external macroeconomic sources as well as sources specific to the industry.
The weighted average cost of capital rate after tax ­required
for impairment testing is determined using the Capital Asset
Pricing Model. It comprises a risk-free rate, a market risk
premium as well as the spread for credit risk usual in the
indus­try, determined, for the first time in 2014, on the basis of
peer groups. The calculation also takes into account the
usual capital structure and the beta factor common in the
indus­try as well as the average tax rate of each cash-generating unit. Impairment tests were conducted assuming a
weighted average cost of capital rate after tax between 6.60%
and 7.76% (2013: 7.47% and 7.57%). This is equivalent to
weighted average costs before tax of between 8.19% and
10.3% (2013: 9.31% and 11.27%). For the cash-generating
unit Exploration & Production in the Oil & Gas segment, a cost
of capital rate after tax of 9.46% was applied (2013: 8.83%),
or before tax of 17.72% (2013: 17.39%), taking countryspecific risks into account.

BASF Report 2014

In determining the value in use for the majority of cashgenera­ting units, BASF generally anticipates that a ­reasonably
possible deviation from the key assumptions will not lead to
the carrying amount of the units exceeding their respective
recoverable amounts. The goodwill of the C
­ onstruction
Chemicals division, which arose in connection with the acquisition of Degussa Bauchemie in the 2006 ­financial year, is
excluded from this. In the 2014 financial year, the recoverable
amount of Construction Chemicals e
­xceeded the carrying
amount by around €195 million. E
­ arnings in the Construction
Chemicals division were ­influenced by the growth of the construction industry. The weighted average cost of capital rate
used for the impairment testing of C
­ onstruction Chemicals
was 7.76% (2013: 7.52%). The r­ ecoverable value of the Construction Chemicals unit would equal the book value if the
cost of capital rate increased by 0.5 percentage points or
­income from operations of the last detailed planning year, as
the basis for the terminal value, were lower by 9.10%.
The impairment tests resulted in no impairment losses on
goodwill in 2014, as in the previous year.

Including licenses to such rights and values

Besides goodwill, intangible assets include acquired intan­
gible assets as well as internally generated intangible assets.
In connection with the acquisition of assets from Statoil
ASA, there were additions of €704 million to intangible assets
in 2014. Of this amount, €121 million pertained to ­exploration
rights and licenses and €583 million to goodwill.
Concessions for oil and gas production under the c
­ ate­gory
product rights, licenses and trademarks with a net carrying
amount of €579 million in 2014 (2013: €457 million) authorize
the exploration and production of oil and gas in certain areas.
Some of these rights entail obligations to deliver a portion of
the production output to local companies. At the end of the
term of a concession, the rights are returned.

In other rights and values, the line item transfers includes
additions and market value adjustments of emission rights
recognized directly in equity as of the balance sheet date.
Disposals were largely attributable to the sale of selected
oil and gas investments in the North Sea to the Hungarian
MOL Group.
Impairments of €56 million were recognized in 2014. Due
to the weak development of the coal mining business in
China, impairments of €40 million relating to distribution,
­
supply and similar rights were recognized in the Construction
Chemicals division. The recoverable amount equals the value
in use amounting to €10 million. It was determined using a
weighted average cost of capital before taxes of 11.02%.
Transfers included a write-up of €5 million in 2014.

Including licenses to such rights and values

There were additions of €412 million to intangible assets in
2013 in connection with the acquisition of Pronova ­BioPharma
ASA. Of this amount, among other things, €164 million pertained to technologies, €141 million to goodwill and €83 million to other rights and values.
The transaction with Statoil ASA resulted in additions of
€675 million to intangible assets, €643 million of which to
goodwill and the remaining amount to other rights and values.
The disposal of a 15% share of the Edvard Grieg development
field reduced intangible assets by €70 million, of which €8 million represented a pro-rata share of goodwill.
In connection with the acquisition of Verenium, there were
additions of €20 million to intangible assets in 2013, of which
€4 million were to goodwill.
		

In other rights and values, the line item transfers includes
additions and market value adjustments of emission rights
recognized directly in equity as of the balance sheet date.
Disposals were primarily caused by the derecognition of
fully amortized intangible assets.
Impairments of €25 million were recognized in 2013,
­primarily related to licenses in the Oil & Gas segment and
customer relations in the Performance Products segment. The
recoverable amount was determined using the value in use.
Impairments are reported under other operating ­expenses.
There were no material reversals of impairments in 2013.

Additions to property, plant and equipment from investment
projects in 2014 amounted to €5,368 million. Significant
­investments were particularly related to the construction of a
TDI plant in Ludwigshafen, Germany; a production complex
for acrylic acid and superabsorbents in Camaçari, Brazil; an
MDI plant in Chongqing, China; and oil and gas production
facilities and wells in Europe and South America. Investments
for expansion purposes were particularly made at the
sites in Ludwigshafen, Germany; Antwerp, Belgium; Geismar,
­Louisiana; and Freeport, Texas. Property, plant and equipment rose by €1,001 million primarily from the acquisitions of
the assets from Statoil ASA, Stavanger, Norway.
In 2014, the impairments of €298 million recognized under
accumulated depreciation primarily concerned the Oil & Gas
segment. They mainly arose from the complete write-down of
property, plant and equipment due to projects for the
­development of a gas field in Qatar in the amount of €81 million as well as an oilfield in the United Kingdom in the amount

of €44 million. Furthermore, write-downs relating to oil and
gas fields in Norway and Germany of €94 million were recognized. The oil and gas fields were written down to their recoverable value amounting to €554 million. The recoverable values for the the individual oil and gas fields were calculated
using a weighted average cost of capital rate before taxes,
which ranged between 8.46% and 73,56%. The high capital
cost rates are due to the separate income tax for the oil and
gas industry in Norway. A plant in the Chemicals segment
was written down to its recoverable amount of €31 million,
requiring the recognition of an impairment in the amount of
€27 million. The weighted average cost of capital rate before
taxes used was 9.38%. The recoverable amount for impairments was determined using the v­ alue in use.
Disposals of property, plant and equipment were largely
attributable to the sale of selected oil and gas investments in
the North Sea to the Hungarian MOL Group.
In 2014, transfers included a write-up of €3 million.

Changes in scope of consolidation

Additions to property, plant and equipment from investment
projects in 2013 amounted to €4,917 million. Significant
­investments were particularly related to the construction of a
TDI plant in Ludwigshafen, Germany; an MDI plant in
­Chongqing, China; a production complex for acrylic acid and
superabsorbents in Camaçari, Brazil; and oil and gas production facilities and wells in Europe. Investments for expansion
purposes were particularly made at the sites in Ludwigshafen,
Germany; ­Antwerp, Belgium; Geismar, Louisiana; and Port
Arthur, ­
Texas. Property, plant and equipment rose by
€1,511 million on account of acquisitions; €1,204 million
came from the ­acquisition of assets from Statoil ASA, Stavanger, Norway, and €288 million from the acquisition of Pronova
BioPharma ASA, Lysaker, Norway.

Impairments of €213 million under accumulated depreciation
in 2013 resulted mostly from a fully impaired plant in the
Chemicals segment, as well as from a gas field development
project in the Oil & Gas segment that was impaired based on
a recoverable amount of €82 million. The recoverable amount
for both impairments was determined using the value in use.
Transfers of property, plant and equipment amounting to
€1,382 million, mainly ­machinery and technical equipment,
concerned the Oil & Gas segment. This was due to the reclassification of GASCADE Gastransport GmbH, Kassel, Ger­
many, from a fully consolidated company to a company
accounted for using the equity method, as well as to the
transfer of assets from a fully consolidated company to a
company accounted for using the equity m
­ ethod.
In 2013, transfers included a write-up of €1 million.

Manufacturing (Xinjiang) Co. Ltd., Korla, China, as well as a
capital increase in BASF Huntsman Shanghai Isocyanate
­Investment B.V., Arnheim, Netherlands, led to additions of
€40 million. Disposals of €781 million primarily resulted from
the sale of BASF’s share in Styrolution Holding GmbH to the
­INEOS Group. Transfers included the income of investments
accounted for using the equity method and dividend distributions. Of the transfers in 2013, €631 million was attributable
to the fair value measurement of GASCADE Gastransport
GmbH, Kassel, Germany, which was accounted for using the
equity method for the first time. At two investments ­accounted
for using the equity method, the e

The decrease in current loans and interest receivables was
primarily due to the repayment of loans granted by W & G
Beteiligungs-GmbH & Co. KG, Kassel, Germany, to NEL
Gastransport GmbH, Kassel, Germany, and GASCADE Gastransport GmbH, Kassel, Germany, in the amount of
€628 million. The issuance of new, noncurrent loans amounting to €697 million by WIGA Transport Beteiligungs-­GmbH &
Co. KG, Kassel, Germany, to NEL Gastransport GmbH and
GASCADE Gastransport GmbH led to a corresponding
­increase in noncurrent loans and interest receivables.

The increase in derivatives with positive fair values is
attributable to the increased fair value of commodity and
­
currency derivatives.
In 2014, prepaid expenses included prepayments for
operating expenses of €58 million (2013: €72 million) as well
as prepayments for insurance premiums of €31 million (2013:
€25 million).

BASF Report 2014 

Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes — Notes on Balance Sheet

The increase in other receivables from tax refund claims is
largely due to the higher corporate income tax receivables of
BASF SE and to foreign income tax receivables arising from a
tax agreement between Germany and the Netherlands.
Precious metal trading items primarily comprise physical items and precious metal accounts as well as long positions in precious metals, which are largely hedged through
sales or derivatives. The increase in precious metal trading
items was primarly attributable to an increased amount of
such items.

In other receivables which qualify as financial instruments, financial receivables such as receivables from the sale
of assets are reported. The increase in 2014 was particularly
due to the sale of BASF’s share in Styrolution to INEOS.

Even in the current economic environment, BASF does
not note any material changes in the credit quality of its
receivables. In 2014, after being individually assessed for
­
­impairment, valuation allowances of €65 million were recognized for trade accounts receivable and €23 million were

19 – Capital, reserves and retained earnings
Authorized capital
At the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 2, 2014, shareholders authorized the Board of Executive Directors, with the
approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the subscribed
capital by issuing new registered shares up to a total of
€500 million against cash or contributions in kind through
May 1, 2019. The Board of Executive Directors is empowered, following the approval of the Supervisory Board, to
­decide on the exclusion of shareholders’ subscription rights
for these new shares in certain predefined cases covered by
the enabling resolution. Until now, this option has not been
exercised and no new shares have been issued.
BASF SE has only issued fully paid-up registered shares
with no par value. There are no preferences or other restrictions. BASF SE does not hold any treasury shares.

Reserves and retained earnings
Capital surplus includes effects from BASF’s share program,
premiums from capital increases and consideration for
­warrants and negative goodwill from the capital consolidation
resulting from acquisitions of subsidiaries in exchange for the
issue of BASF SE shares at par value.

­already controls or includes as a joint arrangement in the
Consolidated Financial Statements is treated as a transaction
between shareholders, as long as this does not lead to a
change in the consolidation method. There were no trans­
actions of this type in 2014, as in the previous year.

Payment of dividends
In accordance with the resolution of the Annual Meeting on
May 2, 2014, BASF SE paid a dividend of €2.70 per share from
the retained profit of the 2013 fiscal year. With 918,478,694
shares entitled to dividends, this amounts to a total dividend
payout of €2,479,892,473.80.

20 – Other comprehensive income
Other comprehensive income

Measurement of securities at fair value

The income and expenses shown in other comprehensive
­income are divided into two categories. Items that will be
­recognized in the income statement in the future (known as
“recycling”) and those that will not. The first category includes
translation adjustments, the measurement of securities at fair
value, and changes in the fair value of derivatives held to
hedge future cash flows and net investments in a foreign
­operation. Items in other comprehensive income that will not
be reclassified to the income statement in the future include
effects from the remeasurement of defined benefit plans and
the remeasurement of assets and liabilities due to acquisition
of a majority interest.

For fully and proportionally consolidated companies, as well
as those companies which are accounted for using the equity
method, changes in value of available-for-sale securities in
excess of their acquisition costs are accounted for in other
comprehensive income, without impacting the income statement, until the securities are disposed of. Upon disposal, the
changes accumulated in other comprehensive income are
recognized in the income statement.

Translation adjustments
The translation adjustments due to the use of the closing rate
method are shown under currency translation adjustments as
a component of other comprehensive income in equity (translation adjustments) and are recognized in the income statement only upon the disposal of a company.

Cash flow hedges
Derivatives are used to hedge future cash flows. The effective
portion of the change in value of these derivatives is recognized in equity. This also comprises equity effects from the
hedging of future cash flows at companies accounted for
­using the equity method.
The significant decline in the hedging of future cash flows
in 2014 was primarily a result of the increase in the negative
market valuation of commodity derivatives at WINGAS GmbH.
For more information on cash flow hedge accounting, see Note 27.4 on
page 216

BASF Report 2014 

Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes — Notes on Balance Sheet

Hedging future cash flows at Nord Stream AG, Zug, Switzerland, a company accounted for using the equity method,
­resulted in a change of minus €29 million in 2014 and of
€30 million in 2013.

Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
Hedge accounting can be used to hedge the translation ­risk
from the net investment in a foreign operation. Effects
­recorded in equity are recognized in the income statement
upon sale of the operation or return of the investment.

Remeasurement of defined benefit plans
Actuarial gains and losses from changed estimations with
­regard to actuarial assumptions used for calculating defined
pension obligations, as well as the difference between
­standardized and actual returns on plan assets, are recognized directly in equity as other comprehensive income.

Remeasurement due to acquisition of majority
of shares
Until 2008, effects from the revaluation of net assets were
recorded in equity when they arose due to the acquisition of a
majority of shares in a previously proportionally consolidated
company. Additional depreciation of these revalued assets
led to a reversal of the corresponding item diretly in equity
until 2013.

22 – P
 rovisions for pensions and similar obligations
In addition to state pension plans, most employees are granted
company pension benefits from either defined contribution or
defined benefit plans. Benefits generally depend on years of
service, employee contributions or compensation, and take into
consideration the legal framework of labor, tax and social secu­
rity laws of the countries where the companies are located. To
limit the risks of changing financial market conditions as well as
demographic developments, employees have been almost
exclu­sively offered defined contribution plans for future years of
service in recent years.

The Group Pension Committee monitors the risks of all pension
plans of the Group. In this connection, it issues guidelines regarding the governance and risk management of pensions plans,
particularly with regard to the funding of the pension plans and
the portfolio structure of the existing plan assets. The organization, responsibilites, strategy, implementation and reporting
require­ments are documented for the specialist units involved.

199

200

Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes — Notes on Balance Sheet

Economic and legal environment
In some countries – especially in Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Belgium – there are
pension obligations subject to a governmental supervisory
authority or similar legal restrictions. For example, there are
minimum funding requirements to cover pension obligations,
which are based on actuarial assumptions that may differ
from those in IAS 19. Furthermore, there are restrictions in
qualitative and quantitative terms for the investment in
different asset categories. This could result in fluctuating
­
employer contributions, financing requirements and the
­
­assumption of obligations in favor of the pension funds to
comply with the regulatory requirements.
The obligations and the plan assets used to fund the
­obligations are exposed to demographic, legal and economic
risks. Economic risks are primarily due to unforeseen
­developments in goods and capital markets. They affect, for
example, pension adjustments based on the level of inflation
in Germany and in the United Kingdom, as well as the impact
of the discount rate to be applied to the amount of the defined
benefit ­obligation. In previous years, measures taken to close
plans with defined benefits for future service, especially benefits based on final pay promises and the assumption of healthcare costs for former employees, however, led to a reduction
in risk with regard to future benefit levels.
The strategy of the BASF Group with regard to financing
pension committments is aligned with country-specific supervisory and tax regluations.

Description of the defined benefit plans
Germany
For BASF SE and German Group companies, a basic level of
benefits is provided by BASF Pensionskasse VVaG, a legally
­independent funded plan, which is financed by contributions of
employees and the employer as well as the return on plan
­assets. BASF SE will ensure the necessary contributions to adequately finance the benefits promised by BASF Pensionskasse
VVaG. Some of the benefits financed via BASF Pensionskasse
VVaG are subject to adjustments that must be borne by its
sponsoring member companies to the extent that these cannot
be borne by BASF Pensionskasse VVaG due to the regulations
imposed by the German supervisory authority. In 2004, the ­basic
benefits plan at BASF was closed for new employees at German
BASF companies and replaced by a defined contribution plan.
At BASF SE, occupational pension promises that e
­ xceed the
basic level of benefits are financed under a contractual trust
arrange­ment by BASF Pensionstreuhand e.V.; at German Group
­companies, these benefits are almost exclusively ­financed via
pension provisions. The benefits are largely based on cash
­balance plans. Furthermore, employees are given the option of
participating in various deferred compensation schemes.

BASF Report 2014

United States
Employees of U.S. companies receive benefits from defined
contribution plans. The existing defined benefit plans were
closed to further i­ncreases in benefits based on future years
of service, and benefits earned in the past have been frozen.
There is no entitlement to pension adjustments to compensate for cost-of-living increases. For future years of service,
employees are granted benefits based on defined contribution
plans.
The legal and regulatory frameworks governing the plans
are based on the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security
Act (ERISA), which requires the plan sponsor to ensure a
minimum funding level. Any employer contributions necessary
to meet the minimum funding level would be based on the
results of an actuarial valuation. Furthermore, there are
­unfunded pension plans that are not subject to ERISA.
Additional similar obligations arise from plans which
­assume the healthcare costs and life insurance premiums of
retired employees and their dependents. Such plans are
closed to new entrants since 2007. In addition, the amount of
the benefits for such plans is frozen.
Switzerland
The employees of the BASF Group in Switzerland receive a
company pension, which is financed through a pension fund
by employer and employee contributions as well as the return
on plan assets. The pension plan is accounted for as a ­defined
benefit plan, as the obligatory minimum pension guaranteed
by law according to the Swiss law “Berufliche Vorsorge (BVG)”
is included in the scheme. All benefits vest immediately.
According to government regulations, the employer is
­
­obligated to make contributions, so that the pension fund is
able to grant minimum benefits guaranteed by law. The
management of the pension fund, where employer and
­
­employees are equally represented, manages and governs
the benefit plan and assets.
United Kingdom
The BASF Group maintains defined benefit plans in the United
Kingdom, which were closed to further increases in benefits
from future years of service. A part of the workforce still
receives benefit increases depending on service period in
­
connection with a career average plan. Adjustments to
compensate for increases in the cost of living until the
­
­beginning of retirement are legally required for beneficiaries of
defined benefit plans.
The financing of the pension plans is determined by the
provisions of the regulatory authority for pensions and the
relevant social and labor law requirements. The defined
­benefit plans are administered by a trust company, whose
Board of Trustees, according to the trustee agreement and
law, represents the interests of the beneficiaries and ensures
that the benefits can be paid in the future. The required
­funding is determined using technical valuations according to
local regulations every three years.

Following the closure of defined benefit plans, employees are

The assumptions used to ascertain the defined benefit
­obligation as of December 31 are used in the following year to
determine the expenses for pension plans.
A Group-wide, uniform procedure is used to determine
the discount rates used for the valuation of material pension
obligations of the BASF Group. Accordingly, the discount
rates were derived from the yields on corporate bonds in the
respective currency zones with an issuing volume of more
than 100 million units of the respective currency with a minimum rating of AA– up to AA+ from at least one of the three
rating agencies: Fitch, Moody’s, or Standard & Poor’s.
The valuation of the defined benefit obligation is generally
made using the most recent actuarial mortality tables as

of December 31 of the respective financial year, which in Ger­
many and the U
­ nited States are derived from the BASF Group
population and last updated for the pension obligations in
Germany in 2010 and for the pension obligations in the United
States in 2014.

The standardized return on plan assets is calculated by
­multiplying plan assets at the beginning of the year with the
discount rate used for existing defined benefit obligation at the
beginning of the year, taking into account benefit and con­
tribution payments expected to be made during the year.

The increase in employer contributions arose from a payment
in the amount of $250 million to the plan assets of U.S.
companies.
The estimated contributions for defined benefit plans for
2015 are €291 million.

Assets from overfunded plans can only be recognized to the

are not met, recognition is not possible due to the necessity

Explanations regarding plan assets
The target asset allocation has been defined by using asset
­liability studies and is reviewed regularly. Accordingly, plan
assets are taken into consideration considering the risks
­
asso­ciated with the specific asset classes and the regulations
relating to the investment of plan assets are aligned with the
long-term ­
development of the obligations. The existing
portfolio structure is oriented towards the target asset
­
­allocation. In addition, current market assessments are taken
into consideration. In order to mitigate risks and maximize
returns, a widely spread global portfolio of individual asset
classes is held.
Liability-driven investment (LDI) techniques, such as
hedging the risk of changes in interest rates and inflation, are
used in particular pension plans, especially in the U.K. and
U.S. plans.

Almost all of the equities are priced on active m
­ arkets. The
category debt instruments includes ­promissory notes and
deben­
tures (Pfandbriefe), which were acquired through
private placements with a market value in the amount of
€1,381 million in 2014 and €1,676 million in 2013. For such
securities, especially those held by domestic pension plans,

there is no active market. The capital market compensates for
this lack of fungibility with yield premiums depending on the
maturity. There is no active markets for plan assets in real
estate and alternative investments – except in exceptional
cases.
The asset class debt instruments comprises promissory
notes and debentures (Pfandbriefe) in addition to corporate
and government bonds. Government bonds primarily
concern bonds from those countries enjoying the highest
­
credit ratings such as the United States, the United Kingdom
and Switzerland. Corporate bonds mainly comprise investment-grade bonds, whereby particular high-yield bonds are
also held to a limited extent. In connection with the ongoing
monitoring of default risk based on a given risk budget and on
the continuous oberservation of the development of the
creditworthiness of issuers, an adjustment of plan asset
­
allocation to a revised market assessment may be made, if
necessary. Alternative investments largely comprise investments in private equity, absolute return funds and senior
­secured loans.
On December 31, 2014, plan assets contained securities
issued by BASF Group companies with a market value of
€10 million in 2014 and €8 million in 2013. The market value
of the properties of legally independent pension funds rented
to BASF Group companies amounted to €168 million on
­December 31, 2014, and €76 million on December 31, 2013.
The increase was due to BASF Pensionskasse’s construction
and leasing of a new office building in Germany.
Since 2010 there has been an agreement between
BASF SE and BASF Pensionskasse about the granting of
profit participation capital with a nominal value of €80 million,
which is used to strengthen the financing of the BASF
­Pensionskasse. No material transactions beyond this took
place between the legally independent pension funds and
BASF Group companies in 2014.
The funding of the plans was as follows:

Restoration obligations primarily relate to the estimated
costs for the filling of wells and the removal of production
equipment after the end of production. The increase in
­long-term provisions was mainly due to taking over provisions
in the Oil & Gas ­segment as a result of the acquisition of the
production fields of Statoil and the compounding of p
­ rovisions.
Provisions for environmental protection and remediation costs cover expected costs for rehabilitating contaminated sites, recultivating landfills, removal of environmental
contamination at existing production or storage sites and
similar measures. In addition, provisions are recognized in
connection with the allocation of emission certificates from
the German Emissions Trading Authority or other similar
­bodies. The increase in provisions was almost entirely attributable to foreign currency effects.
Provisions for employee obligations include obligations
for the granting of long-service bonuses, anniversary payments, variable compensation including associated social
security contributions, and other accruals as well as provisions for early retirement programs for employees nearing
retirement.

The restructuring measures provisions include severance
payments to employees as well as expected costs for site
closures, including the costs for demolition and similar
­measures. The decrease was largely due to the utilization of
provisions for restructuring programs in the Performance
Products segment in Europe. On the balance sheet date,
€125 million was attributable to provisions for severance
payments.
Provisions for litigation, damage claims, guarantees
and similar commitments include the expected costs of
litigation, obligations under damage claims, and other
­
­guarantees.
Other includes long-term tax provisions as well as further
present obligations and accruals. The increase largely r­ esulted
from a tax refund in 2014, which was deducted in the calculation of the provision for tax risk items in the previous year.
The following table shows the development of other
­provisions by category. Other changes include changes in the
scope of consolidation, currency effects and the reclassifi­
cation of obligations to liabilities when the amount and timing
of these obligations become known.

	For more information on provisions for the long-term incentive program,
see Note 30 from page 219 onward

The sales and purchase risks provisions include warranties,
product liability, customer rebates and other price reductions,
sales commissions, and provisions for expected losses on
committed purchases as well as provisions for onerous
­contracts. Currency effects led to higher values at year end.

Unused credit lines

Other bonds consist primarily of industrial revenue and pollution
control bonds of the BASF Corporation group that were used to
finance investments in the United States. Both the weighted-­
average interest rate of these bonds as well as their
­weighted-average effective interest rate amounted to 1.6% in
2014 and in 2013. The average residual term amounted to
222 months as of December 31, 2014 (December 31, 2013:
235 months).

BASF SE had committed and unused credit lines with variable
interest rates amounting to €6,000 million as of December 31,
2014 and as of December 31, 2013.

Liabilities to credit institutions
In order to finance natural gas trading and storage business,
a €1,650 million loan was incurred with a 5-year term at an
interest rate of 1.08%. A corresponding loan in the amount of
€1,000 million due in 2016 was repaid early. As a result of
higher volumes of loans in emerging countries, the weighted-­
average interest rate on loans increased to 4.0% in 2014
compared with 2.8% in 2013.

to the development of oil prices as well as foreign currency
forward contracts resulting from the appreciation of the U.S.
dollar relative to the euro. The derecognition of o

the disposal of BASF’s share in Styrolution Holding GmbH
had a countering effect on the noncurrent derivative instruments with negative fair values.

Assets used under long-term leases
Assets used under long-term leases primarily concern
­buildings and IT infrastructure.

BASF purchases raw materials via long-term contracts and
spot markets. The fixed purchase obligations of long-term
purchase contracts with a remaining term of at least one year
as of December 31, 2014, are as follows:

Purchase obligations from long-term natural
gas and raw material purchase contracts

The reduction of purchase obligations from natural gas and
raw material purchase contracts from €164,409 million in
2013 to €131,851 million in 2014 was primarily attributable to
the decline in oil prices.

BASF has entered into long-term purchase contracts for
natural gas in the Natural Gas Trading business sector which
are subject to ongoing price adjustments. These ­purchase
obligations mainly relate to long-term supply c
­ ontracts with
natural gas purchasers with terms between one and 17 years.

26 – Risks from litigation and claims
On August 12, 2014, Metrogas S.A., Chile, filed its Statement of Claim in the arbitration proceedings initiated in May
2013 against Wintershall Energia S.A., Argentina (WIAR),
Total Austral S.A. and Pan American Energy LLC. Metrogas
claims damages valued at an amount of €180 million as a
result of insufficient gas deliveries under a natural gas supply contract entered into by Metrogas and the defendants,
as sellers, in 1997. WIAR’s share of supply in the contract is
37.5%. The defendants submitted their response to the
proof of claim on December 10, 2014. They are of the opinion that Metrogas does not have any claim for damages.
BASF Corporation has potential liability under the
­Comprehensive Response, Compensation and Liability Act
of 1980, as amended, and related state laws for investigation and cleanup at certain sites. The Lower Passaic River
Study Area (LPRSA) is one such site comprising the lower
17 miles of the Passaic River. BASF Corporation along with
more than 60 other potentially responsible parties agreed
with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to
perform remedial investigations and feasibility studies of the
LPRSA. In April 2014, USEPA issued its focused feasibility
study, identifying various alternatives for the lower eight

miles of the Passaic River. After reviewing the comments on
the study, USEPA will prepare a responsiveness summary
and make a cleanup decision, which is anticipated in 2015.
As the cost of the final remedy remains uncertain and the
Company has found no evidence that it contributed any of
the primary contaminants of concern to the Passaic River,
BASF cannot reliably estimate its portion of the final costs
for this matter at this time.
Furthermore, BASF SE and its affiliated companies are
defendants in or parties to a variety of judicial, arbitrational
or regulatory proceedings on a recurring basis. To our
­current knowledge, none of these proceedings will have a
material effect on the economic situation of BASF. This
­includes a civil case for damages brought in the Southern
District of New York against BASF Metals Limited, based in
London, England, by a U.S. jewelry business in November
2014, and two lawsuits with identical allegations brought in
the same court in January and February 2015. BASF Metals
Limited and three other defendants are a
­ccused of
improper conduct concerning the calculation of the market
prices of platinum and palladium. BASF will d
­ efend itself
against this lawsuit.

27 – Supplementary information on financial instruments
27.1 – Financial risks

Exposure and sensitivity by currency (in million €)

Market risks
Foreign currency risks: Changes in exchange rates could
lead to negative changes in the value of financial instruments
and adverse changes in future cash flows from planned transactions. Foreign currency risks from financial instruments
result from the translation at the closing rate of financial
­
­receivables, loans, securities, cash and financial liabilities into
the functional currency of the respective Group company.
Foreign currency contracts in a variety of currencies are used
to hedge foreign exchange risks from primary financial
­instruments and planned transactions.
The foreign currency risk exposure corresponds to the net
amount of the nominal volume of the primary and the derivative financial instruments which are exposed to currency risks.
In addition, planned purchase and sales transactions of the
respective following year are included, if they fall under the
currency risk management system. Opposite positions in the
same currency are offset against each other.
The sensitivity analysis is conducted by simulating a 10%
depreciation in all currencies against the respective functional
currency. The effect on BASF’s income before taxes and
­minority interests would have been minus €351 million as of
December 31, 2014, and minus €286 million as of Decem­
ber 31, 2013. The effect from the items designated under
hedge accounting would have increased the equity of the
share­holders of BASF SE before income taxes by €48 million
on December 31, 2014 (2013: increase of €93 million). This
­refers to transactions in U.S. dollars and British pounds. The
currency ­exposure amounted to €2,009 million on Decem­
ber 31, 2014 (December 31, 2013: €1,905 million).

Due to the use of options to hedge currency risks, the sensitivity analysis is not a linear function of the assumed changes
in exchange rates.
Interest rate risks: Interest rate risks result from changes
in prevailing market interest rates, which can cause a change
in the fair value of fixed-rate instruments, and changes in the
interest payments of variable-rate instruments. To hedge
these risks, interest rate swaps and combined interest rate
and currency derivatives are used. While these risks are
­relevant to the financing activities of BASF, they are not of
material significance for BASF’s operating activities.
The variable interest exposure, which also includes fixed
rate bonds set to mature in the following year, amounted to
minus €3,343 million as of December 31, 2014, compared
with minus €2,666 million as of December 31, 2013. An
­increase in all relevant interest rates by one percentage point
would have raised income before taxes and minority interests
by €12 million as of December 31, 2014, and raised income
before taxes and minority interests by €6 million as of December 31, 2013. The effect from the items designated under
hedge accounting would have increased the equity of the
shareholders of BASF SE before income taxes by €30 million
on December 31, 2014 (2013: increase of €19 million).

BASF Report 2014 

Options for disposal of shareholdings: BASF and INEOS
had agreed upon options for BASF’s withdrawal from the
shareholding in Styrolution. These options were classified as
derivatives according to IAS 39. A significant risk variable
which was decisive for the valuation of both options is the
value of the company. In June 2014, BASF and Ineos agreed
on a sales transaction that was successfully concluded in
November 2014; because of the transaction, these options
no longer exist as of December 31, 2014.
Commodity price risks: Some of BASF’s divisions are
exposed to strong fluctuations in raw material prices. These
result primarily from the following raw materials: naphtha,
propylene, benzene, lauric oils, titanium dioxide, cyclohexane,
methanol, natural gas, butadiene, LPG condensate, ammonia
and precious metals. BASF takes the following measures to
reduce price risks associated with the purchase of raw
­materials:
––BASF uses commodity derivatives to hedge the risks from
the volatility of raw material prices. These are primarily
­options and swaps on crude oil, oil products and natural
gas.
––In order to secure margins, the Oil & Gas segment uses
commodity derivatives, primarily swaps on oil products.
Risks to margins arise in volatile markets when purchase
and sales contracts are priced differently.
––The Catalysts division enters into both short-term and longterm purchase contracts with precious metal p
­ roducers. It
also buys precious metals on spot markets from a variety
of business partners. The price risk from precious metals
purchased to be sold on to third parties, or for use in the
production of catalysts, is hedged using derivative instruments. This is mainly done using forward contracts which
are settled by either entering into offsetting contracts or by
delivering the precious metals.
––In the Crop Protection division, the sales prices of products
are sometimes coupled to the price of certain agricultural
commodities. To hedge the resulting risks, derivatives on
agricultural commodities are concluded.
In addition, BASF holds limited unhedged precious metal and
oil product positions, which can also include derivatives, for
trading on its own account. The value of these positions is
exposed to market price volatility and is subject to constant
monitoring.
In connection with CO2 emissions trading, various types of
CO2 certificates are purchased and sold using forward
­contracts. The goal of these transactions is to benefit from
market price differences. These deals are settled by physical
delivery. As of December 31, 2014 as well as of December 31,
2013, there were no deals outstanding. Furthermore, BASF
utilizes emission certificate derivatives on a limited scale.
By holding commodity derivatives and precious metal
trading positions, BASF is exposed to price risks. The valuation of commodity derivatives and precious metal trading
­positions at fair value means that adverse changes in market
prices could negatively affect the earnings and equity of
BASF.

Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes — Notes on Balance Sheet

BASF performs value-at-risk analyses for all commodity
­derivatives and precious metals trading positions. Using the
value-at-risk analysis, we continually quantify market risk and
forecast the maximum possible loss within a given confidence
interval over a defined period. The value-at-risk calculation is
based on a confidence interval of 95% and a holding period
of one day. A confidence interval of 95% means that there is
a 95% probability that the maximum loss does not exceed the
value at risk within a one-day period. The value-at-risk
calculation for precious metals is based on a confidence
­
­interval of 99%. BASF uses the variance-covariance ­approach.
BASF uses value at risk as a supplement to other risk
management tools and also sets volume-based, exposure
and stop loss limits.

The exposure corresponds to the net amount of all long and

For more information regarding financial risks and BASF’s risk
management, see the chapter “Opportunities and risks report”
in the Management’s Report from page 111 onward

Default and credit risk
Default and credit risks arise when counterparties do not fulfill
their contractual obligations. BASF regularly analyzes the
creditworthiness of each significant debtor and grants credit
limits on the basis of this analysis. Due to the global activities
and diversified customer structure of the BASF Group, there
is no significant concentration of default risk. The carrying
amount of all receivables, loans and interest-bearing s­ ecurities
plus the nominal value of contingent liabilities excluding
potential warranty obligations represents the maximum
­
­default risk for BASF.
For more information on credit risks, see Note 18 from page 196 onward

BASF Report 2014

Liquidity risks
BASF promptly recognizes any risks from cash flow fluctuations as part of the liquidity planning. BASF has ready access
to sufficient liquid funds through its ongoing commercial
­paper program and confirmed lines of credit from banks.

Derivatives are included using their net cash flows, p
­ rovided
they have a negative fair value and therefore represent a liability. Derivatives with positive fair values are assets and are
therefore not considered.
Trade accounts payable are generally interest-free and
due within one year. Therefore the carrying amount of trade
accounts payable equals the sum of future cash flows.

27.2 – Maturity analysis
The interest and principal payments as well as other payments
for derivative financial instruments are relevant for the presentation of the maturities of the contractual cash flows from
­financial liabilities. Future cash flows are not discounted here.

27.3 – Classes and categories of financial

instruments
For trade accounts receivable, other receivables and miscellaneous assets, loans, cash and cash equivalents, as well as
trade accounts payable and other liabilities, the carrying
amount approximates the fair value. Shareholdings which are
not traded on an active market and whose fair value could
not be reliably determined are recognized at amortized cost
and are reported under other financial assets.

The carrying amount of shareholdings which are traded on
an active market and therefore recognized at fair value
amounted to less than €1 million as of December 31, 2014
and €1 million as of December 31, 2013. They are included
in other financial assets.
	For more information, see Note 16 from page 195 onward

The carrying amount of financial indebtedness amounted to
€15,384 million on December 31, 2014 (December 31, 2013:
€14,407 million). The fair value of financial indebtedness
amounted to €16,194 million at the end of 2014 (end of
2013: €14,918 million). The fair value of financial indebtedness is determined on the basis of interbank interest rates.
The difference between carrying amounts and fair values
­results primarily from changes in market interest rates.

Derivatives whose fair value is calculated using parameters
not observable on the market (level 3) comprised exclusively
in the previous year the options agreed upon with INEOS
regarding the sale of BASF’s share in Styrolution Holding
­
GmbH. The sale and purchase options were shown on the
balance sheet under other noncurrent receivables or other
noncurrent liabilities. As of December 31, 2013, the market
value of these options amounted to minus €116 million. Until
the announcement of the sales agreement with INEOS in

June 2014, the fair value of the options in the reporting year
led to an expense of minus €42 million, which was recognized
in the financial result. Upon conclusion of the divestiture of
Styrolution in November 2014, the fair value of the options
amounting to minus €158 million was derecognized against
disposal gains.

The table “Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities”
shows the extent to which financial assets and financial
­liabilities are offset in the balance sheet, as well as potential
effects from the offsetting of instruments subject to a legally
enforceable global netting agreement or similar agreement. In
accordance with IAS 32, financial assets and liabilities can
only be offset if a company has a legal right of set-off and
­intends to settle on a net basis.
Deviations from the derivatives with positive and negative
fair values reported in other receivables and other liabilities at
the end of 2013 arose mainly from options for the disposal of
shareholdings, since these are not subject to netting agreements and therefore are not included in the table above. The
same applies to both reporting years for embedded derivatives as well as derivatives which are not subject to netting
agreements.

Relating to
financial
collateral

Potential
net amount

Net gains and losses from financial instruments comprise the
results of valuations, the amortization of discounts, the recognition and reversal of impairments, results from the translation
of foreign currencies as well as interest, dividends and all
other effects on the earnings resulting from financial instruments. The line item financial instruments at fair value through
profit or loss contains only those gains and losses from instruments which are not designated as hedging instruments as
defined by IAS 39. Net gains or net losses from available-forsale financial assets contain income from write-downs/writeups, interest, dividends and the reclassification of valuation
effects from equity on the sale of the securities and shareholdings.
The net losses from financial liabilities measured at amortized cost primarily relates to the results from the translation of
foreign currencies.
	The gains and losses from the valuation of securities and shareholdings
recognized in the equity of the shareholders of BASF SE are shown in
the Statement of income and expense recognized in equity on page 156.

27.4 – Derivative instruments and hedge
­accounting
The use of derivative instruments
BASF is exposed to foreign-currency, interest-rate and
­commodity-price risks during the normal course of business.
These risks are hedged through a centrally determined
­strategy employing derivative instruments. In addition, derivative instruments are used to replace primary financial instruments, such as fixed-interest securities. Hedging is only
­employed for underlying positions from the operating business, cash investments, and financing as well as for planned
sales and raw material purchases. The risks from the underlying transactions and the derivatives are constantly monitored.
Where derivatives have a positive market value, BASF is

event of nonperformance of the other party. To minimize the
default risk on derivatives with positive market values, transactions are exclusively conducted with creditworthy banks
and partners and are subject to predefined credit limits.
To ensure effective risk management, risk positions are
centralized at BASF SE and certain Group companies.
­Contracting and execution of derivative financial instruments
for hedging purposes are conducted according to internal
guidelines, and are subject to strict control mechanisms.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments are
­calculated using valuation models which use input para­meters
observable on the market. Exceptions to this are some
­commodity derivatives, whose valuation is based directly on
market prices.

Notes — Notes on Balance Sheet

Cash flow hedge accounting
Some of the planned purchases of naphtha are hedged using
swaps and options on oil and oil products. Some of these
hedges were shown in the Consolidated Financial Statements
of the BASF Group by means of cash flow hedge accounting,
where gains and losses from hedges were initially recognized
directly in equity. Gains and losses from hedges are included
in cost of sales at the point in time at which the hedged item
is recognized in the consolidated statement of income.
Furthermore, cash flow hedge accounting is used to a
minor extent for natural gas purchases.
Cash flow hedge accounting is applied in the Natural Gas
Trading business sector for crude oil swaps concluded in
­order to hedge price risks from purchase and sales contracts
for natural gas. These contracts have variable prices and the
price formula is coupled with the oil price.
The majority of the planned transactions and their effect
on earnings occur in the year following the balance sheet
date. A small part relates to subsequent years. In 2014, effective changes in the fair value of hedging instruments of minus
€322 million (2013: minus €9 million) was recognized in the
equity of the shareholders of BASF SE. In 2014, effective
changes in the fair value of hedging instruments of €19 million
were derecognized from the equity of shareholders of
BASF SE and recorded as an expense in cost of sales. In
2013, there was an expense of €9 million in this regard. The
ineffective part in the change in value of the hedge amounted
to minus €4 million in 2014 and €2 million in 2013. This
amount was reported in the income statement in cost of
sales, in other operating income and in other operating
expen­ses.
BASF uses cash flow hedge accounting for derivatives
used to hedge foreign currency risks from gas purchase and
sales contracts. In 2014, the effective change in values of the
hedges was minus €110 million (2013: minus €32 million),
which was recognized in the equity of the shareholders of
BASF SE. There were no ineffective parts. The amounts
derecognized from the equity of shareholders of BASF SE
­increased cost of sales by €101 million (2013: €21 million).

BASF Report 2014

BASF also uses cash flow hedge accounting for some foreign
currency derivatives to hedge planned sales denominated in
U.S. dollars. The impact on earnings from the underlying
transactions will occur in 2015. In 2014, the effective change
in values of the hedges was minus €66 million (2013: minus
€18 million), which was recognized in the equity of the shareholders of BASF SE. A total of €37 million (2013: €43 million)
was derecognized from the equity of shareholders of BASF SE
and was booked in expenses from foreign currency transactions. The hedge was entirely effective.
The interest rate risk of the Floating Rate Notes issued by
BASF SE in the reporting year (€300 million note 2014/2017)
as well as the Floating Rate Notes issued in the previous year
were hedged using interest rate swaps. The bonds and the
interest rate swaps were designated in a hedging relationship.
In 2014, the effective change in the fair value of the hedging
instruments was minus €22 million (2013: minus €10 million)
and was recognized in the equity of the shareholders of
BASF SE. There were no ineffective parts.
Furthermore, BASF SE’s fixed-rate U.S. private placement
of $1.25 billion, issued in the previous year, was converted
into euros using currency swaps. This hedge was designated
as a cash flow hedge. The hedge was entirely effective. In
2014, the change in values recognized in the equity of the
shareholders of BASF SE amounted to €38 million (2013:
minus €7 million). In 2014, €110 million was derecognized
from other comprehensive income and recorded as ­income in
the financial result (2013: €14 million income in fi­nancial
­result).

covered by a contractual trust arrangement.
Cash used in investing activities included payments for
acquisitions amounting to €963 million (2013: €1,156 million).
These arose from the purchase of shares in producing oil
and gas fields as well as exploration licenses from Statoil,
Stavanger, Norway, and Tullow Oil Norge AS, Oslo, Norway.
Payments from divestitures in the amount of €1,336 million
(2013: €63 million) were primarily attributable to the sale of
the 50% share in Styrolution Holding GmbH to the INEOS
Group in the amount of around €900 million. Divestitures also
included payments arising from the disposal of shares in
non-BASF-operated oil and gas fields to the MOL Group, as
well as from the sale of the PolyAd Services business to
Edge­water Capital Partners, L.P., Cleveland, Ohio. The payments for property, plant and equipment, and intangible
­assets in the amount of €5,296 million included investments
for 2014, to the extent that they a
­ lready had an effect on
cash.
Cash and cash equivalents were not subject to any utilization restrictions, as in the previous year.

Capital structure management
The aim of capital structure management is to maintain the
financial flexibility needed to further develop BASF’s business
portfolio and take advantage of strategic opportunities. The
objectives of the Company’s financing policy are to secure
solvency, limit financial risks and optimize the cost of capital.

Capital structure management focuses on meeting the
­requirements needed to ensure unrestricted access to capital
markets and a solid “A” rating. BASF’s capital structure is
managed using selected financial ratios, such as dynamic
debt ratios, as part of the company’s financial planning. The
equity of the BASF Group as reported in the balance sheet
amounted to €28,195 million as of December 31, 2014
(Decem­ber 31, 2013: €27,673 million); the ­equity ratio was
39.5% on December 31, 2014 (December 31, 2013: 43.1%).
BASF prefers to access external financing on the capital
markets. A commercial paper program is used for short-term
financing, while corporate bonds are used for financing in the
medium and long term. These are issued in euros and other
currencies with different maturities. The goal is to create a
balanced maturity proﬁle and diverse range of investors, and
to optimize our debt capital ﬁnancing conditions.
As a part of risk management, activities in countries with
transfer restrictions are continuously monitored. This includes,
for example, regular analysis of the macroeconomic and ­legal
environment, shareholders’ equity and the business model of
the operating unit. The chief aim is the reduction of counterparty, transfer and currency risks for the BASF Group.
Currently, BASF has the following ratings:

Moody’s confirmed BASF’s short-term and long-term rating
on October 31, 2014 and Standard and Poor’s on December 11, 2014 with a stable outlook.
BASF continues to strive for at least a solid “A” rating,
which ensures unrestricted access to financial and capital
markets.

30 – Share-price-based compensation program and BASF incentive share program
Share-price-based compensation program
In 2014, BASF continued its share-price-based compensation program known as the long-term incentive (LTI) program
for ­senior executives of the BASF Group. This program has
been in place since 1999. Approximately 1,200 senior executives, including the Board of Executive Directors, are currently
entitled to participate in this program. This program provides
for the granting of virtual options, which are settled in cash
when exercised.
Participation in the LTI program is voluntary. In order to
take part in the program, a participant must make a personal
investment: A participant must hold BASF shares amounting
to 10% to 30% of his or her individual variable compensation
for a two-year period from the granting of the option (holding
period). The number of shares to be held is determined by the
amount of ­variable compensation and the weighted-average
market price for BASF shares on the first business day after
the Annual ­Shareholders’ Meeting, which was €80.96 on
May 5, 2014.
The participant receives four option rights per invested
share. Each option consists of two parts, right A and right B,
which may be exercised if defined thresholds have been met:
The threshold of right A is met if the price of the BASF share
has increased by more than 30% in comparison with the base
price (absolute threshold). The value of right A will be the
­difference between the market price of BASF shares on the
exercise date and the base price; it is limited to 100% of the
base price. Right B may be exercised if the cumulative percentage performance of BASF shares exceeds (relative
threshold) the percentage p
­ erformance of the MSCI World
Chemicals ­IndexSM (MSCI Chemicals). The value of right B will
be the base price of the option multiplied by twice the
­percentage outperformance of BASF s­ hares compared with
the MSCI Chemicals Index on the exercise date. It is limited
to the closing price on the date of exercise minus the computed nominal value of BASF shares. Beginning with the 2013
(LTI) program, right B is only valuable if the price of BASF
shares at least corresponds with the base price. The options
were granted on July 1, 2014, and may be exercised following
a two-year vesting period, between July 1, 2016, and
June 30, 2022. During the exercise period, there are certain
times (closed periods) during which the options may not be
exercised. Each option can only be exercised in full. This
means that one of the performance targets must be surpassed. If the other performance target is not surpassed and
the option is exercised, the other option right lapses.
A participant’s ­maximum gain from exercising an option is
limited to five times the original individual investment starting
with the 2013 LTI program. The maximum gain from exercising an option is ­limited to ten times the original individual
investment for programs from previous years. Option rights
are nontransferable and are forfeited if the option holders no
longer work for BASF or have sold part of their individual
­investment before the e
­ xpiry of the two-year vesting period.
They remain valid in the case of retirement. For the members
of the Board of ­E xecutive Directors, the long-term orientation
of the program is significantly strengthened compared with

the conditions applying to the other participants. The members of the Board of ­E xecutive Directors are required to participate in the LTI program with at least 10% of their gross
bonus. In view of this binding personal investment (in the form
of BASF shares), an ­extended holding period of four years
applies. Members of the Board of Executive Directors may
only exercise their o
­ ptions at least four years after they have
been granted (vesting period).
The 2007 to 2013 programs were structured in a similar
way to the LTI program 2014.
The models used in the valuation of the option plans are
based on the arbitrage-free valuation model according to
Black-Scholes. The fair values of the options are determined
using the binomial model.

Fair value 

As of December 31, 2014, the fair values and the valuation
parameters relate to the LTI programs 2014 and 2013. The
fair value calculation was based on the assumption that
­options will be exercised in a manner dependent on their
potential gains. For the programs from preceding years,
corresponding fair values were computed and valuation
­parameters were used.
Volatility was determined on the basis of the monthly
­closing prices over a historical period corresponding to the
remaining term of the options.
The number of options granted amounted to 1,870,440 in
2014 (2013: 2,081,900).
As a result of a resolution by the Board of Executive
­Directors in 2002 to settle options in cash, options outstanding from the programs 2007 to 2014 were valued with the fair
value as of the balance sheet date December 31, 2014. A
proportionate provision is recorded for programs in the
­vesting ­period. The LTI provision decreased from €367 million as of December 31, 2013 to €207 million as of December 31, 2014, due to lower fair values of the options on average.
The utilization of provisions amounted to €106 million in 2014
(2013: €148 million). Income arising from the reversal of the
provision amounted to €54 million in 2014. The previous year
had i­ncluded an expense of €104 million.
The total intrinsic value of exercisable options amounted
to €41 million as of December 31, 2014, and €160 million as
of December 31, 2013.

BASF Report 2014

BASF incentive share program
All employees are entitled to participate in the “plus” incentive
share program, with the exception of those entitled to
participate in the LTI program. The “plus” incentive share
­
program was introduced in 1999 and is currently offered in
Germany, other European countries and Mexico. Each
participant must make an individual investment in BASF
­
shares from his or her variable compensation. For every ten
BASF shares purchased in the program, a participant receives
one BASF share at no cost after one, three, five, seven and
ten years of holding the BASF shares. As a rule, the first and
second block of ten shares entitles the participant to receive
one BASF share at no extra cost in each of the next ten years.
The right to receive free BASF shares lapses if a participant sells the individual investment in BASF shares, if the
participant stops working for the Company or one year after
retirement. The number of free shares to be granted has
­developed as follows:

The free shares to be provided by the Company are valued at
the fair value on the grant date. Fair value is determined on
the basis of the stock price of BASF shares, taking into
­account the present value of dividends, which are not paid
during the term of the program. The weighted-average fair
value on the grant date amounted to €64.73 for the 2014
program, and €54.39 for the 2013 program.
The fair value of the free shares to be granted is recognized as an expense with a corresponding increase in capital
surplus over the term of the program.
Personnel expenses of €26 million were recorded in 2014
for the BASF incentive share program “plus” (2013: €21 million).

­corresponds to earnings before taxes plus borrowing costs
as a percentage of average assets.
The members of the Board of Executive Directors were
granted 193,172 options under the long-term incentive (LTI)
program in 2014.

The market valuation of the options of active and former
members of the Board resulted in income of €3.7 million in
2014. In 2013, the market valuation of the options resulted in
expenses of €10.3 million.

Other receivables

Sales and trade accounts receivable from and trade accounts
payable to related parties mainly included business with own
products, merchandise, agency and licensing business and
other operating business.
Other receivables and liabilities primarily arose from
financing activities, outstanding dividend payments, profit­
and-loss transfer agreements as well as other finance-related
and operative activities and events.
The decrease in sales with associated companies in 2014
related primarily to the decrease in sales with companies of
the Styrolution Group in the amount of €798 million particularly due to the plant outage at Ellba C.V. at the site in ­Moerdijk,
Netherlands.
As in the previous year, there were no significant valuation
allowances in 2014 for trade accounts receivable from related
parties.
There were obligations from guarantees at BASF in favor
of nonconsoli­dated subsidiaries in the amount of €8 million
in 2014 (2013: €14 million) and obligations from guarantees
and warranties in favor of asso­
ciated companies in the
amount of €27 million in 2014 (2013: €28 million).

Other liabilities

Long-term purchase obligations with joint ventures arising
from natural gas purchase contracts amounted to
€32,561 million on December 31, 2014 (December 31, 2013:
€46,141 million). The decrease was primarily due to the
­decline in oil prices.
Effective December 31, 2014, the present value of the
­outstanding minimum rental payments for an office building
including parking area payable by BASF SE to BASF
­
Pensionskasse VVaG for the nonterminable basic rental
­
­period to 2029 amounted to €63 million.
There were no reportable related party transactions with
members of the Board of Executive Directors or the Super­
visory Board and their related parties in 2014.

Supplementary Information on the Oil & Gas Segment

Supplementary Information on the Oil & Gas Segment
(Unaudited)
The following tables provide supplemental information on the
Exploration & Production business sector of the Oil & Gas
segment. In the absence of detailed disclosure rules in this
area under IFRS, the Group has elected to voluntarily disclose
the following information in accordance with SFAS 69 (Disclosure of Oil and Gas Producing Activities) and the Securities
and Exchange Commission. In ­order to present economically
meaningful reporting of the cooperation with Gazprom in the
Yuzhno Russkoye and Achimgaz projects, several modifications have been made to SFAS 69. BASF has an interest of
35% in the economic rewards of the Yuzhno Russkoye field
through Severnefte­gazprom (SNG), the company which holds
the production ­license. SNG is accounted for using the equity
method. Marketing of the natural gas is carried out by a separate, fully consolidated company. For the Achimgaz project,
in which BASF has an interest of 50%, full field development
was started after the successful completion of the pilot phase
in 2011.
In the following overviews, BASF’s stake in both projects
is included under “Russia.” In addition, the values for SNG,
which is accounted for using the equity method, are presented separately.
All fully consolidated subsidiaries are included with 100%.
The German Wintershall subsidiary with production and
explora­tion rights to the Libyan onshore concessions 96 and
97, in which BASF has an interest of 51%, is accounted for as
associated company for using the equity method as per
IAS 28.
The following table provides an overview of the most important differences between the information given for the Exploration & Production business sector in the Consolidated Financial Statement of the BASF Group and the supplemental
­information for the Oil & Gas segment.

Oil and gas reserves
Proven oil and gas reserves are the estimated volumes of
crude oil, natural gas and condensate that are shown by
geological and engineering data with reasonable certainty to
be recoverable in future years from known reserves under
existing economic and operating conditions. Accordingly,
­reserve estimates could be materially different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. To
reduce uncertainties, Wintershall uses independent, internationally recognized reserve auditors to perform recurring
­reserves audits of its major oil and gas fields.
The tables on the following pages show the company’s
developed proven and probable proven reserves as of
Decem­ber 31, 2013, and December 31, 2014, as well as
changes attributable to production and other factors.

BASF Report 2014

Operating income from oil and gas-producing
activities
Operating income represents only those revenues and
­expenses directly associated with Wintershall’s oil and gas
production. These amounts do not include financing costs
(such as interest expenses) or corporate overhead costs and
therefore do not correspond with the contributions associated
with the Oil & Gas segment. The deviations in sales compared
with segment ­reporting are the result of merchandise and

service transactions not shown here, as well as the proportional inclusion in the IFRS-based Financial Statements of
companies accounted for using the equity method. Estimated
income taxes were computed using local applicable income
tax rates. At year-end 2012, the assets and liabilities of
Winters­hall Noordzee B.V. were reclassified into a disposal
group in the financial statements in anticipation of the asset
swap planned with Gazprom. The cancellation of the transaction made it necessary to reintegrate the suspended writedowns by restating the figures for 2013.

Capitalized exploration well-drilling costs:
Suspended well costs

Standardized measure of discounted future
net cash flows relating to proven oil and gas
reserves (SMOG)

Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized until the drilling of the
well is complete. If hydrocarbons are found, and, subject to
further appraisal activity which may include the drilling of
further wells, are likely to be capable of commercial development, the costs continue to be capitalized as construction in
progress. All such capitalized costs are subject to technical,
commercial and management review at least once a year to
confirm the continued intent to develop or otherwise extract
value from the discovery. If this is no longer the case, the
costs are written off. If proven reserves of oil or natural gas are
determined and development is sanctioned, the relevant
expen­ses are transferred to machinery and technical equipment. Impairments are recognized in exploration expenses for
unsuccessful exploration wells.
The following table indicates the changes to the capitalized exploration well-drilling costs.

The following information has been prepared in accordance
with SFAS 69 and the regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which require the standardized
­
calculation of discounted future cash flows based on the
respective revenues, costs and income taxes. The proven
reserves are valued at the average price calculated from the
prices on the first day of the month. The values thus determined are discounted at a 10% annual discount rate.
The projected values should not be understood as a
realistic estimate of future cash flows. Furthermore, the total
value of future net cash flows should not be interpreted as
representing the current enterprise value.
In the future, expected proven reserves may differ signi­
ficantly from current estimates. Development and production
of the ­reserves may not occur in the period assumed and
actual prices and costs may vary considerably.
The company’s investment and operating decisions are
not based on the information presented below, but on a wider
range of reserve estimates, as well as on different price and
cost assumptions.
Beyond the above considerations, the “standardized
measure of future net cash flows” is also not directly comparable with asset balances appearing elsewhere in the Consolidated Financial Statements because any such comparison
would require a reconciliation adjustment.

Glossary ﻿

BASF Report 2014

Glossary

A
Associated companies
These are companies over whose operating and financial policies
BASF can exercise significant influence, and which are not subsidi­
aries, joint ventures or joint operations. In general, this applies to
companies in which BASF has an interest of 20% to 50%.
Audits
Audits are a strategic tool for monitoring and directing standards.
During a site or plant audit, clearly defined criteria are used to create a profile on topics such as environment, safety or health.
B
Backup line
A backup line is a confirmed line of credit that can be drawn upon
in connection with the issue of commercial paper if market liquidity
is not sufficient, or for the purpose of general corporate financing. It
is one of the instruments BASF uses to ensure it is able to make
payments at all times.
Barrel of oil equivalent (BOE)
A barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) is an international unit of measurement for comparing the energy content of different fuels. It is equal
to one barrel of crude oil, or 6,000 cubic feet (169 cubic meters) of
natural gas.
Biocatalysis
Biocatalysis is the use of enzymes as biological catalysts for the
targeted application, acceleration or control of chemical reactions.
The high selectivity of enzyme catalysts allows for simplified processes and lower production costs.

Commercial paper program
The commercial paper program is a framework agreement between
BASF and banks regarding the issuing of debt obligations on the
financial market (commercial paper). The commercial paper is
­issued under a rolling program for which the terms can be determined individually. This requires a good rating.
Compliance
Compliance is an important element of corporate governance. It
refers to the company’s behavior in accordance with laws, guidelines and voluntary codices.
Conflict minerals/conflict mines
Conflict minerals describe minerals listed in the U.S. Conflict Minerals Trade Act. These include tantalite (coltan), cassiterite (tin ore),
wolframite, gold, and their derivatives. Some conflict mines are
suspected of being used to finance armed conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo or neighboring states.
Consumer goods sector
The consumer goods sector includes, for example, the textiles and
leather industry, the electrical industry and domestic appliance
manufacturing, as well as the paper industry and the personal care
and cleaners sector.
E
EBIT
Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT): At BASF, EBIT corresponds to income from operations.

Biotechnology
Biotechnology includes all processes and products that make use
of living organisms, such as bacteria and yeasts, or their cellular
constituents.

EBIT after cost of capital
EBIT after cost of capital is calculated by deducting the cost of
­capital from the EBIT of the operating divisions. The cost of capital
thereby reflects the shareholders’ expectations regarding return (in
the form of dividends or share price increases) and interest payable
to creditors. If the EBIT after cost of capital has a positive value, we
have earned a premium on our cost of capital.

1,4-Butanediol (BDO)
1,4-Butanediol (BDO) is a BASF intermediate. BDO and its derivatives are used for producing plastics, polyurethanes, solvents,
electronic chemicals and elastic fibers.

EBITDA
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
(EBITDA): At BASF, EBITDA corresponds to income from operations before depreciation and amortization.

C
CO2 equivalents
CO2 equivalents are units for measuring the impact of greenhouse
gas emissions on the greenhouse effect. A factor known as the
global warming potential (GWP) shows the impact of the individual
gases compared with CO2 as the reference value.
Coil coatings
Coil coatings are specialty coatings that can be applied to steel and
aluminum bands, creating a composite material that combines the
traits of the metal and the coating material. The composite material
is especially resistant to corrosion and can be easily formed. Coil
coating sheets are mainly used in the construction ­industry.

EBITDA margin
The EBITDA margin is the margin that we earn on sales from our
operating activities before depreciation and amortization. It is calculated as income from operations before depreciation and amortization as a percentage of sales.
Eco-Efficiency Analysis
The Eco-Efficiency Analysis is a method developed by BASF for
assessing the economic and environmental aspects of products
and processes. The aim is to compare products with regard to
profitability and environmental compatibility.
Ecosystem services
Companies simultaneously rely on, and have an impact on, ecosystem services, such as the conservation of air, water and soil quality.
Biodiversity – or the variety of life forms on our planet – serves as a
basis of and indicator for the integrity of ecological systems.

Enhanced oil recovery (EOR)
Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods, also called tertiary recovery
or tertiary production methods, are used to increase the recovery
factor from oil reservoirs. Different technologies are employed
depen­ding on reservoir conditions; a distinction is generally made
between thermal and chemical EOR and miscible gas flooding,
which makes use of gases such as carbon dioxide.
